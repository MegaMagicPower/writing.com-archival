She was a little sad and was going to miss them, but she was really excited for college. Madison had been successful and well liked in high school at Coral Gables and looking forward to new experiences in college. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter around an hour of setting up her room around her roommate's stuff, which had already been moved in, someone walked through the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hi, I'm Cassi'' said the girl in a friendly voice. ''I'm Madison, we must be roommates.'' It was obviously awkward at first, but after awhile of talking they realized that they really liked each other. Cassi was from a small town in Kansas where her family were wheat farmers, far different from her upbringing where her Dad was a successful businessman in the Miami area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs dinner time approached, they found some other girls from their floor went to the dinning hall on campus, which had just been recently redone. They were shocked at how good the food was, and how much of it there was, seeing as it was buffet style. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison usually ate pretty healthy when she was at home, but she decided that she should go for something tasty since it was the first night. She had a slice of pizza and huge burrito. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her and Cassi were eating they go to know some other girls on the floor, there was Kelly, a lanky blonde who used to play basketball in high school, a short skinny girl with brown hair named Ginger, and Megan, a medium hieght girl of african descent who looked to be in pretty good shape. They all got along great, mainly because everyone was trying to fit in during the first week of college. Madison also noticed that she ended up in a pack of pretty attractive looking friends. She was a really nice and outgoing person, but her one flaw was that she had an overdeveloped sense of vanity, and deeply cared about her appereance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass went well the first week, but as Friday approached, she decided to...</span></div></div>",

They texted some upperclassmen that they met during the week and found out about a function that started at around 10. Before that they decided to gameplan at dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison and Cassi told Kelly, Ginger, and Megan about the party and they all seemed excited to go as well. Then Megan brought up a point that Madison was also thinking about, ''So how are we going to get booze, should I call around and ask some people if they could buy us some?'' Madison thought this was a pretty good idea. She socially drank in high school, and figured the trend would continue in college. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Madison ate, she noticed that she wasn't the only one who had been eating larger portions than she normally would have. It looked like all 5 of them were putting down a lot of food. Not huge amounts, just more than she would have expected them to in high school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey secured the alcohol from Ginger's older sister, a 24 pack of cheap beer, and a 1.75 of vodka. Obviously they were not going to drink it all on the first night, but it was nice to have a reserve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they sat in the room and talked and drank for a bit, they put some vodka in a clear bottle and went out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party was at an upperclassmen's house near campus. Seeing as how they were a pack of attractive freshmen girls, they had no problem getting in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the party they met some girls from the sororities, at which point, they decided they should rush when the period started in a few weeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey also met guys, who seemed very interested in them. Madison wasn't trashy, so she didn't hook up with anyone on the first weekend, but a few of her friends got pretty intimate with some other freshman guys who made their way to the party. </span></div></div>",

His name was Tom, and they while they were walking, they realized that they had a ton in comon. Tom was from Chicago, but they both had the same tastes in music and loved the Mad Men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were walking, Madison noticed that she was pretty attracted to Tom, who was slim and 6'1. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes they came back to the dorm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey Tom, you want to go back to my room and watch Mad Men.'' Madison somewhat anxiously asked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom responded with a somewhat eager, ''Yeah, that would cool, let's do that.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey watched a few episodes, and talked about school, family and friends, all while demolishing a bag of chips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the night ended, they decided they needed to hang out the next day and watch some more Mad Men. </span></div></div>",

Madison wasn't looking for any relationship at all. She liked Tom, but the last thing that she wanted to do was be bolted down in the first semester of college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom on the other hand wasn't going to rush into things either, but eventually, he knew that he wanted to be with her.

Madison didn't want to neglect her social life, or her studies, so she figured she could cut down on the gym for the time being until Tom and her friends just all started hanging out together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they moved through September, Madison noticed what looked to be the smallest amount of padding on her stomach. It wasn't a belly yet, but it wasn't the near six pack that she used to have either. None of her clothes fit that much differently, and she was still one of the hottest girls at the school so she didn't think much of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison and the girls on her floor were still having a good time though. They all joined and got into the same sororities, and Tom got into a fraternity. This meant that they were going to be going to a lot more parties, but also, that she was going to be drinking a lot more calorie rich beer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison continued to keep up a good study schedule as well. She felt that she was doing well in all of her classes, and keeping her options open for whatever she wanted to do after college. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her calves looked a bit wider, and it looked liked she had a tiny love handle that was on the backside of a tiny belly. Plus her arms looked a bit meatier than before. Granted, before was rail thin for Ginger, so she wasn't fat by any means. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Man, I better work out soon, I don't want that happening to me anytime soon.''

They went to the warehouse district near downtown Powers, and went to a decently nice restaurant for college students. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidway through the dinner, Tom got somewhat awkward, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Madison, I really, really like you, and I was wondering if you wanted to go out, you know, like boyfriend and girlfriend.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom knew immediately from the moment he finished that he wasn't going to get a yes, but it went better than most rejections. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Tom, I really like you to, I constantly talk with Cassi about how great you are, and I hope you know that, but at the moment, I just don't want to be in a relationship. I don't want to be one of those couples that meets the first weekend, and stays together all of college and never experiences any of the fun single stuff that goes on.'' She paused, and then said, ''I don't know if this makes it any better, but I still like you and want to be friends, but not in the douchy your my token guy friend and you're on my hook kind of way.'' She meant it in the sincerist of ways. She liked Tom and didn't want to burn through him in a relationship that wouldn't last, but she also didn't want to tie herself down, even if it was someone great like Tom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom had a ton of things he could have said. He almost snickered, which would have caught Madison off guard. Floating in his head were thoughts like, ''Well you're out of my league, and I thought I would give it the ol' college try'' or ''soooo...can we still hook up'' to ''Hey is Cassi seeing anyone?'' He liked Madison a lot and was disappointed, but all that came out was, ''Yeah, I understand completely.'' Now his goal was to stay out of the dreaded friend zone. </span></div></div>",

The theme was white trash, and date parties were one of the few areas where Madison didn't mind looking slutty. She wore some really short jean shorts by tearing apart a pare of old jeans, and wore a loose cut off t-shirt only her boobs covered, with a trucker hat. Madison looked at herself in the mirror and noticed that there was a bit of pudge in her stomach that wasn't there before. It wasn't huge, or even all that present if you were not looking for it, but for her, it was new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''F it, I still look better than most of the girls at this school,'' thought Madison, and she was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison went to Ginger's room to pregame a bit, and noticed that Ginger's gain was not slowing down. Her belly looked a tad bit bigger, and she was starting to get a rather round behind. Ginger also wore short jorts, and showed off her newly formed cleavage with a tight flannel shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer and her pack of friends met their dates at the party and danced. Tom had a good time with Madison, despite their friend status, and both her and him got pretty drunk to the point where anything made them laugh, thus contributing to the great night.

Normally, Madison didn't eat very much fast food, since she considered it unhealthy and tad too greasy for her tastes, but being drunk, she couldn't think of anything better than that at the moment. Madison ordered a massive burrito and demolished it on the ride home. The combination of fast food and beer from the evening easily doubled her caloric intake that day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison and Cassi woke up in their room hungover the next day, and Madison noticed her bulge had gotten a bit bigger. She figured she should work out, but she was a tad hungover to be hitting the gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she put on her under ware she also noticed it seemed a bit tighter than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cassi woke up she noticed it was noon and she was rather hungry.

She knew that if her parents were paying for her undergraduate education, then they expected her to perform at a high level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was having an easy time with most of her classes, except for bio. So for most of the week before midterms, one could find her deep in the stacks of the library, head down in a book, trying to do well on her test. She didn't get out much during the week, and mainly existed on quickly eaten fast food, or snacks while studying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, with such attention paid to her studies, Madison pretty much quit going to the gym all together. She felt a bit sluggish, but it was necessary, she was an A student in high school and intended for that to continue into college. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she didn't notice was that she had gained just under 10 pounds as the semester reached the midway point. Madison's toned abs were becoming soft, and her legs had grown a plusher feature to them. Her butt was seeing the effects of many study sessions and drinking binges as well, and was just starting to go from the perfectally toned behind that it was, to a bit more average. A small love handle was also forming, but only when she wore her tight spandex, or when she wore really tight pants. She was still very hot, and with her clothes on, most guys were not going to notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison took her finals, and felt pretty confident on all of them, even if bio was a bit of a struggle. Her and Tom hung out again that night and went to a party with the girls on the floor. Speaking of which, the girls on the floor were taking note of Ginger's new figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Man, Ginger has been putting on weight,'' Kelly whispered to Megan. <br>\r\n''I'd hate to have to go home to my parents if I looked like that,'' Megan responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinger hadn't joined them yet, but she knew she was putting on the freshman 15. She had a booty coming in, and her hips were starting to spread. She was having trouble making her shorts fit as her thighs got wider, and she noticed that her arms were bigger. They couldn't be described as meaty yet, but they were getting there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the night of partying, Madison got ready for fall break. </span></div></div>",

Yelled her excitable Mom. Her Dad was quieter, but still happy to see her. They got to talking and each parent was happy that their daughter was adjusting to college life so well. They had heard stories of other kids who started traveling home every weekend, or couldn't cut it on a high academic level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison's sister, Alexa, was happy to see her as well. Alexa was two years older than Madison, and shared her great genes and good looks. As Alexa was talking to Madison she thought to herself that Madison looked just a tad softer, not fat or even chubby, but just a bit fuller than when she left for school. Alexa treated this as an opportunity to pat herself on the back. Madison and Alexa loved each other and got along great, but they were also in a sibling rivalry. They both were hot, did great in school, and were very sociable. Alexa had made it into her junior year with a perfect body. She was a workout fanatic, and loved the gym, where she could show off her toned body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Madison went upstairs to unpack her things, Madison's Mom, Jenny, was talking to her Dad, Chris. ''Hey Chris, does Madison look like she gained some weight while she was at school?''<br>\r\n''Don't even start that discussion,'' remarked her Dad. He loved his daughters and trusted their judgement. The last thing Chris wanted was his wife making them feel bad about their bodies, he continued, ''listen, Madison is old enough that she can make her own decisions, wouldn't you feel horrible if your Mom had started commenting on your weight?''<br>\r\n''Well first off she did, and second, that's why you have the hot wife that you do right now.''<br>\r\n''Don't say anything. Come on, she's just growing up, do you really think Madison would let herself go?''</span></div></div>",

Most people wouldn't really notice, but she shared the same heightened sense of vanity that her daughters did, and wanted her family to look great at all times. Heck, she was 50 and still had a great body. In her mind, fat was a side affect of laziness, not something that affects everyone differently. This contrasted with her husband Chris, who although he kept in good shape, was a genuine person, who felt that we all played the hand we were dealt and judging people was small and petty. </span></div></div>",

It's not like she was gaining enough for it to be alarming, at most it seemed like her body was ''filling out'' from her high school body, or at least this is what Madison told herself when she went to the gym and noticed that her belly and some small love handles poked over her shorts. When she was wearing a skirt and crossed her legs they also seemed to have a bit more flesh hanging off them and just looked a bit fuller. Madison figured that she would lose this weight once she became fully adjusted to college life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuys still found her attractive, and Tom was still getting some kudos from his friends for snagging such a fox, but he and his friends pretty much knew Madison wasn't interested in going exclusive, she had said as much when he asked her out.

Powers would be closing on Wednesday evening, meaning classes were cancelled on Thursday and Friday. Madison learned that Cassi was driving back to her family's farm, about two hours away. Kelly and Megan were going to stay on campus, and Ginger had family in town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison didn't really have any Thanksgiving plans. Before the semester started, her Dad and her had sat down and looked at the weekends where she would want to come back home. \"You'll just be coming home in 3 weeks anyway, do you want to stay up at Powers over Thanksgiving?\" he asked at the time. Madison had found that to be sensible, so here she was, without any plans and willing to just camp out in the dorm for a few days. If anything she was almost looking forward to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her and Cassi walked back to the dorm, she extended an invitation, \"You know, you're more than invited to come spend Thanksgiving with my family.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Madison weakly said, \"I may just veg out on campus and relax a bit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, just so you know, the option is available.\" Cassi responded, not taking Madison's decline very personally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison didn't tell Cassi this, but part of the reason that she was considering not going to anyone's Thanksgiving was the food. She knew she had put on a bit of weight, and although she was currently able to hide it under winter clothes, there was no denying that her size 6 pants were starting to feel a tad snug. This was particularity worrisome, given that in high school and at the beginning of the year, she was wearing a size 4. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith resolve not to gain weight, after class that day, Madison went to the gym, which she had neglected to do for the past week. As she ran on the treadmill, she realized she felt a bit out of shape, <i>I'll have to fix this over Thanksgiving break</i> she thought to herself through the fatigue. </span></div></div>",

She had pondered running, but it looked a bit cold outside, so she figured that she could wait until the mid-afternoon when it got a bit warmer. Around lunch time she put on her size four jeans and a shirt and walked to the dinning hall, where she was greeted with a somewhat predictable sign: \"Dining Hall closed until Sunday over Thanksgiving break.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rats, I probably should have guessed that one,\" Madison thought to herself. She now wished that she could have asked Cassi or one of the other members of the floor that had a car for a ride to the grocery store before they had departed for home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Madison got back to her room, she hopped on her computer and looked for places that would be open on Thanksgiving, and luckily, a fast-food burger place that was only a few blocks away from campus did the trick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen arriving, Madison was greeted with a smile and a similar, \"What can I get for you?\" Looking over the menu, Madison was at somewhat of a loss. She generally did not east fast food, which was mostly reserved for when she was drunk. Normally, she would have jumped for something that was somewhat healthy like a salad, or a small sandwich, however, she was hungry, and it's not like anyone on campus would see her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get the #1?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What size fries would you like with that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...heck...let's go large,\" Madison responded, thinking that any leftovers could consumed later as snack food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the dorm, Madison sprawled out on her floor, turned on the TV to football to provide for some background noise, and ate her meal. Initially feeling a bit hesitant to dig in, she ended up finishing all the calorie-rich, but not particularly filling food. After she finished she felt extremely full, but also good, craving more food, while knowing that she shouldn't. <i>I should probably try to order a sandwich from somewhere</i>, she thought, while feeling slightly bloated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her feelings changed by nightfall, and right as the person who was taking her order at noon was getting ready to get off for the evening at 7, the familiar girl from lunch who had come in early in the day was back, and ordering the same thing. </span></div></div>",

Madison's upper arms were starting to collect some fat as well. Her legs were slowly turning into thunder thighs, and she was beginning to get a hint of cellulite on the back of her thighs.

When she got dressed to go out, it was about minimizing her newly acquired fat. She wore shapewear under her shirt, which she thought helped, but if she ever did get a guy to come home with her, he would immediately see her lovehandles and her pooch. This wasn't out of the question, Madison wasn't fat yet, she had just never been used to having to deal with having anything less than a flawless body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't figure out why this was happening, she kept working out, she was trying to eat healthy, but no matter what she seemed to gain weight like clockwork, was it hopeless? Madison vowed that she would lose the weight, so she kept going to the gym, even thought that wasn't a fun place either, with ripped guys and lean women, Madison felt almost like an outsider as she struggled to keep up with the pace that she used to be able to nail when she was thin.</span></div></div>",

She felt even some of the newer clothes that she bought getting tight, and she knew this was a topic of discussion among people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one brightside of all this was that Madison was pretty confident going into her first set of finals. She had studied hard throughout the semester, and she thought she had a pretty good grip on all her classes. Madison enjoyed most of her classes, but going to them was a different story. Guys who were linning up to talk to her at the start of the semester now acted like she didn't exist, and for the first time in her life, Madison had to deal with being on the outside of clicks, as more attractive girls were getting invited to great parties and hooking up with a plethora of guys. Madison thought to herself as she was leaving her last class before finals, ''That could have been me, if I hadn't gotten gross and fat.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison didn't go to the gym during the week of finals, too much studying to do. While she was studying, Madison didn't realize the high level of snaking that she was doing. Every time she would study in her room, she would open a bag of chips, not realizing that she was piling a large amount of calories on her daily total while she passively burned through the bag without noticing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the days during the week Madison ran into Tom at lunch, who was happy to see her, it had been a few weeks, and he was going to text her later in the week about hanging out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey Tom! How's it going?''<br>\r\n''Oh you know finals...'' They proceeded to talk about their various finals for a while, and Tom checked out Madison's body while she was going on about her Intro to English Literature class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Man the powder certainly worked on Madison,'' he thought. He looked at her sweatshirt, which had obscured her tummy, but still looked pushed further out than if she had been thin. Madison's legs were also hidden in sweatpants, but he was looking forward to seeing how much her butt had grown from the powder. Her face looked a bit less defined and it looked like the potiental for a double chin had started. Tom realized that if they dated, he wouldn't be the reacher, because she had gained a ton of weight, and maybe it would shake up the dynamic that led a then skinny and hot Madison to reject him at the start of the semester. ''Crap, I better tell Cassi to stop using the powder,'' he mentally noted to himself. He could deal with her having a bit of flab, but he didn't want to take crap for dating a fat chick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cassi was still in good physical shape and had also noticed that her roommate was moving from being chubby to downright fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we need to talk about Madison, I think this is getting out of hand.\" Tom started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know, at first I thought it was kind of funny to see her freaking out about her weight...but now, I don't know, she almost seems like she has given up,\" Cassi responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't know what to do, maybe we could see if she wanted to exercise, or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea, and I'll try to hide some of the snacks that she keeps bringing here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Cassi and Tom asked Madison if she wanted to go to the rec center with them and play tennis. Madison had brought her tennis racket from home, but it had not really gotten that much use since she came to Powers. She went to her closet to put on her active clothes, and given the incident at the gym a few weeks ago, she feared that nothing would fit her now 166 pound body. First she put on a sports bra that had trouble containing her enlarged, but less perky breasts. She then found some athletic shorts that use to be extremely baggy. They now made a muffin top and love handles on her side, and they showed off how much her legs had expanded, looking softer with fat. She found a t-shirt that was a M, but she knew that as she worked out and started to sweat, it would stick to her belly and possibly ride up, which Madison was not looking forward to. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison broke down and decided to get new clothes. ''Ok, I'll just get these clothes, and that will hold me over until I lose this weight. Madison liked shopping, but it wasn't as fun when she knew that she was buying clothes because she had gained weight. Madison obviously had to be resized, she was just happy that her friends back home couldn't see her at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison continued to try to work out and lose weight, and couldn't figure out why she was retaining all these pounds. Cassi was pleased by all of this. She found it interesting watching the former hottie become the fat girl in the group, and as Madison's roommate she had a front row view to Madison's expanding body. Cassi continued to put the powder into Madison's vegetable juice, so most days Madison's metabolism was artifically slowed down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she killed herself at the gym for the week, Madison was hoping she would see some kind of result. The result that Madison got was not one that she wanted. When she jumped on the scale she saw 161.2 staring back at her. ''WHAT THE HELL?'' screamed Madison. It was a gain of nearly thirty pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi looked over at Madison, who was weighing herself in her underpants. From behind you could clearly see that her butt was getting bigger and starting to bubble out. Madison had bought new underpants, which was good, since her old ones were getting stretched pretty bad. She was also starting to develop some back fat, especially her lovehandles, which were growing as well as her stomach in front, which was pressing against her shirt and pushing out further. Madison's upper arms were starting to collect some fat as well. Her legs were beginning thunder thighs, and she was begining to get a hint of cellulite on the back of her thighs. Madison's face had mainly escaped up to this point, but her cheeks loooked more full, and her jaw was a little less defined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi sat there and she realized, Madison Kraft, probably the hottest girl on campus at the begining of the semester was now chubby. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison's sorority semi formal was yet another reminder that things are not as fun for college girls if you don't have a great body. Madison moved through her dresses and looked for some recent ones that she bought that may fit her, and the list was slim. Back when she had her ripped beach body, Madison would have loved to get ready for something like this and wore the slimmest dress that was tastefully possible, and at most of the events for college kids, there was a lot of skin that could be shown, but still considered tasteful. If Madison had been this weight later in life and at events that required formal dress attair, this would not have been an issue, but for college formal dances, it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked through her closet she saw her trendy dresses that she wasn't even going to dare try to fit into. Madison went went a blue dress that she had bought while she was out shoping a few weeks ago, the only problem was that she had gained another ten pounds since then, which didn't escape her while she was putting it on. Madison's dress was a blue sleeveless dress that at the time seemed loose, but now Madison had regretted buying. The dress had become rather tight, much to her embarressment. It went midway down her knees, so her larger thighs were covered. She could see her stomach could be see pushing outwards on the fabric, a clear pot belly, and her butt also stuck out, leaving nothing to the imagination. The sleveless top put her boobs on display, but also left a noticeable amount of back boob going over the top of the back, however, at least her arms, which had grown soft, didn't look any bigger without sleves on the dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, despite being friends and romantically involved with Tom [although she noticed that had slowed down as she grew] Madison would have possibly invited another guy that she was looking to hook up, since she enjoyed playing the field. But she knew that with her current body, that wasn't going to happen, so a few weeks ago she had asked Tom, who accepted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison loosened up and started to forget about the concerns she was having with her dress and her body as she drank, and just partied as the semi formal dance went on. Of course, the other girls in her sorority noticed their formerly hot pledge was putting on a ton of weight, and it was a point of gossip. Kelly and Cassi, who both were looking stunning in their dresses, overheard it and joined in, but Madison was too busy having a good time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom also enjoyed the evening, especially, dancing with Madison, which was like an up close view at how the powder was working. He could feel her softer behind pressing up against him, and giving way against his body as they grinded. Whenever he put his hands across her front he would occasionally press her stomach, which was getting deep with fat, and when possible, he moved his hands along her side and pressed her lovehandles which were also soft. Madison assumed these were signs of him being hot while dancing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Him having to put up with a girlfriend who was a bit chubby, but still cute was a draw for him. However, he never thought he would actually enjoy Madison having a softer figure, but now, here he was, having feelings that he never encountered before. Tom thought again to the night before, and how he could see how much weight she was putting on, how tight she looked in the dress, and her bit of insecurity. <i>I caused this</i> he thought to himself, feeling slightly sick, turned on, and ashamed all at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile trying to sort out these emotions, one thing was certain to Tom, he was at a crossroads. Madison was on the cusp of being considered chubby. He did not know the long term implications of continuing to give her the weight gain powder, and he knew that his decision on whether to continue the powder would drastically change his future with Madison, but more importantly, could significantly alter her identity and life, he pondered what to do. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'm still just trying to understand why you did that!\" Cassi muttered for about the tenth time since Madison had told her about the dinner with Tom. \"You guys are basically soul mates,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison rolled her eyes, \"We have been on two dates, Cass.\" She shrugged, \"I don't know it just seemed too fast. I...I was in a relationship in high school and it got kind of serious. I felt like I missed out on a lot because of it. I just don't want that to happen again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi gave her an understanding look. \"I get it I do. You just seem so disappointed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am...I just...there was that hot guy at the party the other day and all the sorority stuff coming up. and my grades I am not going to let my grades slip! Being in a steady relationship could ruin that and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright!\" Cassi interjected. \"Enough excuses, I get it I really do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison relaxed slightly. It felt oddly liberating to get someone else's understanding, especially from Cassi who was turning out to be a better and better friend each day. Mitchell, the guy she had dated all of senior year and the last part of junior year, had been her entire life for those times and she thought she had been in love but once they ended it she realized all the friends she had grown distant from and all the things she had bailed on in exchange for Mitchell. It had seemed romantic but now that she was single and independent she felt a little stir crazy, as if her life was on a swift countdown and she had to fill it with as much friends, fun, and experiences as possible. She had already given up half her high school life for a guy. She was not about to do that with Tom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she could not get the thought of Tom's dark blue eyes, darkening with disappointment at her rejection, the only betrayal to his otherwise masked and understanding expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi must have noticed the internal struggle consuming her because she suddenly jumped to her feet. \"C'mon, you need comfort food. Let's go get milkshakes, I'm buying!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison fake groaned, \"but I'm still full from dinner with Tom...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up girl. You need this. Let's go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi yanked her to her feet and the next thing she knew they had driven the few blocks to the Burger shake and were sitting at a booth with the largest cookies'n'cream milkshake she had ever seen, and a large thing of cheese curds sitting in front of her. Her blonde friend laughed at her expression. Wide eyes and a slight bit of dread and...her mouth started to water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassi...I really don't think I should eat this.\" her hand rubbed her already full stomach remembering how her washboard abs had been losing their definition recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blonde friend laughed in her girly bell-like way. \"I can think of three reason right now why you should. One,\" she ticked off on her fingers, \"you need to drown all of your confusing emotions in sugar and move on, 2, this place has the best food in town and I already bought it so don't you dare waste a single bite, and 3, what's college if we can enjoy a little late night indulgence and fun. You are so thin anyway I don't think you have anything to worry about.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison couldn't help grinning. \"You win. This looks delicious anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, the two slim girls, dorned in sweatpants dug in to their feast. Madison told Cassi about her relationship with Mitchell and how she was certain she no longer loved him but how she still felt like he was there and all the regrets she had. Cassi told her about her troubling high school life with her dad getting sick and never having a boy friend before. Madison found that hard to believe. Guys eyes followed Cassi when she entered a room. A little shorter than she was, Cassi had smooth sun with a few faint freckles on her cheeks, sunkissed from the summertime, and while not as toned as Madison, she was slim and had nice curves, a flat stomach, slightly rounded hips, a nice butt and big boobs. She was flirtatious and outgoing to. But apparently, in high school Cassi was too stressed and now she felt awkward committing to more than a one night stand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they finished off their shakes and cheese curds their talking turned to laughter and they even got more cheese curds and despite her protesting stomach got another shake to share. It was all almost enough to forget about Tom.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I think your mom is here.\" Cassi called from the front room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one second!\" Madison called. Then she turned her attention to the waist band of her jeans and tried tugging at them again. In the passed few weeks since her night out with Cassi, Madison had done her best to go to the gym and workout but with the constant parties late night drives to the Burger shack she just could not keep up. She was not fat at all but to her dismay she had noticed the tone she had once been so proud of disappearing. Her arms were ever so slightly softer as were her thighs and hips and her washboard abs had been replaced with a slight pudginess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter failing to button the jeans, she splayed her self, back down on her mattress, sucking in with all of her might and got the button to close.  The jeans were good quality and despite the fact that they were squeezing her like an extra skin she needed to shed they complimented her figure well. She added a slightly loose fitting navy shirt to cover any evidence of her soft stomach. She practiced sucking in, examining herself from every angle. Not bad. Not as satisfied as she wanted to be. But not bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison!\" Cassi called again. She heard the front door open her roommate greeted her mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison took one more look in the mirror, took a deep breath, ignoring the tightness digging into her hips and went to greet her mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdriana Kraft stood like a model in all of her Spanish glory, looking much too glamorous for their tiny apartment.Tall and slim her form fitting clothes and black stiletto boots emphasized her hours at the gym and self discipline. Like Madison, she had a sharp chin and defined cheekbones, full lips, and piercing eyes--a face framed by long dark hair. People frequently commented on their striking resemblance, usually right after a guy Madison's age had accidentally flirted with her mother. The only difference was that Madison had inherited her Caucasian father's blue-green eyes which made her own face even more striking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she was a nice woman, her mom was quite strict in her healthy lifestyle and never left the house (or even her room) without dressing to the nines and had a tendency to make everything around her look plain in comparison. Even Cassi, who Madison considered to be exceptionally pretty looked a little soft and out of place next to her mom. Or maybe Madison wasn't the only one who had put on a few pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sight of her daughter, her mom relaxed and swept her into a hug with an extravagant sweep of her arms. \"Ha pasado mucho tiempo hija. It's been too long my sweet girl.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom,\" Madison responded sheepishly. She pulled away and quickly introduced Cassi who she could sense was growing more and more uncomfortable by the second and ushered her mother out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went to a private restaurant at the edge of town, one that was usually way too expensive for Madison's college budget. Her mouth watered at the menu. Steak, buttery potatoes, ribs dripping in barbecue sauce, and the desserts! Oh the desserts looked heavenly. \"So how have you been mija? You seem like you've let yourself go a bit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison bit the inside of her cheek. Even though she had been expecting this, her mother's candid scrutiny still stung. Instinctively, she straightened and reminded herself to suck in her stomach even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a few pounds mom. I promise to work it off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much?\" Her mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, how much have you put on?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison flushed a bright red, her hand cradling her softer stomach. Was it that noticeable? \"Um...I'm not sure maybe ten pounds, I think. Does it even matter? I am still active, I will burn it off quickly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyone else who saw Madison and overheard such a conversation would probably be appalled. Madison was still quite slim and all the weight was distributed in an even, attractive way. But her mother, who truly had once been a model had always had an attentive eye to such matters and had always stress that her daughters remain toned and active. Beauty was success in her mother's eyes and ten pounds was basically a mortal sin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the waiter came, her mom ordered for both, of them a grilled chicken salad with light dressing. Madison liked salad usually but with the shame and silent rebellion coursing through her, her taste buds rebelled and she still really wanted the lava cake she had seen. Maybe it was all for the best anyway. Her mom was right to be appalled and she knew she had to change her eating habits eventually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we could go work out tomorrow morning before I leave. Are you still going to those cardio kickboxing classes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison hoped her blush didn't give her away. She had not been since the second week of school. \"Um...it's really early but we can definitely go,\" She and her mom used to share a personal trainer so she tried to tell herself it would be fun to exercise with her tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't want you to get any fatter, mija,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their boring lunch they went shopping. Her mom laid off on the fat comments after the restaurant, much to Madison's relief but it was impossible to ignore her stern glances each time an outfit did not fit or she did not look flawless. To save herself some misery, Madison began sneaking a size larger in the dressing room with her and by the end, all was forgotten. On the way out they stopped by the book store for a few extra school supplies and to get some fun reading books when Madison saw him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was handsome as ever in his modest unaware sort of way. He was crouched in the aisle, one hand tucked into his sweatshirt while the other held a book his nose buried in. His black hair fell in his face, messy but she could imagine the clean smell of his soap and shampoo radiating off of him even though it looked unkempt. As if sensing her gaze, Tom stood up and smiled. Even from across the room she could see his deep blue eyes fringed by dark lashes that were completely unfair for a guy to have. His twinkling gaze made her heart skip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she realized he was approaching her, she fixed her face into a casual smile and greeted him. \"Hey Tom! What's up?\" This was not the first time they had seen each other since she rejected him but usually they were both surrounded by friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maddie! I mean Madison... hey,\" his cheeks flushed a slight red at  the use of her nickname. It made her laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maddie is just fine,\" she said, then remembering her mom was there watching them with her analytical gaze, she quickly introduced her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very nice to meet you Mrs. Kraft. You've raised a wonderful person. Madison is pretty great,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison rolled her eyes playfully, \"Tom you don't have to lie to her!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, \"You're right. Forget what I said before, Madison is kind of the worst.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them talked for a moment, joking and getting to know each other, and Madison felt the tension melt away. Maybe everything could go back to the way it was before? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I should probably go find my girlfriend. I told her to meet me here.\" Tom said. As if on cue a plump, pretty red head with big brown eyes rounded the corner, sauntering up to Tom and grasping his hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison felt the light feeling in her chest instantly harden but she ignored it. This is what she wanted, wasn't it? If they weren't going to date than why should he be kept from dating anybody else? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Kraft, Madison, this is Renee, my new girlfriend. Renee this is Madison and her mother.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee had a bright smile but it turned frosty when she looked at Madison. \"Oh, this is Madison. Tom told me about you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison felt her heart skip a beat, finding it even more difficult to ignore the lump in her chest. What did that mean? Her mother too had grown stiff. Usually, she was a smooth talker and rarely was at a loss for words but all she could manage was an awkward, \"Hey,\" and then when there was an unnatural pause in the conversation her mom added, \"How did you two meet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison zoned out. She caught something about a mutual friend and hitting it off and how romantic Tom is. But it was the last thing she wanted to hear and when Renee placed a possessive kiss on Tom's cheek she wanted to gag. It could be anyone else but she suddenly hated Renee and wished Tom had chosen anybody but that sickening, boastful redhead. She was not good enough for him and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it, he mother was pulling her away, having made an excuse for them to leave and as they left she was grateful that her mom disliked the girl as much as she did. \"What a simpering little butter ball!\" She muttered something angrily in Spanish, making Madison laugh. \"I have to say I had a good opinion of him until I saw her. I have never seen such a poor choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's pretty though,\" Madison said. She felt obligated to say something in the defense of Tom's happiness but she was quite happy at her mothers criticism. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom snorted, \"If you are in to excessive make up and the shape of round on a woman.\" Madison felt this was a little excessive but then again her mother always exaggerated even the tiniest bit of fat. After a few more comments about the girl talking too much and seeming too clingy and how she did not look right for Tom. she concluded, \"Well maybe they are right for each other anyway. Tom isn't the most fit either.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he seems lean because of his height but a young man his age should not have any hint of a gut.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had never occurred to her that Tom wasn't as fit as the usual guys she was into. She just liked him because he was modest and handsome and funny. He did have a little bit of a belly on him though. Madison thought about this, trying to be disgusted but she found it endeared her to him even more and she found herself grateful for Renee. Because then she couldn't be tempted and at least Tom was happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With a grumble she rolled onto her back and patted her little rounded belly, she frowned as it jiggled slightly but went limp again in sheer exhaustion. After struggling with the kickboxing class with her mom the week before, Madison had vowed to get back in shape and lose the extra ten pounds she had gained but it was proving to be a lot harder than she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should really go with you next time. I could use the exercise. This is not alright,\" Cassi gripped her soft gut in two hands. She had taken to lounging around in sweat pants and a sports bra and there was no denying the affect their lifestyle had had on her. While Madison still managed to eat decently during the day, Cassi indulged in her favorite things with reckless abandon. She slid off of her bed and Madison watched her rub her belly which stuck out a few inches of pure flab. Her boobs had grown and her butt was a big round bubble. From behind, Madison noticed some love handles had formed and resisted the urge to pinch them. She didn't want to be like her mom and she could care less if Cassi was gaining weight as long as her friend was happy. \"Like, I cannot even fit in any of my real clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo demonstrate she pulled on a pair of jeans she had apparently failed to fit in earlier. She stopped at her thighs where she had to jump, wiggle, and sashay to get them up. Her butt and arms and belly wobbled as she heft them over her her bottom end. Madison was slightly fascinated at the feat of Cassi trying to pull the wide jean flaps together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need help?\" Madison hopped from the bed and gripped the two flaps. \"Okay, suck in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Cassi obeyed while she yanked with all of her might. Once, twice, on the third try she finally felt the latch of the button closing. \"Yes I did it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Cassi exhaled jubilantly but with a small pop it burst apart and her belly rolled forward slightly resembling jello. She deflated slightly. \"Alright. That's it. From this point forward, we diet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison laughed. \"Agreed,\" If Cassi hopped on the health bandwagon then she might actually stand a chance of losing her extra flab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, if you get those abs back then there is no way Tom can stay with that skanky Renee girl the next time he sees you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison laughed. \"You know I'm over it right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, and you also don't want a boyfriend, I know. But I don't think it's going to be as bad as you think. Just look at me and Adam?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys are pretty cute,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of the reason Madison seemed so relaxed is that for the first time in her life she had gotten an official boyfriend. Adam had seemed to come inout of no where and swept the buxom blonde off her feet. Literally, they were at a party and after one too many drinks Cassi had been dancing on the ping pong table about to strip from her thin sundress when she tripped and Larson had swooped in to catch her. Madison had expected it to end at a one night stand, especially when he was gone the next morning. But in a show of true chivalry he had shown up an hour later with cookies and grilled cheese sandwiches to cure her hangover. Then the following day had taken her on a real date. Then flowers and so on and so forth. Now they were one of the happiest couples on campus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which, he should be here any minute, we were going to a buffet for brunch with his roommates. Want to join?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if summoned, someone knocked at the door. Cassi's eyes widened. \"He's early!\" She burst into action scrambling around the room for a bra and a t-shirt that would fit her. Adam had let himself in as usual and Cassi burst from the room in a flurry of blonde hair and a beaming, sheepish smile. She had found a lavender shirt that made her eyes pop and had once been loose on her but now struggled to contain her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello gorgeous!\" Adam greeted her with a kiss \"Sorry I'm early. Hey Madison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should always give a girl extra time,\" she scolded. \"I was making myself beautiful for you!\" He eyed her up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always look beautiful. Um...even if you're uh, pants aren't buttoned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi blushed a brilliant shade of red. \"They don't, uh...fit. They don't fit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam laughed warmly, patting his own gut which strained the buttons of his shirt. \"I think I need to go a size up as well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison laughed. She had never met such good-natured people. Ones who were so open about their weight. It was so different from her own family.  \"Did you want to come with us Madison?\" Adam asked. \"we have a bit of time if you both want to finish getting ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't say no so she hopped in the shower while Cassi searched for a dress that would contain her extra curves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the buffet between Cassi, Adam, and three of Adam's roommates. She was by far the smallest one and found it easy to justify a second helping and then a third and then more until there was a huge stack to her name. There were five different types of chocolate cake and she had to sample all of them, since she still had not gotten the lava cake she'd been craving when her mom was visiting. Plus, she had been so good at eating healthy she could indulge a little. By the last piece she could barely breathe her stomach hurt so bad, when she thought nobody was looking she undid the button allowing her bloated stomach some relief and covered it with her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the laughing and talking somehow the topic of Renee came up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Renee?\" Adam frowned. \"As in Renee Lumberg?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the one,\" Madison replied, she had looked up her Facebook page enough times to know her last name. \"Do you know her,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam and his roommates exchanged glances. \"I hung out with her for a while but then I caught her making out with her roommate.\" Said Tyson, one of Adam's roommates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's lesbian???\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not sure, she could be bi, but I remember I took her out to all these fancy dinners and dates and then she didn't say even a thing about it. I was kind of under the impression we were together when I found out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry Tyson,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is seriously a jerk move.\" Cassi added. \"Was she just using you for...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The money?\" Adam finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyson shrugged. \"I just feel sorry for whoever this guy is,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, if she is a gold digger. Tom would be just her type.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Madison asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you know? Tom Russel is loaded. His parents donated a huge charity to this school and practically saved the sports department a few years ago. Madison went silent. She did not know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi put her hand on Madison's shoulder. \"Girl, we have got to check out this Renee girl. Whether you want to date Tom or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right! She can't hurt Tom!\" To emphasize her point, she leaped to her feet with surprising agility for how full she was. In the process her bloated stomach lurched forward, exposing her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um you might want to button your shorts first,\" Cassi giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam added. \"Looks like we all might be needing some new clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, after Madison had changed into a much roomier dress. She sat in the car with Adam and Cassi outside Renee's apartment. She felt kind of creepy but had a determined fire to keep Tom from hurting any more than the hurt she had caused. Although, he had moved on quite quickly so maybe he was not as disappointed as she had thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't quite sure what they were looking for. and was getting a bit bored. Despite all the food she had eaten earlier and a salad at dinner time she was craving cake like crazy. It suddenly seemed a lot more appealing than sneaking into a strangers house. Was it really her business to get into Tom's life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There she is,\" Cassi said. Attention caught, Madison moved to watch the curvy girl leave her house to meet none other than Tom. He got out of his car to greet her and the three of them were exposed to a passionate make out before she got in and they drove away. Madison's stomach did somersaults and she regretted all the food she had eaten earlier. She did not want to see this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are no lights on, I don't think anyone else is home.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough this had become the last thing she wanted to do, Madison found herself following Cassi and Adam into the apartment. Because it was not Miami where she was from and the town was considered safe, no one really locked their doors so it was easy to get in and find Renee's room. It was obnoxiously pink. Hot pink. With clothes strewn all over the floor and make up cluttering her vanity. Maybe her mom was right it did look like this girl wore a lot of make up. There were dirty dishes with hardened food on her desk and the trash was overflowing. It gave the whole room a rotting smell that was covered in an exorbitant amount of cheap perfume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi coughed. \"I think I am going to be sick,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we even looking for?\" Madison asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does she have a diary somewhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are not stealing her diary!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We really should have thought this through.\" Adam said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should have,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all froze and looked up to find Renee in her door way. Arms crossed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison's head swarmed with a solution to their situation. She thought of the window but it seemed a little pointless now that Renee had seen them. Plus, Adam and Cassi had had another large meal for dinner and she would fit and maybe Cassi but she was a little more dubious about Adam getting through. It seemed the only option was to talk through the situation. Which she was ready to do until Tom walked up behind Renee. All her words turned to mush in her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on here?\" Tom asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a good question!\" Renee snapped. \"What are you guys doing in my room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were supposed to be gone,\" Cassi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does that make it better exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShame burned beneath Madison's skin. Her eyes were cast down and she could not meet Tom's eyes but she could feel his scorching holes into skin. For a moment all five of them just stood there, Adam, Cassi, and Renee glaring Tom and baffled and Madison completely mortified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, this is all just a misunderstanding. We thought this was someone else's apartment and it was going to be a good prank but obviously you are the wrong person. So we will just be going now, we're really sorry about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adam?\" Tom asked suddenly just as Renee was about to snap something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey buddy. I did not think you would recognize me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha so this is not an accident. I know exactly what is going on!\" Renee interjected but no one was listening to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead the attention had turned to Tom and Adam. \"Why would I not recognize you? We used to live together,\" Tom's tone was more poisonous than Madison had ever heard before. How could anyone speak in such a way to Adam? He was one of the nicest guys she had ever met. apparently, Cassi was thinking the same thing because she was looking murderous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about you cottoned brained sissy with bad taste in girlfriends?\" In any other situation, Madison would have laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom's poison turned to a boyish shame but Madison could still see the tension in his broad shoulders. Had he lost weight? She felt a tinge of disappointment but then reminded herself how stupid that was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adam was my...\" Tom began to answer but Adam cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We used to be buddies way back. That is how I know he's rich.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you would remember that.\" Tom muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam threw his large hands up in the air. \"Whatever man, it doesn't matter. Look, we're here because your girlfriend is like me and Madison cares about you so we wanted to do something about it before you got used. C'mon guys lets go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, they followed Adam out. He was a large guy so there wasn't much choice for Tom and Renee except to move out of the way. His face had darkened and he was hunched over slightly with some emotion Madison couldn't name. She looked to Cassi for an explanation but she looked just as confused as she did. What was going on between Tom and Adam?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted an explanation but she could not look at Tom and Adam did not look like he wanted to talk. As she passed Renee hissed in her ear, \"It doesn't matter what you do. You can't have him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison fought the urge to roll her eyes. While she was beginning to feel hopeless about the Tom situation, threats seemed a little high school. She met Renee's eyes and said. \"Get over yourself, I can have any guy I want. I just want Tom to be happy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe retort filled her with adrenaline and she met Adam and Cassi in their car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you guys want cake?\" She offered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam snorted a laugh then shifted his car in gear. \"Yeah that sounds good.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At the burger shack, Adam pounded back more cake than Madison ever thought someone could eat in one sitting, polishing it off with a vanilla milkshake. She had finished her piece and would have liked more except she was too focused by her friend who was obviously distraught. Even Cassi had stopped eating and was watching half awed half concerned at her boyfriends gluttony. Each time the worker delivered another slice his eyes grew wider. After consuming what must have been an entire cake, (and those things were huge) Cassi snatched the plate from him and scowled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay that's enough! You are avoiding giving us an explanation. Out with it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam looked sick though whether it was from the cake or the thought of talking about his past, Madison could not tell. He stifled a burp and leaned back, taking a sip of the milkshake while he eyed us warily. His stomach was so full it pressed into the table the buttons straining to stay together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" he hiccuped, setting the milkshake down. \"Before I tell you, you just need to know...I am not a good person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is not true!\" Cassi protested immediately. Though there wasn't much room left in the booth where Adam sat she scooted in and began to rub his distended belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely not,\" Madison agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I try but my childhood was complicated...So was Tom's but I didn't make it easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs always at the mention of Tom, Madison's chest tightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I was young, I got taken from my home and put in the foster care system. I essentially was raised by dozens of strangers that were always changing. I had a few chances at adoption but I ruined it each time because I would always act out. Usually, I would steal or run away but sometimes I would get violent. When I was fifteen no one wanted me because of my record and that I would most likely end up at a juvenile detention ward. I was angry, hopeless, scared. But my caseworker came to me and told me there was one more family in the state that would take me in, that they would pay off my jail time and that I better not mess it up. I had accepted that no one wanted me. I mean, no one wants to adopt a teenager. They just take us foster kids in because of extra money or they feel bad for us. But not this family. This family was wealthy and all they wanted was to help someone. They had heard about my behavior and were willing to take a gamble. That was the Russel family. Tom's family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were all really kind. Lois and Jared, Tom and I became close friends and I adored their daughter, Missy she was disabled and would have outbursts and they made me feel better like I was not this problem child and that I could be accepted for who I was. They really helped me. Except, I didn't know how to accept their love. It scared me a lot and so I made a plan to run away for good this time and because the Russels were rich I would be able to pull it off. So I sucked up to them, pretended I loved them back and prayed that they would adopt me. I think they were going to, looking back I realize that now. Then I would have gotten an inheritance anyway. But Lois had just had a baby, another girl. Lissa. And after a few months I began to get scared. I panicked. They don't love me I thought. Which I know is a stupid thing for a teenage boy to think but really the system messes you up. I wasn't thinking right. I got access to their private information and tried to get money from the bank. When it didn't work I took Missy. I tried to ransom the child. But of course that didn't work. They knew it was me and Lois and Jared tried to come for me instead of calling the police. But I was manic and not thinking straight and I hotwired a car. I didn't buckle Missy and-and I don't even know what happened. There was a crash and then I woke up in the hospital, completely fine but Missy...Missy wasn't. Missy was gone and it was all my fault.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam was fighting back tears. The way men do when their soul is completely ravaged but they want to appear strong. Cassi had stopped rubbing his belly and was hugging him instead. Her tears falling for him. \"The Russels didn't want to adopt me after that and I don't blame them. I wasn't ready for a family anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not your fault Adam!\" Cassi said with conviction. \"You were young and you've changed so much since then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam smiled tenderly at her, stroking her blonde hair. \"But it is though, Cass. No matter what I do or how bad I feel it doesn't change the fact that I killed Tom's little sister and he has every right to hate me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if he knew how sorry you are...\" Cassi trailed off weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam continued on as if in a trance. \"The worst part is, they still gave me the money. And it was a lot. I didn't get to access it until I was eighteen so I didn't know, but Cass, it's a ton of money. I know I should give it back. I want to but...I can't. I need it and besides I cannot see them again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why did you come to the same University as Tom?\" Madison asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess-I guess the kid in me still wants a family and they are the closest thing I've ever had to one. Tom was my best friend, basically like a brother. We would have been brothers if I...if I hadn't...anyway. Knowing that I have some connection to the Russels helps me remember what it was like to be...loved.\" he tried to make the last word, loved, sarcastic as if it was silly and not a big deal but his pain was palpable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison felt sick, invasive. Though she was glad Adam had opened up to them, she felt that she had read a chapter from Tom's life, a horrible, intensely private chapter and she didn't even know him that well. That guilt, coupled with the conflict of understanding both Adam's pain at making such a mistake and Tom's for losing his sister so suddenly were knotting together furiously in her stomach, churning the chocolate cake. She and Tom weren't even dating--didn't even know if he even liked her... How could she assume she knew his thoughts and feelings? She felt she had to say something. Her hand stretched across the table, touching Adam's limp one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know there is nothing we can say that will help but we really care about you Adam. What would we do without you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi nodded and mopped the tears from her face. \"Yeah, I can't imagine how hard that must have been for you and for Tom's family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...but if you hadn't gone through that...who would you be?\" Adam didn't answer but looked thoughtful. \"You probably wouldn't be the nice, charming, friend we know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to mention handsomest.\" Cassi added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis lips twitched in the hint of a smile. \"Cass, how is that relevant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because all of that lead you to me and you are sexy as hell, mister. I love you Adam. I need you,\" He maneuvered his weight in the booth to face Cassi, a feat that obviously pained him due to how full he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know we haven't known each other long Cassi, but I love you too. I really do,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling that this was a private moment for the couple, Madison excused herself and went outside through the back door. It was chilly out. Though she had put on a sweater it was thin and she was still in a dress so the wind was free to nip at her skin and into her bones. She didn't care. It cleared her head. There was a pain in her chest that she couldn't identify, a pressure behind her eyes that made her squirm with discomfort but slowly with each breath, coupled with the cool temperature she calmed herself down. Madison wasn't sure how long she stood there but her attention had fixated on the bugs gathered around the light, fluttering around it like it was their life source. She wondered if they knew it would kill them but still went for it anyway. There was a small zap and a large white moth went spiraling to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison jumped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.\" It was only one of the workers. The handsome, young black man who had taken their order. He looked familiar for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed her sore eyes. \"No, no that's okay. I'm just thinking.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came to stand next to her. \"I get that. You know your friend in there can really eat. I'm impressed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he's talented like that,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Eli,\" He offered a hand. She took it and couldn't help but smile, grateful for the distraction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison.\" She said. \"Do we have a class together or something? You look familiar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humanities, 10am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the one,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'm not as easy to notice as it is to notice you. You are breathtaking,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she wasn't so emotionally drained, she would have blushed. He was handsome, tall, fit. With milk chocolate skin and the kind of dark eyes you could get lost in, and lips meant for kissing. He probably would be good at it. All those thoughts rushed through her head but they were just basic facts. She felt no interest in him at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should get back to my friends,\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEli opened the door for her. Inside, she could see Cassi sitting on Adam's lap as best as she could, they were smiling now, taking turns feeding each other giant bites from an entire chocolate cake they had ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the end of the night,\" Eli explained. \"I'm the manager so I was able to give it to them for free since we have to get rid of it anyway,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison smiled, \"That was really nice of you,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Adam had had such a difficult night and being with Adam made Cassi happier than anything else in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They seem really happy,\" Eli commented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout meaning to, she sighed. Part happiness for her friends, part exhaustion, part a feeling of not quite having a place she fit in. Which was her own fault of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, if you don't want to bother them I will give you a ride home. Do you live near the school?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I do, but it is not far. I can walk, really.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised his eyebrows. \"You will freeze,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey argued for a few minutes before Madison relented, let her friends know, and left with Eli. It occurred to her that she was getting in a car with a virtual stranger and that she was potentially putting herself in a risky position. But she was too tired to be anxious about her safety. Besides, he was nice and made pleasant conversation. She wasn't planning on it but she even invited him in for some food. Though she wanted to go to bed she wanted company even more. To be alone with her thoughts right now sounded like torture. Plus, she was starving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you are way too tired. Let me cook,\" Eli said as she started exploring her cupboards for stuff to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no it's fine,\" She protested even as she sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEli ended up being an exceptional cook with just a few spices he concocted a cheesy chicken Alfredo, with some of her frozen vegetables cooked and smothered in butter and borrowed some of Cassi's bacon for added flavor. As a side (because you can't have Italian food without all out as he said) he turned half a loaf of bread into delectable cheesy garlic bread. Too tired to care about eating healthy, Madison dug in. Each bite was a a warm, creamy explosion of flavor--a party in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you learn to cook like this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEli shrugged, \"I just like to watch people enjoy food.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe was more than halfway through the meal when she realized he had not had even one bite. \"Eli, you made all of this. Please have some!\" He shook his head, <br>\r\n\"Its fine, I ate at work and it just makes me happy to see that you like it,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is over generous of you. But you're totally right I'm in love with your cooking. You must become my full time chef!\" She joked. Secretly, she was quite greedy about the meal and her inner glutton had taken over. With Eli's encouragement she finished every last bite. It was a good thing he wasn't her full time chef or she would be a mammoth. Groaning, she rubbed her bloated stomach. She could not believe she had eaten so much. But Eli seemed impressed which made her feel a little proud. If a fit guy like her enjoyed her stuffing her face than who was she to hold back? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow. She really must be tired if she was being this loose about pigging out. Or maybe she had just been spending too much time with Adam and Cassi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're not done yet. It is not a feast without dessert,\" He pulled the new half gallon of triple chocolate brownie ice cream from the fridge, the one she had been avoiding all week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't know if I can. You can have some though. Actually, you can have all of it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself,\" he grabbed two spoons anyway and sat down beside her they had moved to the couch for more comfort. He took a big bite, savoring it slowly. To her shock, Madison felt her mouth start to water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw it. Give me that spoon,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEli distracted her with questions about herself. Her major, her family, her future, her favorite food, her favorite drink, favorite restaurant, favorite dessert, they talked a lot about food, which Madison was not to keen on because she only cared about eating food not talking about it. But they also watched youtube videos until the entire half gallon was finished. Afterward, she was so full that moving was impossible. She tried to stand up a few times but was too weak and heavy feeling to do so. She leaned back with a labored sigh, panting slightly from the effort. \"Wow, am I okay? I can't move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its totally normal. I can help,\" Eli offered to massage her aching belly and before she could protest he stretched his muscular arms around her. It felt strange at first but then she realized why Adam loved it so much when Cassi did the same thing. It really did ease the pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she could move without intense pain again, Eli helped her upstairs to her room. It was only once he had left and she was about to fall asleep that Madison realized he had only taken three bites of the ice cream in total. Half a loaf of bread four peoples worth of pasta an entire bag of cheese, a stick of butter and bacon. What had gotten into her?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tom wasn't sure what he was doing outside Madison's apartment. All he knew is that he wanted to see her, wanted to apologize for last night. Although, he still wasn't entirely sure what she was doing in Renee's room and with Adam nonetheless, he wanted to see her. That wasn't new. He always wanted to see her--her stunning eyes and graceful beauty, to hear her smooth, velvety voice joking with him in a way that felt so natural and easy to respond to. He missed hanging out with her and regretted that he had ever ruined it by asking her out too soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want Tom to be happy,\" Though he had not heard the majority of the exchange between Madison and Renee, he had caught the end of what Madison had said. He wasn't sure what that meant but at the very least he figured that they could keep being friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deep breath, Tom marched up to the door almost knocked, then, thinking better of it, he sent her a text: \"Hey, you up?\" he waited an excruciatingly long minute. Then: Yeah. What's up? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe texted: I'm at your house. <br>\r\nThat sounded kind of creepy, haha but can I come in?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure thing, be down in a sec. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, he shifted nervously. He tried to sit down at the kitchen table then stood up again, paced around then half sat at the island, fidgeting with his phone but not actually looking at anything. The sound of footsteps alerted him to her presence and he couldn't help but stand as Madison entered the kitchen. Although tired and a bit surprised, she looked ever bit as beautiful as ever. She was in a tiny pair of light gray pajama shorts lined with pink and a matching tank top that hugged her figure alluringly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I dreaming?\" was the first thing she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head. \"No I just wanted to see you. and talk to you...about last night.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened, suddenly remembering the events of the night before. Her full lips formed a silent oh and a pretty blush colored her cheeks. Tom could barely breath she was so gorgeous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um it's kind of early, would you like something to eat? or drink? I have eggs and orange juice I think.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just orange juice is fine,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison leaned into the fridge. From behind he felt more free to admire her. She had put on weight and with the mini shorts he could see how her thighs were full and soft--her toned thigh gap on the verge of disappearing. The added padding on her butt shortened her pajamas so that when she bent down start of the cheeks were visible. He tried not to focus on that, not wanting to think in-virtuous thoughts about her. Leaning forward into the fridge the tank top rode up over a slight roll of flab that she had not had before, her hips had the slightest curve of love handles that only enhanced her feminine hourglass figure. She turned, a pitcher of orange juice in hand an amused look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I have been craving cake since I woke up and look what I just found.\" She pulled a huge chocolate cake from the fridge, one of the moist delicious ones from The Burger Place. There was a note on it that read, \"Adam and I couldn't finish it. The rest is yours, love Cass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if you want cake for breakfast, no judgment. That's the best.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled mischievously and fetched some forks.\"Only if you share with me,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe matched her smile, the awkwardness suddenly gone and she plopped down. He tried not to notice how her tummy pooched out even more when she sat slouched at the counter and how she hadn't noticed to pull it down. The tank top was too small and her slightly larger breasts were quite visible. Tom felt his hand itch to touch her but he picked up a fork instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About last night...he began. I'm really sorry. About Renee and my outburst and everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blue-green eyes softened. \"You don't need to apologize Tom. I was the one sneaking into your girlfriends room.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I was going to ask about that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a bite of cake, a pondering look on her face. When she swallowed she said, \"Adam's friend Tyson sort of dated Renee once and he told us some things that happened that were concerning. I was worried so we decided to, um...actually I'm not really sure what we were doing. It was really impulsive and dumb and I'm sorry. But I promise we were not going to exploit any of her personal belongings and I was really just curious and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom chuckled. Madison always rambled when she got nervous, it had a calming affect on him. But then he grew sober. \"You know you could have just come to me directly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked away. \"Tom...no I couldn't have. Things have felt so tense since...well you know and I sort of thought you hated me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hated you? How could I hate you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged taking another bite of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom sighed. \"Look, I'm sorry if I have been...distant. It's just when you rejected me I was more hurt than I realized. I'm over it now,\" He rushed to finish. Something flickered across her face, was it disappointment? Then it vanished. \"I guess I didn't want to make you uncomfortable either.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" Madison said. \"I really do care about you, you know. And your girlfriend...I know I'm not in charge of your life, especially in this area but are you sure she...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is egotistical and messy and kind of talks a lot. I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she has good qualities too, and right now I think I need that. Something I know won't be long lasting.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes seemed to penetrate his soul. \"Is there anything I can do Tom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged, \"Can we just be friends?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression was unreadable was she relieved, disappointed, confused? It all seemed to flash through her expression at once. Before settling on a soft, understanding look. \"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"and about Adam...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He told us last night. Everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything?\" He couldn't hide the hint of panic in his voice. because it jolted through him so intensely it almost hurt physically. He set he fork down. a detail that did not go unnoticed by Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I mean...he told us how you were his foster family and that he tried to get money from you guys and then your sister. Oh your sister...\" He eyes filled with tears but she swallowed them back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Missy,\" a whisper was all he could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry,\" she also whispered. He realized her hands were gripping his. So warm, so comforting and they were the only thing grounding him to the present. \"And I don't know if you are ready to hear this but Adam is so so sorry. You should have seen him last night... he cares for you so much. I just hope you don't stay mad at him forever. I mean you can do whatever you want...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom looked at her, surprised. \"I-I don't think I'm angry at him anymore.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked even more surprised than he was. \"You're not?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I was, but last night I realized something. Well, maybe I am mad but it is not because of what you think. Its just that every time I look at him I remember how I-I...\" His voice grew hoarse and he could not finish the sentence. \"It is just easier to blame him than to take responsibility for my actions and I don't know if I'm ready to do that yet...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand Tom.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. I'm just...it's just...I'm so ashamed Maddie! I can't stop blaming myself and so I turn it on him instead and that is not fair to Adam. I just wish...I'm such a...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you didn't do anything! You have nothing to be guilty over.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom didn't realize he was standing and she had stood along with him. His whole body was shaking and he felt very weak and sick. There was something that could fix that but he knew he shouldn't, knew he couldn't... Madison interrupted his racing thoughts by wrapping him in a hug. It was both bone crushing and the best thing he had ever felt at the same time. He relaxed into her, drinking in her sweet floral perfume, letting himself feel safe for just a moment while she held together all the pieces of him that were coming apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he murmured in her soft cloud of black hair, \"I don't think Adam told you everything.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't move. \"That's okay. You tell me when you are ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe used his fingers to tilt her head up to face him. The look on her face was earnest and loving--a look that made him both strong and weak. Before he knew it, their lips were touching. Not just touching, but moving together as a matched pair. It burned and tingled and numbed all at once, filling his soul with energy.  At last they pulled away although he wished he could hold her slightly fuller figure all day long. Everything about her drove him crazy. But he couldn't do that. He had to do the right thing. He had to take care of the demons in his own life before he could be with her, if she even wanted to be with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom...\" She said her voice thick with desire. He planted one last kiss on her swollen lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should not have done that,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"probably not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still have to go.\" He said. \"Renee is my girlfriend now and I need to be true to her. Even if she isn't to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison nodded sadly. \"I get it. It's what I want anyway. You should go,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words stung but Tom nodded and pulled away, linking just their pinkies. \"We can still be friends right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"Friends,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison finished the expanse of the road beside Eli panting and gasping from the run. She linked her fingers between her head and forced her breathing to slow. Eli was looking at her with admiration, something she did not understand because they had only ran a few blocks and he had barely broken a sweat. It was infuriating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look at me like that!\" She growled. They had not had breakfast yet and Madison was always grumpy before food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I'll get you food my princess,\" They entered the Dunkin Donuts they had run to and got a dozen to share. Well, mostly she ate them while Eli watched, enamored by her appetite. An appetite that kept growing. Usually they would carry them home and eat but recently Madison's hunger had been impatient and insatiable and she demanded that they sit and eat. The moment they did she wasted no time in digging into the warm doughy bread. The first three she barely tasted, she was so hungry. Then she slowed down to appreciate the sweetness and the texture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the past six weeks since her kiss with Tom these mornings had become quite frequent. Frequent, meaning everyday. She would run with Tom in the morning to get donuts, pancakes, Mcdonald's, pastries or whatever \"his princess\", as Eli referred to her, was craving. The best part was it was all free. Because one, Eli loved to watch her eat--or not just eat indulge, binge. 2) he was her gentlemanly and devoted boyfriend now. He had expressed his love of watching woman stuff their faces and let it grow on their frame shortly after they had started dating. While she was not too thrilled about the weight gain part she had been on a constant hunt to satiate a strange emptiness that had begun to grow within her. Ever since witnessing the battle within Tom and experiencing a taste of the agony he was in, Madison had wanted nothing else than to be with him and make him happy. But he needed Renee and she needed Eli so that is how it was and besides the endless desire for food (the increase in grease and empty carbs which she had had little to do with before could also be a contributing factor) it was working out quite well. She had even hung out with Tom a few times and much to her delight they had both managed to keep it strictly friends. It was hard though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon princess you have one more. Please finish, for me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the past, this much sugar and bread would have made her feel sick and bloated but now she just felt comfortably stuffed. She managed to eat the last one, noticing that he had only had one donut and a black coffee while she had polished off the rest of the dozen. A voice in the back of her mind reminded her of her goal to lose weight. She was going home for the semester break and she did not want to deal with her relentless mother nagging her about her weight. She didn't want it either but at least she had kept up on working out enough so it was not just pure flab. As they got back to her apartment (they walked back because she could not run on such a full stomach). They parted with a heated kiss. Eli admired her curves with his hands and she felt both pleased and irritated that his desire for her seemed to increase as her waistline did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough not fat, a month of indulging without restraint had definitely tipped her to the side of chubby. She had been 130 when she first started school, slim and muscular and modelesque. When her mom had visited she had easily been 140 maybe a pound or two over and her mother had thrown a fit. She had managed to keep her weight at 145 before dating Eli. Now, nearly a month and a half later she was 155lbs, having easily packed on 15 pounds. No amount of exercise could keep up with her eating. Almost, to the end of freshman year and she had not only gained the freshman 15 she had nearly tripled it. This excited Eli and he encouraged her to get the last five pounds to make it even. She wasn't trying to reach any sort of goal. She just sort of ate what she wanted and let Eli keep track for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came out of the shower, Cassi was admiring herself in the mirror. The night Adam had told them his story, Cassi had been resting at 155, the same weight Madison was currently at. But being a bit shorter than Madison this was quite pudgy indeed for her. If Madison stood Cassi side by side with the girl she had first met as roommates she would have a hard time recognizing them as the same person. At her highest, Cassi had stood at a round 170lbs but she and Adam had recently taken to a whole food, no sugar diet and while they were known to cheat quite frequently, she now was 163 while Adam had significantly trimmed down from being outright obese to a pleasantly plump young man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look good,\" Madison said, she meant it. She was wearing a nice royal blue shirt that slid past her butt to the nice leggings and flats the girl wore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks so do you!\" Cassi chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison snorted, throwing on some pants and a maroon blouse with a corresponding cardigan and scarf to accommodate the cold weather. \"Lets pray that my mom agrees with you,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a canned Dr. Pepper from the fridge, Madison went to her last day of classes before finals. Despite the sugary breakfast and the soda, Madison could barely concentrate. Maybe she had finally packed on those last five pounds Eli was hoping for. Her pants were merciless. They pinched and squeezed her belly, making it hard to breath. The decorative holes in the pants had become exit points for her blubber to squeeze. She shifted and tugged at fabric and moved the entire class, trying not to be a disruption but the whole ordeal was miserable. <br>\r\nNote to self, she thought. Wear leggings to the final. During her second class some snow peas and a chocolate bar distracted her from the discomfort somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n25 pounds. She thought. 25 pounds. If she reached 160 it would be exactly 30 pounds in one semester. Just the thought of her mom made her sick. Two large protein bars helped the anxiety go away and she used the energy from the food and the fear of her mom as motivation to power her through a 30 minute workout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as she finished Eli sent her a text, he would be on break now. \"How's it going, my princess?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"good\" she responded. \"Starving. Will you have my order ready when I get there? I'm craving shakes and cheese curds.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison, Kelly, Ginger, Cassi and Megan decided to rush for a sorority when rush week came up. They went to a variety of events, but they soon realized that they wanted to get into Delta Pi Eta [DPE] which seemed to be the coolest house on campus. The girls were all really friendly, and as Madison noticed, really pretty. Delta Pi always seemed to be teaming up with the most exclusive fraternities for parties and she wasn't opposed to that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn bid night all the aforementioned girls were thrilled when they got into Delta Pi. Madison was honestly surprised that all of them got in, given the exclusivity, but she suspected that the rest of her group of friends were also popular in high school, so they were not intimidated by Delta Pi's grandeur and elite apperances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was loving sorority life during the first few weeks. Her sorority had a beautiful house, and it seemed apparent that she had chosen one of the cooler ones on campus. All the girls seemed really nice, and Madison had a great time hanging out with them. Most of the girls felt the same way about Madison and her friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA group of seniors were in charge of pledges for the semester, and would guide them into the sorority. This group consisted of three members. Karen was a senior who was a very smart philosophy and business major. She had light brown hair and stood about 5'6, and weighed 140 pounds. When she came to powers she was about 15 pounds lighter, but 4 years of parties had added a little extra padding. Karen was smart and creative, but could also be a bit cynical at times [but if you asked her she would just call herself pragmatic]. She approached college with the same analytical focus that she would apply to whatever post grad field she ultimatly decided to go into. She figured out 'the game' of how to make friends quickly, and create a large network of people on campus that she could confer with to her own advantage. When Powers was going to crack down on Delta Pi for underage drinking after one of the parties that it threw got busted, it was Karen who wisely already was friends with a few people in administration and the students on the greek advisory board, and then blew through the Delta Pi alumni phone book to get donors to start calling the university and letting them know to lay off. Almost through sheer willpower and lots of charisma, she got admin to look the other way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was another girl pledge guide. Unlike Karen, who relied on her intellect, Sarah embodied another way to get ahead, her looks. The product of a rich businessman and a trophy wife, Sarah was a knockout, a perfect 10. She stood 5'8, yet weighed only 120 pounds. Sarah had a model like body, yet somehow also had a decent sized rack. Her face looked like she was taken straight out of a photo shoot, and her blonde hair complemented it well. You know how in movies, the lead actress always has an attractiveness that usually doesn't exist in reality, Sarah was one of the lucky few who had that. Sarah could be shallow, but contrary to what one may think, given her hotness, she was pleasant to most people, which made her even hotter to guys she talked to. Like Karen, Sarah had built an impressive network of friends for four years, it helped that she didn't mind sitting next to average looking guys in class and chatting them up as well, she realized that friends were currency, and she wasn't about to go burn some nerd who may go on to be a Senator or prominent figure someday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was the final pledge guide. She was cute, but not the knockout Sarah was, and she was decently smart, but wasn't the ever calculating intellectual that Karen was either. Rachel stood 5'4, and had a slender build. She seemed rather down to earth when Madison was talking to her. Rachel had a great work ethic, which came about through means that she never lead on about. Powers was a rather exclusive university. It was private, and it wasn't cheap. Most of the people who went there either were decently well off, or had some combination of aid and scholarships. Rachel was in the later category. Her parents were never rich, but they worked hard and instilled the notion of hard work in her at an early age. This drive got her a full ride to Powers, and she worked hard to keep it. When her Sophomore year rolled around and she got to choose a room in the sorority house to live in, she purposely choose a room on the top floor, back hallway, in a nook that was small. This may have seemed less than ideal to most, but she wanted the ability to study most nights and not get sucked into a random party that had broken out on a Tuesday. Because of her background, Rachel seemed to be the most approachable of the girls. </span></div></div>",

Karen liked both of them, and she was happy that they were going to be working togther. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she walked into the room, Sarah and Rachel were already there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So...we found out what the class looks like, 18 girls out of 102 girls who wanted into ours, what do we think?'' asked Rachel, to get the ball rolling. <br>\r\n''Looks like another elite class for us, for the third year in a row, no one who we extended a bid to turned us down,'' remarked Karen, as she was looking over the report that their sorority President, Christine, had prepared for all of them. <br>\r\n''Hotties as well,'' Sarah noted, while looking over the photos that they took of their incoming class. <br>\r\n''Okay, well we all know our roll here,'' Karen had switched to a slightly more athorative tone, ''We have to make sure these girls know what our sorority is about, become a tight group of friends, and work hard to become full members.''<br>\r\n''I think there are already some tight groups of girls,'' said Rachel, ''that one girl from Miami, what was her name...''<br>\r\n''Madison,'' Karen interjected,<br>\r\n''Yeah, her,'' Rachel continued, ''she and some girls from her dorm floor seem to be really close, I don't know if I would call them clicky, but they seem to follow her even if she doesn't know it.''<br>\r\n''Hmm now that you mention it, in talking with them, they all wanted to stick together while pledging,'' added Sarah while identifying them in photos, ''These ones, Kelly, Cassi, Ginger, and Megan.''<br>\r\n''Hmm, okay well will have to get that group integrated into the sorority, we can't have clicks within.'' Karen knew this wasn't completely true, in any organization there would always be a hierarchy, but it was her job to try to reduce that as much as possible in the new pledge class, the sorority would decline if it just because a giant cat fight.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The 18 girls filled into the room, and Karen, Sarah, and Rachel introduced themselves. After going over general rules and procedure in the sorority for around 15 minutes, Karen moved to instructing them about the bilaw and history. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''This is your bilaw and history book. Our bilaws are secret, but you can keep these and take them with you out of the house. Do not lose these, our chapter of Delta Eta is water marked on every page, so if this ends up on the internet, the national charter will know who to blame. It is very important that you study these. In two weeks we will be having a test a the things in the book, you will not want to be last. Now, it is still possible to get into the sorority if you are the worst score, but it is much harder, and you will not like the punishment.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What exactly is the punishment,'' asked a girl that Madison did not recognize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''We can't tell you until after the test, but trust me, you don't want it to be you.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So you get kicked out?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren starred back at the girl for a second and tried not to look at her with utter condescension, she wondered if they were even listening to her, ''No...as I mentioned a few seconds ago, you can still get in, it's just a much bigger task, and it won't be fun.''</span></div></div>",

Asked Cassi,<br>\r\n''I don't know, they probably just haze you, or make you do some kind of dare.'' Madison said in a somewhat dismissive tone.<br>\r\n''Gosh, what if she's lying, what if they actually do kick you out,'' Kelly said in a concerned voice.<br>\r\n''Well I'm sure they could shame you into leaving, but face it, they want to have people in the house, they just don't want us to think that they want people in the house and that it's something we need to do,'' said Megan.<br>\r\nGinger chimed in, ''Well I'm certainly not going to get last, I'm going to study that book cover to cover.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison thought about it when she got back to the dorm, sure she would study the book, but it wasn't going to come at the expense of her classes. Besides, she was smart, her high school grades said enough about that, and she didn't need to ace the test, she just needed to study enough to not get last. Madison thought all throughout her schooling and she assumed she had never once did the worst in the class on anything, plus, some of the girls didn't look very bright, so she figured that she had a pad that she could fall back on if all else failed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater the next day, after talking with Tom after class for a while, Madison walked into the dorm and saw Cassi with the history and bilaws book in full study mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wow, you took Karen's speech to heart.''<br>\r\n''Well you heard her, and I don't want to get last.''<br>\r\n''I don't know, I'm going to study it, but I'm not going to let it get in the way of the classes that, you know affect our GPAs and lives.''<br>\r\n''It sounds like getting last on this test could affect our lives, Madison.''<br>\r\n''Hey I didn't say I wasn't going to study, just not like it's finals.'' </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cassi continued to study hard, she was just happy to get into such a good sorority, she wasn't going to risk starting off on a bad foot with everyone. Cassi went through the first 11 chapters, which went over the background of the sorority and it's bilaws. She learned some stuff that she thought was cool, and she learned about famous members of the sorority, some former first ladies, CEOs of a few fortune 500s and a few members of congress, things that interested her and she figured may come up on the test. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued and learned about proper decorum at meetings, and then a ton of things about proper formal attair and other things that she thought was archaic, ''Man, this must have not been updated since the 1920s,'' Cassi half thought as she continued to read through the rules. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Cassi came across chapter 11, which was titled, ''New Member Procedure.'' It started off with a disclaimer, ''The following is the new member procedure of which new pledges will be brought into the Delta Pi Eta sorority. This is not the full procedure. Further instruction on new pledge procedure will be given to three pledge guides upon their election in a meeting with quoroum of the sorority chapter.'' This made sense to Cassi, they were not going to tell the new pledges what was coming up ahead of them, it would kind of ruin the whole point. So, whatever was in the book, they wanted the new members to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChapter 11 went over things that they had already done, the bid night ceremony, she learned that they needed a 75 percent vote of the sorority to get a bid, she learned about other major ceremonies, big sister evening, and pledge retreats, among other things. Then she came to something that confused her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>''Chapter 11, Clause 26, A- New members [footnote 5, in 1986 the international sorority voted to informally term 'New Members' as 'Pledges', to seperate them from full members who had been initiated in good standing.] will be given a test to evaluate their knowledge and understanding of the Delta Pi Eta sorority and its functions. This test will cover all portions of the Rules and Bilaws publication of the current year. The new test will be mailed [footnote 6, in 2004 the international sorority voted to change the mailing of the test to secure email.] to each chapter in good standing with the international sorority each year. Test scores must be recorded, ranked, and sent back to the international sorority. Faliure to send back scores will result in probation for pledge guides.''</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi looked up, ''Crap, this must be important if they are sending these back to the international sorority, I wonder how long they keep these scores.'' She continued reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>''Chapter 11, Clause 26, B- After tests have been recorded new members shall be ranked from first to last in order of test proformance. The new member who has the highest score should be invited to a meeting of the chapter and praised for her intellect and work ethic. She will be forever marked in our achieves as a Gamma sister, which will be marked next to her name in all future printed materials of the sorority chapter, or international sorority.''</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Okay, that's pretty cool,'' thought Cassi, ''I really want to go for that.'' The guide continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>''Chapter 11, Clause 26, C- The new member who has the lowest score in the sorority shall be treated with scorn among her new members. This individual has shown a level of disrespect for our beloved sorority, and should be treated with consequence. This sorority was founded with forgiveness as one if its main ideals, the lowest member will be allowed to stay in the sorority. However, this member's appereance will be affected. [footnote 7, in 1923 it was voted on by the international sorority that 'apperance' refers to the physical apperance of the new member. The lowest new member will be forced to eat a diet of her sorority sisters' choosing for the remainder of her pledging.] After one semester, the lowest member will be forgiven for her disrespect to the sorority, and may enter in as a full member, assuming completion of the other requirements.''</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What the hell,'' thought Cassi as she read clause C, ''what kind of freak sorority is this?'' Cassi was studying alone in her room, which was too bad, because she wanted to motion Madison over and share in her shock over this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi decided to go the sorority house</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cassi was shocked by this clause in the chapter. ''They are going to fatten one of us up? Would they actually do that?'' She wondered as she walked off campus onto frat row, which was only about 3 blocks away from her freshman dorm. Cassi noticed it wasn't nearly as hot as it was a month ago, now that they were getting into mid September. She thought about the weight issue and realized that none of her friends had really put on a lot of weight, which was good because some of the girls were looking a bit porky, which is probably why they didn't get into Delta Pi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi continued to walk and thought it was interesting that some sororities could be known as ones for fat girls, ''how does that happen, why do they all get grouped in like that? It's kind of weird when you think about it, that we are all so judgemental about one thing like that,'' thought Cassi. However Cassi wasn't in delusion about her ability to change the system. She knew that it may always be like that, at really any age. Cute little girls in grade school make fun of ugly girls, everyone know how insecure they all were in high school, heck studies showed that students, even before they were sexually aware prefered attractive teachers at a  higher rate. Now, Cassi wasn't the victim in this scenario, she was attractive, and hung out with popular people in high schol, but it drove her nuts about how teen movies always protrayed these things. Maybe it was how she saw how nice her parents were to everyone, but she didn't pick on people, and talked to anyone she came across, regardless of social class or apperance, it just always seemed like the right thing to do. It was like she was trapped in a system that she hated, but benefited her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi eventually got to the Sorority house and went up to Karen's room. Karen came to the door in sweatpants and a t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey, what's up Cassi.''<br>\r\n''Not much, what are you up to.''<br>\r\n''Just writing my senior philosophy thesis, 'The consequences of hedonism in a nihilist world.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi vaugly knew what she was talking about, but some of that went over her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wow''<br>\r\n''Yeah, just finished my 26th page.''<br>\r\n''Yikes.''<br>\r\n''Yeah, but I like doing this kind of work, I guess that makes me a freak,'' Karen noted with a laugh.<br>\r\n''Hey I wanted to ask,'' Cassi said in an uncomfertable tone, ''what is the deal with Chapter 11, 26, Clause C.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ah, yes you found that. What do you think about it?'' This was a trick that Karen always used, she wanted to get someone's angle on a subject going it, so she could figure out what point they wanted her to make, she had perfected this trick through four years of networking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I think it's weird, like do they actually make you fat?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I agree, it's messed up, some bilaw they amended in the 1920s to put a true consequence to not taking the sorority seriously.'' Karen agreed with Cassi, she thought it was humiliating, and counter productive. She remembered 4 years ago when she stumbled across the rule while studying and she still wondered why a sorority would fatten up a pledge. Wasn't that like a car dealer taking his new model and hitting golf balls into it? Karen continued what she was saying to Cassi, ''Yeah, the person with the worst score will probably gain some weight, some girls get really into it and buy a ton of junk food to make the girl eat.'' Karen said while shaking her head. ''It's stupid, they tried to repeal it at the international sorority a few years ago, but they couldn't get the 80 percent of chapters needed to take it out. Some girls a just mean spirited or think it's tradition.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Gosh, that's awful, I should probably go tell the other pledges,'' said Cassi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You know, Cassi, that may not be a good idea,'' said Karen, ''I take it you don't want to get the worst score,'' Cassi's head nod served as affirmation, Karen continued, ''So it may be in your best interest to not spread it around, so you have less competition.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Karen, they're my friends.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I didn't say it wasn't cold, I just wanted to give you some advice on how to avoid it.'' Karen said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Okay, I'll think about it. So who ended up getting the worst score in your class.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Bridget, she ended up gaining around 35 pounds during the semester.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Huh, I never met her.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''That's because she dropped out of school due to the stress and teasing.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Really??''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''No, she lives upstairs, I'll introduce you guys sometime.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So did she lose the weight afterwards,'' asked Cassi,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well not all of it, she probably lost about 15 pounds. But she's still trying,'' Karen said, and thought about how many times she saw Bridget pushing herself in the gym. That was the crappy thing about weight, it was much harder to take off once you put some on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Who ended up getting the highest score and being a Gamma member?'' Cassi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Me.'' Karen said, sheepishly. </span></div></div>",

This contrasted with Madison who was spending her time working out, studying for classes, hanging out with friends, or spending some time with Tom. Of course, Madison didn't purposely shrug off studying, she just had a busy schedule, and didn't fully realize the repercussions of having the worst score. Madison also figured, ''I'm pretty smart, so the chances of me having the worst score are low, even if I don't study.'' This line fo thinking were somewhat flawed. Yes, Madison was smart, but a lot fo the rules and bilaws were not common sense, and the history of the sorority sections were not something that you could just expect to guess on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison had planned on studying the night before the test, which was on a Thursday, however she also had a paper due the next day that she was investing a lot of time in. Madison had thought she would finish it by midnight, however, in her drive to get the best possible grade she kept expanding on sections and polishing it, until 6am. Granted, it was a great paper, but this only left Madison a few hours to sleep, and no time to go over the sorority stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi and Madison usually got up around the same time due to similar class schedules.

''6,'' replied Madison, ''I don't know how I'm getting through the day, all I want to do is sneak in a few hours of sleep.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis worried Cassi, not only was Madison unprepared, she was now also sleep deprived. </span></div></div>",

''Ok,'' thought Madison, ''only 100 questions, I'll just have to average about a minute a question and I'll be fine.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Madison started the test, she knew that she wouldn't be as fine as she thought.

But we can't, it's in the national bilaws. But, I mean, if they study they should find it, and push themselves to study harder so they don't have to do it.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey shifted gears after that, ''Sarah, how is your new internship going?'' asked Rachel.<br>\r\n''Really, really well, I sit down more than I'm used to, but I'm on a lot of projects and getting to see the marketing process.''<br>\r\n''Neat, what are you doing now?'' Asked Karen, wondering if she should have persued the internship.<br>\r\n''One of the culinary firms in town is trying to create a brand that they can franchise regionwide.''<br>\r\n''Ah, I see, how would a culinary firm do that, don't you need a certain infrastructure to do that?''<br>\r\n''Well they have some capitol lined up, they are just trying to identify what they want the public to associate with them, and then they train chefs and contract with the wholesale providers for the individual franchises , and just take a little bit off the top. So it's a lot of working with the culinary firm that's up and running in town.''<br>\r\n''Not a bad idea.''<br>\r\n''Yeah, they bring a ton of food into the office, it's sooo good.''</span></div></div>",

This test will cover all portions of the Rules and Bilaws publication of the current year. The new test will be mailed [footnote 6, in 2004 the international sorority voted to change the mailing of the test to secure email.] to each chapter in good standing with the international sorority each year. Test scores must be recorded, ranked, and sent back to the international sorority. Faliure to send back scores will result in probation for pledge guides.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Chapter 11, Clause 26, B- After tests have been recorded new members shall be ranked from first to last in order of test proformance. The new member who has the highest score should be invited to a meeting of the chapter and praised for her intellect and work ethic. She will be forever marked in our achieves as a Gamma sister, which will be marked next to her name in all future printed materials of the sorority chapter, or international sorority.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Chapter 11, Clause 26, C- The new member who has the lowest score in the sorority shall be treated with scorn among her new members. This individual has shown a level of disrespect for our beloved sorority, and should be treated with consequence. This sorority was founded with forgiveness as one if its main ideals, the lowest member will be allowed to stay in the sorority. However, this member's appereance will be affected. [footnote 7, in 1923 it was voted on by the international sorority that 'apperance' refers to the physical apperance of the new member. The lowest new member will be forced to eat a diet of her sorority sisters' choosing for the remainder of her pledging.] After one semester, the lowest member will be forgiven for her disrespect to the sorority, and may enter in as a full member, assuming completion of the other requirements.''</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasically, whoever got the lowest score on the test, was going to get fat. </span></div></div>",

Off with the trendy jeans and cute shirt, on with the pencil skirt and [tight] sweater. Sarah also put her hair up in a professional manner and applied the smallest amount of make up, she was skilled at looking trendy in a business environment, while not giving off the appearance of being an office slut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah jumped in her car, which was her parent's old luxury sport sedan, and drove to the business district of the city. After parking she went to the underground garage elevator, and hit '34.' She wasn't going to the top floor, with investment bankers and CEOs, but hey, 34 wasn't anything to scoff at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah walked into work, past the reception desk, ''Hey Cheryl, how did Jimmy's soccer match go?'' Sarah realized quicker than her fellow interns was that the best way to possibly get hired, or at least expand your network, was to be super friendly to everyone in the work place. Folks like Cheryl, the 57 year old receptionist, were always pleasantly surprised when someone like Sarah, an attractive [understatement] 22 are that outgoing towards them, it was just rare among young interns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her brief small talk, Sarah sat down at her work station and started doing the background research that her boss had assigned her. She was tasked with finding catering companies of any size that could possibly delude the market for the catering company franchise, mostly grunt work, but hey, that's what interns are for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boss, Tim, walked out of his office at around 11, ''Hey Sarah, just a heads up, the catering folks dropped off lunch for all of us.'' He was referring to the group that was using the marketing firm to create a national franchising brand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wow, again, Tim? Are they just doing that every day?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, feels like that sometimes, but hey, I'm not complaining about a free lunch.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah Tim, you're really struggling to get by.'' Sarah said sarcastically, she had no idea how much he actually made, but from gossip among the interns, he was compensated at a high level for his skill. He had landed the marketing firm many accounts, and had been one of the main reasons that they had expanded so much over the past 10 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ha, well no gets rich by spending money, and I think they are trying out a ton of new foods over the next month, so they may ask the interns to fill out food surveys after meals.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Is that...you know...scientific?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh gosh no, you guys are just another informal layer of test, we have focus groups'' Tim moved to a playfully false offended tone, ''gosh Sarah, you think I would stake our firms reputation on a bunch of sleep deprived college students.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen lunch rolled around, Sarah saw there was a ton of lasagna. She grabbed some, and wondered how many calories she was scarfing down. ''Gosh,'' she thought to herself, ''I better not eat this kind of food every day, I would start looking like Claire.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was another intern that they had. She was pretty chubby, she had a pot belly, soft arms, and a chunky butt, along with a double chin and full cheeks and thighs. Sarah was always friendly with her, and they ate lunch together sometimes, but in secret, Sarah wondered how Claire could let herself look like that. </span></div></div>",

Claire had never been skinny, since she could remember, she was always insecure about her weight. High school and college were not that fun for her because of that. She was always a little pudgy, but at the end of high school she gained her pot belly and pushed herself into 'fat' territory. She never had dates in high school, and when she got to college, she got rejected to all the good sororities, and ended up in one with other fat girls. Claire was always jealous when she went online and saw photos of Sarah hanging out with hot guys at football games, or going to South Padre for spring break and prancing around in a small bikini and a drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire thought this extended to the workplace. Claire got along fine with everyone, but not like Sarah did. The other interns loved talking with her, and the employees almost treated her like an equal. She half wondered if Tim and Sarah were flirting instead of doing work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, obviously everyone's perception of a situation was different, and Claire wasn't 100 percent correct in thinking that everyone liked Sarah because of her hot body and model looks. People liked Sarah because she was really friendly to all of them. Part of it may have been that they weren't used to someone that attractive not coming off like a b--- but she wasn't just getting by on her looks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire didn't take any of this into account, she spent a lot of time thinking how great it would be if Sarah had to live with her body, and didn't get all the perks of being hot.</span></div></div>",

She loathed having to sit next to someone who looked like a model, and who excelled at work. So, she decided that it was time to knock Sarah down a peg. When she got home one night, she gradually thought of her plan. If Sarah lost her appearance, maybe she wouldn't be so miserable to work next to, Claire thought. Of course, Sarah was great to work next to and was nice to her coworkers, but Claire could not see this through the jealousy that she held towards her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire figured her plan was straightforward enough, but had to be carried through with much subtle, because if she screwed it up, she would be fired, and her bizarre plot would be exposed, causing certain social and professional suicide. First, she would turn the secretary, Cheyrl, against Sarah. Then, she would get the interns, one by one, annoyed by her. Finally, she would get Tim to become irritated that her, and assign her less than great assignments. As opportunities arose, Claire figured that she could find ways to turn other employees against Sarah, but that would take time, the core that she had named was most important, as they had the highest level of daily interaction with Sarah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Claire got to work the next day, she told the IT guy, Rick, that her computer was having some issues. This was true, but only because she purposely deleted some important files and now the operating system had become essentially useless. While Rick was sitting at her desk, identifying what he needed to do to make the machine functional again, Claire snuck into his office. Rick made a somewhat rookie mistake for having been a good IT person, he left his computer logged in. Claire knew that Rick had the central document that held all the intern email passwords, it was bad security, but it made managing interns easier, and college students were prone to forgetting things like that so it made sense that the company kept these. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire quickly found the file, and located Sarah's email, sroberts@hsmarketing.com, and the password, intern9. \"Okay, I totally could have come up with that on my own,\" thought Claire. She quickly texted it to herself, and left Rick's office. When she arrived back at her desk, Rick was just finishing up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Claire, did you go digging into your computer's drivers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are drivers?\" Claire played dumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are the files that help your computer function, a message probably popped up and said they were sensitive files?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. I don't remember doing anything like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick figured it was just another computer illiterate college airhead. \"Okay, well hopefully we don't have to worry about it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's first step was in place. </span></div></div>",

One day in the dorm when Cassi was studying, Madison came back from the mail room with packages from clothing retailers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah,\" Cassi asked, looking up from her desk, \"someone went on a bit of a spree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Eh...\" Madison said emabrassed, \"my jeans have gotten way too small. I guess I wasn't going to be a size 4 forever.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happens to everyone,\" Cassi said, neglecting to mention that she herself had maintained her great figure so far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Maybe we should plan some gym outings or something,\" Madison responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was alarmed by the weight, but hopped she could get back down to where she had been before. With the gym on campus, and a bit of self control, she figured, 'how hard could it be?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe workouts never seemed to materialize for Madison, however, and Cassi continued to place snacks in the dorm room, preying on Madison's lack of self-control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a week after the newer jeans had come, Madison and Cassi went to a pep rally to kick off the basketball season. While standing behind Madison in line, waiting to get into the arena, Cassi couldn't help but notice that Madison's butt seemed bigger in her jeans. Formerly, Madison's seemed small, but still enough there to impress guys. Now Madison's was filling out the larger jeans, and she seemed like someone who had always had a bubble butt. When they got to their seats and sat down, through the corner of her eye, Cassi could see Madison had the tiniest belly roll when she sat down. Although the pep rally ended up being fun, Cassi would always remember it as the day where Madison ceased to be a thin girl with a few extra pounds, and became soft. A girl on the verge of being chubby. </span></div></div>",

Her boobs were bigger though, so Cassi could not have been too angry about that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison wondered if it was their different upbrining that caused it. Being from image consious Miami certainly was in the back of Madison's mind. She was kind of curious if Cassi's family would even notice that their daughter gained some weight.

Madison never turned down the opprotunity to use her Dad's emergency credit card that he gave her. ''Emergency'' being the running joke, since both her and her Dad knew that it was Madison's way of secretly getting money from her Dad without her Mom noticing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were in the fitting rooms, Madison thought that Cassi looked like she had gained about 15 pounds over the course of the first month of school.

She grew a pot belly, and chunky arms, in addition to a large set of boobs, the downside being that it came with back rolls of fat. Cassi's body just could not take the additional calories from all of the dorm food and greasy dinning hall meals. Madison was keeping her figure by working out, but Cassi never really seemed interested in that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison kept working out, and was keeping her figure, and one day she ran into Kelly at the gym.

At dinner time, Madison also started to shift away from salads, and instead towards the more tasty, but also fattening, dinning hall pizza or burgers. In her mind, she could always start eating healthy one meal later, however, she kept pushing this back. \"I'll just have to work this off,\" thought Madison, not realizing that she was now eating more calories than she was burning off, and eventually, this meant that she was going to put on weight no matter what she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all pleasing to Cassi, however she wanted faster progress on Madison. Cassi hated her soft body, and the only thing she could think to do was to help hurt Madison's as well so that there was less for her to be compared to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne evening when Cassi got home from class, she saw Madison was sitting on her computer typing a project.

Her breasts had grown as well, struggling to stay in her bikini top, sagging out the edges. Her thighs now touched at the top, and her bottoms cut into them, causing her to constantly adjust them. When she walked, her butt jiggled. Her butt had grown a lot, taking the brunt of the weight. It now had dimples and traces of cellulite of the side, and now stuck out more.

Madison had been pigging out all week, constantly stuffing her face with junk food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie was repulsed by how much unhealthy food Madison was eating. Over the past few weeks Cassie had gone on a diet and exercised regularly, causing her to lose almost 20 pounds. Madison's growing appetite for junk food started to disgust Cassie, even though she was happy she was packing on the pounds. \"Oh my god, they put like barely any bacon on these fries\" Madison complained as she polished off the remainder, then licking off the extra cheese from the basket. She then inhaled her burger and started on her sundae. Cassie watched as her friend demolished the massive sundae, polishing it off with the snicker bar. \"You want some?\" Madison asked as she tore open the bag of M&amp;M's. \"No thanks\" Cassie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you wanna go in the water Madison\" Cassie asked her friend, who sitting in one of the chairs reading a magazine. \"Not yet, you're supposed to wait 45 minutes before going into the pool after eating\" responded Madison. Cassie decided to go in the water without her friend, who was content sun-bathing beside the pool in her bikini, which after her feast, was struggling to stay on. Cassie watched as her formerly ripped friend lathered her self with sunscreen. She started with her belly, which was bloated from her \"snack\". Usually after stuffing, Madison's belly was taught, almost as hard as a rock. Over time though, enough fat had settled on her belly that it always had a layer of soft flesh on it.Cassie watched as Madison's hands sunk into her potbelly, which when sitting down formed two big jelly rolls. When sitting down, her belly sagged over the waist band of her bikini bottoms. Madison continued put sun-screen on, moving down to her thighs. Her thighs had taken a lot of her weight gain recently, brushing at the tops when she walked. Madison slapped some sun-screen on her soft thighs, rubbing the lotion in, causing her thighs to quiver slightly. Cassie was mesmerized by her roommate's weight gain. Only a few weeks ago she was super hot and fit. Now she was chubby, even having a slight double chin.

Madison had been contemplating going on a diet, but she never seemed to muster the motivation to actually follow through. It had been two weeks since she weighed herself and she still hadn't done anything to combat her gain. She continued to inhale junk food under Cassie's influence, always convincing herself that she would start to eat healthier later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie entered her room to find Madison sitting alone on her bed eating a carton of ice cream with an empty box of pizza next to her. \"Hey Madison!\" Madison looked up from her ice cream and mumbled, \"Oh hey Cassie\". She immediately put her head down and continued devouring her ice cream. Cassie watched as her roommate stuffed her mouth. Madison was wearing sweatpants and a hoodie. Over the past few days it seemed as though this had become Madison's uniform, as she put little effort into what she wore now that she had started to pile on the pounds. Her exclusively junk food diet had caused her appetite to skyrocket. She now had three massive meals a day, along with constant snacking on chips and cookies. Soda had replaced water in Madison's diet, who now was almost always drinking some sort of soft drink. The scale was her worst enemy. She hadn't weighed herself in weeks in fear of knowing exactly how big she had become. If she did weigh herself, she would realize that she had put on another ten pounds, causing her to tip the scales at 163 pounds. She know had a full blown pot belly, which poked out from most of her shirts. Her now meaty thighs jiggled when she walked, and her growing butt swayed with every stride. Madison had lost motivation to lose weight, accepting her fate as a chubby girl. During the nights Cassie would see Madison getting ready for bed in her bra and panties, which now struggled to contain her chubby body. She now was completely soft. When she sat down her belly folded over the waistline of her panties, sitting on her fleshy thighs. Her lovehandles poured over her sides and her backfat was a growing problem. Madison had now descended into the realm of being overweight. </span></div></div>",

You think I don't realize that?!\" She almost screamed into the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi instantly realized that it was her mother. From what Cassi gathered, Madison's mother had seen photos of her daughter on social media and was not pleased. Madison's Mom had always been really thin, and she expected her daughters to do the same. IT had never been an issue, at least until Cassi started to influence Madison into gaining weight without realizing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cassi starred at Madison's back, she stopped hearing the words Madison was frantically screaming back into her cell, and just focused on the body of a girl that was experience weight gain and the insecurity that came with it for the first time. Madison's love handles were peaking out of the t shirt that she was wearing, and her butt was filling up sweat pants that were huge on her when she first came to campus. Cassi guessed that Madison had gained another 5 pounds during the last week, bringing her up to 168 pounds. As she looked at Madison wondered, <i>Are her arms really that plump, or is it just because her left arm is raised bringing the phone to head?</i> She was interrupted when a shriek went through the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT'S NOT LIKE I'M TRYING TO GAIN WEIGHT MOM, I HATE YOU.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Madison her Mom calling to ask about her weight was just another example of how awful things were for her since her weight had begun to rise. She knew that girls were making fun of her behind her back, and that she was quickly losing her sex appeal. It was embarrassing enough at parties when the hottest guys were not talking to her anymore, but now her Mom had to pile on as well? Plus, her favorite clothes were not fitting anymore, and she did not want to face buying new, ones. She loved her old body that was slipping further and further in the rear view mirror. It was all too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison threw her phone onto the couch and started to cry. Cassi tried to intervene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison, don't do that, you're Mom is just being a jerk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she's right, how could I let myself get so fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doesn't know what she's talking about--you don't look any larger then when you weighed yourself a few weeks ago. I think those workouts are really helping. You'll be back to your weight in no time. Come on, how about some ice cream, you're having a hard day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that going to help this. It's just going to make me worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One serving won't hurt anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison sniffled, \"Yeah, I guess you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison ended up eating 4 servings. </span></div></div>",

Her lazy and gluttonous habits had grabbed her from the realm of chubby to overweight and rapidly approaching fat. Now at 180 Madison had passed how Cassie had been at her heaviest.<br>\r\n\tThe effects were exactly what she had wanted. All of the old whispers of her weight gain had shifted to Madisons now growing waistline. She had also gained through her sabotage the title of the hottest roommate. Cassie had not managed to lose all of the weight she had gained, a stubborn 10 lbs refused to leave her now curvier frame. It always helped to look at how much her friends had put on whenever she stepped on her unbudging scale. Cassie had branched out her sabotage to her other friends, and the effects were starting to show. A few gift cards for free meals, pushing high-calorie beers on her already drunk friends, and implementing similar lazy tactics on them to reduce their gym time, Cassie had managed to put the freshman 15+ on Kelly Ginger and Megan.<br>\r\n\tThe effects were particularly noticeable on Ginger as she was the shortest, but Kelly had gained the most. She had given up on the gym the fastest after not making the college basketball team, she then continued to eat like a teenage athlete with unhealthy cafeteria food. The result was a new jiggling pot belly on the now 25 lb heavier athlete. She was also the least worried about her gain. Ginger was worried about her weight but had resigned to try dieting as she was abhorrent to the idea of working out. With Cassie's bad influence, however, she was not succeeding. Megan had been the most successful at keeping the weight off, being a bit of a gym nut, but her previously well-defined ass had definitely gained some jiggle.<br>\r\n\tReminiscing about her friend's new weight gain Cassie happily put down her old pair of jeans. It was a pair of skinny jeans that fit well on her first day of college but was still a little too tight. Instead, Cassie put on a pair of workout clothes and decided to take an early trip to the gym. On the way out; however, she decided to sneak a peek at her fattened roommate. Madison was struggling with a pair of pants she had gotten just last week. After an effort that left her red-faced, she managed to button them. Satisfied Madison reached over and started munching on a doughnut from a box Cassie had gotten her. After the second doughnut, the button on Madisons pants burst and flew across the room. With a disappointed sigh, Madison took the pants off, giving Cassie a view of her larger flabbier butt, then continuing to eat her doughnuts in a stretchy pair of sweatpants. <br>\r\n\tThe sight gave Cassie a sudden lazy urge. She had been working her butt of recently trying to lose weight and not succeeding, it had also been forever since she had a cheat day\u2026 \u201cMaybe I can afford one doughnut\u2026.\u201d Cassie thought as she opened one of the boxes in the fridge meant for Madison. She picked up a glazed doughnut, \u201cJust one...:\u201d It turned out to be more than just one. She actually managed to eat four. It was so good! Her memory started to flood back to why she had gained so much weight in the first place. Food was delicious, but after so much eating she was always too full to work out. As she was now of course. Slightly ashamed but mostly deeply satisfied Cassie elected to skip the gym. After all, she was the skinniest of all of her friends. She could afford to skip a few trips to the gym, right?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When she got there she was happy to see that he was jogging next to an open treadmill. Madison jumped onto the machine next to him and they started going through the normal small talk that they usually engaged in, classes, friends, just talking to pass the time since they were not great friends yet. After a while, Madison, somewhat awkwardly, but in an acceptable manner since they were both tired while running, managed to stick in something about Cassi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey so I heard my roommate Cassi is in your lit class. She says you're always pretty funny about the dry stuff that you guys have to read.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh yeahh, Cassi, yeah we sit near each other, she's really fun.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah! I love being roomies with her, would you ever be interested in swinging by our room to hang out, or maybe grabbing dinner with her sometime?'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Umm, would it just be me and Cassi, like are you trying to set us up?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ha, yeah I guess I am.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wow, you know I just don't think of her that way, she's not really my type.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison knew what that meant, coming from someone who worked out as much as he did. He didn't want to date someone who was putting on as much weight as Cassi. She had no idea what she was going to tell Cassi, but that wasn't going to be fun. But she had the situation at hand that she had to deal with, making sure she didn't get awkward with Chris, so she continued the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh yeah totally, it's fine, I just figured I would ask since you guys were in class...and I know both of you, no worries.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Did she ask you to do this?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What? Nooooo. I just was curious. No harm, right?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, I guess, he what are you doing later tonight?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Umm, studying.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Cool, well if you get bored you should call me.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison probably assumed he knew that was a lie, but she almost wanted to call her out after he was about to invite her to hang out after he shot down her friend. She replied,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Do we even have each other's numbers?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''No, I guess not, hey hand me your phone.'' Madison without thinking about pressed pause on her treadmill, and handed it to an already stationary Chris, who punched in his number. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Okay, well you have it now.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison didn't realize this, but she had a list of things she now had to deal with, most important being letting Cassi know Chris was a no go. But additionally, she wondered what was going on with her and Chris. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison came back to the room, and Cassi was waiting for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So how did it go?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What, not going to let me go shower first?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Come on, did he show any interest?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Cassi, I'm really sorry...''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They all pregamed before that, so as they walked up to the house, they were all pretty buzzed and feeling good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party was packed, and they stuck around for a while, but eventually Madison got separated from the rest of them. After a while of kind of walking around somewhat bored, she ran into a familiar face towards the back of the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well, I didn't expect to see you here.'' said the voice, after a second, Madison knew it was Chris and she turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Heyyy, wow, nice to see you for once while we're not at the gym.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ha, yeah, it may be good for you to see that I am not always sweaty and disgusting.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got to talking, and Madison was shocked how much she was enjoying his presence, she didn't know it, but Chris was having a great time as well. After about 25 minutes, Madison got a text from Cassi, which read - ''Maddi, goin to new party meet in frnt.'' Madison thought about it for a second, and decided to consult Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So Cassi wants to go to another party, should we join her?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Do you want to go?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''No, not really'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Then let's not go, and ride this one out a bit longer.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Madison sent Cassi back a text, ''Hey you can leave with out me, I'll catch up later.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison knew that she was only staying because of Chris, she wanted to talk to him more, even if he had rejected Cassi. Maybe it was the alcohol talking, but she was kind of into him. A sober Madison would have wondered what the repercussions would be for her friendship with Cassi, but she and Chris weren't, so it created a situation where both sides wanted the same thing.

She thought that she could bake a ton of food, and hope that Madison would eat what was in front of her, but that seemed unlikely. ''If only I could find her food weakness,'' thought Cassi, as she continued to brainstorm ideas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi also wondered if she could tamper with anything that Madison often took each day. She knew that Madison took birth control pills, but she wasn't about to mess with that. Getting Madison pregnant, or worse, screwing with it and causing her to have clot issues would be awful. ''Hmm, what if I just take her 7 placebo pills, and replace those with protein supplements ?'' Although Madison kept those in her purse, so they would be hard to get to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly because it was a brainstorm, she even considered hypnosis, ''yeah, I'll do that right after I get done with my tin foil hat,'' thought Cassi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't really think of ways that she could keep Madison out of the gym, heck, that's where she met Chris, so that's not going anywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hmm...how did I get fat when it's this hard to think of ways,'' wondered Cassi. Just then she gazed at Madison's coffee pot. Madison often needed coffee to get her day off to the right start, she was not really a morning person, but could make it through with her daily coffee. ''This could work, I'll just get black protein powder, and mix it in with Madison's coffee stash. The coffee is bitter enough that Madison won't be able to tell. Then, she'll basically be having a weight gain shake everyday before class that she hasn't even realized.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi pondered her options. </span></div></div>",

Madison had once admitted to Cassi that she would burn through it if it was ever out. Cassi figured that if she kept bringing that, Madison's intake would go up a ton. She also would get back into cooking, and make sweets for Madison on a frequent basis, she figured once in a while, Madison would indulge. Finally, she thought the powder in the coffee was a brilliant idea, and went to the store to buy the most potent mix possible. While Madison was at class, Cassi dumped out a bit off coffee, and replaced it with the protein powder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Cassi paid close attention to see if Madison noticed anything odd about her coffee. If Madison did, she didn't show it, and Cassi was pleased with that portion of her plan. After class, Cassi put a thing of trail mix on a side table next to Madison's desk, and saw her demolish a bag in one evening. ''That's incredible, there must have been 12 servings in that bag, this may work.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi looked at her fit roommate, and wondered how long her perfect body would last. </span></div></div>",

Of particular concern was her history project that she was doing, and the lack of research leads she was finding. After exhausting JSTOR and other internet options, she decided to find things the old fashioned way, and headed to the Powers' library. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe library consisted of two structures. The first was a modern building. Bright and open, filled with technology and good places to study. Some mega-donor had wanted a prominent place for his name on campus after the new basketball facility got built, Madison half-joked to Cassi the first time they had gone into the newer part. The second half of the library consisted of long winding series of bookshelves, and endless stacks. It was much more dim, especially late at night, when Cassi was looking for the specific cite she needed to complete her assignment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued to walk deeper into the stacks, she realized she had not seen anyone for a while, something she chalked up to the hour, and the obscure titles she was looking for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then she heard a the sound of someone else moving closer to the shelf she was looking at, and she got nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" she asked, a bit frightened, and feeling foolish for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn elderly woman walked by the row of books that Cassi was looking through. \"Oh, I hope I did not interrupt anything,\" the woman remarked. Cassi noted from the dress that this seemed to be the janitor, or something, armed with only a broom and her uniform. Looking a bit frail, and past the age of retirement, Cassi felt bad that someone that age had to take what she figured was a low paying job, at this late hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, I'm actually happy to run into someone to take my mind off this problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what would that be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My stupid European colonialism paper.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. I expected you to say your problem of Madison stealing Chris from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi nearly dropped the book. \"What?.....how do you know about that?\"</span></div></div>",

That's why I have sought you out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi continued to just stare at the woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You passed my final test as well. I sensed your empathy towards my lowly status, when you did not know any better.\" In an instance, when Cassi blinked, the elderly woman looked to loose 20 years, and was suddenly wearing a female power suit. She looked like a senator now, or a female CEO. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassi, the universe is a collection of random events, insignificant circumstances eons ago have lead to this world where you are stuck with a slower metabolism, less well off family, and fewer friends than Madison. I can't change the past, but what if I told you, I can ever so slightly adjust things to dramatically change the future.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would say that I need to drink less coffee,\" Cassi responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been doing this for a while. I don't blame you for your doubt. How about this; tomorrow morning, it will be raining tomorrow, Madison is going to eat a doughnut for breakfast, your dorm-mate across the hall, Kelly, is going to scrape her knee on the way back from class, and the Dow is going to gain exactly 68 points.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Insignificant events, right? But predicting all three of things would happen in this manner be nearly impossible, wouldn't they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the do happen, it would be worth your while to come back here tomorrow evening, wouldn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the woman was back to her elderly status, and started sweeping the floor, \"You have a nice day, mam, good luck with your report,\" she said as she moved to the next area of the library. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi was shooken. As she tried to figure all this out, the exact book she had been looking for, appeared on the floor, next to her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning, Cassi awoke to Madison getting back from the dinning hall. She was casually eating a doughnut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning,\" Cassi said, well aware that the first of three things had happened, \"you decided not to eat a granola bar for breakfast?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" Madison replied, \"I just decided to splurge on some junk for a change.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi thought about this conversation for the rest of the morning, not really taking in any of her classes. At lunch, her and Madison met Kelly, where they all had salads.<i>What the hell was up with that doughnut this morning?</i> Cassi thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked down the campus pedestrian mall back to the dorms, the were chatting and laughing, when suddenly, Kelly slipped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F---!\" she screamed, getting up and brushing off her knee, which was now bleeding. Since she had been wearing shorts, Kelly's skin was the only thing harmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmygosh! Are you okay?!\" Madison said to Kelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine...ugh, I'm going to look <i>great</i> with a bandage on my knee this weekend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi just starred at both of them, seemingly in a trance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What Cass, you've never seen a cut before?\" Kelly asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry guys, I have to go,\" Cassi responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's a blood thing?\" Madison told Kelly with a shrug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi raced back to the dorm, where she whipped out her smartphone, to check the markets. The Dow was was down 10 points with only 3 hours of trading left. Cassi felt reassured. Those two other things were just flukes, she told herself. There was no mythic janitor/wizard/karma lady, just her having a dream or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt dinner, Cassi grabbed a spot in the student union, and bought a sandwich and began studying. After around fifteen minutes, she looked up, and saw a graphic on the 6:00 PM news, \"Dow, Up: 68.0\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi sat there stunned, and could only think to herself, \"Well...crap.\"</span></div></div>",

Madison looked like a gym rat, and she was excited to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi on the other hand, was not. She got a larger shirt in an attempt to cover up the belly that she had recently gained. She also went out and bought a larger sports bra during lunch, since she didn't want her newfound bust to be all over the place. She also had some lose athletic shorts that she could wear to attempt to hide her flabbier legs, but it was still pretty obvious that she had gained some weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they got to the gym they started by running on the track, but it was clear that Cassi wasn't going to be able to do that consistently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey M, this isn't happening, let's try something else,\" said an exhausted  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassi, it's been like, 2 laps.

She didn't want her roommate to see her ashamed feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you understand M, I meant that <i>I</i> didn't like going to the gym with <i>you</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" asked a confused Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean I don't feel comfortable going to the gym when I look like a complete slob next to you. I don't like how all the guys look at you with lust in their eyes and then and look disgusted with me. I can see how easy this you run on the treadmill and when I can't keep up with you, I feel awful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassi...\" began Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just feel that it would be less difficult for me to go work out if you didn't join me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassi, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to humiliate or embarrass you in any way, but what do you expect me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison knew she didn't want to stop working out, but she didn't want to keep her friend from working out either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi replied, \"I'm not giving you an ultimatum here. If you want to keep working out, I'll try to as well, but if you stopped going with me I think I would be more willing to work out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison thought the both of them could work out together, but from what Cassi told her, she began having doubts. She thought Cassi would have been inspired by her rocking body to work out harder in the gym when they went together. Madison felt that she was too distracted by her own love of attention at the gym to notice how detrimental the effect was on her roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi kept trying to convince Madison, \"Maybe if you didn't go with me a couple of times, I can work on my confidence and we can work out together again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like a reasonable thought, but Madison was unsure. If she didn't work out with Cassi, it would be difficult to find a reasonable time to work out. She could try to work out at home, but she wouldn't be able to work off as many calories. She would have to try and watch her food intake if she was to keep her lean frame. If she was lucky, Cassi would be confident enough to want to work out with her in no time. However, helping Cassi lose weight might not be worth the risk of getting out of shape herself. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison, being the great friend that she was, decided she could live with skipping the gym for a few weeks. Plus, she reasoned, she was disciplined enough not to gain any weight, and if Cassi lost the weight, then they wouldn't have a fat girl in their group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first day that Cassi went to the gym alone, it was hard for Madison to sit that one out. She got anxious, just because it was part of her routine, it felt like she was missing an exam or something. Madison almost felt resentment towards Cassi because of this, who exited the room in her workout gear and headed to the gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison tried to do homework, but couldn't focus. Then she transitioned to watching TV, but she was still feeling jumpy. Finally she decided to just go out and walk around campus. She figured that being boxed up in the small dorm wasn't going to make her feel any better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she had some extra free time, she just generally explored campus, and went to parts of it that her normal routine did not take her past. She walked past the basketball arena, and suddenly got pumped for those games, saw the new student center that was still under construction, which would replace the old and outdated one that they were using now, and she saw some statues of famous Powers alumni. She also walked past a card table set up with some upperclassmen. She looked at the sign, \"Coooking club; Tired of just watching cable food shows in envy? This is the club for you.\" Madison was intrigued, like much of the country, she was all about celebrity chefs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, so what does your club do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, we meet once a week, and we learn 5 or 6 new recipes, then the next week, we make them and bring them back and have somewhat of a gourmet potluck, as contradictory as that sounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh cool, well, I guess I have a bit more free time now than I expected. Can I take your flyer and email you if I decide to come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison walked away with the flyer, it could be kind of fun, she thought, but at the same time it would run counter to her goal of not eating anything extra while at the gym. As she kept walking she saw the building for the student newspaper. Madison was intrigued by this because she had always known  she was a good writer. She walked in, where someone walking by and greeted her. It was Jim, the paper's chief student editor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, you look new, what can we do for ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I don't know, I just have always wanted to write a bit, and I thought I would come in and check this out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy didn't know what to say, they were not really taking new volunteer correspondents for a while, but at the same time, you could never use enough free labor, and she was pretty hot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....we\" he was thinking on his feet, and just said the first thing that came to mind while staring that the very well dressed Freshman, \"we do have an opening as a fashion columnist, but you'll need to submit a sample copy to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, yeah that would be great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just one other thing, we do two issues a week, so it may take up some of your free time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison knew that he was saying that to her as a dealbreaker, but in reality, this was perfect. She could work on a story at the paper, while Cassi was working out. Maybe the stars were aligning to help her bridge some time until Cassi was done working out!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison was quite excited to get started on the fashion column. She had always had a flair for style, and she enjoyed writing. Even though she didn't really plan on becoming a journalism major, she wanted to get some experience in writing. In the days leading up to her first deadline, Madison narrowed down her topic and got started. She decided to write on the evolution of fashion and the neo-80s design period that was currently overtaking American fashion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this was taking up a lot more of her free time than she had planned, but she was enjoying it, and it was an excuse for her to get out of the gym. Along with her studies and social life, she wasn't at a lack of things to do, but she was rather pleased to have gotten involved. At the very least it made for good networking. Madison spent the Tuesday before her Wednesday deadline editing her story, which she found to be pretty decent. She emailed it back to Jim, who upon receiving it, was shocked that a freshman writer could be so competent in both content and style. Maybe this freshman, who he only gave the assignment to because of her appearance, was actually going to work out fine. He ran the story, expecting ridicule for putting a relativity subjective piece in their paper, but response was good. Jim would usually keep his ears open around campus the day that the new issue of the paper dropped to see what people were saying. Much of the time, the deficiencies of a college newspaper were evident, and people would laugh about a glarring typo, or a stupid op-ed. However this week he didn't hear much of that. When he was around a group of hot girls in line at the dinning hall, he overheard them talking, about how spot on that new fashion column was. Later that day when he went to the gym, he saw a few girls reading the page with the column on it and casually nodding their heads. Maybe that new freshman had a nack for this kind of thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Jim invited Madison over to the paper's offices, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison, I have to say, that was a great column, I've heard a lot of good things about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?! That's great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was thinking. We have an opening, as our scene correspondent decided to quit and try other things, do you want to take that over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!! Jim, that would be great! Does it differ much from my current duties?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somewhat. You would be in charge of review restaurants and bar openings, I know you're not 21, but we can probably work things out, or you can just interview people who went to the places. Also, you can still write fashion stuff, since that fits in the scope of the title. The paper will pick up the cost whenever you review a new place, and you'll get a small weekly stipend for the time you put in, but it's not enough to be considered a part time job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis part didn't really hang up all that much on Madison, because her parents paid for most of her expenses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that sounds great, do I start next column?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison could not be more pleased, but this also meant that in addition to the lack of gym time, she would be eating more fattening meals while reviewing restaurants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was happening, Cassi was trying to get used to working out everyday. In high school, despite her going to a small rural school, she was still vain about keeping in shape, and now she was somewhat distressed about the state that her body was in, especially with her perfect looking roommate who she would be constantly compared to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first few days at the gym were rather rough. Each time she finished her workout and wondered how she could ever go on. She didn't exactly enjoy being the fat girl at the gym who looked awful while she struggled on the machines, her excess fat wobbling unattractively. However, by the end of the first week, the exercises became slightly easier. She also got used to cutting some foods out of her diet. It really was just getting used to the routine for her, and she hoped she could keep it up going forward.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cassi's determination to lose weight pays off. Within the next two weeks Cassi was able to run around the track and keep up with most of the women who worked out there, despite her more rounded shape. Speaking of her shape, Cassi was noticing her body shrink slowly. Her belly still stuck out a bit, but it was more of a pooch than a pot now. After her workouts she could feel how firm her stomach muscles were, underneath a layer of fat that slowly seemed less and less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter working out so hard, Cassi felt more tired than hungry and was able to keep her food intake to a minimum, but was always sure to eat properly so she had energy to work out the next day. At first, her stomach would grumble with such a reduced amount of food, but her determination to lose weight was fueled by her past rejection from Chris. She wanted to enjoy college, but eating recklessly and avoiding exercise was not fun enough to make up for being rejected by guys she wanted to date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter more than two weeks of exercising Cassi steps off the scale ten pounds lighter and confident that she can lose the rest of her added weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison walks into the apartment, full and sluggish after a heavy meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim didn't force Madison to eat the larger meals the restaurants featured, but Madison figured it would make for a better article and she got her money's worth from the paper. It didn't start that way, however; Madison first tried writing articles on skimpy salads and uninteresting diet-friendly sides, but these foods lacked flavor and inspiration for a good article. It was Jim's suggestion that she try the more \"flavorful\" options. Madison was concerned about how the food would affect her weight, but after several delicious meals without gaining weight, Madison decided to trust her metabolism to handle the extra food. Her trust extended so far as to stop weighing herself and focus on how the food should affect her writing, not her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Madison still wrote about fashion, but her combined writing would often keep her busy enough to stay up longer than she intended, shortening her rest and increasing her appetite. She started snacking on the late nights of writing and she found the food helped keep her energy levels up and better focused on the paper. She seemed too occupied with her writing assignments to notice how her behavior has slowly changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo weeks of this behavior and Madison's metabolism was showing signs that it was losing the fight against her new lifestyle: her muscle definition was replaced by smooth and soft skin, her energy levels seemed to drop, and yet her appetite seemed to only increase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any more chips?\" Madison asked Cassi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm sorry. I gave you my last bag\" Cassi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food that Cassi was starting to avoid, Madison started eating. She had gone through all the leftover snacks that Cassi had sworn off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison looked disappointed, \"Darn. I guess I'll have to start buying my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi noticed Madison's change of behavior, and that it started to have an effect. She thought to herself how she should react.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ok, well just watch out Madison, those are the snacks that made me put on a ton of weight,\" Cassi said in a concerned tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Madison said in a somewhat condescending and dismissive voice, \"I don't think we have to worry about that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi was somewhat hurt. She was just trying to help her friend avoid her early semester fate, and didn't really know where Madison was getting off on that. She wondered if Madison even knew that she looked a bit softer than Cassi had remembered. At this point, part of Cassi was telling herself to just ignore it and move on, since Madison was right, maybe she didn't have to worry about it--it was, after all, Madison who did her the favor of not going to the gym to help her overcome her issues. That was a huge favor done by Madison, and Cassi recognized that. At the same time, Cassi would not forget that comment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the week, Cassi kept up hard at the gym. She was really digging the workouts, and her steady weight loss didn't hurt. She noticed that everything was still firming up. Yes, her stomach still stuck out, but she figured she could get rid of it within a few months if this kept up. Another problem area, her butt, wasn't jiggling all over the place anymore, either, and she was no longer embarrassed to be wearing shorts, since she could feel her thighs firming up, even if they still were softer than she would have liked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi also noticed the increased male attention at the gym. When she first started, that day with Madison, she swore that she could hear snickering by a few of the people behind her on the treadmill. She never knew if she was just being self conscious, or if it really was directed at her. Either way, she was pleased with the progress she made, and she felt okay in her body for the first time in a while. Still a long way to go, but she no longer felt like the beached whale she believed herself to be at the start of her workout push. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cassi was running one day, she noticed, despite headphones that a guy next to her was somewhat checking her out--or at least she thought he was. She tried to steal a glance back. He was running a bit faster than she was and seemed to be in pretty good shape. Cassi thought that she recognized him from somewhere, but could not figure it out. After a while of what seemed to be mutual admiration, Cassi pulled out her earbuds, and told him through the heavy breathing of her running, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, (deep breath) if we're going to keep checking each other out, (breath) my name is Cassi.\" It was a bold move that she would not have previously made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, (breath) Jared. You've been coming here a lot lately.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you a creep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What (breath) no..I\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi cut him off, \"I'm (breath) screwing with you, Jared.\" Yes. Cassi was getting some mojo back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talked for a bit, and Cassi remembered how to be a flirt. After she finished her workout, she told him to keep in touch. As she was walking away...she remembered where she saw him. That was someone Madison had been casually hooking up with! Not serious, but Madison certainly did not mind the action. She knew Madison wasn't going to be possessive, since she was also just, \"playing the field\" but it felt good to have someone with high standards chat her up. When Cassi got back to the room she saw she had lost another 5 pounds during the week--and it felt great. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was rushed. She had been cramming for a test the night before and was working to beat a deadline. The night before she stayed up late and must have finished off a entire large bag of chips, and consumed two sugary energy drinks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped by the paper to pick up a stipend check and had run into Jim earlier, who asked her how the article was going,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost done, Jim, just some spot checking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good, hope to get it in a few hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Count on it,\" she yelled as she ran out the door. She was fudging some stuff...it wasn't spot checking, but some major components still had yet to be written. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison didn't have time to grab a meal at the dinning hall, so she ran to a fast food restaurant along the way back to the dorm. She looked at her options. She knew she should have gotten something small off the dollar menu, but she was really hungry. She ordered a 1/3rd pound burger, a large fries, and a diet coke. The diet coke was more habit than discipline at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, she finished the article with, \"Yes, buffets have taken a lot of abuse over the years, rightfully so, but the new City Buffet is trying to overcome that. It looks like an upscale Sushi bar, and the food quality rises above what we got used to when meeting our Grandparents for dinners. Be careful though, you're going to want to eat multiple plates, I know I did.\" Madison chuckled, she figured some self deprecation was always good, plus, she was hot, so she didn't really worry about the last line looking bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi got back from the library and noticed that Madison had fallen asleep in her desk chair with her laptop open. There was a bag of cheese puffs open next to her, and her shirt had crumbs on it. Her fingers looked a bit yellow from the cheese dust. At one time, Cassi would have tried to sneak some in, now she found the snack food increasingly repulsive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cassi looked at her friend, she also noticed something rather shocking, it looked like Madison was starting to get a bit of a belly. \"Maybe she does have to worry about that,\" Cassi smugly thought.</span></div></div>",

Her columns were very well reviewed, and it seemed to showcase a view that many students had regarding a wide variety of subjects. It was clear to many that Madison had a knack for this kind of writing. Madison was also considering being a journalism major because of this, and had been spending some time chatting with a few professors to see if she wanted to go down that path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe extra time that she was spending writing scene columns and going out to do reviews wasn't harming her studies. Madison still put in a lot of time at the library, or her dorm room desk, where she would slowly eat huge amounts of snack food while she cruised through coursework. However, this left very little time for her to workout. As the next few weeks went by, Madison didn't make it to the gym once. During this time she was eating out a lot, and grabbing fast food to go in order to save time. She wanted to be healthy, but what was the alternative to her current schedule? She just didn't have time to workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi, on the other hand, was still working out and lost another 5 pounds over a three week period. She was fitting back into clothes she had sworn off at the beginning of the year, although still tightly. Getting back into shape felt great, and she was happy that she no longer considered herself fat. She still could be considered chubby, but guys were talking to her again, and some of her sharp facial features were becoming more noticeable again as her double chin started to recede. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison on the other hand, was going to the opposite direction. One morning when she was getting ready for class, she noticed that her jeans had become extremely tight. She had to suck in rather hard and work to get them to close. She was starting to get a paunch, and her love handles seemed like they had gone from non-existent to a real concern for her. The softening of her body was continuing. \"Hmm...I'm going to need to do something about this, I wouldn't want to turn into Cassi,\" thought Madison.</span></div></div>",

Glancing about Madison wondered if anyone else noticed how tight everything was on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison normally didn't have to worry about these things. She was used to having a toned body and a high metabolism that kept her trim, however, an increased food intake coupled with a lack of exercise has softened the freshman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have a small mocha frappuccino.\" Madison asked the barista at the college cafe. Despite somewhat admitting to herself that she was slightly larger, she didn't think she needed to make changes to her diet just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barista handed Madison a 20oz. version of the order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't what I ordered.\" Madison said with a confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barista looked at her with a friendly smile, \"We're out of all the smaller cups right now, so we've upgraded you for free!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison didn't complain. With her lower metabolism came a lack of energy that made it difficult to stay awake during class, so she had been relying on caffeine to keep herself awake. She first tried plain coffee but didn't like the taste and had started drinking the extra sugary and creamy versions of the drink promising herself that she will eventually be able to drink her coffee without any flavorings, sugars, or creams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison started with frappuccinos weeks ago and hasn't changed the order since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Madison was able to drink her frappuccino within the first class so she wouldn't have to carry it around or worry about the drink getting cold. As class was going on Madison was too distracted between the lecture and trying to think about how quickly she might need to finish her drink that she didn't notice her stomach sticking out a little farther from her jeans than it normally did. As she drank more of the drink, her stomach pressed harder against her jeans and Madison could feel the jeans straining. She thought for a moment to undo the button to get rid of the pinching the jeans were doing to her stomach, but dismissed it as a silly idea for chunkier girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sudden relief came anyway, and before anyone could say anything about the random projectile, Madison left the class quite embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Madison gets back to the apartment she starts to wonder if she's going to turn into a chubby girl. She hurriedly checked the rest of her jeans. They all felt just as tight as the now button-free pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even though she stopped working out in an attempt to get Cassi to feel comfortable enough to lose weight, Madison wasn't having a similar come to Jesus moment for herself that she had already had with Cassi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Madison was still busy, but she was also masking that she had grown to enjoy some tasty new foods that she never used to eat before. Additionally, going to the gym seemed much more challenging, and she often felt sluggish. In her mind, once she fell into a better routine and could carve some time out, she would eventually go back to working out and drop this weight rather quickly. This line of thinking was helping her ignore that she was slowly allowing her lifestyle to change, and her self control was lapsing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison approached Cassi and asked her about it,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Cassi, do you have any of the jeans you bought a few weeks into the school year?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I haven't worn them in weeks, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been overdoing myself a bit this week, and I could use something else to lounge around in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yeah, check my closet, I should have some size 6s.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was pleased, yes, she wasn't excited about moving up from her size 4 norm, but she figured if she just borrowed a few pairs, it would keep her from having to buy new jeans and accept her fate. In reality, it was just enabling her not to work out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi looked at her friend. Madison was still in much better shape, but it looked like the gap was narrowing, as Madison continued her descent into softness, and Cassi continued to go hard at the gym. She looked back at her roommate while she was digging through the closet. Her shirt rode up a bit when she reached for things, and it showed how her belly was becoming soft, to the point that it stuck out and was noticeable in most shirts. Madison's legs also looked softer, and her butt looked like it was expanding, if she wasn't careful, she was going to get a ghetto booty. Additionally her arms looked a bit softer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison wasn't even chubby yet, but her softening was something that Cassi was surprised by. She didn't want her roommate to gain weight, but she had already tried to warn her, what else could she do? Cassi was still barely able to squeeze into size 8s, but the trend lines were pointed in different directions. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison's lifestyle change was quickly changing her body. She chose tastier, more caloric foods and avoided spending time exercising in order to save time for her writing and studies. The calories added up and with Madison spending most of her day either sitting or lounging there wasn't any activity doing her any favors fighting off the excess intake. If she had tried to exercise, she would have found herself out of breath and giving up within minutes. If she had tried to eat normally, her stomach would have grumbled in contempt. Her body was getting used to eating lots of food and relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi's lifestyle was changing her body in the opposite direction. A strict diet and consistent vigorous exercise gave the blonde a great figure. Cassi wasn't as trim as she was the beginning of the school year, but she was in better physical shape than when she started. Despite a slight softness that was still on her, her energy and aura gave off the sense that she was indeed a dedicated gym member. Going to the gym felt natural to Cassi now, and with the physical results and increasing attention from men, it definitely didn't hurt her incentives to go. Cassi felt like she understood why Madison was always so dedicated to her gym routine before. Cassi had asked Madison to go to the gym with her a few times, but Madison was always too busy studying or writing articles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo weeks of working out and watching her diet and Cassi lost another five pounds. The size 8's that were tight a few weeks ago were now a bit loose. Cassi noticed this after leaving the gym and wondered if she could try on one of the size 6's she loaned Madison.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo weeks of sitting and eating and Cassi's old jeans started feeling tight on Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must have shrunk these last time I washed them.\" Madison thought to herself in her continued denial of her gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure one of the other pairs will fit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison went through and tried all of the jeans Cassi lent her. None of them fit right. One even felt significantly tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The whole load must have gone bad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison grabbed a pair of her own size 4 jeans. These she hasn't touched in the last few weeks and the dryer couldn't have affected them. She paused for a moment thinking about the ramifications that these jeans would have if they didn't feel the same as they did the last time she wore them. If they felt like Cassi's size 6's, then she would be justified in her accusations against the laundry system. If they felt a lot tighter, or worse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison pulled her pair of size 4's up her meatier thighs which fought against the jeans in a way Madison never knew before. She had to do an awkward little dance to shuffle the jeans up her legs. The jeans then encountered a foe they could not overtake, Madison's fleshy ample butt. It was pretty clear that Madison's posterior had grown quite softer and expanded out a bit in the last couple of weeks. Despite Madison's continued struggling, the jeans were entrenched a third of the way up Madison's bubbly bottom, and showed no sign of being able to go further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was during this moment with the awkward pinching of the jeans and the softness of Madison's butt protruding over and fighting against her attempts to pull up the jeans that Cassi walks in and sees the embarrassing scene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Her butt was spilling over her jeans, and from the angle she was at, it was clear that her roommate must have gained somewhere close to thirty pounds. Madison's body had become so soft that Cassi had probably passed her up. Madison's toned legs and thighs were quickly becoming thunder thighs and her hips were widening as well. Her belly was prominent, and her boobs were growing at a similar pace, even her arms had grown softer and she had a bit of a double chin coming in. Madison had clearly become chubby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, hi Madison, having trouble with the Jeans?\" Cassi asked in an innocent manner, heck, she knew how crappy it felt to gain weight. She didn't want her roommate to get fat after Madison was the one who urged her to lose weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...yeah...I guess I may have to start working out more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, do you mind if I take a couple of the size 6s?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Madison was still in a state of denial. If they were too tight for her, she thought, Cassi wasn't going to fit into them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've been working out and my 'fat' jeans were getting a bit loose and I wanted to see if I could go down a size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they're on my bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi walked over and tried them on. Madison was very interested to see if they would fit, but tried to look like she wasn't paying attention. Sure enough, the jeans went up Cassi's slimmed down body and she was able to button them up without much effort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, they fit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison didn't know what to say. Those jeans were becoming way to tight on her. When she tried them on, Madison could feel her love handles spilling out over, and they looked at this point that they were tailored for Cassi! \"Oh crap. My fat roommate is in better shape than me,\" thought Madison, \"this cannot be happening.\" Madison wondered how this had happened. Without saying anything to Cassi, she went into the bathroom and examined herself. She felt sick as she looked over her body, her butt had become huge and was a shell of its former self. She wondered how she had let her body get like this. What would her friends back home say if they could see this? Heck, if she got any larger, would guys even show interest in her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to finally weigh herself, the scale settled on 160 pounds. \"NO NO NO NO NO,\" Madison screamed, \"how could I let this happen to me?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For time being, Madison could not think of where she would get time to work out, with her ambitious class load and assignments for the student newspaper. She decided that her best bet was to try to eat healthier in her reviews for the student paper. Her upcoming review was for a new Italian restaurant that was coming opening downtown, surely, there had to be healthy options there, Madison thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got to the restaurant she brought her legal pad, as normal, to jot down notes about the restaurant. It looked fairly normal to her, at the bottom of an office building, and mainly filled with office workers who were enjoying a happy hour or quick bite to eat after work. Madison was wearing what was formerly her loosest skirt, but which was now tight, and she felt somewhat under dressed, and a bit cold, given the transition to autumn was nearly complete. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started with a salad, <i>Well, this can't be that bad for me</i> she thought while ordering it, but was quickly proven incorrect, as it came drenched in italian dressing. <i>Does anyone care about portion control anymore? What's the point of all this dressing</i> the former thin girl thought. However, it was not enough for Madison to stop from eating the whole salad, which she would later note in her column as delicious, if not a bit filling for pre-meal fare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, her main dish arrived. She had ordered grilled chicken in an attempt to cut down, however, she had neglected to read that it came in a rich alfredo sauce and was mixed into noodles, which turned it into a calorie laden dish. <i>Oh, you've got to be kidding me</i> Madison thought as she saw it arrive at her plate, but like the salad, it was suburb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her column, she needed to try a desert, so she ordered chocolate cake, thinking she could have a small bite and take the rest home, which she actually stuck to, mainly because of her fullness from the salad and large entree. However, it was only two hours later when Madison got hungry while studying that she opened her to go box back up and ate the remainder of the fattening cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, throughout the week Cassi was pushing herself at the gym. She was very pleased to be back in her size 6s, a sign that she was back on the right track, however, she knew she was still around 5 away pounds from her original weight when she came to Powers, and wanted to get back to that symbolically pleasing number. She was somewhat eager to let Madison know, given Madison's previous condescension, about her achievement. When she got off the treadmill after her Friday workout, she saw Chris, who had previously rejected her due to her size, coming by to say hi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Cassi, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much Chris, how's it going?\" Cassi said, while thinking, <i>Oh sure, now you want to talk</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some upper classmen are having a party off campus, want to come with me?\" He asked, looking slightly nervous about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is he asking me out? Why would I do that, after he made it clear he didn't want me when I was larger....then again...he's hot, and cool...and...</i> \"Yeah! where is?!\" Cassi responded. She figured this was just how things worked. It was not his fault for being shallow, it was her fault for not being in shape. Plus, she reasoned, <i>\"it's not like I'm obligated to marry him, I'll just go out and have a good time.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll text you the address, oh, and umm, I guess you can invite Madison as well, I have not seen her out much recently.\" Chris noted. </span></div></div>",

Through the door her roommate called, informing her that she was leaving to do some shopping. As Madison heard the main door close she breathed a sigh of relief. At least for now her new insight was confined o herself alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she made her way to the bedroom, still not acknowledging the extent of her recent eating, instead rationalizing that her metabolism must have slowed down.  She felt she looked like a blimp, but also had a gnawing hunger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on with me? What am I going to do,\" she wondered as the phone rang.  It was Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girl,\" he greeted her. \"Great column today.  You are really some writer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks,\" she replied flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you sound a bit down - would you mind some male attention?\" he offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yeah right, like you or anyone wants to be seen with the Hindenberg,\" </i> she thought, but before she could reply her tummy rumbled, and Jim heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, what about I pick you up for a bite,\" he invited.  Madison liked Jim, and this was the first time he'd invited her anywhere and she obviously was hungry. .  Maybe this wasn\u2019t the time for her to be worrying about a diet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well, maybe - but you need to know I have had a little wardrobe malfunction. My clothes may be a bit tight.\" She responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not an issue - you can deal with the laundry later. I'll be there in ten minutes.\u201d Jim replied and hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison in a panic raided Cassie\u2019s closet, finding some size eight slacks and a top she hoped would fit.  Thankfully they did.  She resolved to go out with Jim, eat  lightly and go on a diet beginning the next day.  But when Jim arrived he had other ideas.\u201dHey beautiful, you look great \u2013 just perfect for where I was planning to take you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is that?\u201d Madison replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u201dA new Mediterranean place I the mall \u2013 they have great lamb shanks and ecven do baklava.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of healthful mid-eastern cuisine appealed to Madison, who thought it couldn\u2019t possibly be that caloric. The two had a great evening, including several baklava pieces, and as they got near home she thanked him for taking a miserable fat girl out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFat?\u201d replied Jim?  \u201cNow listen, I guess maybe you\u2019ve gained a little and are now fussing about it. But no way am I dating you as a fat girl or from sympathy. I like you, including your figure, as a person. Don\u2019t sell yourself short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJim, my metabolism has changed\u201d Madison complained.\u201d. I\u2019m bigger than Cassie if you haven\u2019t noticed. This outfit is actually hers from before she lost weight these past few months,  I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to lose what I\u2019ve gained.\u201d\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm \u2013 I see why you are feeling out of sorts.\u201d Jim answered. \u201dCan I suggest that you get some clothes of your own? If your metabolism really has shifted you could indeed be exactly who you are, Cassie or no Cassie. But with your own wardrobe that won\u2019t matter. You can just stay where your body wants to be. All I ask is that afterwards you let me date you some more, because I think you look great!  Really!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Madison got home Cassie was waiting, and happy for Jim\u2019s having taken her roommate to dinner as well as his counsel. She promised to help Madison shop for new clothes.  Thus assured Madison began to relax, even giving in to the temptation to finish off a pint of ice cream in the refrigerator before retiring.  Gone was her resolve to bring her increasing weight into check. Cassie took note of this and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Jim made a point of catching Madison after her last morning class and accompanying her to the campus cafeteria where he added a piece of apple pie to her burger combo for lunch. Madison love it, thinking \u201cI guess he must like chubby chicks.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her fat and extra flab and been replaced by a toned body, she had only sporadically weighed herself, but she now was in as good of shape as she had been going into this year, a true transformation after she had gained all the weight from the beginning of the year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie was also surprised by her roommate's change of heart on her diet, she didn't know why, but suddenly, Madison didn't seem to be all that concerned about her weight anymore. Madison would bring back huge meals to the dorm, and just start pigging out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim wasn't used to this kind of sensation. He never figured himself to be anything other than a normal college senior, hooking up with anything that was available, but Madison's gain fascinated him. At first it was just a bit of a stomach that caught his eye on the college freshman, that he assumed was some overeating, but then he realized that it was persistently there. He didn't really know how to approach the subject of her weight, he figured, if he said any more than her did a few weeks ago, she would get creeped out, so he just let Madison continue into her new habits without commenting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne evening after a movie, Jim noticed that Madison had moved towards the window of the dorm to overlook campus. It was a typical move, since the dorms at Powers had a nice view of both downtown and the campus mall, but he thought Madison look gorgeous from behind. He moved in towards her and pushed his body up against her's. He felt her butt which seemed softer than usual, and he couldn't help himself, so he moved his hands up against her front, which she happily obliged. Jim noticed that her belly felt soft, and he enjoyed feeling the bloat of her stomach after a large meal and sitting down for two hours. Madison slowly turned around, and they progressed into bed for the evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was confused. She had forever held her beauty to be tied to her physical appearance, and yet she found a guy who was all about her despite the gain. Was it possible that he was into her being larger? Or was he just being polite. Either way, she did not have time to work out and felt self conscious whenever Cassi came back from her daily workout. The gym rat now had a toned body, and Madison was jealous of the days when she rivaled her, but she didn't have the will to attempt any kind of diet plan, and she questioned whether Jim would even want that. </span></div></div>",

It didn't take long for him to formulate a hypothesis. If Madison got even curvier, sex would be even better than it is now. While Madison was doing a good job of piling on the pounds on her own, Jim wanted to accelerate the situation and find out if a significant amount of weight would make a difference. He didn't want to reveal his plan to Madison. While she has been in a better mood about her weight, she didn't want to get any bigger. Jim had to be clever to make this work. His goal: 10 pounds<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out to be much easier to trick Madison into eating more than he would have thought. When they went to dinner at the dining hall, Jim always managed to add deserts to his plate that he just \"couldn't finish\" and encouraged Madison to finish. At night, Jim would stop by with beer and sweets. The appeal of free alcohol to a freshman was too hard to turn down. After a few drinks, Madison was aching to relieve her beer munchies. Jim also approached Cassi to help encourage Madison to eat extra snacks and the occasional fourth meal. Cassi wasn't all that hesitant to help. Making Madison slightly less attractive to other boys meant more attention for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all these added calories to an already calorie laden diet, Madison put on the pounds rather quickly. In just a little over a month, Madison had put on 13 pounds. It was a little over Jim's goal, but he didn't actually know how much she put on. Getting Madison to weigh herself would be tragic to the experiment, so he could only guestimate that she had packed on around 10 pounds. It certainly showed. Madison was really turning into a true pear shape. All the new pounds went straight to her lower half. Her thighs strained her jeans. The stress was so strong that holes were starting to appear everywhere. The jeans did their best to contain her ass, though when she sat down there was a clear shot of her panties. Her hips widened giving her a more exotic curve to her. Jim didn't hesitate to take her to bed.</span></div></div>",

Well, OK, he couldn\u2019t make up his mind which it was, but he knew that her gaining excited him while also eliminating the competition. But he didn\u2019t like Cassi\u2019s increasingly superior attitude towards his girl friend and mentioned this to his friend Tom. He didn\u2019t know that Tom and Cassi had helped start Madison\u2019s gain and that Tom had come to regret having involved Cassi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm,\u201d replied Tom, \u201cmaybe the exercise girl needs to regain a bit and come down off her pedestal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a girl having a few extra pounds \u2013 Madison\u2019s taught me that,\u201d replied Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, should we double date a bit and make Cassi feel she has to join in to be a part?\u201d asked Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim nodded. \u201cSounds like an idea. Do you want to ask Cassi yourself or shall I have Madison do it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet it come from Madison and tell her why. Then we can all work together on Cassi\u201d answered Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening at the DQ sharing a Blizzard and burger Jim discussed Cassi\u2019s comments, which were also bugging Madison. She agreed to go along with the scheme. After the initial date Tom began interfering with Cassie\u2019s workout schedule with invitations, nearly always involving food.  Within a month Cassie wasn\u2019t working out and was starting to re-gain \u2013 in part because Madison was sharing her calorie bombs.  But all three of her classmates kept complimenting her and Cassi  didn\u2019t notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of this, of course, curbed Madison\u2019s own overeating and gaining. But since Cassie was re-gaining she added weight faster. Within two months Cassi had picked up 10 pounds and was wearing her size six outfits again. Madison meanwhile was pushing 180 and wearing tight size tens, with her cheeks becoming ever fuller as she developed a slight second chin. This helped Cassie rationalize her own situation as not being so serious and she ignored the scale along with her workouts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effort was successful. As Madison pushed past 180 her re-plumpened roommate said nary a word, and Tom fund he was liking the change more every week.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No one said anything to her directly, but people talked, and many people wondered how someone could let themselves go like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, Madison walked past Chris, who a few months ago snubbed Cassi over her weight and started this series of events. He thought Madison was hot back when they were both working out together in the gym, but she suddenly stopped coming after the conversation they had about Cassi that one day. Now, he was shocked to see how much she had gained. She nearly looked like a different person. He was completely turned off at this, and was happy that she never took him up on his offer to call her a while back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly, who lived next to them on the floor, was also critical of Madison's body, but never said anything to her. She also noticed that Cassi wasn't at the gym all that much, either these days. After her classes, she often ran into Cassi on her way back to the dorm, and today she noticed that Cassi seemed to have a bit of padding on her stomach again. She wanted to say something to Cassi, and remind her of how crappy she felt when she was larger, but instead she declined, she didn't mind being a bitch and talking trash about something behind their back, like she was doing about Madison, but she really didn't want the awkwardness of confrontation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Kelly, her boyfriend, Mike, had noticed Madison's gain as well, and it was driving him crazy. He really liked Kelly, but for some reason, seeing this former babe pile on weight intrigued him. He felt conflicted about the entire situation in multiple ways. First, socially, it felt easier to date Kelly as is, since she was thin and hot, he was fitting into social norms, friends had actually given him kudos over her appearance, that would surly stop if she gained weight. Second, this was just something that went over her because of Madison, so maybe the feelings would disperse, and he wouldn't want to try to put some weight on his girlfriend if he was just going to have a change of heart. Besides, he reasoned, there is no way Kelly would ever let that happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was already pretty well known across campus from her partying through the first few weeks and her column on fashion/scene around Powers/ect, but as she gained weight, it was almost flipping the perception of her. When she was thin and hot, it seemed like an extension  of her personality, and many people gave her legitimacy over what she was reviewing. Now, when people saw this tubby girl walk by them in sweats, they tended to dismiss her columns as the ramblings of a fat girl. If anything, they were starting to become a joke. The restaurant reviewer who is getting fat, it wasn't exactly a narrative that Madison wanted to float around, but one that everyone thought while reading her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of the attention that it was attracting, Madison was still active in trying to get Cassi to gain a bit more weight and it was working, however, her clothes were increasingly tight as well, something that she was not thrilled about. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison was having a great time with Jim, enjoying the food and managing to be in denial of her own gain as Cassi continued to blossom along with her relationship with Tom. Madison made sure there were plenty of tempting snacks for Cassi and also began making breakfast. After three months she dismissed Cassis concerns about, her weight re-gain of probably fifteen pounds (Cassi hadn\u2019t dared get on the scale) as \"something neither of our guys seem to mind, so why not enjoy life? After all its the holiday season.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to mollify Cassi, who really didn\u2019t mind being bigger and was still smaller than Madison. But the snide ongoing carping of their neighbor Kelly still annoyed her. It was also bothering Kelly's boyfriend Mike, who decided to talk ih Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and Tom are two lucky guys, man, I hope you know that,\" he opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean\"\" responded Jim with some little suspicion, especially with the tie-in with Tom. Only Madison and Tom were in on \u201cOperation Cassi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou both have girls who aren\u2019t obsessed with being skinny,\u201d Mike said. \u201cKelly\u2019s a nice person but I can\u2019t even share a dessert with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim thought of the ice cream in Madison\u2019s refrigerator, the frozen pies in the freezer and boxes of cookies and other goodies stashed throughout the apartment.  The times they\u2019d enjoyed ordering in pizza, going to fast food joints and sharing lunch between classes also poured through his heads. It was truly a different world from Kelly\u2019s.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cIs Mike envious? Or wanting help</i>?\u201d thought Jim. <i> \u201cHow I going to handle this?.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, its called fatophobia \u2013 fear of being fat. It can lead to anorexia understand,\u201d he ventured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how do you cure it?\u201d queried Mike. \u201cBoth Madison and Cassie used to emphasize being thin but things are different now.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but neither of them were like Kelli. All they needed was some acceptance and caring and then their appetites took over. People like Kelly won\u2019t admit to having one \u2013 thy think it\u2019s a weakness to enjoy eating,\u201d  Jim pontificated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo its hopeless,\u201d said Mike dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot necessarily \u2013 but you can\u2019t change it. She has to change herself \u2013 maybe gain five pounds and not let it scare her, then let go a little more. Is there anything she does like?\u201d asked Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe loves Mexican food but she won\u2019t go near a restaurant that serves it,\u201d replied Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Hmmm \u2013 maybe Madison and Cassi could have a party with Mexican-style food but Kerlli wouldn\u2019t know it until she got there. Then you could encourage her to relax and enjoy \u201cjust this once.\u201d What do you think?\u2019 offered Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison of course was part Hispanic and an excellent cook of burritos and Mexican food, which Jim well knew. She too knew and was weary of Kelly\u2019s taunts of Cassi and was easily recruited into hosting the small gathering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected Kelly was both surprised and conflicted when Mike brought her into the apartment with mariachi music playing and a pi\u00f1ata suspended from the ceiling. Luscious aromas from a buffet of Mexican style dishes filled the air.  Kelly immediately clenched her teeth as her conscience screamed \u201cnooooo \u2013 this is a den of iniquity.\u201d But then she felt Mike grabbing her hand and praising the food.  She didn\u2019t want to offend him and she therefore gave herself permission to stay, vowing just not to have much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy any normal standard she kept her promise, but what she consumed was for her at least double her normal level. Then Madison gave Mike a large carton of \u201cleftovers.\u201d for Kelly.  She was spe4echless, especially since Mike was so gracious in accepting for her. He and Madison had correctly deduced tat part of her would indeed want more of what she had enjoyed that night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening was just the beginning, Kelly of course could not resist devouring the leftovers the next day and in courtesy had to share with Madison how good they were, But the experience turned on a small switch.  Two days later Kelly picked up a grande burrito at Taco Bell  It was to be the first of many, but not as good as Madison\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike followed Jim\u2019s pattern at college, frequently having lunch with Kelli, never pushing food on her. Instead he would ask if she\u2019d tried the lasagna or ricotta or other calories-laden dish, then share his with her. Inevitably she loved it. The next day he would buy her a full plate of her own. Kelly, confident of her metabolism and ability to exercise off a few extra calories, allowed her boy friend to treat her. But despite her intentions she managed to start developing a softer belly ion her 120 pound frame which she chose to ignore.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was committing other dietary indiscretions as well, enough that she didn\u2019t criticize others quite as much, to Cassi\u2019s great relief and Mike\u2019s pleasure. After two months he invited her to the Acapulco restaurant for dinner and she accepted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the school year melted into Spring Cassi noted the slight change in her nemesis Kelli, who even with a slight pudge was stiil forty pounds less than than Madison\u2019s re-gaining friend. Madison\u2019s Mexican culinary skill had done its job, but Cassi thought she needed to move things along a bit urther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelli\u2019s roommate was Ginger, a short, quiet chubette who Madison early in the school year had noticed was packing pounds onto her already wide hips and thighs. Madison then had took pleasure in nowing that she would \u201cnever let herelf go like that.\u201d  Now, with her appetite, she easily outweighed Ginger, who was just naturally heavier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelli in the early months had had to bite her tongue over what she regarded as Gingers \u201cobvious\u201d lack of self control, although she never saw her actually overeating. In fact, she was quite skilled with vegetable dishes and could prepare unique and delicious salads. But Ginger wasn\u2019t that calorie conscious \u2013 she was always willing to share with Cassi and Madison whatever they ordered in, she just didn\u2019t do iut herself because she could cook better. This openness was what Cassi determined to capitalize on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne Thursday evening when Madison wasn\u2019t in Cassi deliberately ordered a 2/1 pizza with chicken wings and invited Ginger over. They enjoyed the first pie, then Cassi gave her the second plus the remaining wings to take home \u201cfor you and Kelli.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe already sated Ginger (both she and Cassi had devoured four pieces and several wings) took the second pie and surplus wings home. She then left a note on the refrigerator telling Kelli that they were \u201cextras\u201d for her to share. She was pleasantly surprised to see that the next morning three of the eight pieces and a wing were missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder how far I can take this,\u201d she pondered, little knowing that Mike\u2019s efforts had already increased her roommate\u2019s stomach capacity and that Kelli was in blissful denial that she\u2019d gained anything major.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Ginger took two slices of pizza and half the remaining wings for herself, leaving the rest for Kelli. She anticipated that Kelli would be too busy or lazy to make something else for herself.  Sure enough they disappeared by the next morning.  Thus encouraged  Ginger broke out the bag of chocolate chip cookies in her bedroom and left it in the kitchen where she knew there was ice cream in the freezer. Normally Kelli wouldn\u2019t touch ice cream, but with the temping luscious cookies she capitulated, thinking \u201ccome on, just this once can\u2019t hurt much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two weeks of this Ginger was at Cassi and Madison\u2019s and related what had been going on.  Madison looked at Cassi and said \u201cCan it be that Kelli the perfect is beginning to act normally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not have a party and include her and Mike,\u201d Cassi suggested.  Ginger and Madison readily agreed \u2013 deciding to make it a dinner where each of them would cook something. Ginger focused on meatloaf and potatoes, Cassi did a casserole and Madison settled on a mouthwatering Frangelico pumpkin Pie with Mascarpone cheese topped with hazel nuts. They decided to have Mike invite Kelli and assign her a Waldorf salad to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelli initially wasn\u2019t excited about the idea. Her size four slacks were getting tighter and she thought she might have gained 7-8 pounds (actually it was twelve). But with her improved appetite and relationship with Mike she agreed to go. As it turned out Ginger was the one who \u201chelped\u201d prepare most of the salad because Kelli truly wasn\u2019t that talented in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party went well, and while Kelli didn\u2019t eat quite as much as her friends it was a lot for her. She saw the obvious bond between Cassi and tom as well as Jim and Madison. Ginger\u2019s date was an occasional escort named Lyle who didn\u2019t seem to mind anyone\u2019s size either and it set Kelli to thinking about her and Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho am I starving myself for,\u201d she thought that night. \u201cI\u2019ll never be as big as them, but they are actually decent and nice. I\u2019ve really been a bitch at times. Its time to stop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that epiphany Kelli unknowingly stepped across the threshold into the unofficial club of campus chubbies \u2013 although it would be months before she gained enough for this to be apparent and even more before she acknowledged that she was truly comfortable with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Cassi\u2019s weight climbed toward 170 and Madison was edging towards 200. Ginger had no care about her size \u2013 she came from a larger family and expected it as her destiny. She was nearly Cassi\u2019s size but focused in the lower half of her body. Kelli no longer cared. These were her friends, and she accepted them as they accepted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison, however had another acceptance issue \u2013 her family. She had dodged the bullet of going home during Xmas break but summer as coming. She knew she had to tell them in advance that she\u2019d gained \u201cover fifty\u201d pounds (65 to be precise) and had a boy friend who loved her, but didn\u2019t know how they would take it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He figured that it was because her Mom had been vain and thin her entire life, and had worked out hard for it. Madison's Mom never had to struggle with any work life balance, since she had always been a stay at home Mom while Madison's Dad was off doing business, and thus had ample time to workout while raising her daughters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that this trip was going to be hell for Madison, all of her friends at home had not seen her up to this point, and even girls who were not very cool in high school that Madison had been nice to were going to relish in seeing the former hottie turn into a fat girl in the course of a year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was just starting to rebuild her confidence after losing her figure, and now she was going to have to deal with all the awkwardness of seeing everyone in her current size. Plus, in an area like Southern Florida, it was not like she was going to be able to cover up a lot. Even Jim suspected that it was going to be humiliating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile online, he compared the two figures of Madison, her current form and the old thin version. Madison used to be a total knockout, and now, her legs had become close to thunder thighs, and shook whenever she walked anywhere. Her butt plumped up, and was starting to wobble, he would love to see that in a bikini bottom. Her belly was persistently sticking out and formed a spare tire, and she had back fat, and Madison's larger but less perky boobs accompanied arms that had become noticeably soft. Even her face was melting into the fat and looking softer by the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few options facing Jim. He could let Madison go home, and watch from afar, keeping in touch with madison via internet chat and texting. However, he assumed that Madison would face a lot of humiliation from all her skinny former friends, which would be bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, there was the option of going down with Madison. Even though her Mom wasn't thrilled about the weight, both her parents were still excited to hear that Madison had a boyfriend and even offered to fly him down for the first portion of break. Madison and him were both lukewarm on the idea, since they didn't really want to rush into meeting the parents, but if he went down, maybe he could even shake things up a bit. ''Madison's Mom is always so uptight,'' thought Jim, ''what if he caused her to gain a few pounds, maybe she would finally focus on herself and lay off her stressed out daughter.'' Jim thought of the ways he could do this. Maybe he could find a substence that would slow down her metabolism, or make her lazy, or maybe he could get her to show him the city during the week while she normally would work out. Either way, Jim suddenly liked the idea of joining Madison for a month of the Summer. </span></div></div>",

If they don\u2019t, when its time for me to return to school you can come with me.  That\u2019s going to be their call.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! You\u2019d do that for me.  Jim, I think I love you more than all the food in the world,\u201d melted Madison<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim smiled. A week later he and Madison were enjoying a fiesta at his parents place is Muskogee. As predicted she was welcomed warmly and was the focus of friendly attention. Meanwhile Madison did nothing to address concerns in her family that their daughter might be thinking of dropping out of college to marry her beau, although nothing she or  Jim had said directly even inferred that. They didn\u2019t have to, as a conversation in Florida illustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want this Jim person checked out,\u201d demanded her mother, still fuming and upset. \u201cFirst she informs me she\u2019s become a whale, then she tells me she needs to take a side trip to visit the family of someone she\u2019s bringing here. I can only imagine what a loser he must be!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI already have been checking,\u201c responded hers Father. \u201dBut actually he\u2019s not a loser.  He has a high GPA, a year to go to graduation, a clean record and his family has ample funds so he doesn\u2019t have any student loans. Every indication is that he fully intends to graduate and has a role in the family business if he wants it. But I have confirmed that everyone at Powers considers their relationship serious. I think we need to treat he and Madison with respect \u2013 and by that I mean lay off the weight remarks. I\u2019m told that she\u2019s not only fat girl in her dorm and that this Jim and his buddies don\u2019t mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother shook her head, grieving over her daughter and thinking dark thoughts about this Jim person. No man who wanted a fat girl could be normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim would actually have understood her despair. He was committed to fat Madison and came from a background of heavier people, bit still their relationship was not something he would have predicted.  But first he, then Tom and Mark had all fallen for larger girls and now it seemed perfectly right to him. It was just too bad that they couldn\u2019t do with Madison\u2019s Mom what they had done with Kelli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the short time available he had tried to prep Madison. His mom and aunt, both women of size,  had helped her select a well fitting wardrobe. As to eating, they had agreed to be as moderate as possible so as to deflect criticism.  Madison expected her Father to be less critical and Jim expected that to work in their favor.  Still, mom was a force in her own right and Jim knew Madison was facing a test of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had done the math. For months Madison had been habitually consuming around 4000 calories a day. Now, virtually overnight, she was going to try cutting back to less than hlf that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan she do it,\u201d Jim wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the time they stepped off the plane her mother started in, obviously shocked at her daughter\u2019s change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh my baby, what\u2019s happened to you?  How did this happen,\u201d she cried touching Madison\u2019s  belly and glaring at Jim, whom she obviously thought was somehow responsible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim greeted Madison\u2019s father with a handshake while courteously nodding towards but not speaking directly to his wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMadison writes one of the best columns on the campus paper,. \u201c he volunteered. \u201cNearly all the students read it. As one of the editors that\u2019s where we became acquainted and I\u2019m glad to now get to meet her family.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re going into the newspaper business,\u201d answered Madison\u2019s father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot likely, \u201c responded Jim. \u201cthe information industry is going all social media now and my family has other interests.  But reporting and writing are in my blood, so I\u2019ll likely do some on the side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his interviewing skills Jim diverted attention onto Madison\u2019s father, effectively leaving her mother by the conversational wayside as all four made their way to the baggage turnstile.<br>\r\nMsadison was pulled towards he food court but steeled her will instead.  Se began to realize that it wasn\u2019t going to be easy cutting back to 2000 calories a day.  Already she was hungry and they weren\u2019t out of the airport.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the car on the way back home, Jim was getting increasingly irritated at by the comments that Madison's Mom was making about her weight, and wanted to say something, but decided not to. Even if Madison's Mom was being a pain about this, it did him no benefit to do anything which would cause her any resentment towards him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they drove back to Madison's house, Jim was shocked at how nice the neighborhood was. His family never struggled for money, and he knew Madison was well off, but holy cow, her family was more wealthy than he had assumed. They pulled up to the house, which looked to be worth a few million dollars and jumped out of the car. The house was a an older house from the 1920s and had aged gracefully with great updates through the year. As they walked through the large entrance, Madison's older sister Alexa came running to great them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maddie!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'HEEYYY\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you had work?!\" It was still the mid to late afternoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psshhhh, I can take an evening off for my sister coming home from her first semester of college!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a pretty typical sister interaction. They hugged it out for a second, and Jim noticed how even when Madison was thin she still had some curves, Alexa stood in contrast to this. Maybe it was the trendy form fitting clothing, but Alexa was really thin. If she was thrown off by Madison's weight, she wasn't saying anything. \"Hmm, maybe the coldness doesn't run in the family,\" thought Jim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that afternoon, Madison's Dad caught Jim in the hallway away from Madison, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jim, want to retreat to the back deck and have a beer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim was wondering if this was some sort of trap, but her Dad seemed genuine,  \"sure, why not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they sat down in the expensive outdoor furniture, Jim noticed that Madison's backyard was as well groomed as the front. With the heat that he was unaccustomed to beating down on him, Jim was happy to have the cool drink. They talked for a while, and it was not shakedown he thought he was getting, but instead, Madison's Dad seemed rather friendly, and just appeared to like talking to people. After a while, they got around to dinner plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That reminds me, I haven't booked a reservation anywhere for tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim saw an opening, \"You know, Mr. Kraft (despite him already telling Jim to call him Chris), I'm a pretty good cook, how about we grill some steaks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you know that would hit the spot...plus I would be able to see if Madison was being truthful when she talked up your cooking abilities,\" joked Madison's Dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, Jim started cooking on the steak, but tried to marinate it in as much fatty olive oil as possible. Then, while he created some servings of mashed potatoes, he also dumped a ton of butter into the mix, possibly doubling the caloric numbers. \"Maybe if Madison's Mom feels even the smallest gain, she'll lay off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt dinner, the family raved about Jim's cooking skill,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jim, how did you learn to cook like this,\" asked Alexa, while she ate some fried apples, something she didn't have much in Southern Florida.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you know, I guess you just pick it up here and there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Madison's Mom looked to be indulging. </span></div></div>",

Both raved about the food, which even Mrs. Kraft had to quietly admit was enjoyable. If this was a ample of what Madison had been exposed to it was obvious why she\u2019d ballooned so much in a single year.  Despite her opinion even she enjoyed the mal, eating perhaps a third more than she normally permitted herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaddie,\u201d Alexa queried, \u201cis this the kind of cooking you\u2019re getting at school?  Its divine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHardly,\u201d replied Madison. \u201cJim\u2019s a genius but the dining hall is just a commissary with no creativity. That\u2019s why the girls in our dormitory cook a lot of their own stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMadison makes a mean breakfast burrito \u2013 and her crepes and quiche are great too,\u201d said Jim. Mrs. Kraft, who seldom cooked anything besides minimal survival rations due to her own stressful job, glowered but held her peace. Chris and Alexa, however, were intrigued <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a chef now?\u201d Me. Kraft asked his daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI used to cook meals for the family because Mom seldom had the time when I was living at home \u2013 you know that,\u201d Madison replied. \u201cIts nothing that new. I\u2019ve just expanded the menu\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember you doing crepes, though,\u201d said Alexa. \u201cDo you mind doing some for us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlexa,\u201d admonished her mother, \u201cDo you want to go down the same road as Madison? Look at what that kind of eating has done to her in just a year,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, I\u2019m nearly a stick and can\u2019t gain an ounce for trying. You may find that great but frankly I wish I had enough padding to have some curves. Its  just not possible for me to get over 115 even when I\u2019ve tried. I sort of envy Madison a bit,\u201d Alexa announced.  Her mom reacted with bewilderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell. The question is, Madison is on vacation. Does she want to do crepes and do we have the ingredients,\u201d queried Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Coral Gables has stores where we can get everything required,\u201d replied Madison. \u201cWith Jim\u2019s help I think we can give you a breakfast you\u2019ll remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim immediately began spieling off a menu. \u201cWhat about galettes? They\u2019re a crepe which began in Brittany. They\u2019re made with buckwheat flower and honey for the crepe plus blackberry jam and scrambled eggs for the filling. They\u2019re gluten free so they\u2019re actually health food- but very tasty. The French even have a special day, February 2, in their honor.. They go great with duxelles on raisin toast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuxelles?\u201d asked Mr. Kraft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a French paste spread, sort of like jam, for toast, made from chopped mushrooms, shallots and butter. Don\u2019t knock it till you\u2019ve tried it. I think you\u2019ll find it, well, different but delicious,\u201d answered Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have me drooling already and I\u2019ve just had a big supper,\u201d said Alexa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad, we\u2019ll be happy to do it.  In fact, if you like we\u2019ll be happy to try preparing other things later in the week,\u201d Madison offered, \u201cbut before we take off I think Alexa and I need to do the dishes for Mom and Jim.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the two sisters got to work, Mrs. Kraft eyeing Madison\u2019s wide frame and ting it was nearly double that of her sibling. Was she the only one bothered by the transformation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they departed Mrs Kraft wasn\u2019t happy with either her older daughter or her husband. \u201cI hope you\u2019re happy \u2013 you just let the family hippo take over the kitchen. What is the point of me cooking low calorie meals all the time if you can let a pair like that just come in and take over?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts hardly a takeover, dear. It will only be a few weeks and they\u2019re obviously content with being who they are. Why not relax and enjoy,\u201d replied her husband,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd honestly, mother, do you think we could possibly gain very much in that short of a time? I hope I could but its not going to happen,\u201d Alexa sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,: huffed Mrs Kraft, \u201cwith this whole family against me I guess I\u2019ll just have to keep my mouth shut. But if your clothes don\u2019t fit in four weeks don\u2019t say you weren\u2019t warned.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her protestations Mrs. Kraft\u2019s behavior contrasted to her words. The next morning, when served three crepes along with everyone else, she polished off every bit. This fact was not lost on Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim and Madison didn\u2019t just buy food for a French style breakfast. They procured supplies for a week of breakfasts and supper as well.  Madison struggled to keep her own appetite undr control but was happy to see her family more eager to see what was coming next than to be making comments on her bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris and Alexa noted a side effect of the gourmet dishes.  Meals n the Kraft household had traditionally been \u201cgobble and go\u201d according to everyone\u2019s schedule. Now there was a specific serving time with everyone together. As a result there was more conversation, at least between Jim and Chris and Alexa and Madison.  Mrs. Kraft felt lke an outsider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim picked up on Mrs. Kraft\u2019s isolation and noticed something unusual. She was actually indulging in some comfort eating to compensate. How, he wondered, could he capitalize on this?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wondered if there was an opening for some kind of gain that would finally shut her up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne afternoon, Jim noticed that Madison's Mom was snacking on some ice cream. He thought was was odd as she seemed usually pretty health conscious, so he asked Madison about it, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So I saw your Mom eating some ice cream, I thought she would find that kind of thing unhealthy?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh yeah, that's her weakness. Whenever she is slightly stressed, she'll buy a small serving of ice cream, but that's pretty rare, because she knows that she will eat any of it that is in the house.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim decided to capitalize on this. When he and Madison were at the grocery store, he bought a tub of really nice chocolate ice cream and put that in the freezer, hoping that Madison's Mom would cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meals continued to come in large portions, and Alexa didn't seem to mind. She wasn't around much during the day because she had her career to worry about, being a mid-20s something professional, but she often tried to get to their house by dinner time so she could see her sister. Jim liked Alexa and her easy going attitude, and it was clear that she was one of the reasons that Madison was okay coming home. He couldn't imagine how hard it would have been if Alexa was being as harsh on Madison as her Mom had been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison's Dad was enjoying having the whole family around. He looked forward to coming home from work and meeting everyone for dinner. So often it seemed like he would come home to an empty house with Madison at school, Alexa downtown, and Jen at some kind of community event. He liked the contrast that eating dinner with this family offered. It was nice to be able to talk with people after work about non work related things, as opposed to his normal routine of getting home and maybe doing some yardwork, and then just sitting on the couch, surfing market websites for interesting news. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, Jim noticed that Alexa seemed to have a little bulge on her stomach. He wondered if he was just seeing things, or if this was actually the bi-product of eating fattening meals the entire week. In another encouraging sign, it seemed like every time he walked into a common space in the house, Madison's Mom was doing something like reading her tablet and eating ice cream, or doing a cross-word and eating ice cream, or watching tv and eating ice cream, but the common theme was there. Madison was not wrong about her Mom having a weakness of the fattening dessert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Madison assumed that Rachel had not been aware of her drastic change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison knew that her friends would probably not react very kindly to her showing up and flowing all over her swimsuit with her new, larger body. First thing however, was finding a swimsuit that fit. Madison's bikini's from her thin days were long past the point of fitting, and she knew that she needed to find something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to drive to the mall near her house and start trying things on. This wasn't the most fun experience ever, as Madison had to deal with looking at her bloated body in the mirror while trying on suits. It was a come to Jesus moment for just how large she had got. Her legs looked large and soft regardless of what bottom she was putting on, and she had to deal with back boobs no matter what type of top she was trying to fit her enlarged boobs into. Then there was the bikini issue. In her skinny days, she would have criticized anyone of her current size who was trying to put their large body into a bikini, no one needed to see all the jiggling flesh, was her reasoning. Now, she wondered, if she got a one piece, or even something with a swim skirt, she would look like an old prude. However, if she wore the bikini, she would have the inevitable criticism of her friends for letting her larger belly hang out. </span></div></div>",

Rachel, yelled out \"Madison!,\" in her voice drenched with nasal-fry and ran around the side of the pool arms outstretched to give her now fat friend a hug, her perfectly taut and toned beach bod did not jiggle one bit, save for a teasing shake in her squat-formed rear, auburn hair wet and clingy with pool-water. She was morbidly curious to get a feel of Madison's bulky body, as it was a bit concealed under her t-shirt-like slip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was even worse than she had thought. Through her hug reconnaissance, Rachel gathered a more full understanding of the state of her friend's physique. It would seem that most of Madison's weight had settled in a hefty beer gut, in close competition to win against her ample bust in a horizontal race. Her thighs were chunky now and she had lost \"the gap,\" that girls of their age found so necessary in a woman's body. Even her feet seemed a little fatter. Her hair was cut shorter than it had usually been in high school, but it was still pretty, so thick and black and lustrous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel had always been secretly envious of Madison's fantastic raven mane, that in tandem with a perfect body and smile, had always given her an edge over Rachel with the high school guys, but that didn't matter anymore, because she was a fat girl inside.

And I wouldn\u2019t criticize \u2013 I\u2019ve seen you into the ice cream as well \u2013 don\u2019t deny it,\u201d retorted Alexa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yes, I guess I have. And you know exactly why,\u201d her mother acknowledged. \u201cIts that boy friend of Madison\u2019s. He bought the ice cream and you all know that when I get stressed its my weakness. And having a fat daughter is stressful.  I hope you don\u2019t wind up joining her. Can you believe how huge she\u2019s gotten?\u201d Mrs. Kraft obsessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBigger than the average Kraft, to be sure. At least in this generation. But you know how big your grandparents were a century ago \u2013 you\u2019ve lectured us on that enough. Its her life and you should be happy its not booze or drugs or running off with some loser, mom.\u201c responded Alexa as she finished off the last of the chips. \u201cJim\u2019s a nce guy and sees her as a queen. Now, would you like me to get some ice cream for you as well and then we can watch the Patridge Family on ME-TV together?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I-I \u2013well, alright, stammered  Mrs Kraft, who hardly knew what to say. \u201cI guess I need something for all this stress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa went to the kitchen and disposed of the tortilla chip bag and guacamole container, returning with two quadruple scoop bowls of ice cream. The bowls and program were both about \u00be gone when Madison arrived home with the package containing her new swimsuit.  Alexa saw her go upstairs to her room. She followed after the program was over and the empty bowls were taken to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShopping sis? Alexa inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Rachel has invited me to a pool party. I got a one piece and am ready to face the firing squad or see if I still have any friends,\u201d sighed Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean\u201d queried Alexa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSis, you\u2019ve been a jewel of acceptance, not even mentioning how big I\u2019ve gotten. But Rachel was a skinny as me in high school and looks the same on Facebook. Now I\u2019m a full fledged BBW and she and the others may roast me like a pig,\u201d responded Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa smiled. \u201cYou have a pleasant surprise coming I think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeaning what?\u201d asked Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s put it this way,\u201d replied Alexa, \u201cRachel and you are in the same Club. Those pictures on Facebook are from last summer and fall. Since Thanksgiving she\u2019s gained at least the thirty pounds I wish I had \u2013 she\u2019s at least 160 now and has a boy friend like Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d mused Madison. \u201cSo I\u2019m not about to make as big splash as I feared?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, not hardly,\u201c answered Alexa. \u201cRachel was afraid you\u2019d be the one criticizing her until I told her you\u2019d acquired an appetite and boy friend. Before that you weren\u2019t even going to be invited to the party. Linda and Carol are a bit plumper too, but you and Rachel lead the pack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the sisters were sorting things out upstairs in Alexa\u2019s bedroom Mrs. Kraft had retired to her bedroom/study, still feeling alienated both by Madison\u2019s size and Alexa\u2019s declared ambition to be larger. Jim arrived to prepare a lasagna supper and noticed the empty bowls and discarded ice cream container. On a whim he called Mr Kraft and asked that he pick up some vanilla ice cream to go with a special dessert, not mentioning that he was making apple crisp,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening was another calorie laden feast, with Alexa taking the lead in having seconds to her mother\u2019s silent distress.  Madison announced her new swimsuit purchase and Jim noted that Mr. Kraft, who had done as requested, didn\u2019t seem to share his wife\u2019s emotions. Finally Jim noted that all five family members, himself included, enjoyed dessert.  Alexa wondered how her sister would look in her new swimsuit that weekend.  Mrs. Kraft went to bed not knowing what to think but fearful of looking at a scale herself after consuming a second dessert before bed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was Saturday morning of the third week, the same day as the scheduled pool party.  As he had done the previous two weeks Jim had pre-prepaerd a breakfast casserole to be served with meat (in this case turkey bacon)  and chopped melon pieces.  This casserole featured a  praline topping on 20 slices of a 16 oz loaf of French bread drenched in a mixture of 8 large eggs, 2 cups half-and-half 1 cup milk granulated sugar vanilla extract ground cinnamon and ground nutmeg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe initial serving was three slices apiece, leaving five extras.  Alexa took two of them while Madison initially abstained, a fact noted by both her parents and Jim.  Jim looked around and took one of the three remaining pieces, followed by Chris. Jim knew that Madison probably wanted the remaining extra slice and so offered it to Mrs. Kraft, who refused. Then he offered it to Madison, who said \u201cwell I guess its better than throwing it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dHey,\u201d remarked Alexa, \u201cits all good \u2013 but the Louisiana style caramelized French toast was up there too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe baked sourdough bread with blueberries was pretty good as well, at least in my opinion,\u201d said Chris, \u201cbut I think we need to all thank Jim for his efforts. These meals take a lot of work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d acknowledged Madison.  \u201cAnd now Alexa and I need to be going. We\u2019re due at Rachel\u2019s in an hour for the pool party..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alexa and Madison disappeared Jim said, \u201cwell, I guess I need to clean up and then go surf the Internet,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so fast,\u201d blurted Mrs Kraft. \u201cI think its time we answered some questions.  Chris, I expect you to listen to this and support me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, OK. Am I in trouble? asked Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to know just how you persuaded our daughter to get so fat and heavy. I find it horrendous frankly.\u201d blazed Mrs Kraft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim was taken aback but thought fast. \u201cMrs. Kraft,have you ever had any training as a journalist? Because I know you write reports, so you know what research is all about. And frankly I think you\u2019re scrambling yourr facts. Can I explain why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was taken by surprise and didn\u2019t want to go against his wife, but he didn\u2019t really concur, so he was happy to see the young man keep his cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead,\u201d he said while his wife glared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know your husband has had people scoping me out. So he can check his sources and verify that I didn\u2019t make Madison fat. That happened before our relationship even started. She partied and ate, got involved in a relationship, packed on more pounds, got dumped, tried losing with a roommate with the same issue in an effort that didn\u2019t work \u2013 all before I even dated her once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a senior, was a Junior, she was a freshman. Normally the classes ravel in different circles. But as an editor of the school paper I oversaw her columns. When her quality started to slip and her grades were <br>\r\nthreatened I  needed to find out why. Then we hit it off and life got better for both of us. But she was already over 160 by that time \u2013 which I think you would call already fat, agreed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s more than that now certainly,\u201d countered Mrs Kraft<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. But by her choice, which admittedly I for some reason don\u2019t mind. But have you seen me forcing food on herr? No. the fact is that her whole dormitory is bigger than average. And the girls there have guys who like the corn-fed Midwestern style, which happens to include my family and I admit it. But I haven\u2019t \u201cmade\u201d her anything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCooking food like you have here is certainly not low calorie,\u201d responded Mrs. Kraft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue. But I don\u2019t get to cook like this at Powers. I don\u2019t have the time. Nor does Madison. I haven\u2019t seen you. Alexa or Chris hating it. But if you want  I can stop and let you take over,\u201d volunteered Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow just a minute,\u201d interjected Chris \u201cFour weeks of gourmet cooking is something we\u2019ve all  enjoyed. I just said earlier hat you deserved a word of thanks. I will check out what you\u2019ve said, but I personally believe you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI appreciate that Mr. Kraft.\u201d replied Jim as he stood up. \u201cNow, I\u2019ll get the kitchen cleaned up,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jim left the room Chris said to his wife \u201cdear, we need to remember that we\u2019re talking to our possible son in law. Don\u2019t be hasty in judging him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mrs. Kraft stormed off to her room, secretly desiring to demolish a quart of ice cream because of the stress. But she refrained because she knew Jim would see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Madison had arrived at Rachel\u2019s and was greeted by a rotund ball of energy who had to weigh over 180. It took Madison a moment to confirm it was her high school chum, nearly as filled out as herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMadison, I\u2019m glad you could make it. I see we\u2019ve both been enjoying life and you look great!\u201d gushed Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, yeah, I guess Facebook doesn\u2019t always tell everything. I thought you were still a waif like I used to be.\u201d responded Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot anymore. I met a great guy, then got involved with the size acceptance movement when I saw how the establishment is trying to micromanage people\u2019s lives.  It made me push to gain weight just to spite them.  Some of our people from high school are part of the movement too,\u201d announced Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMovement?\u201d said Madison? \u201cI\u2019ve just been eating a lot \u2013 not trying to prove anything..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s your choice \u2013 but yes, we\u2019re out to demolish anti-fat bias.  I\u2019m surprised Alexa didn\u2019t tell you.\u201d Rachel chattered as she led Madison and her sister into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa said quietly to Madison \u201cI wanted to tell you but I couldn\u2019t risk Mom learning about this before you did. I also didn\u2019t know Jim\u2019s feelings. I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts cool. I\u2019ll just play it by ear and we\u2019ll talk later,\u201d replied Madison.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rachel escorted Madison and Alexa onto the patio. Two beefy girls were lounging comfortably soaking up the sun\u2019s rays. Madison took a second glance and quickly realized they were Linda Dowling and Sharon Calkins, two classmates from high school but now each at least forty pounds heavier.  Both had a supply of snacks and wore two piece undersize bikinis that did nothing to disguise their bulging bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Madi,\u201d called out Sharon, \u201cchange into your swimsuit, get some refreshments. You too, Alexa\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking great,\u201d Linda commented, dipping her chubby hand into a bag of pretzels. \u201cit looks like we\u2019ve both been enjoying college!\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah. I hope I\u2019m not out of place \u2013 I brought a one piece rather than a bikini\u201d Madison replied. She had feared criticism because of her new poundage but all three girls were obviously on the same path as her,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo big deal. It takes time to adjust to a new body size, so just do what\u2019s comfortable for you\u201d replied Rachel. \u201cWhen you\u2019re ready to wear a size 18 bikini you\u2019ll get one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey actually have such things? \u201cqueried Madison. Jim had inferred as much but she had just figured he was talking to make her feel good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. Look up Gabi Gregg bikini on the Internet. She has two piece bikinis up to size 24,\u201d stated Sharon with a chocolate donut in her hand,  \u201calthough I\u2019m wearing a 14.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison observed that Sharon\u2019s belly was struggling to stay inside the lower half of the bikini and thought to herself \u201c<i>you really need a 16 \u2013 or maybe 18.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa accompanied Madison into the house so that they could change,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, when you said I would be surprised you weren\u2019t kidding!  What gives?\u201d Madison inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike you, they found more happiness in food than in phony baloney fashion,\u201d  replied Alexis. \u201cMom doesn\u2019t understand but I do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison resolved to learn more and soon returned to the patio, She and Alexa bathed in the sun for about a hour before Rachel announced it was lunch time \u2013 comprised of chicken, macaroni and cheese, hamburgers and similar items. Madison had two burgers, 3 pieces of chicken and a generous serving of macaroni and cheese, comparable to Rachel, Sharon and Linda. Alexa tried to follow suit but couldn\u2019t maintain the pace, having only one burger and two pieces of chicken with her macaroni and cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon smiled. \u201cPoor Alexa, you try so hard, but apparently you just aren\u2019t meant to be a big girl. But we respect and love you anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa bowed her head.  \u201cThanks, but I\u2019ll have you know I have picked up five pounds. Even my mom has noticed. So maybe someday \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison interrupted. \u201cWait a minute Sharon. You sound ilke you\u2019ve gained weight by trying. What happened? I remember that in high school you were afraid of a cookie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue,\u201d Sharon acknowledged. \u201cI wasn\u2019t anorexic but I was trying to please others and hating always feeling hungry and deprived. But then I got a sedentary office job with a lot of snack foods around. I gained 15 pounds in four months and found that I liked it, so I kept on eating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s telling it like it is,\u201d Linda remarked. \u201cI had more of a roller coaster until Rachel got our little foodie group going and growing, but like Sharon I now enjoy my size. It drives the skinnie minnies on campus wild that I\u2019m confident and get dates at 175 pounds. There\u2019s an eroticism to letting my belly strain aginst too tight shorts, but I know I need to wear a looser wardrobe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison had already noted that Linda\u2019s clothes seemed too small \u2013 now she knew why and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd so now you know our little secret \u2013 three fat girls against the prejudices of the world. When Alexis told me about you and your mom and your fat dorm mates I knew we needed to meet,\u201d Rachel declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo what end?\u201d asked Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNetworking,\u201d replied Rachel. \u201cWith Facebook and Twitter messages distances don\u2019t matter like they once did.  Fat people can work together, sharing and encouraging.  I hope you\u2019ll do just that. We already have contacts on about twenty campuses.  Think it over \u2013 meanwhile I suggest we all get into the pool and have fun. \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so they did.  Madison knew she had much to share with Jim.  But what about her mom \u2013 and her sister?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wondered what the extent of the movement was, or if it was just some people chatting online. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we should find out more about it,\" Jim urged Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening Madison called Rachel back up to see if she could informally join. When they met up that evening Rachel told them there was one thing she had to do for entry. Every member of the club had to create change before they could join. Rachel informed Madison that they had formula that could alter one's metabolism and slowly shut it down completely. Rachel continued to explain, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the person will keep their attitude about fat, but their body will change, almost regardless of what they try.

I don\u2019t want any part of drugging my Mom!\u201d exclaimed Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim smile, \u201cI agree.

I\u2019m proud of you sweetheart!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweetheart\u201d said Madison with a start.  \u201cThat\u2019s not something you\u2019ve called me before!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but I\u2019ve been thinking it and it just kind of popped out because I loved what you decided. I wonder why Rachel is so angry over this?  It makes no sense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and another thing. What about Alexa. How far is my sister mixed up in all this?  I think we need to get her in here!: declared Madison.  She spun out of the room and went looking for her sister, who she found on the veranda next to the pool, lounging in a chair sunning with a bowl of ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey, Alexa, what\u2019s with the ice cream?  Its not even lunch time,\u201d queried Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRachel says if I eat between meals it might help me defeat my metabolism,\u201d replied Alexa. \u201cI\u2019m in a rebellious mood against Mom\u2019s fatophobe tyranny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell so am I. But before you ally yourself with Rachel here\u2019s something Jim and I know that you don\u2019t. Will you finish that snack and follow me?\u201d demanded Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa gobbled the last few bites and heaved herself out of the lounge chair. . Compared to her corpulent younger sister she still appeared quite thin.<br>\r\nBut Madison returned to Jim with Akexa in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, hold on,\u201d exclaimed Jim before Madison could start. \u201cThis is a family matter and I\u2019m just a guest. Do I even belong in this discussion?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want a witness\u201d Madison said with determination. \u201cAlexa, did you know that Rachel and her friends have a potion or something to make fatophobes gain weight and they want me to use it on mom as a condition of joining their little group?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, no, I just thought they were a fat support group. They never talked to me about that kind of thing,\u201d Alexa stammered.  Jim and Madison looked at her body language and believed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I want no part of it and Jim agrees.

We\u2019re already the enemy in her eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I agree. I don\u2019t think Dad has the same attitude,\u201d Alexa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, you might be right.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jim was thinking fast as he talked with Madison and Alexa. \u201cOK, now I\u2019ve noticed your dad, Chris, seems to especially like my fish dishes, so here is what I propose for dinner tomorrow night. I can get some pecans, crush and mix them with flour, then baste them with egg whites onto trout for a crust and add a sauce made up of oranges and rosemary.  Combined with green beans and rice it should taste really great.  Then when I get ready to serve dessert your mom will probably leave like always and we\u2019ll have Chris to ourselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison and Alexa were already salivating at the description, Alexa wondering what the dessert would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds great,\u201d said Madison. \u201cbut what do we say to Dad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll break the ice \u2013 just try not to cut me down, OK,\u201d offered Jim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright\u201d the girls agreed. Alexa once again observed her younger sister\u2019s billowing belly roll surging out from beneath her rib case into her lap, the back fat on her rib cage also noticeable. The new flesh on her face, puffing her cheeks and forming a double chin completed the picture. She could see what her mother did but due to her own frustrations Alexa had more envy than criticism.  Madison for her part seemed to be either unaware or didn\u2019t care about her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the next night Madison came to dinner in a comfortably contoured tie-waist dress with a pattern which emphasized her bodice and hips while distracting from her stomach.  The impact was stunning.  Alexa was much more informal, wearing tight pants and a top that did nothing to conceal her minor pudginess.  Jim smiled as he realized they were both baiting their mom in different ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe served the meal, explaining that the sauce, in addition to orange and rosemary had shallots, two types of wine, parsley, lemon juice and whipping cream. This drew a compliment from Chris and a cold stare from Madison\u2019s mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a great meal, Jim,\u201d acknowledged Alxa. \u201cCan I ask if there is dessert?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d replied Jim. \u201cwe have a pecial kind of pound cake with a lemon glaze all over the top and soaked into the cake itself. It originated in Germany and is called Zitronenkuchen. And we have cherry vanilla ice cream to go with it for those wanting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that Madison\u2019s mom arose, declaring, \u201cI don\u2019t have any need for such things, thank you. Please excuse me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she left, obviously not in agreement with the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm \u2013 I guess that means more for the rest of us,\u201d mused Alexa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlexa, that is selfish. Can\u2019t you be a little more understanding of your mom\u2019s feelings?\u201d said her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI try daddy, but she makes it impossible sometimes.\u201d answered his daughter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dIf I may suggest that we have our desserts and get the table cleared, then perhaps there is something we all need to discuss.\u201d offered Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d agreed Chris.\u201dI personally am rather curious about this unique pound cake \u2013 nitronuken I think you called it?.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZitronenkuchen,\u201d corrected Jim<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim served the cake, giving Chris one small scoop of ie ream while he and the girls each had two large ones. Chris silently noted the difference and took note of the symbolism.  When everyone was finished Jim began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChris, I\u2019ve just met you a few weeks ago and what I\u2019m about to may seem presumptuous. But I see a major collision coming no matter what I say or do. I think you know what I\u2019m talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d sighed Chris, \u201cI think maybe I do,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am committed to standing by Madison, and Alexa as well. They\u2019re both adults, as are you and I.  That means we accept another\u2019s choices unless its something illegal or immediately life threatening. We shouldn\u2019t try to control one another because in the long run t seldom works. Do you agree with that in principal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, of course. I think I\u2019ve always supported my daughters,\u201c stated Chris somewhat defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, you have so far as I know. But your wife has her feelings about weight, which for herself is fine and her business. But she\u2019s puhing Madison and Alexa away by trying to transfer those feelings onto them when they don\u2019t want it.  The question is, why does she feel so strongly and what can we do about it, if anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris sighed and hung his head. \u201cI\u2018ve lived with her nearly thirty years and although I can answer the first part of the question I don\u2019t know what to do about the second.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo on,\u201d encouraged Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHer mother\u2019s husband left them when she was four and her mother taught her that it was because she\u2019d gained too much weight. That probably wasn\u2019t the whole story but it created a fear of being unacceptable if she were to be heavier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShallow jackass. Grandma was better off without him if that\u2019s true,\u201d exclaimed Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s your view,\u201d acknowledged Jim, \u201cand I certainly agree. But its not what your mom can see.  She feels a need to protect her chicks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven though we\u2019re grown up?\u201d Alexa interjected. \u201cShe does need to let go. I wouldn\u2019t ever want to be as large as Madison but I envy her \u2018cause I can\u2019t gain much no matter what. I\u2019m sick of being a flat chested beanpole!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd as an adopted child you don\u2019t have my genes so you probably never will be bigger like me. But I love an respect you anyway,\u201d answered Madison.  \u201cBut mom shares genes with grandma and me so if I get fat she\u2019s fearful she might as well and lose dad. Am I getting close to something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so, said Jim,. \u201cNow, what can we do about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think Dad needs to talk to mom an just lay it all out,\u201d declared Alexa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t work, replied Madison. \u201cpeople dance to their own scripts \u2013 even if you convince them to make statements against their will to end an argument they\u2019re of the same opinion still. The change has to one of mind and heart. The real issue is her not wanting to let us loose to live our own lives. I know I\u2019m pushing 200 pounds, but that\u2019s my business, not hers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim and Alexa were both startled. That statement was the first Madison had openly acknowledged to either of them that she actually knew how big she had become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps if I told her we want to talk with her as a group?\u201d suggested Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat might be a good start \u2013 I\u2019m sure she feels isolated and not in control right now,\u201d replied Jim quietly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He knew what was happening for he\u2019d heard it before over the years, but he knew he needed to let it play out, so he bided his time  The refrigerator door opened, a dish rattled.  Then the refrigerator door opened and closed again. Still he waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about five minutes he went into the kitchen, catching his stressed out wife devouring a huge bowl of the ice cream she\u2019d rejected an hour earlier.  Chris  got a bowl, went to the refrigerator and took out the ice cream, scooping out a generous serving for himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMind if I join you?\u201d he asked as he returned the now nearly empty container to the freezer,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMight as well, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing it for stress relief like me,\u201d<br>\r\nanswered his wife. \u201cDo you realize how much pigging out I\u2019ve been doing? If I don\u2019t watch it I might start becoming a whale myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhales are an endangered species. Maybe that wouldn\u2019t be all bad,\u201d quipped Mr Kraft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChris, can\u2019t you take this seriously? We have one daughter as big as a house,  another who wants to be and you\u2019re making jokes?\u201d cried Mrs Kraft<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am taking it seriously, more than you know. But do you realize that not everyone sees things the same way? There might be another viewpoint than yours \u2013 or mine? Madison and Alexis are adults now. How do you think they see things?\u201d Chris countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see being overweight as a guaranteed key to rejection and probably health issues. But some women find being bigger erotic, enjoyable and a way of attracting certain kinds of men. Since they\u2019re adults can\u2019t we grant them the  freedom to find their own way? Who are we to be trying tp control them? I don\u2019t think I have that right and I\u2019m their father. What about you?\u201d he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice platitudes \u2013 but be honest. If I weighed forty pounds more wouldn\u2019t you be out the door in two minutes? Maybe not because I\u2019d have a paid off house \u2013 but otherwise I bet you\u2019d be gone, gone, gone,\u201d she shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually no, my dear. We do and enjoy many things together, I don\u2019t want anyone else and except for when we focus on weight I think we\u2019ve had a good marriage even if you won\u2019t let me take you out to dinner as often as I\u2019d like.  Even if you gained a hundred pounds I wouldn\u2019t leave you over it.  Can you believe that?\u201d Chris declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious?\u201d she gasped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow many happily married men with fatter wives do we know?  Its very possible \u2013 not that I\u2019m saying I want you to try doing it. I\u2019m just saying our marriage isn\u2019t defined by your figure. Can you accept that?  And the girls feel they have a right to define themselves. They\u2019ve told me so and wish you could accept and be happy with that.\u201dMr Kraft stated <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure they feel that way with that Jim as the pied piper of calorieville. He even has me eating more than I usually do. He\u2019s the reason Madison\u2019s gotten so fat, I\u2019m sure of it \u2013even if she claim she got bigger before meeting him,\u201d retorted Mrs. Kraft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s helped add to damage already done, but the question is, are such matters our business or the girls? I think you at least need to talk with them instead of storming about raising your blood pressure every time they take  a bite. Maddy will be gone in a week but we\u2019ll still have Alexa and, you\u2019re right she\u2019s trying to emulate her sister a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut why? I just don\u2019t understand it. The idea of liking to be fat contradicts everything I\u2019ve been taught!\u201d Cecelia replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a question you need to ask her.\u201d Mr Kraft responded. \u201cWhen they get home will you do it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we be eating ice cream while we do,\u201d Cecelia Kraft asked. \u201cYou know it helps me when I\u2019m under stress.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try getting some before they return,\u201d her husband replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes later in the theatre Jim received a text message from Chris:<i> \u201cMrs. Kraft willing to talk. Am at market laying in supply of ice cream for all. Please advise as to arrival time.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim showed the text message to the two Kraft sisters, each of who was contentedly munching on popcorn and sodas. Then he replied<i> \u201cMovie about 1/3 through. Estimate arrival in ninety minutes\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the three young adults returned to the Kraft home Mr. Kraft already had five ice cream bowls out and was filling them. A somewhat dejected Cecilia Kraft sat at the table.  When everyone was seated Mr Kraft began<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a family meeting which also involves Jim who is our house guest.  I\u2019ve had a talk with Cecilia and she understands Madison\u2019s concerns about being allowed to make her own decisions as an adult. I\u2019ve also told her Alexis has a view and that that she should be willing to listen to what others have to say, even if she doesn\u2019t agree. She has agreed to listen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, Madison said. \u201cI didn\u2019t start out to upset you or get fat on purpose.  But you know how you are about ice cream \u2013 well in college I guess I had the same thing about food in general. It started out with trying to be in and be popular. I had successful column in the school paper and got invited to a lot of parties. I hit it off with a guy and then when I gained a few pounds he dropped me. I think you know why I felt I couldn\u2019t share that with you. But that\u2019s when the comfort eating started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext it was my roommate. We tried out for a sorority and that turned into a mess. She was bigger than me and we tried to exercise, then I let up to make her feel better and, honestly, also because I was feeling a need for food to be happy. Well, we went home to her place for a weekend and I found fat people for who it was normal and we both decided to chuck our diets.  I didn\u2019t even know Jim to speak of then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy then I\u2019d gained probably 25 pounds and was ashamed to let you know so I didn\u2019t come home for the holidays. Jim helped me out of the depression I\u2019d sunk into and helped me deal with some critics. I stopped gaining so fast but still added a few each month. But by Spring I was happy and found that I liked both my body and my life. Then we visited Jim\u2019s family and found that they were like my roommate \u2013 very supportive of my being myself. I just have no desire to be different just to help you fight your issues, and for that I\u2019m sorry. But I want to be me \u2013 is that so unreasonable?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlexa?\u201d said her Father<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom,\u201d said Mrs Kraft\u2019s adopted daughter \u201cI\u2019ve never had to turn into a pretzel to appease your weight issues like Madison. I know what she did just to please you when she was in high school, but I also understand how she couldn\u2019t keep it up. As for me, I\u2019ve always felt like a flat-chested freak, all brains and nobody. But my metabolism isn\u2019t like hers and probably yours. If you can understand this, I\u2019ve even considered weight gain pills or having padding added by surgery I so want o have some curves.  I\u2019m not you, I\u2019m not Madison, I\u2019m me. And like her, I\u2019m sorry you find it so hard to accept that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJim, do you want to add anything?\u2019 Mr. Kraft inquired.<br>\r\n\u2018<br>\r\n\u201cI guess just that I\u2019m not the enemy in all this. When Madison and I got involved she was already bigger. For some reason, I liked all of her, including her size. I resented the remarks of others and made it known. I never thought about such things before, but believe me I would never do to your daughter what happened to your mother. But I think Madison probably was programmed genetically to be happy as a BBW from the start.  I hope you can accept that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Kraft turned to his wife. Tears were streaming down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see what I\u2019ve been doing, transferring my mother\u2019s pain onto everyone else. I don\u2019t know if I can change but I want to, \u2018 she sobbed. \u201cWhat do you think Chris?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve already told you I wouldn\u2019t ever leave the woman I love over her weight I meant it.. This has been your issue, and only your issue, for nearly thirty years. Are you willing to let me take you to a few good Mexican and Italian dinners now and then?\u201d he inquired. \u201cGive yourself permission to be who you are without fear, whatever that might be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that might be something we could try, but will please you all forgive me?\u201d she replied softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom,\u201d said Madison, touching her hand, \u201cWe already have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d agreed Alexa, \u201cand although you have nearly finished your ice cream, I\u2019ve barely touched mine. Mind if I dig in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim and Chris smiled at the irony as they looked at one another, neither man saying a thing. Their bowls too, and Madison\u2019s as well, were virtually untouched. In unison they followed Alexis's lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the rest of the their time at break, Madison noticed that her Mom was not being critical of her anymore. She was even acting towards her like she had before she had gained weight. The talk really seemed to work. Another by-product was that her Mom was more open to trying some of the food that Jim was making, and she was enjoying herself with it. Cecelia still wanted to stay slim, but she was now to the point where she realized that she needed to accept her daughters for themselves, regardless of the weight, or any other traits for that matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day while Madison was lounging near the pool, her Mom came out, \"Madi, I've been thinking, and we haven't gotten you clothes in a while!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison thought this over to herself. Her Mom was lying, she had, in fact, gotten Madison a ton of clothes right before the school year started. Now that Madison thought about it, those clothes were not cheap, and she wondered what she should do with them now that they were long outgrown. For the moment, however, Madison knew that this was her Mom's way of suggesting she should get new clothes without saying the reason why. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, thanks Mom, that would be great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeclia was a pampered housewife, and never thought much of going out and dropping more money on new clothes, and Madison was happy to go along with this if she benefited. Her Dad was never too crazy about this, but they had more than enough of the money, so why not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were driving, Madison noticed that they were not going to the mall, \"Mom, shouldn't we be heading in the other direction?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, let's go to the boutiques instead! I want to get some stuff myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison knew that this meant that her Mom was genuinely excited if she was buying the hyper upscale stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to one of the stores a sales girl started helping both of them out. There was also an initial awkwardness that her Mom tried not to acknowledge that although they had Madison's size, it was in the back of the store and with a reduced selection, however, Madison realized there was another reason that her Mom had taken her here. Madison was terrified while looking at the sizes. She knew that her trendy fits on her old clothes would reveal too much skin on her current body. At that moment, however, she looked at a few photos on the wall of the models and noticed the professional nature of their attire. It was really chic, but not too racy, a more late 20s look instead of a freshman in college look. Her Mom was showing her how to dress best for her size without explicitly saying it out loud. She had to hand it to her Mom, she did know style. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Madison got into the dressing room, she noticed how she could somewhat reduce the amount that her larger stomach and love handles would dominate her appearance, she realized part of the reason she felt so uncomfortable while gaining was that she was not dressing in the right manner for it, and she could still be in style, she just had to adjust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she got out, her Mom approached her, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have my things,\" her Mom happily noted, holding a few chinos, \"what fits for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just these things.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison's Mom took it all and went to the register and bought it. Madison was shocked, her Mom basically furnished a new week's worth of outfits for her. On the way home, Madison thanked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, that was soooo nice of you, thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I bet you will look amazing on campus with those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison appreciated it, her Mom was trying to be as nice and helpful as possible. She wondered if it would have any long term effects on her Mom. Madison continued to ponder it as they split a bowl of ice cream. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a great break for Madison. What initially started out as a series of awkward events that she dreaded with an overbearing mother and transformed into a great time. She felt so lucky to have such a supportive family. She had a Dad that never doubted her and was supportive the whole time, a sister who wanted to be more like her, and a Mom who eventually showed her motherly side after realizing her error. Most of all, Jim had been there as well, helping her get through the rough parts with her Mom, and she was very appreciative of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final evening they had a huge meal that Jim had cooked for the family of lasagna, bread and a salad. The old Madison would have noticed the amount of cheese and dressing in the salad hardly rendered it in health food territory, but her whole family was floored at how good it was. They talked for a while, and discussed plans for the next year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Madison, you and Cassi are not in the same room anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we are still good friends, but both of us want to branch out some more, although she will be crashing with Jim and I a bit before the school year starts, just to hang out around the city with us and enjoy the last weeks of summer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a fun plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison could not wait for the upcoming year, and after goodbyes her and Jim got on the road back to Powers. When they got back to campus, a surprise awaited them. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As she and Jim headed back to college Madison knew she\u2019d gained a total of 77 pounds in 15 months \u2013 more than she\u2019d admitted to her parents or even Jim. She was at 207, which meant that any day she consumed over 2600 calories without a lot of exercise she was likely to gain a bit more.  Cassie at 3000 per day seemed to have stabilized at around 230. Madison hoped that would be her fate as well because she had come to enjoy eating too much to diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer roommate Cassie had reported that Kelli was back two weeks beforte school started and had admitted to gaining another 17 pounds over the summer, bringing her gain to 57 pounds and a total of 177. This she speculated might be more than Kellli\u2019s plump but care free former roommate Ginger, who in the Spring had said she was pushing 170. Madison was happy to hear that Kelli and Michael were still together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie had described Kelli in an email. \u201cI saw her on her bike at the corner. She was wearing turquoise shorts and a matching top she must have bought thirty pounds ago.. She had a belly roll bulge  in her shorts and then a bigger one on her torso. Remember her slender runner\u2019s thighs? They are totally bigger than they used to be. But she seemed happy and oblivious to the amount of change. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s crossed over to the round side yet or is just still in denial but of course I have no room to talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is what had caused Jim to text Tim and Michael, inviting them and their girl friends  to a cookout when he and Madison got back. He would have included Ginger but word was that she had a job and wanted to take a break  from school to accumulate tuition money while paying down what she owed, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelli was into her second bag of chips in front of her computer when the message was forwarded from Michael.. Earlier she had had a tv dinner and a bowl of ice cream, so she certainly wasn\u2019t dieting any more than cooking for herself.   She knew Jim\u2019s invitation meant he and Madison would likely be cooking and she began wondering what he might prepare and smiled in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the new foodie Kelli, no longer focused on her weight or that of others, but rather enjoying food as Michael had suggested. He liked it, her family didn\u2019t mind, and she felt free of the pressure to be thin. But indeed she didn\u2019t yet see herself as really fat, dressing in clothes normally worn by those of lesser size. After checking with Michael she accepted Jim\u2019s offer for both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie too accepted the offer. She knew she was the biggest of the trio and not the tallest. Unlike Kelli she knew she was a fat girl. But it was something common in her family and it didn\u2019t bother her. Madison at over 200 considered herself formally fat as well, but tried to dress and act attractive to good effect. Like Jim she wondered how the new roommates the trio would soon be meeting would react to living with a set of certified BBWs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon returning to school Jim dropped Madison off. They both had work to do, He had to check out a portable b-b-que he\u2019d arranged to use at a frat house while Madison prepared a cobbler for the next day. Cassie was supposed to be doing the salad and Kelli was supplying the beverages and paper goods. Jim wasn\u2019t confident of Kelli\u2019s cooking skills but thought she could do basic shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison dropped in on Cassie in her new room. The two sophomores wondered how they would handle their new freshmen roommates whom they both knew were likely going to be far smaller than they.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really don\u2019t care if they get bigger or not, just so they don\u2019t try to change me,\u201d stated Cassie. \u201cI\u2019ve decided this is the way I\u2019m meant to be and that\u2019s my decision to make.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe very point Jim and I had to make to my Mom,\u201d agreed  Madison as she accepted a bag of cookies and withdrew a handful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know I told you about Kelli, but I think you\u2019re still going to be surprised.\u201d observed Cassie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably, but I think I\u2019ll just be friendly and not gloat. People can change and she\u2019s probably still got some learning to do.,\u201d noted Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie nodded in agreement. \u201cYes, a number of her friends didn\u2019t make the cut on grades and won\u2019t be coming back. She\u2019s going to have to build a new social circle and at her size that probably means beginning with us. It\u2019s a strange turnabout, but true.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext day Jim started out early buying supplies. Then he went to the frat house and cooked three BBQ chickens bursting with flavor after being marinated in a garlicky sweet and sour sauce. Meanwhile Madison had cut her cobbler into pieces and put them into a hamper with cold ice cream, , shortly to be joined by Cassie\u2019s potato salad and macaroni salad.  Cassie also brought along a hot kettle full of mixed vegetables. Jim and Tim showed up right on schedule and they headed for the park,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was the first to notice the figure of a large woman adjusting a table cloth and thought \u201c<i>that can\u2019t be \u2026\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was. Cassie said \u201cI see Kelli\u2019s already here getting things ready. I see Michael getting a hamper full of sodas out of that trunk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim whistled softly to himself. Kelli wasn\u2019t yet as big as Cassie or Madison but he could see her easily getting there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the three couples were devouring their lunch and continuing the speculation about the new freshmen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suggest we show some hospitality and organize more outings like this\u201d declared Michael,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could have meet and greet parties on campus serving pizza, Mexican food or whatever \u201c concurred Tim<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim was silent, recalling and contrasting these proactive remarks to the angry vengeance focused approach he\u2019d heard about in Coral Gables. But would Madison, Cassie and Kelli agree?  He was pleased when they did.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d</i> he thought to himself, <i>\u201cthese incoming freshmen won\u2019t be intimidating anyone and they\u2019re likely to gain more than just an education.\u201d</i></span></div></div>",

He had never been attracted to bigger girls, but after his time with Madison, Jim was started to think that over. But the experiment turned out to be a failure later that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim was contemplating the situation over dinner at the dining hall with Madison. As he watched her go up for second plate of food, he watched as her magnificent ass swung up and down with each step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Imagine what sex would be like with another 10 pounds? Or 15 pounds? Or even 20 pounds?</i> Jim thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was getting turned on by the prospect having sex with an even chubbier Madison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>20 more pounds and that's it. I don't want to be dating a real fat chick here.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison came back with a full plate and a brownie in her mouth. Jim could see her belly pushing the limits of her jeans as she began to sit down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRIIIIIIIIP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer jeans could not take the pressure of both her stomach and her ass and she tore her jeans straight down the back of her ass as she sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! This is so embarrassing!\" Madison cried. \"I can't believe this is happening right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim did not plan this far ahead. He didn't even think what might happen if Madison outgrew her clothes. This was a real problem...but in the moment Jim actually found it to be kind of hot. Madison outgrowing her clothes was just a good sign of things to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get up.\" Jim said \"I know this is embarrassing for you, but I don't think anyone saw or heard it. Let's just wait for everyone to leave and then we'll sneak out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so fat. Why did I have to eat that last brownie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not fat, I'm sure there's a good explanation as to why your pants ripped. I mean pants get worn and tear all the time right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim was flailing for an excuse and failing horribly. Luckily his offer to get her ice cream helped distract her from the situation. As it turned out, Madison had been turning to food in times of stress. He dodged a bullet, but failed to keep Madison unaware of her increased poundage. He knew she'd find out about the added weight soon, but for now, he continued to push desserts in front of her until all the students left the dining hall. </span></div></div>",

Madison felt more carefree than ever. Clearly she could eat as she liked and wasn't gaining any weight. She assumed her weight plateaued and while she wasn't still a little unnerved about her gain in college, it didn't effect her appetite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim had Madison over his college apartment for the night. He had a single bedroom apartment all to himself that he was able to secure with the help of a family friend who worked at the school. Madison had come over wearing the only pair of sweatpants that still fit. As Jim opened the door, he could see the Madison's sweatpants straining to contain her. Her waistband pressed tightly against her stomach. As she passed Jim, he got a glimpse of her ass. The seams were working in unison to keep her ass from escaping. Her panty lines were so thick that it was far too distracting to notice much else. As she sat down on his couch, her thighs splashed and began to cover more than their fair share of space. Her stomach raced to her thighs as it too was attempting to spread itself out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim was almost too turned on to contain himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night progressed as Madison and Jim proceeded to get drunk. Jim pulled out a bunch of desserts that he knew Madison would devour when drunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got us some snacks, feel free to have as much as you want\" said Jim<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Madison dove in, thinking Jim was eating right with him. She ate through an entire sleeve of Oreos and then followed it up by eating 3 out of the 6 cupcakes on the living room table. Jim couldn't believe what he had just witnessed. Even though Madison was quite pudgy, he had never seen her eat so much so fast. She was too drunk to notice what destruction she just caused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you can't eat the other sleeve of Oreos\" slurred Jim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe he just issued that challenge, but Madison was more than game. As she sat up to reach for the next sleeve, Jim heard a noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnap!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was that noise? Jim thought maybe Madison had destroyed another pair of pants, but her clothes seemed in tact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear that?\" asked Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" Madison said between cookies. \"It was my panties. They just snapped off. That's the 3rd pair this week. I swear you are right about those washers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison's reaction was so nonchalant. She was completely convinced that the washer shrank her clothes and too drunk to be concerned. She couldn't have put on weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim sat there in awe. He was half turned on and half in shock. Madison didn't even slow down to finish those cookies. Once she completed the last cookie in the bag, they whisked off to the bedroom where they had the best sex of their lives. As Jim laid in bed asleep from the nights activities, Madison laid next to him polishing off the last 3 cupcakes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was aware, though, based on how fast she outgrew her size 12 clothes that he had reached near the peak where he would stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was blissfully unaware of her true size. In fact sometimes she's not even sure she remembers how much she ate. The night she spent at Jim's was pretty hazy. She had no clue what she had done after her 4th drink. But it's been a week and the only thing she is thinking about is how much she likes Jim. Was it possible that she was in love? She wasn't sure, but with Jim on her mind, there was no time put into keeping track of what she's eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi meanwhile was quite aware of Madison's size. Madison was pushing 200 pounds (204 pounds to be exact) and she showed every single one of them. Most of the new weight was still going to her lower half. While her boobs and arms received a bit of an upgrade, it was Madison's lower half that stole the show. Cassi witnessed Madison sitting down in one of the dining hall chairs and engulfing the entire thing with her thighs, hips and ass. Cassi couldn't believe how fast Madison has expanded, yet she's still struggling to fit into those size 4s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter break was here and it was time for everyone to go home. This meant that Madison would show her newly added weight to her family. The whole plan was about to go up in flames. Luckily Cassi tipped Jim off about Madison's parents and their distaste for their daughter to be anything but perfect. Jim realized this an devised a meetup with Madison to tempt her to stay on campus. He explained to her that he had to work at his internship all winter break at the school and he didn't want to be alone. He wanted to see more of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison contemplated the idea for a bit, she really wanted to see her family, but felt that she would be letting down Jim if she didn't stay with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the heck?

Jim knew that he had to resist the urge to continue to encourage Madison's weight gain and that spending this time would make things even harder. Madison was already pretty big and the sex was fantastic...but still he had many lingering thoughts in his mind. The outgrowing of clothes stuck in his mind pretty strongly, yet he'd probably never get to witness it again. And who knows...maybe the sex could keep getting better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first few days went fairly well. Jim kept sweets out of his apartment and while Madison did eat her fair share of food, it wasn't anything over the top. It wasn't until three days in when Jim came back from his internship to find Madison drunk finishing up a doughnut. Empty wrappers were strewn around her. All junk food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison, what going on?\" questioned Jim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was nothing to do here while you were gone, so I went out and got some snacks since you seem to be all out of them. And when I got back I figured I earned myself a beer or three. After that I was just bored waiting for you to come home, so I opened up some of the snacks.\" said Madison \"Care for a doughnut?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim was in disbelief. There was Madison on the couch opening up a second box of doughnuts as her stomach expanded over her thighs. It was all too much for him to take in. She was happily devouring large amounts of food with no encouragement. It was then that Jim thought maybe 5 more pounds isn't hurting anyone. Why not help her get there? It took little convincing from there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like we could use some more snacks. I'll go pick us up some.\" Jim replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim's decent back into his old ways were met with a new wave of interests. He witnessed Madison eat her way though half a box of Oreos. He wondered if he could get her to finish an entire box. Jim brought back a lot more snacks as well as some more alcohol. A few drinks later into the night, Jim decided to test her appetite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you can't eat that entire box of Oreos\" Jim said jokingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's in it for me?\" replied Madison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...I will buy you a cake every day this week?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim couldn't believe she fell for the dare. Madison couldn't believe it was such an easy challenge. She already ate a box when she got back from shopping. Madison tore into the box and shoved cookie after cookie into her mouth with no intention of enjoying the moment. She was in it to eat them as fast as she could to show off.  When she was done, she gently placed the empty wrappers on Jim's lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You owe me a cake every day this week. What else you got?\" smiled Madison<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison quickly moved on to opening a bag of Doritos and emptying the contents into her stomach. Jim knew the next 3 weeks were going to be dangerous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n//////////////////////////////<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire first week went similar to that faithful night except there was a cake. Madison took to the cake herself claiming she earned it. Jim did not protest. Madison's pants, however, did. She had outgrown her size 16s at some point during the week. She was pouring out of her clothes. She gave up on her jeans a few days ago and was once again down to her sweats. They met their match at the supermarket where Madison exposed her panties to the world after bending down to pick up a box of cheese-it's that were on sale. She tried to hide it, but a lot of people got to see her panties, which were barely holding their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim found Madison at home crying. She was so embarrassed by the whole incident. She cursed the school washers. All Jim could think about was consoling her with food and getting those panties off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPint after pint of ice cream seemed to help, but Jim was not done. He did some research and found out how to make a milkshake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks\" said Madison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I made it for you\" replied Jim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can eat or drink anymore...I'm so stuffed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it would be so disappointing if you didn't. I learned how to make this just for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison couldn't turn down the offer after that. She struggled drink it, but found it less so after her panties split. A lot of pressure was taken off her stomach. She was so upset by her losing her last set of panties that she quickly downed the rest of her milkshake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you hate me if I said that I had made you another milkshake?\" said Jim<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't help himself. Here's a girl who is going to be a size 18 on his couch completely full and he's serving her another calorie bomb. Jim never thought he'd find himself in this situation. He needed to stop...but maybe after winter break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...can't...have anymore\" said a very full Madison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you can. I'll help.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim started to pour the milkshake into Madison's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drink up. You've had a rough day\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim was so turned on by feeding her. He never thought about doing something like this before and he's not sure why he never tried this before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jim knew that Madison was going to be sad about not being with her family on Christmas, so he woke up early and started with breakfast to surprise her. Madison's parents shipped her presents up to her and she had brought them over to Jim's apartment to open. In allowing her to stay over break, they did make a deal that she had to come back over spring break. Jim was thinking about that while he was making pancakes and bacon. Was he operating on a timeline that expired in March, or were there other ways her to avoid going down to South Florida. He imagined her struggling in plus sized swimwear on the beach and got a little turned on, but then went back to the task at hand, the breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison had been eating throughout the week, and it was pretty obvious in her constantly bloated stomach. She was sleeping in a pair of larger panties that she had purchased, and a super tight tank top that wasn't leaving anything to the imagination. When Jim walked in with the food, before he woke her up, he took a moment to look over her. Her thighs were becoming absolutely massive, and cellulite was starting to become a factor as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Merry Christmas!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison awoke to a tray full of pancakes, eggs, and bacon. Even for her, it was a huge serving, with probably 6 pancakes, 10 strips of bacon and 3 eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Jim this is a ton of food, how early did you wake up for this?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Who cares, I just wanted to start your day off great.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison didn't plan on eating all of the food, but she reasoned that it was a holiday, so she could indulge. Madison ended up eating all of it, including the bacon, which she loved. Stuffed, Madison walked into the living room, where she noticed the smell of ham.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Holy crap, Jim, are you baking us ham?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, why not?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well...for just us?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I guess we'll have a lot of leftovers and ham sandwiches for a while.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a morning of exchanging gifts and lounging around, they had a small lunch, given that Madison was still trying to get over the big breakfast she had. Jim also found another way to cope with the clothing situation. He got her nearly all clothes for his gifts, and tried to obscure the tags near their clothing size. He wondered if Madison suspected something, because her gain was so noticeable, but maybe she was just engaged in wishful thinking, either way she loved the new clothes from Jim. But in the evening, Jim prepared a meal of ham, and Madison helped make mashed potatoes and gravy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison had become hungry again by this point in the evening, so she had no reservations about eating multiple servings of the ham. Jim was shocked by her increased appetite. He remembered back to when this fit girl walked into the paper and asked if anything was available, now she was piling away ham quickly. Madison had purchased more panties, but they always seemed perpetually small on her huge butt, and Jim was hoping another pair would succumb to her girthy body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, Jim introduced the freshman to eggnog. After one sip, Madison grimaced. ''Ugh, it tastes like I'm drinking dough, what is this?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''It will grow on you, plus it masks the vodka in there really well.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was never opposed to a new vodka delivery method, and she soon downed four cups while becoming buzzed. Jim knew that there was about 350 calories per cup of the eggnog, and that didn't even include the vodka calories. Madison felt stuffed after this and she looked it. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Christmas came and passed. Jim spoiled Madison rotten. He supplied her with a whole new wardrobe in size 18 (although they read size 10), a new necklace and earrings, and a feast made for a whole family. Madison gave Jim tickets to see the Dave Matthews Band. But Jim's real gift was Madison's slow release on her self-control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since that night where he fed Madison, Jim has kind of gone off his personal deep end. He knew that Madison was going to put on a lot of weight while she stayed here, and he was going to make the most of it while he could. Because after the break, he truly promised to stop encouraging Madison's weight gain. Jim had continued to push Madison's limits by feeding her beyond her known limits. What he didn't realize is that it was stretching Madison's stomach, giving her more room to eat before she got full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison couldn't understand why she was always so hungry. Many nights of drinking made keeping track of her eating habits a bit foggy, but she assumed she was eating enough. Every night of drunken sex resulted in ravenous consumption. It started with a few cupcakes, but Madison had graduated on to boxes of cookies and making her own milkshakes. Now she never really felt full until Jim fed her until she couldn't move. Her late night binges lasted longer and longer sacrificing sleep for more calories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim enjoyed waking up to Madison struggling to put on her clothes. That usually meant that they were getting pretty tight. With all this newly added weight, she was having a hard time balancing herself to get her clothes on. Jim could just see her sweats groan as they attempted to crawl past her hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was New Years and Jim and Madison shared each others resolutions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This year, I resolve to be a better person and support you in every decision\" said Jim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This year I resolve to not be so strict about how I live my life. I'm going to let the reigns go every now and then and spoil myself. I've lived such a restricted life up until I met you\" said Madison<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim was really surprised that Madison still believed that she was restricting herself especially when it came to eating and her weight. How could she not know something is up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple celebrated with a kiss and continued to celebrate the new year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n////////////////////<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter break was coming to an end and Jim saw his last opportunity to fatten Madison before he called it quits. He was desperate to see her burst through her clothes if just one more time. He found out on the internet that weight gain power provided the biggest bang for his buck. He went out and bought some and started to include it in desserts and shakes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember when you said you were going to spoil yourself this year?\" said Jim. \"Well I went ahead and spoiled you before you could spoil yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim had presented Madison with more treats and calorie laden snacks than she could ever eat in a day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go, even if just for a few days. You deserve it. I also rented us the entire series of Lost, so we can just stay here and enjoy the last days of vacation together\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was overwhelmed by Jim's outright thoughtfulness. Of course she dug right in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last few days were a food and sex orgy. Jim was pushing as many calories into Madison as he could. And Madison's ass was pushing as hard against her pants as it could. It was Madison's last night a Jim's apartment. It was around dinnertime when Jim suggested that they go to the dining hall for dinner since it had just reopened for the semester. Madison was a bit lethargic from all the eating of the last few days, but she welcomed actually leaving Jim's apartment. What she wasn't aware of was that the yoga pants she decided to wear had holes in them. Holes all inside the thighs, tears down the seam, even a tiny hole across the butt that just got bigger every time she sat down. Fat was pouring from every direction. Jim had no idea how they even stayed on. All he knew is they were going to come off at the cafeteria. Madison was going to be humiliated beyond belief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim followed behind Madison to the dining hall. He never noticed that Madison's gait was slowly transforming. Her thighs touched all the way down to her knees which gave her more sway as she walked. Some of the students had already returned and some were shocked to see Madison's transformation over winter break. She had added 30 pounds over the course of 3 weeks. That was unheard of. There was whispering and snickering behind her back, but Madison was focused on the task at hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison piled her plates high and made sure to go back for seconds. As she leaned in for her first bite from her second helping, she felt a twinge in her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnap!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison's bra couldn't take the strain anymore. The clasp broke making a really loud sound in the cafeteria. Jim didn't expect that to happen. Madison had piled so much weight on her lower half that he failed to realize that there was some poundage going into her boobs. Madison turned red. People heard that. She got a little upset. Now was Jim's time to act. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh, it's ok. Calm down calm down. Just act natural like nothing happened. Just keep eating. Here have a slice of this apple pie.\" Insisted Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison, overcome with embarrassment, listened to Jim and continued to eat. Two plates of pie later and the distinct sound of tearing fabric was making itself known. Madison's thighs were fighting through the holes in her pants. It was as if a dam was bursting in slow motion. Of course the feeling of ripping clothes only made Madison panic. Luckily Jim was there to comfort her with food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything is going to be fine...just have some cake\" said Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim sat next to his expanding girlfriend and gave her a belly rub from under the table. Jim grabbed and fondled her flab as he rubbed her stomach. He could feel it getting bigger. Madison on the other hand was only getting more hungry thanks to the belly rub. And the more she ate, the more her pants began to rip. And the more her pants ripped, the more she ate. Jim was in purely blissful state. Madison was eating everything he put in front of her. The waistband snapped on her yoga pants. Her stomach shot out free of it's confines. More food. Her hips tore through. More food. Her ass was the only thing holding the pants up, but they burst through with relative ease. To Madison everything was happening so fast, that it was a bit blurry. She didn't even realize that she was halfway though a whole cheesecake. It was at this point that Jim realized wasn't going to stop feeding Madison after winter break.</span></div></div>",

Cassi had managed to get back before Madison. Having spent her winter break at home gave her more opportunity to work on her figure. She was finally able to cut down into a size 4 much to the concern of her mother. Cassi had never been so slim in all her life and her mother was a bit concerned that she was far too fixated on her weight. This didn't phase Cassi in the least. She was now slim and Madison well....Madison was....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi had a stunned look on her face. Madison assumed it was because she was happy to see her. In reality it was because Madison piled on a ridiculous amount of weight in just a few short weeks and it was hard not to notice. Everything had rounded out...well except for her face. Madison still had that beautiful thin face with not even a hint of fat. Her arms were billowy almost dimpling over her elbows. Her breasts were certainly bigger, but based on how much she had grown it was kind of a given. Cassi had to she was a DD by now. Surprisingly her stomach didn't extend further out than her breasts, but when she sat down, her stomach started to form rolls. It was Madison's lower half that really showed the excess poundage. In fact it was hard to not notice immediately since Madison accidentally knocked her stack of books over with her ass as she was moving back in. Her ass was huge! It was so big that it had a shelf. Cassi thought she could probably balance her V-8 can on there without a problem. And her ass wasn't just thick, it was wide too. Madison's hips were so big that she was wide as two Madison's when she arrived at school. And no hips are complete without thunderous thighs. And Madison made sure to pack on a the pounds there. Each leg was already fighting for space as Madison walked. Each step she took created a little jiggle. Each chair she sat in gave a little groan. Seeing Madison made Cassi quite...</span></div></div>",

Cassie assumed that she must of weighed 250 pounds, which was pretty close to her actual weight of 242 pounds. She's almost double the size since she started school. She knew that this was all Jim's doing. While Cassi wasn't Madison's biggest fan, she couldn't let her roommate pack on so much weight. While Cassi and Madison exchanged small talk over what they did on break, all Cassi could focus on was talking to Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClasses had started and once Cassi's classes were over she went to go find Jim at his apartment. Jim heard a knock on his door and was surprised to see Cassi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Um Cassi, how are you? How was your break? Um...what are you doing here?\" rambled Jim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can the small talk Jim, you know why I'm here. What the heck happened to Madison? She was already quite chubby and now she's borderline obese!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't call her obese, not at all. She's just full figured. And what's it to you? Madison enjoyed herself while she stayed with me. Sure she put on a few pounds...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few pounds? Jim she's easily a few pants sizes bigger. This needs to stop before it gets any further out of hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't get out of hand, I promise, but look...I don't want you mentioning her weight or anything else regarding her size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she really not aware of how big she is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm....not really...I don't know how she hasn't noticed, but I need to keep up this illusion that she's just chubby at most. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why I should.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well for starters you were in on it up until today...and what's the point of telling her if you were involved. Also if you tell her, I'm pretty sure she'll end up working off the weight and then you'll have to compete with another skinny bombshell. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well...when you put it like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi feared Madison being thin again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While I don't support her gaining anymore weight, I don't need to compete for guys with her. So I'll continue to help you in support only. I'm not contributing to Madison's weight gain anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Cassi off his back, Jim was pretty sure he had a relatively quiet night ahead of him. That is until his friend Ted came to his apartment. Ted explained how his brother, Rob is a freshman at the school and spotted Madison attending one of his classes. He found the situation amusing, so he took a video with his phone and sent it to Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, isn't this your girlfriend? Man she got really fat...what happened?\" said Ted<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed showed Jim a clip of Madison putting her bag down next to a desk/chair combo and struggling to fit her ass into the seat. Madison had to adjust several times as her fat was pushing from every side of the seat. Her very visible panty lines were only second to her fat ass poking out the sides of the chair. It was a real struggle for Madison, who was quite unsure what to think of the desk. Jim was actually quite turned on by watching Madison struggle and squeeze into the chair, which was something he didn't think would really turn him on. Jim was quickly brought back to reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that's her right? Are you dating a fat chick? I remember that girl used to be hot.\" said Ted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look man, maybe some day you'll understand that when you love someone it shouldn't matter what weight they are.\" replied Jim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um..sure dude. Maybe I'm just not getting it. Dude you're a senior! You could date any other hot freshman if you wanted\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going to stay with Madison. That just means there's more for you man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, right! One more guy off the market. Got it. Thanks for doing us guys a solid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My pleasure\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim was pleased to both shake a friend's comments and Cassi's comments about his girlfriend. But he was more interested in seeing that video again. </span></div></div>",

Sure a few sleeves of Oreos could tide her over for a class, but there was a lot of class time and less time to lounge. So when she had breaks between classes, she would head down to the dining hall and gorge on food. She would eat as if she had been stranded in the dessert for a week. She wasn't even enjoying the taste and flavors of food she was eating, she was trying to satisfy her urges. Students would often see Madison in the dining hall a few times a day eating with reckless abandon and then sneaking a few treats into her purse for later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison just couldn't stop thinking about food. If there was food in front of her, she was probably going to eat it. Nights at Jim's apartment was reminiscent of winter break except with more food. Jim started to buy bigger fattier foods. Whole cakes, especially cheesecake, where a common sight. On top of milkshakes, Jim kept a large supply of sodas available. Hand candy, such as economy size bags of M&amp;Ms were placed in every room. If Madison ate through a box of cookies, Jim would encourage her start on another box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison loved it all. She never realized how easy it is to eat a cheesecake on your own. Bags of candy would just be empty wrappers by the end of the night. The two would have sex and Madison would eat her way though a tray of fudge or a few boxes of girl scout cookies in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her dorm room, Madison would stash food she took from the dining hall, plus goodies from Jim's apartment. She would often save them for when she got home at night. She had been so used to being stuffed full of food before bed, that she couldn't sleep on an \"empty stomach\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no surprise to anyone anymore why Madison had packed on so much weight so fast. Any self control she might of had was slipping and slipping fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So it didn't take more than just a few weeks for a noticeable change. Madison packed on a good 18 pounds putting her at 260 pounds or double the weight since she started college. The added pounds were heavily favoring her hips. They really flared out putting more strain on her clothes than even her titanic ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim was in his apartment with Madison. He was hoping tonight was the night Madison upgraded to size 22s, instead he was in for another treat. Madison was at Jim's desk, sending out a few emails when he spied the arms of the chair digging into Madison's hips. Her fat poking out the top and bottom of the arm of the chair. After a good 20 minutes the arms had left some serious red marks on Madison's thick hips. As she felt a twinge of soreness she attempted to stand up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! Oh come on! Ughhh let go!\" yelled Madison<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was stuck in the chair. At first Jim watched with pleasure. Again another new thing about Madison and her weight that really turned him on. He loved to watch her struggle. Ever since he saw the video of Madison trying to squeeze into a desk chair, he's waited to witness this moment himself. His enjoyment was short lived as his mind quickly darted to the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wonder what she would get stuck in if she was even fatter?</i> thought Jim<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind raced with excitement yet he didn't know what would come of this. All he knew is she had to be fatter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim helped Madison out of his chair. His hands cupped around rolls of her fat as he loosened the arms of the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just adjusted these the other day, I didn't even realize how tight I made it. \" said Jim<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim set out that night to really make sure Madison really pushed her limits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Jim woke up to find Madison struggling to put on her sweat pants. Through all the struggle, she didn't seem to notice that she had ripped her panties across her butt in the process. Madison just couldn't seem to get past her hips and ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...a little help please\" said Madison<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim jumped out of bed to help his ballooning girlfriend stuff herself into her clothes. Of course for Jim that meant he got to feel her fat press tightly against her clothes. The sweatpants couldn't go higher than halfway up Madison's ass, but that was good enough. As she started to move her pants began to tear in the inner thigh and crotch. Madison couldn't care at the moment as there was half of a cake leftover from last night's binge. </span></div></div>",

Encouraging her to have an extra slice of pizza or order a 3rd large fry came with little resistance. Jim was even seen feeding Madison at a McDonald's off campus. He was having a hard time not doing it in public. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeals ran longer and Jim made sure Madison was plenty full..but Jim pushed too far at times. Madison would get too filled up before dessert and she refused to eat any more. Jim was slightly disappointed by this and after a few days his frustrations came out and he because very visibly frustrated. Madison picked up on this. She didn't understand why Jim was so upset, but she didn't want to disappoint him...she loved Jim and only wanted to make him happy, so she pushed herself to eat far beyond her limit. The problem was dessert was usually in the form of a whole cake or other pastry meant for a group of people. Yet somehow she was able to finish it. Oftentimes she was so full that she couldn't move or she would be sick. At first Jim didn't catch on to why Madison was having a change of heart. But once he did, he took full advantage of it. He would make sure she was filled to the brim and present a cheesecake and act frustrated until she finished it. Sometimes he would push it a little further and follow up with a milkshake. Madison was too full to move much less reject the drink. Jim usually ended up feeding it to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Madison's weight exploded. She had put on an additional freshman 15 in just 15 days and jumping up another size in the process. By the end of the month she packed on a whopping 34 pounds putting her at 294 pounds. Madison was now quite large. In fact, it was made apparent while she was at Jim's apartment eating away on a few boxes of oreos and suddenly Jim's notorious chair crumbed under her massive weight. Jim ran over to console her and come up with an excuse as to why the chair broke, but Madison had it covered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jim, you're shitty chair broke? Can you believe it? You should've gotten rid of this thing awhile back. And look now there are Oreos all over the ground. Can't let good food go to waste.\" said Madison<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison wasn't even upset, in fact she was more concerned with the food that had fallen on the floor. She was desperately inhaling them right off the ground, Madison's giant ass crack being exposed to the world. No cookie could be spared. It was at that moment where Jim realized he was now dating a fat girl. </span></div></div>",

Tipping the scales close to 300 pounds, Madison had grown to more than double her starting weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison wasn't completely in the dark. She was in denial. Madison knew that she had put on more weight, but how much she didn't want to know or think about. Madison never had to worry about her weight or anything for that matter. She never dealt with any stress. As it turns out Madison didn't know how to cope with her weight, but she found her only solace to be in food. This only made the situation worse, but for Madison, a bite into something delicious helped her forget about her weight. She avoided mirrors, and played off teasing from friends. Being as big as she is now, Madison only dove deeper into denial. At first she ignored her issues, but now she was straight up making excuses about her weight. Her bra burst because of \"shoddy craftsmanship\", her ass was pouring over the sides of a chair because the chair was \"meant for children\", the elastic in her pants burst because she was sitting at a funny angle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the encouragement from Jim, Madison has been conditioned to eat a crazy amount of food. This extreme eating used to come around mostly when Jim was around, but now Madison was making efforts to put down large quantities of food on her own. At the beginning of the school year, Madison would have questioned eat just one doughnut, but now she was questioning if she should get more than a baker's dozen. Maybe she should have questioned when was the last time she saw her feet. Unbeknownst to Madison, she was now hitting a point of no return. She was in big girl territory now. </span></div></div>",

He watched her start to struggle with everyday things. Bending down was no so easy as her belly pressed up against her giant thighs. Plus with all the added weight, getting up was a real chore. Madison would have to squeeze into a booth at a restaurant and oftentimes her belly pressed up against the table. She was developing a waddle which made her ass give a hypnotic shake. She was constantly forced to pull up her pants. Madison couldn't even cross her legs because her thighs were so fat. Jim was actually enjoying this, in fact he was enjoying it a bit too much. He didn't want to stop her at 300 pounds. He loved the sex. He loved her ever increasing struggles with her weight. He wanted more. The more she struggled the more turned on he got. He wanted more Madison and he knew that he couldn't stop himself. Madison may have lost her self-control with food, but Jim lost control of his inner feeder. </span></div></div>",

But now he really wanted to push the limits of Madison's gluttony. Jim had discovered a community of people just like himself. He learned that he was a feeder. He also talked to several people about her gain. He was seeking advice on ways to increase her weight without her knowing. Most people in the community shunned the fact the he was secretly fattening his girlfriend, except one member. He suggested Jim to purchase a particular drug that was fairly harmless, but caused a person to have a heightened appetite. He promised that she would pile on weight even faster. Jim contemplated the situation...but only for a minute. Would he feed Madison drugs to help increase her weight? He reasoned with himself that the drugs were harmless and would only help in speeding up her weight gain. So..why not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim was nervous to get her to take a pill, so he decided to place in on a cupcake after Madison had a few drinks. It was candy colored anyways. Madison took the bait as she devoured the cupcake. For awhile Jim thought he was sold a placebo...that is until a few hours later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what's gotten into me tonight.\" said Madison between chews. \"I'm just so famished tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you just dig into those cupcakes and I'll just go get the box of brownies that I picked up from the bakery\" grinned Jim<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pill did work! Jim was excited...and quite turned on. Madison was practically stuffing cupcake after cupcake in her mouth, spending little time to even chew her food. She finished a half dozen cupcakes before Jim could even pull out the brownies from the box. Madison jumped out of her seat, ass knocking over the chair, and waddled over of the box before Jim could even put it down. She crammed piece after piece into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you brought more because I've got an appetite tonight\" said Madison<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim realized he would have to dig deep into his saving to satiate Madison's newfound hunger.</span></div></div>",

He became more comfortable adding a pill a day to Madison's sweet. If he could, he'd get a pill in during the morning. The early day pills were really messing with Madison's schooling. When the pills take effect, Madison is insatiable. It's as if she had been starved and hadn't seen food in days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison typically ate out of pleasure or stress, but now she was eating to satisfy a constantly empty stomach. The urge to eat was so strong that she didn't even bother enjoying the taste. It was about satisfying the hunger as fast as possible. Except that the hunger would come back often and sometimes it would happen during class. Madison always came prepared to class with more than enough food, but when that hunger struck, no food that she could carry was going to satisfy her. She knew she couldn't leave class, but the hunger was so strong that it was hard to concentrate. This caused her to fail a few tests and even forced her to skip class so she could gorge at the dining hall. Nothing could slow her down from eating. And there was no better example than one faithful evening where Madison skipped Economics to grab food at the dining hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison waddled into the cafeteria pushing a pair of size 28 sweatpants to their comfortable limits. Her ass was jiggling so much that it was a battle for the threads to hold together. Madison piled her plates high. Slices of pizza, bowls of french fries, and hot dogs everywhere. Madison decided to wash that all down with a few glasses of soda. That, however, was not the best idea. All that liquid and food made her belly bloat and press against her sweatpants. Madison could feel her pants getting uncomfortably tight, but she continued. More pizza, more soda, more..just more. RIPPP!! The pants gave up their fight. A tear right down her ass. Madison stopped only briefly...but continued to eat. More!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What's wrong with me?</i>\" Thought Madison. \"<i>I can't stop...I need to get more food.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison decided she needed seconds, but she was struggling to get out of the booth. In her struggle her rip expanded and became all that more apparent. Students snickered and laughed as Madison went up for her seconds. There was Madison, now the school fat girl, with a giant tear exposing her underwear and going up for more food. Madison knew that people could see what had happened, but the stress of the situation just made her pile the food even higher and it made the food go down even faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison's expansion at the cafeteria continued past her sweatpants and was now targeting her panties. She was concerned, but couldn't resist another bowl of ice cream. And then a tray of cookies that she swiped. Every bite put that much more pressure on her panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>No, no, no, no, no, no, no, NO, NO, NO!!</i>\" said a panicked Madison internally. \"<i>Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!!</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was trying to reason with herself to stop eating, to save her underwear and her dignity, but failing. More food. Cannolis. More cannolis. Madison was suggestively sucking out the cream from the cannolis before devouring the shell. More cream. More fat. Madison desperately trying to give her underwear some more room by taking one hand and slightly stretching her underwear elastic. She just couldn't compete with her urges. RIIIIIP! The entire underwear was torn to shreds. Madison's butt was exposed to the world. But she made sure to finish her desserts. Students had been downright watching Madison during all of this. Some found it funny, but some actually were slightly turned on by the way Madison suggestively ate her dessert. Madison was so embarrassed and a bit beside herself as she lost control over her eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison texted Jim....\"Bring new pants to dining hall...clothes shrank again\". There was nothing for Madison to do but polish off the remaining food and wait for Jim to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim arrived 15 minutes later to Madison securely fastened between the booth and the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there beautiful. Can I get you something to eat? You look hungry.\" said Jim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...that cake looks delicious.\" replied Madison. What was she saying?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming right up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No time to think about that, here comes a plate of cookies. Where did the cookies go? Oh nevermind, this danish is so tasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim noticed that Madison's body wasn't quite done outgrowing her clothes.

In fact the first thing she remembered after that first slice of cake was Jim tossing her onto his bed. Jim looked over Madison watching her fat jiggle.

It took a lot to take off the last few pounds. But it looks like whatever pounds Cassie just lost, found their way to Madison, plus a whole bunch more. Cassie had really been concerned with Madison's weight since the semester started, but lately Madison has pushed her weight gain from concerning to dangerous. In just 15 days since Madison had been taking the pills, she put on a whole 32 pounds. And it was noticeable...very noticeable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of that time, Madison's hips went from easily fitting in a door frame to brushing up against the sides. Her hips were so plush, that her fat would gently hug narrowest of doorways. Her thighs started to dimple over her knee. When she sat, her thighs would spread wide over every chair. She was easily more off of a chair than on. Madison's ass already spread pretty far back, but now her back couldn't touch the back of the chair. It seemed like the last 30 pounds were solely focused on her lower half, but she still had a very busty chest and belly. Her stomach folded into rolls and was giving her breasts a run for her money. Madison's arms had grown so thick that most girls would be ashamed if those were their thighs. The only place that was not covered in fat was Madison's face. It was as thin as the day she started school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison would come back to her dorm and Cassie would attempt to bring up Madison's weight. Madison would deflect all attempts. Even as Madison's chair would groan in extreme pain when Madison sat down, there was nothing that was going to get past her thick layer of denial. Other friends started to present their concern to Madison, but not specifically mentioning how fat she had got. Rather than accepting her gain or listening to her friends, Madison lashed out. They were all jealous because she was dating Jim. She knew it.

He stripped her clothes off and had sex right there and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison's calves grew so thick that she could no longer fit into her boots. Jim had knocked the boot right out her hand and sex with her right on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison grew winded just climbing two flights of stairs. Jim stopped to make out with his wheezing girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison's hips were too wide for the movie theatre seats. They skipped the movie to have sex in the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSex was becoming more frequent, but Jim was enjoyed being in the moment less and less. Instead he was fantasizing about Madison getting fatter while having sex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I want you fatter. Fatter! Fatter!</i> Jim repeated in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was not big enough yet for Jim, no. His fantasizing was taking over his reality. The more he visited these feeding fetish sites, the more he convinced himself that he actually had a pretty skinny girlfriend. Even though she was tipping the scales at 345 pounds, Madison wasn't even considered all the fat amongst the sea of women on those websites. Jim promised to change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jim smiled as he stared at Madison sitting in the passenger seat of his car. With each pothole and bump, Madison's fat jiggled uncontrollably. The seatbelt pressed tightly against her stomach and her hips bumping up against the door and the cup holders. It was Madison's birthday weekend and Jim was treating a very plump Madison to an all you can eat buffet. This wasn't a private event though. Jim decided to invite all of Madison's friends. Madison's friends, were...well not so much friends anymore. Madison had not said kind things about her friends and her roommate lately and the girls didn't take well to the comments. Jim had big plans tonight. The ultimate humiliation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were already going smoothly as Madison's bra snapped just from Jim's car hitting a very deep pothole. Madison's cheeks turned red, but she feigned ignorance of the situation. <br>\r\nAs they pulled into the parking lot of the restaurant, Jim got a good look at how tight Madison's clothes were. Having given up on another pair of jeans, Madison was forced to put on some rather unflattering sweats which showed off every curve. Her shirt barely held her breasts in place, but her lower belly roll was a little bit exposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison entered the buffet with her friends already there. Everyone watched as Madison squeezed into a booth. Her stomach pressing up against the table because her ass barely fit on the cushion. It didn't take long for Madison to make a catty remark about some of her friends weight. She suggested that the buffet might not be the best place for them. This of course pissed off the whole table. How can Madison just the weight of her friends when she was over double their size. Cassie, fuming at her roommates attitude, conspired with the other girls to make Madison eat her words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the evening wore on the girls were constantly bringing Madison food. A few slices of pizza here, a full plate of french fries, basically anything that was remotely fattening. Madison of course ate with gusto. But it wasn't enough that Madison was eating with her normal fury. No, Jim also gave her on of the pills not too long ago. Jim had learned how long it took for the pill to take effect and he was planning for it to go off halfway through the night. And kick in it did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Madison had happily eaten all the food that was brought to her, but the girls started to notice that Madison's appetite turned into a ravenous tornado. She spent less time chewing and enjoying her food and more time inhaling everything around her. Cassi took a cue from Jim and used this opportunity to stuff and feed Madison. Soon the other girls started to join in. Each girl in line shoving food into Madison's mouth. Madison could barely keep up. Jim was naturally very turned on. His original plan was to have Madison split her pants in front of her friends. He never expected Madison's friends to open join in on feeding her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls worked almost like a machine. Some girls would run to the buffet to get food, while the other girls would force feed Madison with delicious sweets. A never ending pile of food approached the table. Madison still feeling famished, could feel her clothes digging into her body. She knew that if she kept eating, these pants were not going to make it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I've had enough\" muffled Madison between bites. But the girls didn't stop. Madison again pleaded for the girls to stop, but every time she opened her mouth, someone popped food in. Madison's clothes got tighter. She desperately attempted to loosen her drawstrings forgetting that they had disappeared a long time ago. Madison tried to pull her pants further down in an attempt to give herself a little room, but she couldn't get it past her lower belly roll which had grown far too large for such tight pants. Her pants began to tear. First along the seam of the ass, but it quickly spread across her entire lower half. Unlike the other times, she outgrew her clothes, this time it was was quick and violent. There was no pants covering her anymore, just large tattered pieces of clothing that draped off of her. The pressure on her stomach was relieved and the first thing out of her mouth was...\"I want more\". The girls walked Madison over to the dessert trays where they leaned her on the table allowing her to scoop up cookies, cupcakes and other hand desserts. The manager was getting upset. This very obese girl was starting to make a scene. Her gigantic ass leaning across a table for everyone to see. Madison couldn't stop. Despite everything going on around her, her priority was to fill up her seemly bottomless stomach. The girls, who were stuffing Madison out of spite, were starting to turn a bit as they watched Madison continue to eat beyond enjoyment. The fun was kind of over and things started to get a bit worrisome as Madison was showing no sign of slowing down. The encouragement stopped, but Madison kept eating. She kept pushing more food down into her stomach. Madison was reaching for the last cupcake which was just out of reach when her underwear snapped leaving her bare ass exposed to the world. Not even that stopped her from climbing on the table to claim her prize. The problem with that was the table was not meant to hold 360lbs of dessert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table collapsed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim ran over to check on Madison, worried that she might be hurt. Instead he found her lying on the ground with a devilish smile eatting the last cupcake. The manager threatened to call the cops, as everyone ran out of the restaurant. Jim covered up Madison and paid his bill along with some extra money to cover the damage before leaving. On the way home they stopped by a few fast food restaurants because Madison was still too hungry to wait until she got back to school. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eating had started to become Madison's #1 priority. Food was always on her mind and figuring out what she was going to eat next and where was more important than her studies. Her grades started to slowly slump in the first half of the semester, but now as finals approached, Madison was failing tests left and right. Rather than study for her finals, Madison stress binged. In fact Madison spent more time stress binging during the tests, than finishing her tests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nF's. Madison had failed 4 out of 5 classes. She was utterly crushed. She had yet to tell Jim, but she would need to take summer classes if she wanted to finish school on time. She couldn't ask her parents for money, no, they would disown her if they found out that she failed classes. Madison needed a job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison decided to commiserate her failure at the bakery downtown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two bakers dozen cupcakes please\" said Madison<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man behind the counter wrapped up the cupcakes gently, so that they may be safely taken to their destination. Madison paid for her cupcakes and tore open the box at the dining area. Everything here seemed to fit Madison's size. The chairs were sturdy and wide enough and the tables granted space for stomachs. Madison popped cupcakes into her mouth like they were chips. This caught the attention of the old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'a have a real good appetite for such a'ah thin girl\" said the old man who had a slight accent. Madison hadn't heard a compliment on her slim figure in some time, but it definitely suited her level of denial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My wife, she'ah...she cannot work no longer. But you. You..I'm'ah need of someone like you. Come work for me thin girl. I will pay you and you can live in the studio above the bakery. You can also have all the food you could want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree housing? Pay? Free FOOD? Madison found the real solution to her troubles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll totally work for you...umm...I'm sorry I don't think you introduced yourself\" said Madison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry sorry. My name is Vincenzo. People around here call me Vinny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Madison, it's nice to meet you Vinny. I'm excited to work here! When can I start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about tomorrow? For now, I think you need to eat girl. I'uh think you are wasting away\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny was from the old country where fat wives were coveted. Vinny's wife was unable to work at the bakery after she tipped the scales at over 650lbs. He saw the same promise from Madison. And while Vinny had no intention of courting Madison, he knew a growing girl was good for business. Never trust a skinny chef. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jim was a little distraught. He had hoped of landing a job near the school so he could continue to see Madison every day, but that had to take a backseat to his career. Jim loved Madison and the only way he could provide for her and her appetite was to get a real job. Jim had to move 4 hours away, which in the big picture wasn't so bad. The only problem was that he had to travel for training, so seeing Madison over the summer was going to be sparse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison had told Jim about her summer job. She seemed very excited to start working and getting her schooling back on track. She seemed very positive after such a rough past few weeks. Jim knew about Vinny's Bakery. Vinny's wife used to help run it and she was huge. There was always talk around town when she would do her yearly eating contests. It brought a lot of attention to the bakery that's for sure. Jim knew that Madison working at Vinny's should help her maintain her weight. Hopefully she wouldn't gain too much as Jim wouldn't be around to buy her new clothes and mask her true weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim was still giving Madison a daily pill to increase her appetite, but the overusage it was starting to have a long term effect. The pill was to be used sparingly, but once a day started to bring on early morning headaches. This was a minor issue for Madison, but it meant that she had to take some ibuprofin before starting her day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison had her goodbyes with Cassie. Cassie was happy to leave for the summer and not have to see Madison's fat ass every day. Cassie slimmed down to a size 0 by years end and could not be around such a fat blob. Madison had a moving team pack up her things and move them into the apartment above the bakery. Madison had a more emotional moment when Jim was cleaning out his place and getting ready to move out of town. Jim gave her many keepsakes to put in her apartment to tide her over until he returned. Madison as she was boxing up some of the keepsakes, decided to sneak in Jim's giant bottle of ibuprofen to also tide her over with all these headaches. Unbeknownst to Madison, that giant bottle of \"ibuprofen\" is where Jim kept his appetite pills. Jim thought his pills got lost in the move, never thinking that Madison ever took them. Probably for the best though since maintaining her weight over the summer was for the best. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison moved into her apartment. Something seemed a little off about the place, but she wasn't going to complain about a pre-furnished apartment. What Madison didn't realize was everything in the apartment was meant for someone of larger size. Wider doorframes, bigger bed, sturdier chairs, bigger fridge. Everything seemed less cramped, but Madison mistook that for colleges packing students into rooms like they were a can of sardines. Madison was ready to get life back on track. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison's first month on the job was a big change for her. After failing her finals, she finally found something that put her in a good mood. And that was working at the bakery. Vinny was an amazing boss. He didn't just allow, he encouraged Madison to eat as much as she sees fit. There was just so much good treats that she couldn't find back at school, that she made sure to take full advantage of what was offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny was a real charmer. He commented on how Madison was just \"skin and bones\" and a girl like her needs a good appetite. He encouraged Madison to eat and eat often. Madison loved the compliments and the encouragement. But what Madison didn't know was how deceiving Vinny was. Vinny knew that all this encouragement would go to Madison's waistline, but unlike Jim, Vinny wasn't about to ruin the illusion by watching her outgrow her clothes. No, Vinny had his wife working hard to hem and extend the waistline of Madison's clothes. So even as Madison grew, her clothes become more loose. The loose clothes were actually something new for Madison, since she couldn't remember a time when her clothes didn't feel like they were painted on. Madison got comfortable with her eating. Clearly she wasn't gaining any weight. If anything, she was losing weight! And so she ate without fear. Her stomach was allowed to expand and thus hold more food. And being surrounded by fattening foods all day<br>\r\nevery day, Madison's weight spiraled. Vinny fed his wife for years and even with her appetite, it took her over 10 years before she ballooned to 650+ pounds. Madison gained weight like it like it was her job (and it kind of was). In the first month, Madison gained a whopping 60 pounds! She had breezed right through 400 pounds and settled right around 420.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't help that she continued to take Jim's pills, which usually led to an early morning gorge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny had never seen someone eat so much so fast. Madison was going to make Vinny a lot of money so as long as she didn't eat through his profits. His wife used to draw quite the crowd and now Madison was quickly becoming the new draw. Who trusts a skinny baker? Madison's decent into pastries got people talking and trying out the latest and greatest pastries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim had returned to town after a month long training session for his new job. While he kept in constant communication with Madison, there was no indication that she was eating as much as she was, though she did mention that Vinny always encourages her to eat and that she thinks that she lost weight since her clothes are so loose. Jim was actually modestly happy about Madison losing a little bit of weight. Without him there, she might had an incident where she could snap out of her denial. What he saw, though was completely different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was Madison completely engulfing the chair she sat on. Her stomach in large rolls resting gently on her massive thighs. Her bottom roll tucked into her loose sweatpants. Madison always had larger thighs, but they had grown out of control. They were thicker than most women's waists. That didn't bode well for hips. As Jim approached Madison, he could see her expansive hips more off the chair than on. Her upper half started to inflate with her mammoth gain. Her arms insulated in a thick layer of fat, she had dimples on her elbows. Her breasts competing for space with her stomach, Madison had no idea what horrors lied under her boobs. The only thing that remained unchanged was her picture perfect face and shoulders. There lied what was left of the 130 pound Madison from college. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison jumped out her chair when she noticed Jim. What Jim noticed was Madison's massive ass which had become just as easy to notice from the front as it was from the back. It jiggled uncontrollably, but was somewhat hidden through the baggy sweatpants. They hugged and embraced for a few minutes, but the whole time Jim was lost in thought. He...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nIt all made sense to Madison now. Her new job was so exhausting that she was turning into this twig of a girl and that's just not what Jim is into. Madison remembered how much Jim used to like to squeeze her body and now being so skinny, there's probably not much left to squeeze. Of course to Madison, being as fat as she was, it never occurred to her that she was over 420 pounds. In fact, she had been fat for awhile now and as the days progressed, being the size that she was felt like the norm. She never did fit well into chairs or climbs stairs and not be out of breath. She always was unable to see past her breasts and she's always struggled fitting into tight spaces like showers, booths, and doorways. That was just the normal things that thinner girls like Madison dealt with everyday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison's objectives were clear. She needed to put on weight. These loose clothes were damning evidence of the weight loss over time. with enough effort, she'd give Jim something to squeeze by the time he came back. She was going to have to get serious if she was going to get soft in time for Jim's return. It wasn't going to be easy, but Madison noticed a few opportunities between work shifts to help put on the pounds. Of course Madison didn't consider the binging she did all day overeating or calorie-laden. Only her plan now was considered just a tad gluttonous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach night after the bakery closed, Madison would sneak into the store and into the back room where Vinny stashed all the baked goods considered too old or stale for retail sale. Vinny had Madison toss those baked goods out each night, but Madison instead stashed them away in a closet. There after work she'd take out all the old baked goods and stuff herself silly. There was so much leftover pastries. Madison had never been presented with so much food before. She tried to take it all down, but even in her most valiant efforts she would come up short. Madison crammed as much food in even before she went to bed. She'd eat and eat until it pained her to move. When she thought she couldn't eat any more, she'd think about Jim and finish off another slice of cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe results early on were not good for Madison. Every couple of days, Vinny would return with Madison's laundry and again all the closes would be really loose. Even the sweatpants needed to be tied just to stay on. Visibly frustrated, Madison continued her late night stuffing sessions. Each night she ate a little bit more, but the results always felt the same. With no scale to check, Madison could only gauge her gain from her clothes. What she didn't notice was how much harder it was to get out of bed in the morning or how long it took her to get to and from work or the long climb of the stairs to her apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving had found little to no improvement through her late night snacking, Madison went on the web and bought some weight gain formula from a reputable fitness company. Madison really wanted to put on the pounds and she'd do whatever it took to get there. So as she was scarfing down pastries after work, she'd pour herself a few weight gain shakes to go with it. Over time, Madison found that the shakes really helped with her late night snacking and the shake helped wash down all the food and make room for more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the week, Madison was feeling her clothes getting tighter. Vinny and his wife were having a tough time keeping up with Madison's growth. As time continued to pass, Madison made sure to keep pushing herself. She ordered more weight gain powder and drank it more often. Madison was so driven, that she'd wake up in middle of the night to down a few shakes until she was so full she passed out. This level of gluttony was putting anything Madison had done in the past to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach delivery of laundry was a success. Soon the clothes went from loose, to fit, to snug, to tight. One night Madison found a rip in the thigh on her sweatpants. She knew she had finally made it...but she didn't want to stop. She kept growing. She continued to eat until she burst out of her clothing. But even after she accomplished her goal, she still didn't stop. Vinny could no longer keep up. He had to order special clothing and Madison was growing out of them before his wife could even adjust them. Madison was finding her new clothes to be a bit snug already and soon enough they too were going to be thrown out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison couldn't stop. Even as the newest clothes were too small to get past her thighs, Madison could only see her goal. She was skipping work because nothing fit, but would still sneak downstairs to the bakery in her underwear at night to binge even more. There she barely squeeze into a booth and consume so much food, she struggled to wiggle out of the booth when she was done. And still she wasn't satisfied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite outgrowing clothes at a terrifying rate, Madison was still in fear that she'd be too thin for her man. Having free time not working while waiting for Vinny to update her wardrobe, Madison stumbled upon some methods for weight gain after she talked to other people online. They suggested tube feeding was the way to go and Madison took on some research as to how to do it. She ordered a funnel and tube and restocked on some weight gain powder. Within a few days, Madison was force feeding herself drink after drink. The first few times were tough to get used to, but by the end Madison was pushing her limits to the farthest one could go. Drink after drink went down her gullet. She'd only break when she was almost gagging because there was no place for the liquid to go. She'd continue once again after her stomach had just enough room to take on another drink. She was constantly begging herself for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong done were the days of her underwear as Madison no longer fit into what was provided by Vinny. She spent entire days force feeding herself on her bed. She rarely slept more than a few hours to make sure she was always full. She constantly told herself that she wasn't big enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was more than big enough. She didn't notice how much harder it was for her to get out of bed or that even when she turned sideways to go through a doorway that her butt and belly began to touch the frames. Each day getting through those doors was getting tougher and tougher. It was starting to become a struggle. Her hips and ass grew so wide, she couldn't even fit into the booth at the bakery anymore (not that she's been at work lately to find out). Walks to the bathroom was making Madison winded. And most notable of all, Madison's once slim and trim face was starting to show the signs of her extreme gain. At first it was subtle, but now Madison was really starting to show off a true double chin and round cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time passed, Vinny began to catch up with Madison's growth...by giving her some of his wife's old clothes. Though from the looks of them, Madison was going to outgrow them in no time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison had finally returned to work for Vinny after his wife's old clothes managed to not burst off the massive Madison's body. He finally ordered custom made elastic pants and top that had a full on patent for their durability. Once Madison outgrew his wife's old clothes there was only so much more they could do to keep making bigger clothes. The new outfit he was ordering were so exclusive he had to wait 2 months to get them and had a lifetime no rip size fit all guarantee. Hopefully they could keep up with the healthy girl for 2 months Vinny thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison's natural pear shape had slowly been turning into an apple with her constant stuffings and fullness but she didn't care. She still spoke to Jim all the time and was excited to see him at the end of summer but there was still 2 months left until he'd be back and she wanted to get as big as possible for 'him'. Athough at this point she was so addicted to eating and gaining she didn't really need a reason to gain except for the fact that it gave her pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer 1st day back was a real struggle. She broke the reinforced stool she used to man the cash register and had to stand for 8 hours which was a huge struggle for the greedy fatty. Vinny apologized to Madison but it would take at least 2 weeks for a new stool to come in and with clothes that fit her she'd have to keep coming to work until she outgrew them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow besides gaining for Jim she was gaining so she wouldn't have to go to work. Every day there were fewer and fewer left overs as Madison ate constantly even if their were customers. By the 5th day to Madison's surprise a milkshake machine was brought in because Vinny started offering milkshakes and with that Madison's stuffings increased. After being trained on the machine she started bringing in her funnel and weight gain powder for an extra oomf to the already extra fattening milkshakes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while her new clothes were barely hanging on for dear life. By the 2nd week of her having to support her own weight without a stool and gaining as much as possible she was sure the clothes were gonna not fit. To her surprise before work in the morning her clothes just barely managed to fit. She got her top just barely buttoned and her pants JUST made it past her ass. 'Damn' thought Madison as she waddled to work. She'd gotten surprisingly mobile the past 2 weeks from constant standing, bending and moving around but even with her musclular gain she was eating way too much for her overworked muscles to keep up. 'Tonight will be the night this outfit dies' she thought as she walked into work and put on her customized apron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stuffed herself all throughout her shift eating and drinking so much that for the 1st time since hiring her Vinny had no leftovers to 'throw away' and actually LOST money with Madison working due to her greed not that he cared because he was loaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was finally the end of the day and her clothes were hanging on for dear life. It was 4:59 and she just left the bathroom after tunneling a weight gain milkshake. She was waddling as fast as her overstuffed treetrunk  thighs could move to switch the open sign to closed when her 2 favorite customers walked in John and Derek who also happened to be closeted FA's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, you made it just in time, would you mind switching the sign to closed please loves\" Madison said as she changed course and started walking towards the register to help the 2 boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem\" John said as he held the door for his friend and then switched the open sign to close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what will you have loves, I got you a half off discount because you know I love y'all!\" Madison said as she took off her apron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn and Derek's eyes widened at the sight of the massive woman in front of them whose buttons looked to be screaming for life as her flesh poked through every conceivable opening. He shirt looked like it was begging to be put out of its misery. Her pants didn't fair much better being see through despite the fact they were black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys I know I'm sexy but you're gonna have to order something or get out, I'm feeling hungry!\" She laughed as she shook her overstuffed belly. By all means she was stuffed but she saw the way the 2 looked at her and always showed off her curves whenever she could around them. They weren't the only 2 regulars that checked her out but they were her favorite and went to the same college she went too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys blushed before Derek spoke up, \"you tease we don't need our favorite employee starving, hey john let's get those last 3 brownies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me, don't want you wasting away sweetie\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia sincerely didn't want to eat any more for the 1st time in what seemed like an eternity but she was not the one to turn down free food. \"I'm in guys, that'd be 3$ with the 50% hookup I'm giving ya\" she winked as she punched in the numbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn handed her a 10 and held another 10 in his hand, \"you know you can keep the change baby, but how about this, if you eat your brownie faster than me and Derek eats ours you can keep this 10 as well\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on bitch! Ready to give me 10$ fool\" she replied as they divided the 3 brownies with Madison getting the biggest piece. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't even a contest, Madison stuffed the whole brownie in her mouth whole and then snatched the other 2 brownies out of John and Derriks hands, She had no gag reflex and had been practicing swallowing as a new party trick to show Jim. Before she even finished swallowing the 1st brownie she out the 2nd then 3rd one in her mouth and drank a little bit of milk to make it all go down. With a big gulp and a swipe of the 10$ bill out of Johns hand she.smiled and wiped the brownie stain off her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you guys I was hungry\" she winked but suddenly felt pains in her stomach. Her confident fascade quickly faded as she rubbed her gurgling belly. Suddenly her belly rushed forward onto the counter as all her buttons popped off at the same time and she let out a room shaking burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 2 guys just stared at each other in amazement, \"that was amazing, you should enter eating contest with that speed, you ate 3 brownies in like 20 seconds or something\" John said. Derek gave Madison a high five, \"that was seriously the loudest burp I've ever heard bro\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison just let out a sigh of relief, \"oh that burp, i do it everyday to signal we're closed\" she said as she rubbed her extended belly which took up nearly a quarter of the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're off?\" John asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we see you all the time, want to hang out?\" Derek asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the destroyed shirt Madison no longer had to go to work tomorrow so she could do the usual and focus on eating but she hasn't seen anyone in such a long time maybe company would be nice.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison\u2019s belly spilled out her shirt as the remaining buttons held on for dear life. Her belly fell to mid thigh level and stuck out well over a foot in front of her. Her belly was wider than her hips which was even more impressive considering her original pear shape. Her double belly at this point was bigger than most chubby girls bellies and her belly button piercing was no longer visible. The boys looked wide eyed as she moved away from the counter and they could really take in its immensity. Signs of a 3rd belly were forming st the top of her double belly as her pale gargantuan belly knocked off a 2nd then 3rd button causing her whole lower belly to show as her shirt struggled to contain her upper belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shirt wasn\u2019t the only thing struggling to contain her though as her pants were practically see through, enjoying the gawking the boys were doing the bent over and placed her hands on the wall as she \u201cpicked up\u201d the pen she pretended too drop. Despite the enormous wide belly, her ass was still spectacular. The boys could see her thing and everything else as her see through pants struggled to contain her mass. Her back rolls were visible through her tight shirt as her muffin top showed. Her pants couldn\u2019t contain all that ass as her upper cheeks were out for the whole world to see. Her thong was practically invisible as her panty lines sunk into her fat and were completely buried within her blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breast were still surprisingly perky as they overflowed her E cup bra. They looked small compared to The rest of her but could hold their own compared to any non 400+ pound woman. They completely eclipsed her view of the ground as she looked down and noticed her pale cleavage, examining her arms next she saw how white she was and that\u2019s when she decided she needed to go out with the boys too get some much needed sunlight, the normally tan half Latina was looking pasty and she was gonna change that today, Jim loves his women big but he fell in love with tan Madison and now that she was growing she was gonna bring the tan back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got up from picking up her pen she looked at John and Derek and smiled, \u201cwell we are officially closed so if you help me finish closing I\u2019ll spend some time with you hunks.\u201d Madison was fiercely loyal to her man but she had to admit both 6 ft plus men were gorgeous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek and John both said sure and asked what they needed to do. And Madison informed them that they just needed to stack chairs since she already wiped everything down. Despite formerly being uncomfortably full now that the bottom buttons were no longer squeezing her belly she found she had some room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was going to be the 1st day in 2 weeks Vinny was actually going to have leftovers until Derek and John stopped by. With them doing most of the hard work for her she just ate away at the leftovers. They swept and mopped while Maddy finished the leftovers. She was egging them on being very flirtatious and the boys were flirting right on back. With everything clean, the cash register counted and the leftovers accounted for in her belly she was ready to go. For the 1st time in a while she was having a proper day out in the most unintentionally revealing clothes ever. Her clothes were still holding up but for how much longer no one knew which encouraged Derrick and John even more to take her out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison who usually left through the now double doors back door left through the front for once as she followed John with Derrick behind her checking out her ass..ets while Maddy made a note of Johns cute butt which caused her to forget to turn to get through the front door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison\u2019s belly squeezed through well enough considering how malleable it was but once she got to her hips she was firmly stuck with her belly through the door and her ass stuck in the building. She pushed against the doorframe with her arms but it was no use. That\u2019s when John mentioned that he could help with Derrick quickly offering his helping hands as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn grabbed her hands while Derrick placed his hands on Madison\u2019s upper back fat. While the leverage wasn\u2019t the best they were trying to be proper gentlemen and it wasn\u2019t working at all so Madison spoke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohn get in here and grab under my armpits and Derrick push from my ass, this is basic physics, we\u2019re in college you all should know this duhh\u201d she laughed as she grabbed John and pulled him into her fat from his forearms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was in heaven as his torso was engulfed by Madison\u2019s massive soft belly and he began to pull. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLower Derrick, don\u2019t be shy I know you love my fat ass, you have permission to dig into it, so get lower and really push.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick who had moved from her upper back to her lower back moved his hands even lower into her voluptuous booty and was surprised as 1st his hands, wrist and then arm until he was elbow deep into Madison\u2019s booty with his face right up against her booty. They pulled and pushed and with a loud crack that took a bit of the doorframe Madison tumbled onto John knocking the wind out of him and Derrick head was submerged into some thick booty meat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was stuck on top of John who despite being at a lost of breath and in some pain was still rock hard underneath the massive woman while Derrick pushed himself out of Madison. She could feel his excitement as well as he got up and she finally rolled off of John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison slowly got up with the help of Derrick and apologized but freaked when she saw the door. She went and grabbed it to close it but the front doorframe was bent out of place. While she wasn\u2019t paying attention Derrick went up to John and helped him up and called him a lucky dog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some tinkering the trio managed to shut and lock the front door despite the broken frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that was eventful start to our hang\u201d Madison laughed, \u201cwhat do you guys want to do\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell my family owns a couple bar/restaurants in the area with a bitchin patio, we could go there and I can get the family discount which means we\u2019d eat and drink for free.\u201d John said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf ya don\u2019t feel bar food my family owns a 3 Mexican restaurants with patios or you could come to our place which has a swimming pool and we can cook up some food and kick it, up to you\u201d  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At this point, Madison had pretty much resigned herself to just wearing sweatpants, and she was getting large enough that her now larger panties were starting to snap again. She would still blame the school washing machines, which shocked Jim, as he wondered how this fat girl didn't realize that she was turning into a whale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne evening, Madison was having her usual normal dinner with Jim. He noticed how her stomach was sitting on top of her soft thighs and he could not wait to take her back to the apartment. If someone had seen her from behind they would be witness to her back boobs and love handles, and a bit of her butt crack, as her sweatpants could not keep up with her new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Jim was thinking about how large she had become, Madison suddenly dropped to the floor with a loud smash. Jim stood up and there was his fat girlfriend, on the floor, rather disoriented by what had just happened. He stood there dumbfounded, his girlfriend had just broken a chair, this was not good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the cafeteria had obviously heard it, and just starred. Jim heard some whispers and he knew this was going to be an awkward situation. Madison of course, recognized the situation, and started to tear up a bit. Jim knew that he needed to get her out of here, so he quickly helped her up, put his hand around her, and led her out. The whole cafeteria had just seen his fat girlfriend break a chair, this was going to spread around campus fast</span></div></div>",

Yes, Madison was the friend who had encouraged her to work out, and then stopped going to the gym at the same time as her so she could build confidence, but there was something else that Cassi felt. When Madison had been encouraging Cassi to go to the gym with her, Cassi got the feeling that it was almost condescending. She didn't appreciate how when she was gaining weight, Madison would still prance around in tight clothing in their room, even though it was the same type of outfits that Cassi used to wear when she was still thin. Plus, Madison was there first hand to deal with the embarrassment of Chris not being into her because of her body. She had even heard through another acquaintance, that Chris was into Madison, which caused her immense jealousy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was something that tripped her interested when she saw Madison snacking way more, and seeming slugish. The next day when Cassi got back from the gym, Madison was changing shirts. Since their were roommates, it wasn't a big deal, but Cassi caught a glimse of Madison's bare stomach. Sure enough, it was no longer the rock hard abs that she had come to powers with and was much softer. Cassi tried to have a firm poker face not to give away her discovery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi had no intention of maliciously fattening up her roommate, or so she thought, but she wondered what it would be like if the tables were turned. If Madison had to be the one who dealt with the social effects of weight gain in college, and she could be the hot one, trying  to help out her fat roommate while feeling superior. Cassi decided to keep the room filled with the snacks that she now had the willpower to resist, and wondered if there was anything else she could do to move things along. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cassi saw that Madison's pants were way too tight to be reasonably worn out. Maybe if it had been a Friday evening, and Madison had been going out for a while...but not for a whole day. Had Madison been able to jump on a scale, she would have seen that she had gained 20 pounds since she had been at the paper, bringing her up to 150 pounds. Not huge by any means, but enough to make her too big for the pants from when she was 130. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison knew that the pants were a bit tight, and she wasn't stupid, she knew that she was gaining weight, she just did not want to jump on the scale and actually find out what her weight was. As long as she did not know it, that allowed her to think that she could burn it off relatively quickly. Before Madison left for class, Cassi texted her, <i>Hey want to meet for lunch?</i> Madison was down for that, <i>Yeah, let's meet at 12:30 after my 11 class.</i> Cassi was walking down the mall as she got the text and wondered how those pants were ever going to survive any extra strain from lunch. She also noticed that Madison was eating more than usual lately, and that combination should be potent. As Cassi got to the gym for her morning workout, she wondered what the lunch hour had in store for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Madison got to the history building in time for her class. When she sat down, she felt  the tightness of the jeans that pushed her stomach over. Additionally, her love handles creeped out from behind her shirt, despite the several times that she tried to pull it down, <i>I really need to buy some looser shirts</i> Madison thought to herself. Some of the guys sitting behind her were shocked by this steady transformation, and did not miss that this was also the girl who was doing the food column in  the paper, something they joked about behind her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class, Madison was starving and went to the dinning hall, where Cassi was sitting, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison, you have to try this pizza, it's so good today,\" Cassi said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison went and got herself two slices and dug in, \"Cassi, this is amazing,\" Madison said, in between bites. Cassi pondered this, she didn't find the pizza to be all that exceptional, but wondered if her hyping of it up for Madison had worked. While she was wondering this, Madison got up, \"Are you leaving already?\" Cassi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I'm grabbing another plate.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi sat there, and was somewhat surprised by this action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison got back and continued to eat 2 additional slices of pizza. Since she sat across from Madison, Cassi could not observe the bloat on Madison's stomach, but she assumed it had to be going on. Just as Madison was about to finish her third slice, Cassi felt something hit her hard on her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oww...what the hell!?\" she said in a somewhat loud voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison immediately knew what happened but could not believe it. She knew because the pressure that was on her belly had ceased, and she suddenly felt a horrifying amount of space for her stomach. Madison leaned in to tell Cassi, \"Cassi, my pants button....it snapped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi wanted to snicker, but she knew that she couldn't in front of Madison, so she instead acted shocked, which she genuinely was. \"Well,\" Cassi said, \"Let's try to get back to the room.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison walked back, trying to carry her book bag in front of her pants to shield the shame and embarrassment of what happened in there. But without the button, she constantly had to stop and pull the back of her pants up, and each time she did that, anyone around her saw what was going on. Madison had never been so embarrassed, she felt like everyone on campus had just seen the effects of her pigging out. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cassi jumped out of her seat and went over to a bag by her bed. \"Hey Mads, guess what?  I got a new scale!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison, still trying to catch her breath after buttoning the jeans, cringed.  After cramming herself into one of the few pairs of pants she could still wear, weight was the last topic she wanted to hear about.  She was sure she had gained a few pounds since she stopped working out.   \"Oh really, why is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the old one wasn't very accurate, kept giving different numbers.  These new electronic scales calibrate to make sure you're in the same position each time, so that each weigh-in is accurate and comparable to the previous ones.  Plus it can track your BMI and body fat percentage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite herself, Madison was impressed with the dedication her roommate was showing.  \"Wow Cassi, that couldn't have been cheap.  Good for you, taking this so seriously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi beamed.  \"I'm gonna try it out right now,\" she said, heading to the bathroom.  A minute later Cassi proudly shouted, \"155.6, that's down 15 pounds from my heaviest!  BMI, 25.8.  Body fat percentage...30%.  Is that good or bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about average, but pretty good considering you just started working out six weeks ago.  I'm usually about 20%...at least I was in high school.\"  Madison frowned.  Could skipping the gym for a couple months really have that much impact on her fitness level?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi came out, still clad in her bra and panties from the weigh-in.  Madison couldn't help but notice the difference in her roommate.  Her friend was still a bit plump, but her love handles were smaller now, and the gut that had been surging over her waistband was replaced by a flatter, more solid mass.  Even the thunder thighs Cassi had been sporting were noticably reduced, only touching near the top.  Cassi's posture and overall confidence had also improved, making the girl's remaining 20 extra pounds less visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Mads, it's your turn!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh Cassi, really?  I just got dressed, and you know, I'm a little bloated...it's almost my time of the month.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly Madison, it's just us here.  I know you've made a big sacrifice not going to the gym when it's most convenient...I just want to help you out by keeping you motivated,\" Cassi lied.  \"Plus, you're MY motivation...you have one of the best bodies on campus, after all.  I want to see how close I am to catching up.\"<br>\r\nMadison sighed, \"Will this really help keep you motivated?\"  Cassi nodded.  \"Alright Cassi, but don't be shocked at the number, I think I've put on a few pounds recently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison unbuttoned the pants, sending the zipper halfway down on its own as her pudge surged forward.  She stripped them off along with her shirt and trudged to the scale, giving Cassi an even better look at her roommate.  Madison's breasts had not been immune from her snacking, as they were more than filling out her C cups, spilling out around the bra and into her armpits.  Her once perfect posture had slackened, thrown off by the added weight, and weeks of sloth sitting around the computer or studying.  It only added emphasis to her bloated belly, as did the low-cut panties that had also grown too small.  Madison still had a fairly defined waist, but it spread out like a bell from there, the adipose flesh bouncing slightly around her belly button and sides as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as her belly had chubbed up in just a couple months, the real surprise for Cassi was Madison's backside as she entered the bathroom.  The pert, round but small ass she'd sported out of high school had grown big, seeking release from the fabric of her underwear on all sides.  Amazingly, Madison's ass seemed tight as ever, just...bigger all around.  Approaching ghetto booty territory, really.  A grin crossed Cassi's face as she noticed a few dimples wobbling on Madison's plump ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OHMIGOD!\" Madison shrieked, \"I weigh 151.2!\"  Cassi entered behind her, trying to contain her glee.  She saw Madison still leaning forward, in shock reading the number.  Cassi couldn't help but notice how Madison's belly heaved out over her underwear in that position, moving up and down as she took each breath.  \"What the fuck!\"  Cassi moved up behind Madison and patted her chubby tummy.  \"Awww, it's not that bad.  You said you were a little bloated, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassi, there's a little bloated and then there's THIS,\" Madison said, shaking the bottom portion of fat hanging around the underside of her belly.  \"And this,\" she added, jiggling her big booty for emphasis.  \"I've gained over 20 pounds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, look, you were quite skinny when you got here.  It's natural to gain a little weight as you grow into your body...at least you didn't gain 35 like me.  Plus you're taller than I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison sniffled, trying to hold back the tears.  \"Do you really think it's not that bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!  Look, you just need to firm up a little.  We can do that with exercises in our room, and then you can keep your promise to me.  I'm still intimidated by your smoking bod, girl, I don't wanna fall off the wagon now.\"  Cassi had to bite her lip for a moment to keep from laughing.  \"You can borrow some of my jeans if you want, until your water weight subsides and we get that booty toned back up.\"  Unable to resist, Cassi punctuated it with a firm slap to Madison's ass, sending it shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved by her good friend's enthusiasm, Madison took Cassi up on the offer of borrowed jeans, and left to work on her next article for the paper.  After waiting a few minutes, Cassi pulled up the web browser and typed in a url:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwww.twitter.com/madisgettingfat<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn evil smile crossed Cassi's face as she saw the account's first tweet, sent from the wi-fi scale nine minutes ago:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeight: 151.2  BMI: 23.7  Body fat: 31%<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi chortled with glee at her plan working, and seeing that Madison's body fat percentage was already exceeding her own.  <i>Hmmmm,</i> Cassi thought, <i>who to share this with first...</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison got her old workout shorts from before, a size small and started to put them on. As she lifted them above her legs towards her large butt, Madison realized it was not going to work. First off, even though they were elastic, they dug into her fleshy midsection to the point where they hurt. Additionally, she felt like she had a bit of trouble with movement, and worst, she could feel how bad the stretching of the pants were, and knew that they had become somewhat transparent, showing off her strained underwear and ass for everyone behind her to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a second of deliberation, Madison walked over to Cassi, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassi, these look ridiculous,\" she said, \"do you have anything I could borrow that fits a little better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi thought about it, and to her slight happiness, she didn't have anything that was clean. She knew she had 4 or 5 pairs of shorts that would contain Madison's growing derriere, but they were all sweat soaked, and even a desperate Madison probably did not want to expose herself to her friend's solid laundry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Madison, I don't. I have not washed my athletic gear in a while.\" Cassi then suggested, \"you could always put off working out until you have a chance to go buy some shorts that fit you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Madison quickly rejected the idea, \"I need to do this now. The gain has already gotten out of hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, if you say so.\" Cassi responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison found an over-sized shirt that somewhat hid her new love handles created by her month long excess but exacerbated by the tight pants she was stuck with. As Cassi got ready to go to the gym with Madison, she noticed her roommate was a far cry from the image she was a month ago. No longer was she in her well fitting gear that showed off an active lifestyle, she looked like someone who didn't get out as much, or a girl who could not shake those last few pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked into the gym, they walked past the locker room, where two other freshman girls were exiting the pool. The girls had bodies rivaling Madison's at the beginning of the year, and they were seated down the way from her and Cassi. The girls were getting ready to dry off, but not making much of an attempt to cover up, displaying supreme confidence and comfort that seemed to be lacking in Madison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" Madison wispered to Cassi, \"don't you wish they would just cover up?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Cassi responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like, we get you, you have a great body, but you don't have to flaunt it everywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi was partially stunned. Madison Kraft was bitter about another girl's appearance? This was not the disposition of the girl she knew, who previously had been at the top of the looks and popularity food chain. These were the comments of a girl who was becoming deeply self conscious, who was noticing her imperfections compared to others, and it left Cassi surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they had put their stuff in the lockers, they walked out to the gym floor. Cassi was somewhat eager to show Madison her knew workout abilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mads, let's go hit the track and run 4 or 5 laps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right away? Don't you want to get started on something else first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we can do core later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison knew that 8 laps on the track equaled a mile, so doing half of one should not have been an issue, she assumed. As Cassi and her started jogging, the first lap was fine as each kept on a modest pace, that was still slower than Madison's previous clip. However, during the second lap, Cassi noticed that Madison was already heavily sweating, and breating extremely deep. <i>Tired after .25 of a mile?</i> Cassi thought to herself. Midway through the third lap, Madison suddenly stopped and put her hands on her knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassi, I need to take a breather,\" she said between deep breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi could hardly believe it. Madison was clearly out of shape. Madison used the bottom of her shirt to wipe off her face, and in doing so, showed off her soft belly, and just how deep the shorts were cutting into her gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, let's try the bikes instead.\" Madison said to Cassi, figuring that would have to be easier than the track. Cassi was fine with that. She knew she would not be getting a workout if Madison had to keep stopping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the gym, the row of bikes were lined up in front of treadmills in a way that allowed everyone to see the wall of TVs in the front of the gym. It was an efficient set-up, but it also meant that anyone on the treadmills could pretty easily check out those on the bikes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Madison got on, she again felt how tight her shorts were, but she was not the only one to notice. A group of guys who took intro to world lit with her now saw their classmate's butt trying to escape her extremely tight clothing. As Madison got going, the shorts stretched slightly more, causing the fabric to become even thinner, and showing her scrunched up underwear, caught deep in a wedgie. Madison could feel it caught like this, however, what was she going to do? Reach in and pull it out in front of the whole gym? Little did she know, the guys behind her already had take notice, and could not longer keep to themselves once she sweat soaked shirt began to right up a bit in the back, showing off her fleshy love-handles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, what's happening to Madison?\" One asked to the other while jumping of the treadmill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she is turning into a real porker.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those shorts look like they have not fit for about 20 pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yikes. I wonder what she weighs.\" They said as they were walking by Cassi, who thought to herself, <i>Well, there's a way to find out.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the workout period, of which Cassi thought Madison spent more time being tired than actually moving, they went back to the dorm, and Cassi floated an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how about we wait 2 weeks, and then we weigh ourselves to stay motivated and accountable.\" Cassi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that sounds like a good idea, I suppose.\" Madison said, not knowing the results would be going on twitter.com/madisgettingfat <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the week, Madison found excuses not to go to the gym. She had some legitimate ones, a paper due, or a restaurant to eat out at and review, but other times, Cassi would get back from the gym and see Madison just sitting on the couch reading a magazine or watching TV. Cassi didn't say   anything, but she suspected Madison was having trouble exposing herself to the reality that she needed to lose weight, and preferred not to think about it. However, a weigh in was coming soon, and with Madison seemingly only wearing Cassi's jeans, Cassi suspected it would not end well for her roommate. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the mounting stress of her upcoming test, Madison had abandoned Cassi's jeans and had spent the past week lounging around in her trusty old sweatpants, which were kinder to her growing waistline. Madison had been glued to the couch studying on her laptop, almost always being accompanied by a bag of chips, a carton of cookies, a barrel of cheese puffs, or whatever junk food she had chosen to mindlessly snack on that day. Although everyday she considered working out, she always found an excuse to stay inside, spending the time she could be losing weight watching TV or grabbing an extra meal in the cafeteria. Today was no different. Madison sat on the couch with her laptop perched on her thighs while making her way through an entire box of Double Stuff Oreos. Little did she know that six weeks had past since their last weigh-in. Cassi had extended the time period between the weigh-in's because she didn't want to scare Madison into trying to lose weight, as Madison seemed to remain ignorant of the consequences of her unhealthy lifestyle. Suddenly, as Madison reached for the last Oreo, the door opened, and in came Cassi, fresh from her workout clad in yoga pants and a sports bra, revealing her flat midsection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Madison!\" Cassi almost screamed, \"I can't believe I forgot about the weigh-in! I can't wait to see how much weight you lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison felt her stomach drop. She had completely forgot about the weigh-in. Cassi went into the closet and grabbed the scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Cassi. I'm kind of bloated again and I haven't been to the gym as much as I would have liked to. Can't we do it sometime later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly, Madison. It's no big deal. Weighing yourself won't hurt. It's only a number,\" Cassi said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Alright I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison walked up and stepped on the scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison, what are you doing? You have to take your clothes off. Don't you want an accurate number?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison stepped off before a number could appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really Cassi? It probably only makes a few ounces of a difference,\" Madison responded, reluctant to show her fit friend her growing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Madison! It's not like anyone else is going to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, whatever,\" Madison replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison started with her shirt, which already had become too small since she had bought it only a month earlier. She pulled itt over her head, revealing her chubby belly and her now d cup bra. Her belly sagged over the waistband of her sweatpants and her love handles now had red stretch marks. She adjusted her bra, which was already becoming uncomfortable as her breasts spilled out around the sides. Cassi's side view of Madison was astonishing. The girl with the once model-like body now had a terrible slouched posture and a pot belly that extended past her breasts. Madison's belly formed rolls as she bent over and pulled her pants down, revealing her enormous butt and thighs. She pulled her panties out from her butt-crack as she stepped over onto the scale. Cassi watched her thighs and butt, which were now covered in cellulite, jiggled with each step. Madison's tight panties gave her an obvious muffin-top above her butt, which was officially a \"fat ass\". She closed her eyes for a second in fear of the number that was now forming on the small screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Madison. 166.4 pounds and a BMI of 26.1! Someone needs to hit the gym!\" Cassi said as she slapped her friend's plump belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's my turn!\"</span></div></div>",

She thought back to how she had felt superior to Cassi back when Cassi had blown up at the beginning of the year. Now that was only a memory, as she saw her friend slip off her yoga pants to reveal very toned legs that let up to a well sculpted butt that was a bit smaller than the one that Madison used to have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's see what I'm at\" Cassi said, stepping on the scale. Madison stood watching, in contrast to her time on the scale where she feared the number that came up, she was very curious what Cassi's would flash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n135 lbs, BMI of 22.5. \"This is great!\" Cassi said with excitement, \" I'm back to my starting weight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison felt as small of a person person had she even been, not physically of course, but she felt unaccomplished and like she had failed. In one way she had, her hot body was now gone. As she stared at her roommate and current best friend, all Madison could feel was jealousy. She also feared that the college hierarchy was shifting as Cassi was quietly becoming known as the 'hot' roommate between them, while Madison knew that she was being ridiculed for blowing up like she had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi could see that Madison was increasingly torn up by all of this, and possibly on the verge of tears, but she still remembered how condescending Madison seemed when the roles had been reversed. Plus, Cassi reasoned, it's not like she was fattening Madison up. The only thing that she could be accused of was using Madison as motivation, and it was working. She was now back to her starting weight at Powers, but in far better shape. Her abs were tonned and she loved to jog. She knew all the regulars at the gym, and loved it. \"Madison, I was just thinking, you're only 4 pounds away from my highest weight, that's crazy.\" She said in faux astonishment, realizing that she was being somewhat cruel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison, who was sliding sweatpants back on over her plump frame, responded with a, \"Ugh. I really need to work out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can always lose it, look at me, I was able to!\" Cassi said, trying to rub it in a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can see that, Cassi.\" Madison said, angry and walking into the next room while she slipped a shirt on that covered the back-boobs which were creeping onto Madison's bloated rear frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, Madison got only a salad from the cafeteria. \"This is it,\" she said, sitting down next to Cassi, \"I'm going to diet even if it means depriving myself of amazing food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the paper?\" Cassi asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll deal with that later.\" Madison responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you always have had better will power than me.\" Cassi said, staring at Madison's bloated stomach, which was clearly evident under her tight shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the week, Cassi noted, Madison seemed to be cheating on the diet with such regularity that she was almost eating worse off than before.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her new flabby form made her feel sorry for herself, especially while watching Cassi flaunt the sexy body that she used to have herself. Feeling down fueled Madison's appetite for comfort foods, often she would eat even when she wasn't hungry, or had just eaten an hour or less before. Pizza and chocolate chip ice cream, with a packet of oreos, and a glass of milk, then a beer, always beer, day in, day out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was crossing the line into the range that most people would consider \"chubby.\" She was certainly far from the \"Hollywood ideal\" physique that she had last year. So far, Madison had packed just north of 45 pounds of pure unadulterated fat onto her 5' 7\" body, bringing her to a weight of 180 lbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of this had settled around her waist, giving Madison a protruding gut, which was threatening to outrun her bust in a horizontal race. Her navel had turned into a crease dividing the belly into two fleshy sections, the lower roll sagging down a couple inches over her belt-line. Madison's enormous breasts could now rest on her plump paunch. Below, her thighs met each other from her crotch to about 3/4 of the way to her knees.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cassi felt less and less bad about Madison's weight as the weeks went by, and she kept her own former poundage off. The now hot blonde was as confident as ever, and that had carried over to success with guys. While Madison started staying in on a lot of Friday nights, Cassi started going out more, always excited to wear some new piece that she never would have attempted in her old, chubby body. It was what Cassi always thought college would be while she was in high school; going to frat parties, getting drunk, meeting guys--and she was loving it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing that separated Cassi from her previous excess, however, was that now even through hangovers, she worked hard to keep the weight off, often running miles while wanting to throw up, just to keep her hot body. She was now a constant fixture at the gym, and was getting to know the other gym rats, including a familiar face that had sent most of this chain of events forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, when Cassi was getting off the treadmill and getting ready to leave the gym, an old friend of hers, Chris, walked up and struck up a conversation. Chris was tall, trim, and have great features. Cassi wanted to resent him, given that he had not so subtly told Madison that he wasn't interested in Cassi back when she was larger, but now...well, he seemed genuinely into her, giving her all the signs that she could normally pick up on. After around ten minutes of chatting, they decided to meet up that Friday, and that Friday led to another repeat date, and the result repeated itself after that. They ended up dating for a month around the time that Madison had hit 180 pounds, and neither wanted to tell Madison. Chris, because he didn't really talk with Madison ever, and Cassi because she knew that Madison knew that Chris didn't like larger women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after a month of considering herself in love with Chris, she decided it was time to move on from Madison and move in with Chris. Cassi thought it was justified. At first she enjoyed seeing her perfect roommate, go a bit, but now, it was less fun for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Cassi entered the room, Madison was watching TV, and finishing up with a pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Madison, we need to talk about something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" Madison asked, hoping that Cassi had not noticed that she consumed the last of Cassi's most recent bag of chips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going to move out and move in with my boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was stunned, \"What boyfriend?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been seeing Chris for a few weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Chris? From the gym?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was floored that Cassi would go for this person, even more so now because she was empathetic to larger girls while still loathing her own situation. Additionally, she was hurt that Cassi would want to move in with someone else, especially after their year together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When are you going to move?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the end of the semester seems like a good time.\" Cassi responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just can't believe this,\" Madison protested, \"We're friends, I helped you lose your freshman weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...welll.\" Cassi did not know what to say, it's true that Madison did that, but now that she was trim again, she didn't like having a lame and fat roommate like Madison. She wanted to be with Chris and her hot friends, and didn't mind acing Madison out of their circle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was so angry she got up and left for a walk around campus, leaving Cassi in the room alone. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison was having a bad day of class, and even though she had a mountain of homework and an assignment due for the paper the following day, all she wanted to do was work out. It had been another week since the scale incident, and Madison had not weighed herself, but the looseness of Cassi's pants had helped her put her mind off her weight for a little bit. However, even beyond still feeling a bit of the promise to Cassi about letting her find her own in the gym, Madison needed to get this work done before she did any exercise routines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't to say she did not constantly notice the weight, now, when Madison sat down, she felt her hips spreading like they never had before, and with her in full knowledge that she was over 150, and it was not doing good things for her self esteem. Madison was grateful that she could wear Cassi's clothes, but she wanted to fit into <i>her</i> clothes again, the ones that she bought, and that she knew were hot, or at least were hot when a cow was not wearing them, she thought. However, an odd dynamic set in that Cassi was shocked, but not displeased to see, Madison almost seemed to be eating up to the level of her current body weight. Instead of taking it as a wake up call, and igniting a course of action, Madison seemed to be in full flight mode, and was eating greasy meals in the cafeteria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne such instance, Cassi met her after changing from the gym, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was the workout?\" Madison asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, the more I do it, the more I want to keep going.\" Cassi said as they walked into the food area together. When they got back to the table, Cassi noticed that Madison had grabbed a burger, much in contrast to the salad that she was eating, even though she tried to hold her poker face, she accidentally shot Madison a look of disbelief. She could not help it, this was not the beach bod girl that she knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The diet starts in a few days,\" Madison responded, \"we need to start working out in tandem again. I want to lose this weight by spring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, one burger will not hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this isn't a good start, but I've been having a really bad day, and this just looked so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justified,\" Cassi said, trying to sound convincing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Madison shifted the conversation to a guy. \"Hey, you know Mike over there,\" she said, nodding a few tables down, \"I heard him and Grace just broke up, I think I may start texting him a bit more, and see if anything is there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Cassi said, somewhere between being sincere and not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just heard he was into Kelly, and thought she was really hot. I don't know do you think it's a coincidence...about Grace?\" Cassi said, referring to his ex-girlfriend who had gained around 15 pounds since coming to the school, but then leveled off, unlike Madison. Given Madison's sudden look of frustration, Cassi was also sure that Madison connected Kelly's almost pencil thin physique and realized that she may have let herself slip down a league. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I really need to lose this weight.\" Madison said, while getting up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, maybe we will run into him on Friday. You've never had problems getting guys in the past, let's go out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but we need to work out first.\" Madison said as she was walking away. Cassi was sure to take note of Madison's growing behind as she went back into the food area, and assumed she had to have gained weight. About a minute later, Madison came back with some ice cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater in the day, Cassi was walking through the dorm common area when Kelly and Megan caught up with her. \"So, not to be mean,\" Kelly said, which almost always meant something mean was coming, \"but like, what is going on with Madison?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Cassi asked, knowing perfectly well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...her weight, she looks a lot more puffy.\" Megan said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what do you think she weighs?\" Kelly asked, \"She really needs to be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi pondered whether to give the two girls the URL she had created, with the knowledge that it would probably be updated soon. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If two things could be said of Madison's personality, it was that she couldn't refuse an opportunity opened to her and that, whatever she did, she threw herself in with gusto--some might say, obsession. Truth be told, if she really thought about it, that had at least as much to do with her killer body as her good genes. Between some crucial developmental changes and the pressure of an older, somehow prettier, athletic sister, Madison had been heading into high school with her weight on an upward trajectory and looking a bit chubby. Alexa seemed to have the category of \"hottest Kraft sister\" sewn up, after all, so without any sense in competing, Madison let herself blossom into a different rung of high school society and a lower tier of freshman boys who no less loved her softening Latin curves. It wasn't until her favorite teacher, who happened also to be the school cheer coach, took a special interest in the increasingly unhealthy but dedicated young girl and personally invited her to train for cheerleading tryouts, that Madison's life took the shape it had now. Once someone pointed Madison to the workout room, she was an undeterrable force, and well before senior year she'd become the taught and toned 130 lb. cheer captain that now graced the halls of Powers and, more immediately, the office of the student paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, that doesn't mean that she was good at <i>everything </i>she threw herself into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim stared troubled into the drafts on his desk, looked up and across at Madison for a moment as though about to speak and hesitated thoughtfully again. \"It's just--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no good. ...is it.\" She looked disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no--technically, grammatically, structurally, it's fine. I mean, but yeah, I can't run either of these, sorry. Look, you're a fine writer; it's just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison glimpsed a window and her disappointment shifted to determination. Maybe she could muscle her way to success after all. \"Just...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's distant. No feeling. It's like you know your subjects academically. The fashion piece, it's like you're reporting the weather. And the food review--I know I kind of threw that on you just to test you, and we need someone on the column like yesterday--well, it's like you've never <i>eaten</i> before. I mean, I've been to Marcella's, and you're describing the factual properties of every eggplant parm on the civilized planet. Frankly, I'm not even sure you actually ate there. There's no life, no <i>passion</i>.\" Jim suddenly backed off, embarrased, and Madison said nothing. \"That probably sounds out there and really self-important. I know it's just a food review for a college paper. It's just--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just that writing that connects with people has life in it.\" Her eyes were fixed on his in understanding, as though reading them like a teleprompter. \"And that life comes from passion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim was surprised. And a little aroused. \"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do it,\" her eyes flashed. \"I totally get what you're saying, and I can do them better. Give me another shot, chief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, keep calling me 'chief.' Second, I've got to move on the fashion column, and I've already got someone else ready to move into it. So if you're serious about this, I need another food review in two weeks, and I need it written by basically a completely different person than the one that wrote this chilling analysis of breaded aubergine. Can you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the next issue is in a week. Why two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because frankly I'm not sure that you <i>can</i> do this, and two weeks probably still isn't enough time. Sorry to be brutal, but they don't call me 'chief' for nothing--well, presumably <i>you</i> don't--and by the way, I'm going to need you to start spreading that 'chief' thing around. Look, I can tell you're a people-person; let's say you can connect with people. But to connect with the readers I need you to connect with <i>food</i>, and...\" Jim figured he might as well go for broke: \"I just have a feeling you have kind of a...distant relationship with it.\" There was silence. Madison did not react to the prejudgment as Jim feared she might. He was used to pulling no punches and, for that matter, earning a few punches back for it. \"I have no idea what you're going to do in two weeks, but I promise I'll read anything you put on my desk by that deadline.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison had been silent because she knew he was right. Sure, Jim was being an ass and <i>could have</i> been way off base. Maybe Madison's body <i>did </i>look especially fit in her high-cut shorts and tight tank. Maybe Madison <i>had</i> showed up at the office on her way to the gym (Cassie couldn't expect her to go cold turkey yet, could she?). And Maybe she <i>had</i> already squeezed in a five-mile run that morning, apportioning the proper amount of calories accordingly. But none of that meant that she had a \"distant relationship with food.\" It just happened to be true anyway. \"Chief,\" she said firmly, perhaps a bit flirtatiously, \"I do have passion. And you'll see just how much.\" With that, she turned on a toe and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she sat back in the dorm room alone with little else to do, with Cassie at <i>her</i> gym, Madison was having doubts and, quite frankly, starting to feeling a little crazy thinking about food in terms of a \"relationship.\" It wasn't an unhealthy one. She certainly remembered loving food, loving to eat, but she never gave any thought until now that that just wasn't there anymore. It's not like they had a \"falling out\"--just that in the fitness fervor that seized her a few years ago the role of food kind of shifted and became more utilitarian: fuel that kept her tight body turning heads. She thought in calories rather than flavors. And where she was certainly right, that she did have passion, she wasn't sure what it would mean to <i>feel</i> anything when she ate. Somehow she wouldn't be defeated, by journalism of all things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt an impasse for the moment, Madison went to lower herself to the floor for some quick, surreptitious sit-ups--addict that she was--when her eye caught a bright flyer sticking out of her bag. \"Huh,\" she mused, and seized the familiar paper. \"Cooking Club.\" Checking her watch against the printed meeting schedule, she saw she had just enough time to make it to the lunch group. \"Man,\" she thought, \"they do sure meet a lot. This could really help to fill out my schedule until Cassie's ready to work out with me again.\" Without a sit-up crunched, Madison bounded off to learn the secret to irresistible gourmet macaroni and cheese. (Hint: mostly, a lot of butter and cheese.)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Madison was on her longest vacation from the gym in three years, Cassi ramped up her commitment from zero to 60. It was doubtless a struggle. Unlike Madison, Cassi's former physique was the result more of youth and once more-reasonable eating than disciplined fitness regimens, and now she was downright out of shape. Still, she managed to drag her heavier frame back and forth from the gym with an almost imitation regularity compared with Madison's old schedule, determined to reclaim her old '9' body and close the gap between Madison and \"Madison's fat roommate,\" maybe even get herself some abs this time too and rival her '10' roommate. Only a week and a half into the friends' arrangement and down only five pounds, the chunky blonde had few results to show yet--at least not at first glance. Coming back from her evening workout, Cassi was nearly drenched and still breathing hard, but she undoubtedly carried more energy lately, and confidence. After a couple of days of powering into something like Madison's routine, Cassi had changed her habits drastically, kicking her between-meal grazing and junk food, even moving her stash of snacks from her side to the middle of the dorm, where it had remained as of yet untouched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll while Cassi was being consumed with the beginnings of her own transformation, she hadn't noticed the changes in Madison's own demeanor. Come to think of it, between her shifts and the gym, classes and, well, wherever it is Madison had been off to, she hadn't seen much of the girl. Only after she collapsed in a chair to remove her running shoes did she notice Madison slouched behind a monitor, quietly working away at her desk. Working away at two things, actually: an article, and some leftover Chicken Florentine. The half batch of lobster biscuits don't count; she had already finished those by the time Cassi returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhh!\" Madison swallowed, finding herself discovered. \"This is so good, Cass. I just learned how to make this. ---Well, mine wasn't as good, but I'm catching on quick. It's fascinating how the flavors are brought together. In fact--mmhhh!\" She interrupted herself with another sizable bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you had another week to submit your column again,\" Cassi questioned. Unconsciously her hands felt her own enticed pot belly as the fragrance of the buttery sauce reached her nose. Strange, she thought, that she thought she also smelled cheddar biscuits and maybe something else . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill masticating an overly large forkful of poultry and pasta Madison had turned furiously to the keyboard. \"Mmhm. And I'm not writing it yet. I'm practicing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cooking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cooking, tasting, writing. --Seriously, Cass, I'm learning a lot. Who knew there was so much to food?-- I'm going back to Marcella's,\" she paused to pop some chicken in her mouth, \"and I'm going to rewrite my first piece. Jim was right. I didn't appreciate the food, so I couldn't write about it. But I will.\" She flashed a smile, spinache in her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi had to admit she was pleased. Maybe it was silly, but she was a little worried about kicking Madison out of the gym for a while. She was a great friend and a great girl, but as driven as she was she needed an outlet to be balanced. The whole foodie thing was a weird fit on Madison, and that phase might take getting used to as short-lived as it would probably be, but she seemed happy. She apparently wasn't wearing workout clothes out of habit anymore, which actually may have been a little less weird than this new gushing over food. Of course that didn't mean that she showcased her gorgeous body any less, wearing tiny jean shorts and a tight Powers tee. --Though, come to think of it, Cassi noticed, was that a little bulge pushing out gently against Madison's waistband? Maybe it was how she was sitting. Maybe it was all the food she very evidently ate that evening. Maybe. But it was still nothing Cassi had ever seen on her perfect roommate before, who was now apparently mixing biscuit crumbs into her remaining Florentine and savoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and Cass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi work back up to her own couple of rolls with some 30 pounds to go before she could judge Madison for indulging a little bit on her gym-vacation, which was after all for her friend's benefit. \"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're totally welcome of course to the leftovers I bring back from Cooking Club. A lot of the dishes might not be great for your diet, but seriously, you know where they are. I just noticed some of it being eaten this week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um. I didn't notice you'd been bringing stuff back. I haven't been in the fridge,\" she replied honestly and got up for some last cool down stretches before her shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird,\" Madison trailed off, scraping the bottom of the dish and settling back in her desk chair. \"But you know what article someone needs to write... How it is the cafeteria food has actually been getting pretty good lately! Tell me you've noticed that.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cassi thought she was making progress. Sure, her loss had slowed down a bit, only three pounds so far this week, but as she finished another workout at the gym, she reasoned that all the weight wasn't just going to fly off without any effort. <i>If it were easy to lose a ton of weight, everyone would be thin,</i> Cassi thought to herself. Still, she could not deny that the gym workouts were getting a bit less strenuous. When she started with that horrible workout with Madison, every movement felt like the last thing she could do before she was about to collapse, her body seemingly working against months of indulgence on top of a less than active (but satisfactory at the time) lifestyle in high school. She still felt like a beached whale surrounded by sleek gym bodies, but she felt less helpless, and more in control at the gym, like she at least knew what she was doing. Although it was still hard, and she still sweated it out every workout, she was starting to understand why some people said it felt good to work out, and why people like Madison actually liked going to the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, at least Madison used to. Over the past week Madison didn't once try to go to the gym with Cassi, something Cassi had noticed, and she wondered if Madison was being a great friend, or if the lack of activity had caused Madison to get a bit more comfortable with the lifestyle of a lazy college undergrad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Cassi got home, she saw Madison still typing away at the computer, \"How the was the workout Cassi?\" Madison asked, momentarily pausing from the frantic typing pace she seemed to be at before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! I think I'm really getting the hang of it,\" Cassi said, walking over to get a glass of water from the sink, where she noticed a 24 ounce bottle of soda. <i>What?</i> she thought to herself, <i>since when did Madison start drinking pop?</i>. Tucking the thought away, Cassi inquired more about Madison's day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's the article coming along?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...I hope it's as good as Marcella's was last night. Ohmygod, it was so good. I know I shouldn't but after the chicken roule...but it just looked so good in the menu! Cassi, we have to go back there sometime so you can try it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi was a bit surprised to see Madison gush about the food like this, despite it becoming a more frequent occurrence, \"Yeah, Mad, when I finish this diet, we should go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you'll get there,\" Madison said, not condescendingly, but still with absurdness that Cassi knew could only come from someone who was thin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways,\" Madison continued, \"want to go get lunch? I'm starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the leftover pork from two nights ago,\" Cassi asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well...I got hungry and had a little snack last night.\" Madison replied, somewhat embarrassed. Cassi didn't consider the amount of pork left to be \"little\" by any standard, and even in her carefree diet of old, she never would have gone that deep into it. When Madison got up to go to the cafeteria, wearing shorts and a T-shirt, Cassi was sure that outline of a stomach wasn't just bloat, Madison had actually lost her hard abs. Yes, she was still thin by everyone's definition, but Cassi wondered if she should consider inviting Madison back to the gym, before her roommate let her body slip away under her newfound love culinary creations. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Wow,\" Jim remarked as if to himself and momentarily raised his eyes across to the clearly self-satisfied co-ed. He returned to the page and continued silently running his lips over the vowel adn consonant sounds of the more impressive lines. Finally he set it down and sat back. \"OK, so when I said the piece had to be written by a completely different person... I've gotta say, this doesn't read <i>anything </i>like a couple weeks ago. You're telling me <i>you</i> wrote this?\" There was some sincere incredulity in his question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same person,\" Madison quipped. She didn't have to ask whether it was good; she had felt it. \"I got in touch with my passion,\" she shrugged and took a couple of long, sultry steps toward the editor's desk before smiling casually. She did think Jim was pretty cute--especially when she could get a little rise out of him like most of the boys--but truth be told her attention was now beginning to drift back to the memory of that sauce at Marcella's. She wondered if she could recreate it--better than last night's attempts at least--and began compiling a mental list of the ingredients she'd need, allowing for some experimental batches to taste, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say. You really got into this. I mean, you're describing an <i>experience </i>with this eggplant. And the tiramisu part...well, let's just say we actually might have to censor that part. This isn't Penthouse, you know. I'll be honest, I was kind of bull-shitting a little bit before--what do I know about food? I live on rice and beans--but I'm glad I did. You seriously sound like you know what you're talking about here.\" Just like that, he was drawn back into the page again. \"A completely different person...\" he mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there <i>was </i>something a little different about her, not just her perspective on food--a remarkably, suddenly intimate perspective on food. Standing before the same desk as two weeks ago she looked a bit...fuller. Mostly around the hips, maybe a little bit on her belly, and that was a word more appropriate in describing her body than it'd been two weeks ago, before she started throwing herself into cooking--and eating. Her jeans, which had always been tight against her sleek and toned tighs, hugged her more than they had previously and pushed up gently where her once rock-hard abs had softened into a bit of puffy flesh that hinted of a muffin top beneath her shirt. She looked as though perhaps she'd just had an especially large meal, and given all the research she surely must have done for the revision, Jim assumed as much unconsciously and didn't take more notice of the subtle changes. In actuality, and as a far departure from her recent habits, she hadn't eaten since breakfast, and her softening tummy was rumbling. Of course, the fact that she'd actually strung together a few waking hours without indulging her awakening taste buds was by no means because she noticed the added eight pounds she was squeezing into her jeans. Madison had been totally engrossed in her latest culinary explorations on the other side of campus when she realized she'd be late for her meeting with Jim--worse, would definitely miss the delicious lunch she'd been anxiously slaving over--and had to run to get there in time. She was still late, but only because she had to take a minute or two in the hall to catch her breath. Even now, her lungs still felt the effect of the first real physical exertion she'd had in some time, but her mind had been working on the best way to preserve the flavor of the risotto when she'd reheat it later--or maybe she'd just have to make another batch in order to know how it really turned out. \"Screw it,\" she thought. \"It's going to be damned good risotto once I make it fresh, and Cassi can help with the extras.\" Of course the new disciplined Cassi hadn't been helping with the extras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whoever you are, or whoever it was that wrote that book report before, you're hired. I mean, not 'hired'--we're not paying you, obviously--but jeez, keep turning in high-class food porn like this and maybe we should. ...but not really. You'll get an English credit, probably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Madison bubbled. \"What's my first assignment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the desk on this column now, so I'll give you some direction and be the one to tell you 'no,' but by the power invested in me you're the expert on this now. You tell us what's hot--err, what's tasty. Plus, something gives me the feeling you've been working on some ideas already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison beamed at this, delighted. Her face was still as slim and defined in features as ever, but something in the natural dimples she flashed just then complimented the new fullness of her hips and suggested a heavier Madison as imaginable, which no one would have found thinkable when catching sight of her cut figure on the elliptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I wrong?\" Jim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So many ideas. Just one article a week?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!\" Jim wagged his pen toward her playfully. \"Write as many articles as you want on your time. Give me the best <i>one</i> each week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison nodded and turned to leave, still elated at her inevitable and self-willed achievement. \"The indomitable Madi Kraft,\" she thought. \"The <i>starving</i> Madi Kraft.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mads,\" Jim chimed after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to him again. \"Chief?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, though. Where'd this come from?\" He was holding up the new draft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison paused and fixed a knowing gaze on him. \"I told you,\" she smirked. \"Passion. Tell you what: Why don't I cook you a real dinner one night. Maybe I can teach you something.\" And Madison was gone--full hips wiggling after. \"You can do better than rice and beans!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Eight pounds in two weeks. Down eight pounds in two weeks.\" This was Cassi's mantra as she pounded the treadmill today. It kept her mind on the prize and off the still foreign jiggles of her over-indulged body, which already was feeling tighter and, beneath all that extra padding, toner even. The routine, which she'd adapted from Madison in Madison's absence from the gym, was grueling, but her early results were motivation enough, and as her energy levels increased from regular aerobic activity and clean eating she was finally beginning to understand why her roommate actually loved working out so much. Maybe it wasn't a Miami-princess vanity that had kept the taller brunette looking like a swimsuit model while Cassi's own body piled on<i> a couple </i>of freshman 15s. Maybe she could forgive her friend for keeping such a killer figure after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But enough about South Beach,\" she thought as she dismounted the treadmill, her road back to bikinis, and caught herself in the wall-length mirror of the workout room. \"We're getting some good old Middle American cute here.\" She checked her reflection out with confidence. Under the extra layer of fat she'd begun to make peace with until Madison intervened, the blonde could more clearly discern her old trim, Harvest Queen body. And just a hair below that was a whole other level hottness she was going to carve out of that doughy physique she'd accumulated. \"At this rate, a couple of months and I'll have the body of Madison Kraft.\" After all, Cassi may have been starting way behind, but she was jumping essentially into the tanned fitness queen's own rigorous--and otherwise unoccupied--schedule. \"That is, if she doesn't meet me somewhere in the middle...\" Cassi wasn't stupid. She knew that Madison was sneaking in workouts here or there for part of the first week, and in all reasonableness she hadn't expected someone like Mads to swear off physical activity altogether, just to make herself a little more scarce around the gym so Cassi could have a little space to get things under control--wobbling being one of those things. Now, however, she felt like she hardly saw Madison move, except maybe to rush off to Cooking Club and drag herself lethargically back from class, and whatever else was evidencing, it was clear that a pattern was settling in that kept her running shoes untouched in the corner and the chip bags continually shifting about on the shelf, shrinking and somehow magically refilling as a different flavor. \"That's all right,\" she thought. \"When Madi's fat, I can help her trim down and be the average-looking roommate.\" She laughed without a tinge of guilt, because she knew it'd never happen. Madison Kraft would never--<i>could</i> never--get pudgy. \"Not like tubby over here,\" she gave her now-smaller pot belly a good-humored slap, indifferent to who saw. \"Hell with it. Tubbs isn't long for this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she began to strut away to the lockers she suddenly recognized the figure cooling down on the treadmill not far from her. Apparently the eye of the tiger wasn't any help to her spotting men. \"Hey, you're Jim, yeah?\" Cassi recognized his face from the Facebook profile Madison showed her, and she was right: he was something to look at all right. She approached. \"Sorry, not a creeper. I'm Madison Kraft's roommate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Yes, of course, she's mentioned you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No she hasn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she hasn't,\" he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jim. Um, right. Sorry, it's really just business when she and I talk--that is, you know, word counts and...stuff. Not that I'm... Because we... I'm just saying you wouldn't have come up.\" Nope. Didn't land that one. He was flustered and caught off guard to have been approached by Cassi Mitchel out of the blue. He'd had a near instant crush on the freshman since he'd worked the paper's booth at Welcome Week. He'd certainly seen her picking up some rolls as the months rolled on, and where she was, well, thicker than he'd usually go for, he couldn't deny that she was still the same beautiful creature, if carrying a bit of pudge, and she'd now come up to <i>him</i>. \"Two months and twenty pounds ago...\" he thought before rebuking himself. \"Hell with it. This is an angel.\" He stopped the machine and cleared his throat. \"Sorry, I was probably being rude there,\" gesturing to the treadmill computer. \"So, um, where <i>is </i>Madison? I used to see her all the time here. Like <i>all</i> the time. I was starting to think the school leased her along with the other equipment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's tagged me in.\" She put her hand the rail of his treadmill and leaned in just a bit to get friendly, hoping she could help him out stop talking to a girl about another girl. \"You could say I'm taking her spot. No lease, though; I'm a free agent.\" She dismissed the stupid, insecure urge to say that she was there getting back in shape. \"Duh. Don't apologize for being fat, and you're obviously not there for the buffet\" she counseled herself. \"Let results do the talking. He's not going anywhere. And I know I'm not. Not until you can bounce a quarter of my ass.\" Best to leave him wanting more, she reasoned. \"And maybe next time we talk he'll have someone else on his mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" she continued, playing at boredom suddenly. \"I should really stretch and hit the showers. I'll see you tomorrow,\" she waved without waiting for his reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh--...tomorrow's my rest day, actually!\" he called after her, still thrown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll be here tomorrow!\" she answered back, not turning around. Why did women keep walking away from him like that? he wondered. This was shaping up to be a very good week.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back in the dorm, Cassi arrived with her confidence now redoubled. Her extra weight had gradually smothered her self-esteem, and the rejection from Chris had finally knocked it out for the count. It was hard going from drawing almost every look as she passed to turning the heads only of those curious co-eds who still couldn't believe how much she'd let herself go. Guys just didn't see her anymore, and she got used to being a non-factor in the room. Almost a quarter of the way to her weight goal, though, and she was already starting to get her game back. \"Imagine where I'll be when I look like Madi.\" She did a little celebratory shimmy as she entered their room, not caring how generously her love handles and thighs jiggled. She missed feeling like this. She missed <i>dancing</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to go to a party!\" Cassi announced. \"Like, tonight. Dancing. Dresses. *Gasp*: Maybe I can fit back into that last 'fat dress' I bought now. Ohmigod, Madi, I just got back from the gym--your place, where else--and weighed myself, and I'm now <i>ten. pounds.</i> down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was fixed in her now usual spot, curled up on her desk chair and munching absently as she typed with ferocity. As she was all bunched together, Cassi couldn't help but notice what <i>looked</i> like a little belly bunched together under Madison's baby-doll t-shirt. Her already short jean shorts rode high from her posture and fully showcased her gorgeous tanned legs, looking smooth and a little softer--actually quite a bit softer--than they had always looked in her running shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Madikins... talking to you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhfh. Sorry, can't tonight.\" She didn't break eye contact with the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cooking Club?\" Cassi rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>No</i>,\" she shot back, \"It's not <i>every</i> day. Well, yes, I'm doing some baking with them later, but that's not tonight. --And you are going to <i>love</i> the fudge brownies I bring back, by the way--it's OK, you can break your diet now and again, marine.\" Cassi couldn't help but be surprised at Madison, supportive as she'd been, actually recommending that Cassi indulge while she was trying so hard to lose weight. Was Madison Kraft actually mocking her for showing some Kraft-brand discipline? \"No, I just think I really need to keep working on this piece.\" She grabbed another a handful of chips. \"Ihm gehtngh ihn th' grhoove.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you were writing a review on Cool Ranch Doritos,\" she eyed Madison and the half-empty family-sized bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison flashed a dirty look and shoved a few into her mouth defiantly. \"Humnggry.\" She swallowed. \"And a little snack helps me think. So shut up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi wasn't done with the banter, especially when she spotted some sprinkles on a paper plate by Madison's elbow. \"And the Pop Tart too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't have breakfast. ...Not a <i>real</i> breakfast. ...I wanted a Pop Tart, and it's a good thing because they didn't used to be this good. How was the gym?\" The deflection was interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So these are the high culinary standards of Powers' leading authority on the food arts? Don't let any of your readers see our trash. And <i>don't</i> change the subject from your bogus excuse not to get all sexy with me tonight and flirt with boys for drinks. Common, you should pressuring your fat friend to go out and be social. You're the one who stands to gain--boys, that is. So Jim hired you, what, two days ago? So you have, what, three, four days until your deadline? Why are you working on this now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of us--\" Madison paused for tiny, silent burp, \"have a standard of excellence. I'm doing some pre-work on my first draft <i>today</i> because I did a dry-run yesterday with the food lab--I have to learn the dish from the ground up, right? So that I know it--which means I only have today or tomorrow to go the Black Dalia for my first taste--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'First taste'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassi. Cassi Cassi Cassi. Do you know why so many food reviews are terrible and bland and flavorless?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I honestly didn't know they were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't know the dish if you only taste each bite once.\" The look on Cassi's face made clear that Madison had completely lost her. \"And if you don't know the dish, you can't write about it with any integrity. It's as simple as that. And that's not fair to anyone. It's certainly not as yummy. If I had more time in the week I'd go more than twice. I'd probably go to another restaurant to see how <i>they</i> prepare it in comparison--oh, now there's an idea...\" Madison took another handful of chips as she thought about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi was getting impatient with this single track on her roommate's mind. \"So...party? Yes, no?\" She held her soft body in a model's swanky pose, gut stubbornly protruding. \"I promise I'll let you be the sexy one. But just for tonight.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ok fine!\" Madison relented after a few more minutes of badgering from her roommate. Cassi still was having a hard time comprehending that Madison Kraft, usually the life of a party for guys, or at the very least the girl who thrived in the company of others would rather stay in than spend a night chatting up guys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Madison reached a stopping point in her review, she saved the document and looked at the bag of chips she had just demolished. \"Well, those servings didn't last long,\" she thought to herself. When she bought the family sized bag, she had assumed it could be a good snack for a few weeks, and yet it only lasted a few days. This kind of thing was foreign to Madison. While she could get whatever types of snack she wanted at Powers, she was used to the pantry that her Mom stocked, usually full of carrots for some crunch, or yogurt if she was looking for something else to hold her over to dinner. Speaking of dinner,  Madison couldn't believe how much better the food was at Powers than it was back in South Florida. Her parents were both people committed to keeping their great bodies, so while never pressuring Madison (although they were pleased when she slimmed up in high school,) their diets also never exposed Madison to the greasy foods she was now discovering in the cafeteria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison looked over to Cassi, who was still in her workout clothes and getting ready to run to the showers. \"Hm, she does look a bit less bloated,\" Madison thought to herself, while feeling good about being the one who had gotten all of this started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Cassi left for the showers, Madison went through her closet to look through her many designer dresses and find one for the occasion. She didn't want to go with something super tight. Although she didn't realized it was approaching a 10 pound gain, Madison knew she was at the very least bloated from her culinary binge over the past few weeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe settled on a black dress that was tight, but she thought did a good job of covering her slight 'bloat' on her stomach. Had Madison had a greater moment of introspection, she would have realized that her stomach was not just bloated from the previous meal, but that her hard abs were gone, replaced by the start of a belly. The dress went on quite easily for Madison. It was a short dress, but even in black it showed that Madison had a bit of curve that she never had before. Unlike when she was wearing jeans, Madison was not yet to the point in dresses where you could see an outline of her belly, but if one had a side by side, they would easily spot that her legs were softer, and the tone that had come from her previous workout regimen were slipping away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Cassi got back from the shower, Madison was doing her hair, and putting on her makeup, and not with a ton of enthusiasm. However, she looked fantastic. \"Why, does Madison get to eat like a total pig for two weeks and still look okay?\" But on another glance, Cassi corrected herself. Madison's legs <i>did</i> look softer, her arms no longer looked like she was lifting, and her dress allowed the possibility that her belly from before was not just an aberration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Cassi realized was Madison's perfect face, well done makeup, and ability to throw herself together distracted from her slight gain. Cassi knew she was pretty, but now she was realizing that Madison actually was what guys meant when they said a perfect 10. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose thoughts were not enough to distract Cassi from her desire to go out, however, if anything, Cassi enjoyed going out with her roommate-- Madison's flirtatious attiude attracted guys that would talk with her as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Cassi, putting on a dress was not as fun as it was for Madison. It was about damage control, does it bring out the right parts and minimize the bad? The first step for her was putting on spanx. Cassi considered having to do this in front of her roommate an indignity, but the results were worth it. The product had been huge for her in limiting noticeable rolls on her belly, although post Chris rejection, clearly not as much as she had hoped. Putting on the spanx consisted of pulling tight spandex over her prominent (if slowly receding) belly. As she pulled them up, fat from her upper belly oozed over, until she got them just below her boobs. \"I can't wait until I never have to do this again,\" Cassi thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reward for the uncomfortable exercise was evident when Cassi put on her dress and it actually fit. Sure, you could see where her belly was, her but was still prominent, and yes, her hips still flared out under the belt of the dress, but it fit, and she didn't look horrible. Rather, like a chubby girl who wasn't trying to stuff herself into the previous size, which was more than she could say for herself a few weeks ago. As she was doing her hair next to Madison, Cassi noted how much softer her arms still were than Madison's and realized she still had some work to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her desire to go dancing, they ended up forgoing the use of their fake IDs and hitting up a party at one of the better fraternity houses. With Madison's presence, they had not problem getting in. \"The perks of being hot,\" Cassi thought of her friend, and they got drinks pretty quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were no shortage of guys who wanted to talk with Madison. Perhaps it was dark, or perhaps there were not as many near model Latina girls who were on the campus of this Midwestern school, but guys still wanted to talk to Madison, despite the slight softening. Or, perhaps, Cassi thought, as she finished her first beer, we're all just drunk. As unethical as it was, Cassi was kind of hoping that she would pass the muster of someone's beer goggles and she also indulged, sure, maybe they would regret it in the morning, but she wanted to see if she could get someone to hook up with her as easily as she did in high school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the night wore on, Cassi found a random frat guy who was willing to dance with her, she figured Madison could fend for her own, and she was right. Madison was completely in her element. \"Cassi, was right, going out was a good idea,\" she thought over beer number 7. As she was walking through the upper levels of the fraternity house, looking for someone to talk to, when she ran into Brad, a classmate of her's who she had hooked up with earlier in the semester. They got along, and had no feelings of attachment, but were each down to have a fun time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing led to another, and they ended up in a spare room together, as Brad ran his hands up and down Madison's body, although he was thrilled to be with her, a thought creeped into his head. \"Is it just me, or is Madison getting softer?\"</span></div></div>",

And then, disdainfully croaked,\"M--morning.\" Madison threw the duvet off her lovely, scrunched face but, met by penetrating sunlight, immediately threw it back over herself. She could admit she <i>maybe</i> overdid it last night. She tried to get up, but her head blared and sent her into the pillow again. Maybe she would just spend the rest of the morning dead and try being alive again tomorrow. OK, so she must have overdid it last night, because this was not normal for Madison Kraft. After a good campus party, she would usually be springing out of bed after a little lie-in (8:00, if she was especially naughty) for a run at the gym. The gym was off the table of course now, because of Cassi and all, but she was demanding as much dedication of herself in her new routine, and she had meant to get up at least as early to start experimenting in the club kitchen--not for the article, but she had been hearing about a new recipe for pork rag\u00f9 she really wanted to try, and she was still developing her passion as a cook, you know, so she could write better. Plus she was enjoying this new world that had recently opened to her. Some classmates had also invited her on a hike with them that afternoon. She'd have to skip it, she decided; she couldn't start slacking on kitchen time just because she had more to drink than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunny though, she didn't think she had. Just as she didn't think she had the last time she went out with Cassi, at her roommate's insistence, when Madison last wore the black dress. In truth, Madison's metabolism wasn't as up for the task as it had been. Operating in a slower gear and already stuffed with junk and gourmet half the time, there was no bouncing back like back when a night of drinking was a just a break between running 3Ks. Worse, that first evening back out with Cassi seemed not to phase the bulky blonde half as much. More mass, able to put more away, she reasoned. But to Madison's misplaced pride, Cassi <i>was </i>shrinking. \"See what happens when you impose a modicum of discipline on your life?\" she'd thought at one point taking note of the recently twelve-pound lighter body. At least Madison wouldn't be suffering this Saturday morning hell alone. \"Cass!\" she croakd out from beneath the covers. No answer. She braved the sunlight and looked over to her roommate's bed. Empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison knew without having to think it, without wanting to think it, but her fat her roommate had pulled a Madison Kraft and skipped off to the gym early after a night of partying. The conclusion wasn't one she wanted to draw, so it was simple: Madison drank more than usual, and Cassi must not have had half as much as Madison thought she saw. Maybe a little early morning activity wouldn't kill her either, she thought. \"No gym, no problem. I used to sneak in workouts in here before.\" But as she strenuously rolled herself out of bed, she checked her phone: 11:43. \"Shit. No way. It is not almost noon.\" As quickly as that the thought of a little morning yoga had passed and, trying to orient herself to the time of day she'd slept into, she found herself hungry--if nauseated. \"I didn't have breakfast!\" and she regretted the lost opportunity to enjoy the soft pillowy pancakes of the cafeteria--whose game had really been stepping up in the last few weeks. She'd used to find those syrupy stacks kind of gross and unhealthy. \"Oh, eggs!\" she consoled herself, and was suddenly lost imagining how she could dress up a few fried eggs to be more brunchy. \"Brunch, then the rag\u00f9. I can't start letting my self-discipline slip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing out of bed in a slightly better mood now, she realized she hadn't worn any pants to bed. \"OK, I need to start taking it easy.\" What she didn't realize was the wobble of her thighs as she plodded to the closet. She adjusted her tan ktop down over her belly, as it had ridden up--overnight, when she got up, whatever. \"Why did I wear my workout tank to bed? This thing is kind of restrictive for sleeping in.\" But it wasn't a workout top. She sighed when she saw the black dress from last week hanging up, letting her tummy fill out the bottom of her shirt so that she unconsciously tugged it down again. If she didn't have a very good time last night, it was because <i>that </i>dress was <i>not</i> working. She knew her body rocked that dress. Let's face it, it didn't do her any favors, because she didn't need any, but she made it look <i>good</i>. Whatever was behind last night's bloat, though, was not having it. And after having scrutinized herself for a few minutes and feeling downright uncomfortable, she decided she didn't want to be <i>over</i>dressed--of course, Cassi could be if she wanted to. She'd opted instead, maybe panicking a little bit, for a nice pair of jeans and a cute blouse that dressed them up. The jeans of course were nice because they were a pair she never wore but just kept on hand. Some girls might call them \"fat jeans.\" Well she felt uncomfortable most the night, and probably because the whole dress thing was in her head she kept thinking that the blouse felt kind of snug, even if it was showcasing her breasts better than she'd remembered, and she was sure that she was not holding as many conversations with guys as the week before. She was definitely getting more of her own drinks, even if Cassi was actually doing pretty well flying solo. And it was all because of that stupid dress. \"I'm kidding, chica, I love you, but you have to be good to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike that, the bit of self-consciousness was written off as the night's aberrations, and she picked out a hot little pair of jeans and a t-shirt, her new, not <i>entirely</i>  unfashionable go-to. Yet putting them on wasn't as easy as picking them out. There was some...resistance. \"Come on... <i>Mi beleza negro</i>, this better not be your doing.\" She wiggled a notably heftier backside into the denim, which was already straining to pack in her thickening thighs. \"Stupid, cheap industrial washers.\" She had begun to notice herself tugging at the waist of her pants lately, trying to get comfortable. Just then she spotted a tiny chocolate stain on the plush upper thigh from when she was working on the fudge brownies--in one sense or another. \"Oops,\" she said, not wanting to start over with a clean pair at this point. \"They were <i>so</i> good too. Ummphf.\" At first she naively tried fastening them without sucking in, to no avail, but her single-minded determination kept her from thinking too much about the struggle she'd never really found herself in before but, if she'd had been paying attention, had been mounting to. At last, after a massive sucking in of her tummy, she'd gotten the jeans buttoned, letting them sit a bit lower as her now squashy tan little belly and adorable matching love handles tried to escape over their taught waistband. Usually exceedingly comfortable showing as much skin as the law allowed, Madison was suddenly eager to get covered, and she threw her size S t-shirt on without a beat. This too she tugged and adjusted, not registering the novel feeling of her stomach and sides pressing out into the cotton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't glance in the mirror any longer than it took her to tossle her luscious, cascading dark hair into something cute that framed her flawless, slender face. She didn't need an ounce of makeup. She felt cute, if sluggish, and her face lit up as she turned to bounce out of the room to the kitchen. That was what she <i>didn't</i> see: those natural dimples, just a little deeper in her soft, feminine cheeks; her famous smile, where her neck pulled sweetly back just a bit, just a little more jowly, making one wonder if her jaw line wasn't <i>quite </i>as defined after all, allowing for the first time the image to be imagined of a chubby-cheeked, double-chinned Madison Kraft, a pudgy Madison Kraft. It was that unwittingly betraying smile, not the dress that she <i>didn't</i> wear, more even than the ill-fitting blouse and jeans that she <i>did </i>wear, that left the guys' attentions a little less captivated by her extant charms and a little freer to look about for hotter, tighter options. She cast that once-fatal beacon of a smile a lot at the party, across the room and to every guy she thought might buy her a drink, but it was now actually bringing attention to what everyone was otherwise barely registering: Madison Kraft had really filled out. Madison Kraft had packed on the pounds and was now sporting some pudge around her middle. A tiny roll of fat sat like a ring above her hips. Her fully Latin thighs wobbled wherever she walked, and her tight, pert ass rounded out with them. Her breasts were a bit larger, but only noticed when expecting them to be. And now, she was almost starting to looked kind of like a chubby girl when she beamed, which was almost anytime Madison was eating, cooking or talking about food. Madison Kraft had put on the freshman 15--with gusto.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Strolling back from the gym, confident and feeling accomplished, Cassi could hardly believe her eyes. She already felt like she hadn\u2019t been seeing enough of Madison lately, not withstanding some downtime in their ill-lit room at the end of the day and a couple evenings going out together. In addition to class and the library, Cassi\u2019s time had been utterly consumed by her new workout regimen, and Madison\u2019s with her newfound burgeoning hobby, which as it happened had much to do with consuming. Sure, it was getting harder not to notice that Madison had maybe been putting on more than a few pounds, maybe a sort of spring winter-weight; it was all a little hard to compute when seeing the perfect-ten stuff her face with culinary creations (and the frequent occasional junkfood), and it\u2019s not like Cassi didn\u2019t have anything else on her mind, like getting her own weight under control and landing a boyfriend or two. Then there was the party last night, where only as a roommate would know, Madison was definitely wearing larger pants, and the light-printed blouse was not doing her thicker waist any of the favors her gracious black dress had perhaps extended the last time. But this\u2026 Maybe Cassi really hadn\u2019t been seeing enough of Madison, because apparently there was a lot more Madison to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi was now down a solid fifteen pounds and change, and boy did that make the difference on her. Gone was her pot belly by now, leaving a tauter, still thick middle, better described as a tummy, a sizeable pooch. The difference was that it didn\u2019t have the lazy heftiness that once poked over the waistband of her athletic shorts; it rounded out her silhouette and hardly moved when she did, for now buried not far beneath that excess padding were abdominal muscles such that Cassi never had before, abs that would melt the last of that fat from the inside out. Her legs too were noticeably leaner, while by no means lean. Her arms were thick but no longer puffy and meaty. Next to her belly, though, the second biggest difference in the impressive last few weeks was her face, which actually did look much slimmer, her adorable second chin having receded almost entirely, such that she looked from the neck up almost exactly as she did when she arrived in the fall. No, Cassi wasn\u2019t fat anymore. Maybe chubby, and approaching the outer range again of what most would consider hot as she began resembling her old self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut those fifteen pounds must not have traveled far\u2014not any further than the other side of her room. Madison was bee-lining it from their dorm to the Student Union building, where Cassi knew the kitchen was that the Cooking Club used, and Cassi could guess why by now if Madison was hung-over and just getting up at noon, their paths about to intersect. Madison may have looked bigger last night in what were clearly her \u201cfat jeans,\u201d but that was nothing compared to how she looked stuffed into a pair of her size-four skinny jeans. Her thighs had clearly picked up some heft, which itself was a new development this semester, but their discernable jiggle revealed them actually be softer than Cassi\u2019s. Not only did they meet on top and kissed as she walked, but they were proportionally thicker as well down their whole length, subtly altering the whole shape of her meaty legs. The shirt wasn\u2019t a good choice either, as it both struggled to give her impressive little jello belly room <i>and </i>to provide enough cover. This in fact it was failing to do, and it had ridden up in Madison\u2019s absent-minded plodding to show the scandalous bottom lip of a very tan, very smooth, very obvious muffin top squeezed up by her undersized jeans. The short sleeves revealed that she'd lost all the definition in her once perfectly toned arms. Of course her breasts looked great, as they always did in their generous fullness, but in truth they only stretched the already scarce cotton and helped to illustrate how soft Madison had gotten everywhere beneath them. Of course, what looked like not a tiny chocolate stain on her overstuffed jeans didn\u2019t help the picture either. No, Madison Kraft was chubby, or at least getting there in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their paths were about to intersect, and the daydreaming Madison spotted her sporty-looking roommate, she beamed ear to ear and waved a soft, toneless arm. Was that the hint of a double chin just then? <i>That </i>completed the picture for Cassi. She had to consciously check that her jaw hadn\u2019t fallen slack and metnally barred herself from looking down at herself and over at Madison, down at herself and over at Madison, for comparison\u2014especially when Madison tempted it: \u201cOhmygod, Cass, you look <i>so </i>great!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi couldn\u2019t quite remember how to speak yet. How did one make words happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, looks like the gym agrees with you, girl. It\u2019s funny, it\u2019s like we\u2019ve hardly seen each other in the light of day all month. I can\u2019t believe how good you look! You must have lost almost ten pounds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little over fifteen, actually.\u201d Cassi had been really excited when she reported ten pounds almost a week ago. Clearly Madison wasn\u2019t paying attention, and she suddenly remembered the occasion for her nacho-flavored distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m so proud of you. You\u2019ll get there. Maybe I can show some core exercises to blast away some of that tummy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Cassi equivocated. OK--she thought--she shouldn\u2019t be excited about this, right? Sure, maybe this was just a little bit awesome after all the humiliation Cassi had felt while Madison got to keep showing off her stupid hot body. But, seriously, Madison was her best friend at Powers, and it\u2019s not like she would wish a weight problem on her. Probably she wouldn\u2019t. And, maybe it\u2019s not even gotten as bad for Madison as it looks. She\u2019s gotten way out of shape, of course, and that\u2019s definitely fat she\u2019s wearing these days, but she\u2019s definitely wearing too small of sizes. And she <i>is </i>taller. \u201cIn other words,\u201d she reasoned to herself, \u201cshe\u2019s not as chubby as I am now. \u2026is she?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Cassi continued, realizing that even if she was the only one appreciating the irony Madison just dropped her silence was getting awkward, \u201cthat\u2019s maybe, you know, not a bad idea. I mean, I\u2019m feeling much more confident about working out now, and, well, I kind of know what I\u2019m doing, but really it probably wasn\u2019t fair for me to ask you not to go to the gym for a while, and it\u2019s been a while, so how about you join me, like, tomorrow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, I\u2019d love to help you out, Cass, but I totally can\u2019t tomorrow. I\u2019m going to be working all day to meet my deadline. That\u2019s so sweet of you ask. But maybe if we catch up back at the room sometime this weekend I can give you some pointers. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve done enough to help you lose all this weight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi was dumbfounded again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I am <i>so </i>hungry and <i>so </i>behind and <i>so </i>hung-over, so I need eggs and apple wood sausage like two hours ago,\u201d Madison hurriedly added as she started back into a brisk pace, tacking on as she parted, \u201cBut I know you\u2019ll get there, Cass. Remember, I\u2019m so proud of you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi couldn\u2019t help herself and turned to watch perfect-ten Madison Kraft from behind, wearing some chubby girl\u2019s ass and seriously needing to pull down the back of her shirt.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On Friday evening, Cassi had a plan to get Madison to the gym one way or other. Her desire to get Madison to workout was an odd one, given her conflicting feelings about her roommate getting a bit larger, but she felt an obligation for Madison to at least realize that she was getting larger...without having to tell her or hint at it herself. It all struck Cassi as bizzare that Madison couldn't see what was happening to her body. Back when Cassi was gaining weight, every pound felt like a disaster for her, and she consiouocly realized she was gaining weight, even if there were weeks where she stayed off the scale out of fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she got back from the gym on Friday afternoon, Cassi found Madison, unsurprisingly, in the room. Madison looked to be working away on a bag of trail mix while watching some television. \"Hey, Madison some of the girls are hitting up a party on frat row tonight, want to come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi knew that there was a good chance Madison would decline given her wardrobe issues. Perhaps she would deflect the question by insisting that the party they settled on was not a great fraternity, or that she didn't want to brave the cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I think I'll work on learning a new dish tonight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi was a bit dumbfounded, Madison wasn't even trying to find excuses. As surprised as she was by the method, it allowed Cassi to trap Madison into a sober morning on Saturday, \"Well, if you're staying in tonight, we should go to the gym tomorrow. You can show me some new exercises!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison paused for a second after that. She really didn't want to, she still considered herself a healthy person, but if Cassi was okay with her going to the gym again, couldn't it wait a few days? \"I don't know,\" Madison trailed off, \"...it's just that, I don't know, I kind of had my weekend planned out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi couldn't recall any conflicts from before, \"Oh, do you have a test coming up?\" she inquired. \"No...\" Madison looked sheepish in her deflections, \"I just...I'm not really in the mood for it.\" At that Cassi gave Madison a look of shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison! I thought you would be excited about this invite, come on, it will be fun!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Madison sighed, \"Okay, fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Madison got up, still full from her previous night's run at Lazanga. She had never tried to make something so filling, and it seemed to give her almost a food hangover, after finishing the meal, she had never felt so full. Cassi was already up, and when she saw Madison was awake, started changing into her gym stuff. The things that Madison had seen before were no fluke, Cassi was indeed losing weight. Her stomach looked toned, her arms increasingly defined, and her butt was starting to become marginally smaller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison didn't know it, but Cassi was having the opposite thoughts about her. As Madison walked to the closet wearing only her panties and a t-shirt, Cassi could see how soft Madison's butt was looking. As Madison rifled through her closet, she realized that her gym stuff had been pushed to the back, yet another sign of her inactivity. When Madison reached back to get it, Cassi saw Madison's growing love handles on display. First Madison put on a sports bra that had to be too tight for her. The result was back boobs like Cassi hadn't seen when she was getting larger. It wasn't that Madison was huge, it was that her growing size was being accentuated from being thrown into far too tight of sizes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Madison went for her shorts. Cassi couldn't believe it, but her growing roommate was going for the same shorts from their first workout together. \"Is she insane? Those will never fit.\" Cassi thought to herself. Luckily for Madison, it took more than a 15-20 pound gain to stay out of the shorts, and with the help of stretchy fabric, Madison pulled them up with some effort. However, this wasn't to say that they looked any good on her. The butt was stretched to the point where the fabric was now slightly transparent. Anyone on a machine behind her would easily see her underwear and chubby rear. Below that was another problem area, her thighs, once part of her killer package, now stuck out looking even larger than they otherwise would have, the softness and size evident even before Madison started walking. Cassi wanted to suggest that Madison get some looser fitting shorts, or at least offer some guy athletic shorts she had laying around, but at the same time, she wanted to see if Madison would actually go through with it as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison pulled the size small shirt from before, and put it over her body. It did little to hide her softening belly, and Cassi doubted that her love handles would ever be hidden throughout the workout. \"Ok, let's do this,\" Madison said to Cassi, how suddenly wondered if <i>she</i> would be embarrassed about coming with her oblivious roommate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite the risks, Madison decided to go with Plan-B. It was clear that Cassi was depressed about her current appearance, and she didn't want to leave her at home every night while she went off to the gym. It seemed as though Cassi did most of her eating when she was alone. Madison decided to do some exercises at home while she stayed away from the gym...only for a week or two...just enough to get Cassi's spirits back up. She would keep the plan a secret, and let Cassi think she was skipping out on the Gym because she had stopped caring. She was confident she could stay in shape as long as she watched what she ate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, for the first time in a while, Madison stayed home. Cassi seemed pleased to have her around, and had ordered them some take out in the form of two large Pizzas. As Cassi served up the greasy, fattening Pizza, Madison realized that if her plan was going to work...she might have to eat the same food as Cassi as well. She would have to work off the Pizza with sit ups and squats before bedtime. She and Cassi took a seat at their small, dining room table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No gym tonight?\" Cassi asked as she tucked into a slice of Pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison shrugged. \"I don't have to go every night,\" she said, trying to sound as though she didn't care in the least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should really stop eating junk,\" Cassi sighed as she grabbed her second slice. \"Guess that's why I've gotten so huge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison couldn't help but agree, but she knew she had to focus on making her friend feel better about herself. \"Cassi, you're not huge,\" she said. \"You've just put on a little winter weight, it happens to everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It hasn't happened to you,\" Cassi grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just have a high metabolism,\" Madison lied. \"You'll lose those extra pounds soon enough. When summer comes I bet you'll get your bikini body back in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi smiled at that, then stuffed another pizza slice into her mouth. Madison grabbed a slice for herself, dreading the consequences of eating unhealthily without a workout to balance it out. She bit into the slice, and realized she had forgotten just how good Pizza tasted. Soon enough, she was on her second slice, and then her third...and fourth...it was a good thing Cassi had ordered two Pizzas, because Madison was really starting to work up quite an appetite, and Cassi had nearly finished one all by herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi reclined on her chair and gave a moan, her soft belly looking round and bloated. She had taken to wearing sweats to conceal her weight gain, but even those were growing tight across her pudgy middle and plump behind. She ran her hands over her pot belly and let out a satisfied sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison continued on with her meal until she had consumed the remainder of the Pizza. She was honestly surprised that she had managed to put away so many slices, and by the time she finished, she was feeling rather bloated herself. Her normally flat stomach had bulged out considerably, as it usually did when she was drinking and partying at the weekend, but compared to Cassi's, it was hardly visible. She suppressed a belch as she reclined in a pose similar to Cassi's. \"Good Pizza,\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've eaten too much out take out lately,\" Cassi admitted as she massaged her full belly. \"I should really try and eat more healthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison nodded and smiled as her bloated belly gurgled. Her tank top had ridden up to just above her belly button, exposing her tanned flesh. She poked at her firm, food stuffed tummy and pulled her top down in embarrassment. She hoped Cassi's lifestyle wouldn't start to rub off on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, still feeling tired and full from dinner, Madison changed into her pajamas and climbed into bed. She decided she would exercise in the morning...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison was still feeling somewhat full when she woke up the next morning, she starred at the clock and decided that it would be a bit of a strain on her schedule to do the sit-ups before she went to class. Besides, with Cassi sleeping in the bed next to her, it would have contradicted her efforts to help make Cassi feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Madison was getting dressed, she looked over to Cassi's side of the dorm room, and saw her partially covered body. She noted how Cassi's arms had collected some chubbiness, and how she was starting to have a double chin that wasn't just there when Cassi smiled. ''Hopefully she eventually decides to start going to the gym with me,'' Madison thought, ''because that is the only way she will lose the weight.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Cassi was in the dumps about her body, Madison was the antithesis to that kind of insecurity. She knew she was hot, and as Madison walked down the campus mall, she knew she looked hot, despite the little slip up and pizza binge that she had. She assumed it hadn't had much of an effect, because she could still see guys checking her out while she walked to her classes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn European Literature, they had just finished their first paper, which the professor admitted was rather grueling for a calls of freshmen. When Madison walked into class, she and the other students were greeted with a carton of donuts and a sign that read, ''Be here in a sec, but enjoy breakfast on me, thanks for all the hard work so far.'' Madison had already eaten her typical breakfast of coffee, and a granola bar to go, but she figured, ''what the heck, it's not like I'm going to be eating donuts every day.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter literature was over, the professor noted, ''hey everyone, we still have a lot of donuts, so if you need something to hold you over until lunch, feel free to have another.'' Madison obliged as she grabbed another slice on the way out. Again, in a very similar way to last night, she knew that she probably should not have done it, but she hadn't had a donut in forever, and they tasted great. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison went to her typical lunch time, and met the girls who she usually dinned with.The group included Kelly, who lived on her floor. The cafeteria at powers was a buffet style, typical of many other campuses, so you paid once when you went in, and then didn't have to worry about pricing on eat individual item purchased. Usually, Madison just went with a sandwich, or soup, but instead she thought the pizza last night was so good, that she would try some more for lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison brought back three slices of pizza, which Kelly noticed, given that this was a departure from Madison's normal diet, which usually went salad, or small portion of a main dish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Pretty hungry today,'' Kelly asked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, I guess I'm just in a funk today,'' commented Madison as she dug into the first greasy slice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Madison was leaving the cafeteria, she again realized that she had forgotten how good some foods were. But, she assured herself that this was temporary, and next meal she would start to eat better again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, just as Madison was about ready to slip into some activeware and do some sit-ups, Cassi came home with Chinese food, and a lot of it. ''Hey Madison, they had a huge sale down the street at the Chinese place near campus, they must be trying to attract new students or something.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I thought we were going to eat healthy today,'' Madison said in a somewhat frustrated tone, she wondered how Cassi could complain about her body one minute, and then not mind chowing down on greasy takeout the next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well, come on, it was a great deal, and we can always eat better tomorrow.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, I guess you're right.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison ate another huge portion of a few different types of chicken, and some more crab rangoon, which were loaded with calories. As she finished another meal, her and Cassi again looked and felt bloated. Madison also noticed that her bulge from last night had returned. ''Ughhh, thank god I'm wearing my workout shorts with the elastic waist,'' thought Madison as she noted that Cassi's pants looked ready to burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she was wearing her workout clothes, the dinner left both her and Cassi feeling sluggish for the rest of the evening, so Madison pushed working out off another night. She knew that this was a bad day for her personal control, but she figured tomorrow she could get back to her normal diet. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unfortunately for Madison, she was growing more and more accustomed to Cassi's lazy lifestyle. Her workout sessions and trips to the Gym were quickly replaced by nights in, studying, eating and watching TV. This had had the notable advantage of increasing Madison's test scores; as her nights in were mainly spent studying with Cassi's help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plan seemed to be working so far too, as Cassi had barely mentioned her weight gain over the last week two weeks - though it was clearly still an issue. Cassi's appetite had not changed at all, and she spent most nights snacking continuously while she and Madison studied. Her meals consisted almost entirely of takeout; which she had been 'treating' Madison to almost every day. While it was kind of Cassi to pay for the food, Madison wished she would just bring something healthy home for once. One night, Madison had made them both a salad, which Cassi had pretended to enjoy...only to help herself to a huge midnight snack of chips and chocolate before she crawled back into bed, thinking Madison had not seen her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost impossible to get Cassi to tone down her appetite, and the increasingly chubby blonde had seemed so happy lately that Madison didn't want to bring it up. Instead, she had gone along with pretty much every choice Cassi had made in terms of food in the past week - which consisted of extra large portions of Pizza, Chinese Food, Pasta, Burgers, Fries...all the food that Madison would normally have avoided. Without realizing it, Madison had become almost completely adjusted to Cassi's lifestyle, and every meal left her feeling bloated and lethargic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a particularly tiring day, Madison returned home and collapsed on the sofa. Cassi appeared almost immediately, holding a large, brown paper bag, which from the smell of it was more Chinese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foods up!\" Cassi said, before dishing up Madison's portion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chinese again?\" Madison asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Thursday,\" Cassi said. \"We always have Chinese food on a Thursday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I lose track,\" Madison said, as she sat up and grabbed her plate. She was sure they had eaten Chinese on Monday as well, but decided not to mention it. From the looks of it, Cassi had ordered way too much again, but as usual, that did not prove to be a problem. Cassi ate greedily, stuffing chicken, noodles and crackers into her mouth and savoring every bite. Madison was a slower eater, but Cassi had served her an equally large portion, and after half an hour, she had finished it all and licked the plate clean.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was so good...\" Cassi said, rubbing her bulging belly as she reclined on the sofa beside Madison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison looked down at her own stomach, which was bloated once again. She gave a groan as she massaged the bulge beneath her shirt, which had ridden up slightly to expose her belly button. She felt absolutely stuffed, but Cassi seemed happy enough, so what was the harm in being a little full? As they let their food digest, they pulled out their books and started to study. Madison found it surprisingly comforting to study on a full stomach, and, against her better judgement, was beginning to enjoy the feeling of being full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, when they went to bed, Madison stripped to her underwear and arched her back as she ran her hands over her bulging stomach, realizing that, once again, she had overdone it. She quickly changed into her pajama bottoms and tank top and fell into bed. Cassi came in shortly after and stripped down, giving Madison a good view of her growing body - she guessed her friend was now about 190 pounds, with most of her weight settling in her big, round pot belly and plump behind. Cassi changed into some ill fitting shorts that were swallowed by her ass and a tank top that revealed her jiggling, soft stomach before she collapsed into bed as well. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison continued to mirror Cassi's laid back life style. She didn't really have any intention of having this drastic of a change, but as she was finding out, once you stop becoming disciplined, it's rather hard to go back. Whereas going to the gym used to seem like something she needed to do every day, after a few days of not going, the decision to go to the gym was something she kept pushing off. Had she gone during this time, maybe should would have gotten back into her old routine, but Madison kept pushing it off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne morning, after another day of lounging around after class, Madison went to put her jeans on, and tried to button them. She had to close her eyes and suck in a tad. \"What the hell?\" She thought to herself, \"Come on, these should fit perfectly.\" Madison got them closed with minimal effort, but just the fact that she now had something to suck in alarmed her. Over the past week, she noticed that after each meal, her bloated stomach receded less. Her former toned abs were now forming the smallest belly. It wasn't all that noticeable, but it was there. Madison slipped off her pants to look at the rest of her body. Her hips looked like they had a bit more padding on them as well. She moved down to her legs, \"hmm, these look a little more full as well, ugh, and those.\" Madison looked at the very small amount of softness that looked like a precursor to love handles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap. I really need to work out more,\" thought Madison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow of course, anyone who didn't possess the near model level body of Madison wouldn't notice any of this. But Madison was very image obsessed, and she didn't want this to be the start of anything bad. 99 percent of guys would say this almost made Madison hotter, or more womanly. At 5'7, She was still thin, but for her she felt this was a wake-up call, that she needed to work out soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison went to the scale, and got nervous. It read 139 pounds. \"Okay...this isn't the worst thing in the world. I just need to get back to the gym before I start to get chubby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Madison told herself that no matter what Cassi brought back, she would resist, and eat healthy. However, Cassi brought home Madison's biggest weakness at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Madison, look what what I brought back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison could smell it before she turned around, \"oh no, Pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no? What? You love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well I can't eat like this every night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, choose to eat healthy on a night where we aren't having the greatest pizza ever. Triple cheese pepperoni.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was eating, Madison found herself thinking, just one more bite, about ten times, and again found herself eating way too much. Part of the problem was that after a few weeks of indulgence, Madison was used to the feeling of fullness. Eating a salad, and then being good for the night no longer felt normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi felt pretty stuffed as usual after dinner. After Madison stopped bugging her to go to the gym, Cassi was almost in a state of cognitive dissonance about her current weight, which still hovered around 190. In the back of her mind she knew that guys couldn't believe what happened to her, and that she had a huge freshman gain, but she didn't really want to think of it, so she didn't. </span></div></div>",

That it really was not as good as she thought it was. Madison had worked out or had done sports her whole life so she could get away with occasionally eating bad food. This shock to her system however, began a quickening change to her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Madison walked back home from school charges could be seen from any onlooker that passed by. Gone was the petite shape that they were used to and replaced with a chubbier Madison at 153. Her belly now pressed against her shirt and throated to peak under at every second. Also her jawline was softening and if one looked closely a slight later of fat may have been forming under the chin.The biggest difference however was her butt, gone the tight firm one, now it was soft and almost a bubble butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wow\" a fellow student said as he passed by \"looks like another freshman 15 victim\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison just barely recognizing that it was directed towards her runs homes with tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie have I gotten chubby, some ahole on the street said I gained the freshman 15?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way What a jerk you look great its me that has to lose\" as Cassie dove into some ben and jerry <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"grab some ice cream from the fridge it will make you feel better\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison thinking that a little could help her out grabs some from the freezer and slumps down on the couch.

The temporary pleasure of the ice cream made her feel better, so she emotionally ate the rest of the ice cream, and figured she would diet later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day, Maidson decided she was going to make some headway on the start of her diet, and had a lunch that was actually healthy, a salad and water with a slice of cumber in a it for flavor, similar to something that she would eat back in Miami. However, in the middle of the afternoon she found herself getting hungry again. This never happened to her back in high school, when her eating habits were more measured. Since she started eating Cassi sized portions, this apparently changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunger pains got the worst during her English Lit class, which she took with Kelly, her thin friend from the dorm. Madison had trouble paying attention for the last portion of class, and swore that waiting for the clock to hit 3:30 and signal the end of class was never going to come, as her hunger burst to the front of her mind. Finally, when the end of class came, she quickly exited outside with Kelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That took forever!\" Madison almost yelled at Kelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, the class? I thought it was interesting,\" Kelly said to Madison, expecting a similar response. Kelly always thought of Madison as more intellectual than herself, however, right now, it was clear her mind had not been on class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! That class would never end! I don't know why, but I am really hungry, want to go to the cafeteria for a quick snack?\" Madison asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly wasn't really that hungry, but she enjoyed spending time with Madison, so she agreed. As they walked towards the cafeteria, Kelly casually glanced at Madison's body. It was quite obvious that Madison's belly had grown, and she thought she saw a softer chin while Madison talked about how hungry she was. It was something Kelly never would have guessed, her equally hot friend Madison was getting chubby. <i>How could she not be watching herself more?</i> Kelly thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the cafeteria, Kelly went and grabbed some cellery and sat at a table. A few minutes later, Madison got back with a bowl of ice cream, topped off with crushed cookies and chocolate surup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" Kelly exclaimed, \"That's a sunday.\" she said, her voice holding back none of her alarm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know\" Madison responded. I'm going to skip dinner. I just saw this and I could not help.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was becoming clear to Kelly why Madison's shirt was so tight.  \"Hey Madison, want to go to the gym tomorrow?\" Kelly asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she said, while stuffing another spoonful of the calorie laden ice cream in her month, \"I'll think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And maybe invite Cassi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll run it by her,\" Madison said, \"But she is kind of insecure about her weight gain.\" Madison said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She shouldn't be the only one</i> Kelly thought to herself. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The following week, Madison made an attempt to be more active, which resulted in her going for a jog after lunch one day. She didn't bother a second time, assuring herself that one jog would do for now while she got back into her routine. It was officially the start of break tomorrow, and she planned to start working out while Cassi went back to visit her parents. She was hoping to lose the small layer of pudge that had attached itself to her stomach before Cassi got back so that her roomate would be none the wiser as to her renewed workout plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Cassi had made them both a huge pile of spaghetti covered in rich tomato sauce and served up with a loaf of garlic bread. It was nice to have a homecooked meal for a change, and Madison was sure to thank Cassi for her efforts, but her chubby friend had made way more than was necessary. It looked as though Cassi had prepared a meal for ten! Every time Madison finished a portion, Cassi dumped more onto her plate and smiled eagerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So glad you like it,\" Cassi smiled, wiping sauce from the corners of her mouth and tearing a slice of garlic bread. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison just smiled and nodded. She was already getting full, and wasn't sure she could devour another plateful...but she didn't want to offend her cook, and perhaps if this meal was a success...it would mean less takeout in the future? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you have any plans for break?\" Cassi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...not really, just going to stay here,\" Madison shrugged. \"It'll be good to just chill out for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was actually going to ask if you wanted to come back to Kansas with me,\" Cassi said. \"You know, meet the family, see the sights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat took Madison by surprise. She swallowed a mouthful of spaghetti, felt her belly bulge out and cleared her throat. \"Oh...wow...thanks for the offer but...wouldn't you prefer to be alone with your folks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah,\" Cassi replied. \"I get bored if I'm on my own, but they're insisting I come back and visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison wanted to stay here and workout, but she really couldn't think of a decent excuse not to. She had already told Cassi that she planned on doing nothing, so lying was out of the question. \"And they don't mind you bringing someone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, they're always happy to have guests,\" Cassi said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison realized she didn't have a way out of this...but perhaps it wouldn't be so bad? As long as she and Cassi kept themselves busy in Kansas, she could try and work off some of her recent gains. \"Sure, why not?\" She finally answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\" Cassi exclaimed happily. \"We'll have a great time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the food was gone. Madison hadn't really noticed how much she had been eating whilst she and Cassi were talking, but the huge bowl that had once been full of spaghetti was now empty, and Cassi had demolished the last of the garlic loaf. Madison looked down at her stomach and found that, once again, she had eaten too much. Her top had ridden up above her belly button this time, and her jeans were uncomfortably tight. She wanted to unbutton them, but not in front of Cassi...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll wash up,\" Cassi said, giving a groan as she raised herself from the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stood up, her big, bloated pot belly jutted out and nearly rested itself on the table. Her clothes were ridiculously tight now, and Madison found herself wondering just how the portly blonde managed to fit into anything at all. She hadn't bought anything new in a while, and it was only a matter of time before she outgrew the remainder of her wardrobe. Tonight, she had chosen a pair of sweat pants and an old tank top, which now exposed her entire stomach. Madison would have been too embarrassed to wear such a thing, but Cassi didn't seem to care about her modesty, or her weight gain, anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm gonna burst...\" Cassi moaned, rubbing her huge belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you leave the washing up to me?\" Madison interjected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi looked relieved. \"Thanks...I need a lye down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison stood up, arched her back and groaned when she saw the full expanse of her swollen belly. She quickly pulled her top down to conceal her exposed midriff, then gathered up the plates and started cleaning up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi waddled over the couch and collapsed onto her back. Unlike Madison, she left her big belly exposed, and massaged it while she lay there. Every so often, Madison heard her belch, or moan, or groan...though she wasn't sure if the moans were out of pleasure of discomfort. Madison was feeling pretty tired herself, and as soon as the washing up was done, she stripped to her underwear and collapsed into bed, not even bothering with her pajamas tonight. Cassi followed suit, and when she clambered into bed in her bra and panties, Madison was amazed they still fit her. Her breasts had gone up at least one cupsize since she started gaining, and were overflowing her lace bra, while her big, round booty had almost swallowed her panties entirely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She really needs to lose a few pounds, </i>Madison thought as she eyed her friend's big butt, but her train of thought was disrupted by a sudden \"URRRRRRRRRRRRP!\" which escaped her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that you way of saying goodnight?\" Cassi asked playfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison burst out laughing. \"Sorry...oh man...\" she gave her belly a gentle rub as she drifted off to sleep. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a multiple hour drive, they arrived in Cassi's town in rural Kansas. The surroundings could not have been more different than what Madison grew up in. Madison's upbringing was in South Florida, in the rity suburbs of Miami. Her and her friends were used to going to the beach, and a conspicuous consumption did not phase them. There was a certain standard of style on had to posses if they wanted to be accepted. She already knew that Cassi's family lived on a wheat farm, which was part of the reason she wanted to stay back and work out. Madison felt out of place as Cassi drove up to the farm house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that struck her was that her notion of what a family farm looked like was off. She thought it was going to be a small operation, but she was wrong. About a mile away from the house Cassi noted, ''So this is where my parents property starts.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh, I don't see a house.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, it's a ways away,'' she noted as they turned off the highway and onto a gravel road. Cassi's mid 90s SUV shook and dumped up gravel while Madison felt uncomfortable--she had never been on a gravel road like this before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''How large is your farm.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''About 1800 acres.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison had no idea what that meant, she just nodded her head and assumed off the tone that Cassi used, that it was pretty large. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the house, Madison thought it looked rather picturesq. It was a large house that looked like it was built in the 1930s, but had been very well maintained. There were sheds everywhere around it, and impressive looking machinery, none of which Madison knew what it did. But even with her crude knowledge level, Madison could tell that Cassi's family farm was well off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they parked next to the house, Madison got out and streched. She felt sluggish from sitting down for so long and not moving after they got their fast food on the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked into the house where Cassi's Mom came running to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Casssiiiii, welcome home!!! We all missed you so much. How's college-'' and before Cassi could answer, her Mom cut her off, ''oh and you must be Madison! Cassi told me about what a great roommate you've been. We're so excited to have you.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison didn't really know what to say, except she thought Cassi's Mom seemed really nice and she could see where Cassi got her personality from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Mom continued, ''well, dinner is almost ready, I hope you both are hungry, because I made a roast, mashed potatoes, corn, and a cake.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Geez, Mom, it isn't Thanksgiving or anything,''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, well we were all so excited to have you back, and you know how much I love to cook.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Cassi went to the car to get some stuff. Madison stayed in the house and noticed that Mrs. Mitchel was somewhat larger than average, although at the moment, it looked like Cassi was bigger. Cassi's Mom looked like someone who had a good body in high school, but slowly let it go after having kids. She had a big but that was confined in Mom jeans, a belly that stuck out, and flabby arms. This contrasted with Madison's image obsessed Mom, who still had the body of a 30 year old. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of Cassi's family joined them for dinner. Cassi's Dad seemed really friendly, but Madison could tell that he was tough, but he seemed to like Madison, and was amused by some of her city qualities. Cassi had two sisters as well. Rebecca, who was older and came home from her job in town to see Cassi, and Erin, who was still in high school. Rebecca looked to be about 215 pounds, and flabby all over. She had big thighs, and a large stomach, like Cassi if she gained even more weight. Erin on the other hand, looked to be in great shape, pretty much like Cassi was when she got to campus. ''hmm, I wonder if Rebecca blew up in college,'' wondered Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison quickly learned where Cassi got her gracious manner with food from. Cassi's Mom dished up servings for everyone, and Madison's plate was filled with a huge serving of roast, she thought maybe 16 ounces, then there was mashed potatoes and gravy, which Madison thought could have been a meal of there own, and on top of that it looked like two cobs of corn had been cut up and put on her plate. Madison had no idea how she could finish any of this. The rest of the people at the table dug in. Madison slowly looked up while everyone was eating and wondered if these portions were common place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she took her first bite she realized that this roast was amazing. She had never had meat this good in her life, including the places she went out to eat in Miami. Cassi's Mom was apparently a gifted cook, but not in the gourmet style, but rather, a rural midwestern way, where calories were nothing to be afraid of. Madison blew through her plate faster than she realized. It was almost like she lost control, as the taste of the food made her keep eating, even though she could feel herself getting full. After she finished she stared at her plate and felt ashamed. Then Cassi's Mom came out with pie. ''Oh you have got to be kidding me,'' thought Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi's Mom looked first to Madison, ''Hey Madison, you want some cake.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I don't know Mrs. Mitchel, your food was so good, I kind of overdid myself.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi picked up, ''Madison you have to try my Mom's fudge chocolate cake, it's the best dessert ever.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison thought to herself, ''Jesus Cassi, now if I back out, it will be awkward.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, what the heck, when is the next time I'll be in Kansas.'' And, with that Madison had a huge slice that Cassi's Mom cut for her. The cake was, of course amazing, and so rich. However, it probably contained close to an additional 600 calories, given the awful ingredients. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner Madison felt a fullness like she never had before. As her and Cassi were watching TV after dinner, Madison quietly undid her pants, which were causing her great discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over at Cassi after she did this who was wearing sweatpants. ''Rats, I should have thought of that.'' thought Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That night, Madison went to bed clutching a belly the size of a basketball. She had eaten way more than she should have lately, but this probably the most food she had ever consumed in a single sitting. It wasn't until she tried to rise from the table that she realized just how heavy her stomach had become. After several attempts to stand, she finally managed to heave herself up from the dinner table, at which point her tank top rode up to just beneath he breasts, exposing her globular belly to the rest of the family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison blushed and pulled her top back down, but nobody seemed to have noticed, and if they did, they were too polite to say anything. She suddenly realized her pants were still unbuttoned, and quickly thanked Cassi's Mom for the dinner and rushed out of the room. \u201cThat was so humiliating...I really overdid it...\u201d Madison thought as she climbed the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison had been given the spare bedroom, and given how huge the family home was, it was pretty spacious. She was utterly exhausted after her overindulgence at dinner, and barely managed to strip out of her clothes before she collapsed onto her back on the comfy bed with a tired groan. She looked down at her hugely bloated stomach as she lay there, rising and falling as she breathed in and out...she couldn't recall a time she had ever been so full. For the next few minutes, she could only listen to her stomach churning while she gently massaged it with her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was disturbed from this process by a knock at the door. \u201cMad? You in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Cassi. She didn't want anyone to see her right now, but she knew she couldn't really lock herself away and ignore her friend after the warm welcome she had been given. \u201cJust a second...\u201d Madison called back, while she scrambled to find something to cover herself. She heaved herself off the bed and rummaged through a nearby suitcase, trying to find something to conceal herself. Unfortunately, she hadn't packed many conservative outfits...and all she could find were skirts, shorts, skin tight jeans and form fitting tops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi knocked the door again. \u201cYou okay in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a sec!\u201d Madison blurted out as she finally seized a fluffy bathrobe she had brought along with her. She quickly put it on and tied the sash across her waist. There was a bulge underneath, but it wasn't too noticeable. She hurried across to the door and opened it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hey,\u201d Cassi said, as though she had been expecting someone else. \u201cYou okay? You disappeared pretty quick after dinner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust uh...needed the bathroom,\u201d Madison lied. \u201cDinner was amazing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad you thought so,\u201d Cassi smiled. \u201cThough I didn't used to eat as much as this...\u201d she rubbed her hand over her partially exposed gut, which was looking as big as Madison had ever seen it. Cassi's clothes were getting so tight that they looked ready to burst open any day now. Even those sweatpants were stretched across her widening butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, when the food is this good, how can you not?\u201d Madison smiled. She might have said 'then maybe you should start cutting down', but from past experience, that would only hurt Cassi's feelings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi rubbed her swollen stomach and nodded in agreement. \u201cAnyway, just wanted to check you were okay, good night!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNight!\u201d Madison smiled as she closed the door. When Cassi had gone, she shrugged off the robe and collapsed onto the bed again, rubbing her heavy stomach as she feel asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Madison awoke the next day, her belly was still looking a little bloated, but not nearly as huge as it had been last night. She ran her hand over her  stomach and cringed at the bulging flesh. Her toned abs were becoming less and less visible lately, and it seemed as though she was waking up with a food hangover every morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her second day on the farm, Madison decided to play it safe and wear her sweatpants at mealtimes. Breakfast proved to be an equally huge feast, almost as vast and calorie laden as dinner. Sausages, Bacon, Eggs, Pancakes...there was food being dished up every direction Madison looked, and the sweatpants only served to increase her capacity. Everything tasted so amazing, she hated to turn down a second helping...or a third...or fourth. Cassi's Mom seemed to have a never-ending supply of food somewhere, because she seemed to be producing it faster than anyone could consume it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Madison had stuffed herself silly by the end of breakfast, Cassi and Rebecca had truly outdone themselves. The two sisters were liked bottomless pits once they got going, and Cassi seemed to be fast approaching her meatier sister's size. Erin, on the other hand, only ate a single plateful, and immediately headed out for a jog when she was done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat used to be me...\u201d Madison thought as she watched the slender blonde duck out the front door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was uneventful, as Cassi was too full to make much of an effort. That suited Madison fine, as she was exhausted after her epic breakfast, and wanted to rest for a while. The end result was both girls lounging in Cassi's bedroom watching TV for the rest of the day. Two huge sandwiches were provided for lunch, but Madison was still stuffed from breakfast and only managed to finish half of hers. Cassi stepped in to help, however, and finished off her leftovers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Madison was starting to feel a little less lethargic, the dinner bell rang, and another massive feast awaited her. She attempted to hold back, but in the end, she ate just as much as last night, topped off with two servings of double fudge cake and ice cream. She could hardly move after the meal, but consoled herself that at least had remembered to wear her sweatpants tonight. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, Cassi got a text from one of her high school friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Madison, Vanessa, one of my high school girlfriends just texted me, want to go to a shed party?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison looked at the floor, this had to be the most country thing she had ever heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this was it sounds like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, her parents are not home. They're fun! We drink and we'll probably dance, some hot guys may be there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was actually intrigued by this. Sure she would never let her friends back in South Florida see this, but she was always up for an adventure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, after another day of large portions, Madison was looking at her outfits. She knew it was colder, but she was really kicking herself for not bringing a sundress. \"Why did I pack all these trendy outfits if I knew I was going to the middle of nowhere,\" she thought to herself. Back at Powers and in Coral Gables, Madison was pretty good at walking the fine line between tight clothing, and a slutty outfit. She realized however, that with the extra bloat and her slightly larger stomach, her currently clothing would not be very flattering. Madison wasn't stupid, and excelled at fashion. She knew that she wasn't close to fat, or even chubby at this point, but if she tried to put her too tight pants on, it may make her look 10 pounds heavier than she actually was, and draw attention to her slightly softer than normal body. Madison, still in the sweatpants and a t-shirt she had been wearing all day, went down to talk to Cassi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Cassi, this is embarrassing, but my clothes are a bit tight from all the food we've had this week. Could we run into town, and I can just buy a pair of jeans, or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah of course, but the one thing is, Manhattan, KS is over an hour away, and that's as close as we will get to the type of clothes you like. We may have to settle for the Wal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if that's all we have, lets try that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe department store was on the edge of Cassi's small town. Madison had actually never been to one, because her parents liked a slightly more upscale chain department store for their needs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe store rose out of the cornfields and looked somewhat alone. Madison remembered reading an article about why this particular chain did this. They liked to skirt zoning laws and get sweetheart deals from smaller and sometimes unincorporated areas that gave them tax breaks. \"Typical,\" Madison thought as she and Cassi walked into the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went to the women's clothing section, and Madison looked at the jeans. They were boring, and they didn't seem to have the most durable design. One of the things Madison liked about the clothes she was used to wearing was that they held up pretty well, and that was how she could justify buying them....well that and her Dad's emergency credit card. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison looked at the sizes, and she sized up, but then tried them on and they were quite loose, so she went with her normal clothes. Madison knew that she had grown a bit, and assumed that these sizes ran large (which they did), but it still made her feel a little better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening they drove to the party. Madison was wearing the boring jeans, and a nice shirt, but one that somewhat covered up her stomach, bloated again from another dinner. Cassi was wearing clothes that were much more trendy than Madison's, despite her larger size, because she was at home, and didn't have to make the last second discount chain store purchase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the party, Madison noticed that there was a ton of beer. A row of kegs, and then a lot of girls dressed in slutty skirts showing tons of skin and exposed midriff. \"Well, I misprojected on that one,\" thought Madison. There were also a good amount of guys there. They all seemed to be wearing pants that were a bit too loose and button up shirts that had designs that guys in Miami stopped wearing 5 years ago. \"So many stereotypes confirmed,\" thought Madison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison took ample advantage of the beer, and the chance to meet Cassi's high school friends. All of them looked to be about the same weight as Cassi was before she gained, with the exception of a few chubby ones. Given how outgoing Madison was, they all hit it off pretty well. In no time they were putting back cup after cup of beer, and chatting up guys. Madison got a little hazy after beer number 8, but the last thing she remembered was dancing with a rather attractive guy friend of Cassi's. As they grinded, through her drunken thoughts, she wondered if he noticed the bit of softness that had settled on her stomach and hips. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was around two o'clock in the morning before the party started winding down. There were people making out, passed out on couches and drunkenly stumbling into taxi cabs outside, as well as one or two girls throwing up in the bushes. It had been a much wilder night than Madison had expected; much to her surprise, Cassi and her Kansas friends really knew how to throw a party! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi stumbled towards Madison drunkenly as they headed for the front door. She was still holding a cup of beer in one hand, and she downed it in one go as she approached. Cassi was smiling as she approached, and her shirt had ridden up to just above her belly button, exposing her beer filled stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to...URP...go?\" Cassi asked, belching and draping her hand around Madison's shoulder and nearly dragging her down to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to call a cab?\" Madison asked, trying to stay standing under Cassi's considerably weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naaaaaaaaaaah,\" Cassi said, pulling Madison towards the door. \"It's a half hour walk home, we can save the money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" Madison asked. \"You look like you can barely stand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...I'm not as...think...as you drunk...I am...\" Cassi slurred her words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison burst out laughing. \"Yeah, sure you're not,\" she grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi giggled. \"Hey, you put it away too...I saw youuuuuuu...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah...\" Madison giggled as they walked out of the front door and past a couple making out on the dusty floor. Madison had drunk her fair share of beer tonight as well, and when she looked down, she saw that Cassi wasn't the only one who was bloated. The combined effects of breakfast, lunch, dinner and half a keg of beer had left her belly bulging out a few inches. \"Ugh...beer belly,\" she groaned, poking at her full stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine's bigger...\" Cassi mumbled, and, to Madison's surprise, she pulled up her top to reveal the full expanse of her beer filled gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woahhhhhh,\" Madison gasped and gave her friend's exposed belly a poke. It was tight as a drum. \"You look ready to burst!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi just laughed again, and rubbed her stomach gently. \"I feel ready to burst...URRRRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me help...\" Madison giggled as she reached for Cassi's pants and, in one swift motion, unbuttoned them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Cassi yelped as her pants were opened up, then let out a sigh of relief as her stomach bulged free of it's fabric prison. \"Okay...that felt good. Let me do you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I don't - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Madison could finish, Cassi reached down, grabbed hold of the top button of her jeans, and unfastened it. Madison blushed as she felt an immense sense of relief, and her own belly jutted forwards with a wobble. \"Oh man...that was nice. URP! Ugh...excuse me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi groaned and rubbed her belly as they walked down the long dirt road that led to her house. It was dark, and the girls stumbled every once in a while, their bellies sloshing with alcohol. The walk seemed to take much longer than Cassi had promised, but they were too tipsy to really notice the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we nearly there yet?\" Madison asked as her legs started to ache. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not long now...\" Cassi replied groggily, then lent against a fence for, puffing and panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Madison asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...out of breath...\" Cassi huffed. \"Oh man...I am really out of shape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison wasn't sure what to say to that. It was the first time she had heard Cassi complain about her weight. \"You need a rest?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...for a second...\" Cassi panted, her fingers rubbing the sides of her taught belly. \"Madison...do you...think I'm getting fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm...well...you might have put on a few pounds I guess...\" Madison stammered. \"But everyone does in their first year of college!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...the freshman fifteen...\" Cassi agreed, then looked down at her bulging stomach. \"But come on...we both know I've gained more than fifteen pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Madison asked, trying to act ignorant. In truth, she knew Cassi had gained more like fifty...but saying that out loud wouldn't help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi pushed her belly out as far as it would go, making herself look positively enormous. \"Seriously,\" she said, patting her stomach for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I think I've gained a few pounds as well...\" Madison admitted for the first time as she poked at the place her abs had once been. There was no denying she had gotten a little softer lately. If Cassi could admit it, so could she. Hopefully it would make her chubby friend feel better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...maybe a little...\" Cassi said, staring at Madison's body intently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassi, don't worry about it...I don't think anyone's even noticed,\" Madison said. \"You just got a few curves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than a few...\" Cassi smiled again and pointed to her breasts, which had gone up at least one cup size since she started gaining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison laughed. \"Oh yeah...don't think I'm not jealous of those bad boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad boys?\" Cassi burst out laughing, and Madison joined her. \"You like the twins, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think plenty of guys do too,\" Madison winked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi giggled again. \"I guess my freshman fifteen does have it's plus side,\" she said. \"Thanks Madison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued on towards the house, and managed to get home by three o'clock. They tried to make as little noise as possible as they turned the key in the front door, but their constant giggling and telling each other to shut up caused Erin to yell, \"KEEP IT DOWN!\" at one point, which only caused them to burst out laughing as they climbed the stairs and went to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are going to have such a hangover tomorrow...\" Cassi whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRRRRRRRP!\" Was all Madison responded with, sending both girl's into fits of giggles once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison returned to her room, stumbled towards the bed, and shuffled out of her clothes until she was completely naked, before collapsing into bed, her eyes fixated on the huge dome of a belly she had gained over the course of the day. <i>\"Oh man...I look like I swallowed a keg...\" </i>she thought, before drifting off to sleep. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, Madison woke up, and instantly felt the pain of a pounding headache. \"Ugggghhhhhhhhh,\" was all she could get out before she let her head fall back into her pillow and then slept for another 3 hours. It wasn't 1pm until she woke up, and although she felt marginally better, she was still in some serious pain. After a stumble out of bed, she put on a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt that had been hapazaardly thrown onto the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went into the bathroom to brush her teeth and try to get the taste of alcohol out of her breath, which was making her gag. Madison would have chuckled if she wasn't in such pain when she saw herself in the mirror. Her hair was a mess, and somehow holding itself up in ways that physics could not yet explain. Her makeup from last night was smeared all over the place. As she raised her tooth brush into her mouth, she felt something else coming up, \"oh god,\" was all she could get out in a meek voice before she dropped to her knees and threw up with most of it hitting the toilet. Madison sat there for a second, inches away from the splattered toilet, eyes closed, and suffering from the pain of a headache, combined with the gag reflex of throwing up. She took a second to compose herself, and then took some toilet paper out to clean the bowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Madison went back into the bedroom, and collapsed onto the bed into a position where she was laying on her side. After she woke up from an unplanned nap, she noticed something, that her swollen stomach had receded, but was still soft enough that her six pack was a distant memory. She poked it, and noted how foiergn the softness felt to her. Then, she noticed, while laying down, that the interior side of her left leg also looked a bit softer as well. These were all alarm bells for Madison, and she was irritated this was happening. But at the moment, the only thing she wanted to do was defeat her hangover, so she rolled back to sleep and took another nap. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It took the rest of the day for Madison's hangover to subside. During that time, she spent most of the day sleeping, only waking when Cassi brought her some dinner, which she just about managed to eat. Cassi was equally hungover, but unlike Madison, it didn't seem to be affecting her appetite. Later in the evening, Madison was lounging in Cassi's room watching TV and eating from a large bag of chips while Cassi lay on the bed absent mindedly rubbing her growing gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, hot tub party tomorrow?\" Cassi asked, out of nowhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Madison crunched a chip and turned around to face her chubby friend. \"Hot Tub?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friend Amy, she invited us both for a Hot Tub party tomorrow,\" Cassi said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison remembered Amy from the party, they had gotten on pretty well...but she wasn't sure about the idea of exposing her body in a hot tub with a bunch of people she barely knew, especially when she wasn't at her physical best right now. There was no denying the extra pudge she had gained over the past few weeks, and wearing a bikini as she clambered into hot water would only expose that. \"Erm...maybe...I don't know if I can face another party after last night...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, it'll be a much quieter party than yesterday's,\" Cassi assured her. \"Amy has a huge hot tub in her garden, it's really cool...well...hot...actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison smiled, but inside she was trying to think of some excuse. \"You know...I don't think I brought my swim wear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I saw you pack it,\" Cassi replied. \"That red bikini, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Dammit, no way out now...\"</i> Madison thought. She was surprised Cassi was so keen on attending, given her current size, she doubted anything she owned would fit her now, and even if she did find something, it was going to display the huge amount of weight she had gained since she left. Perhaps she didn't care? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison eventually agreed to go, not that she had much choice. She went to bed dreading the next day, fearing that her skimpy bikini might not fit her anymore, that she would be spilling out of her top, that her stomach would would be jiggling and bulging while all of Cassi's hot friends lounged around with their perfect bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the time finally came to get ready, Madison stripped out of her clothes and grabbed her bikini from her luggage. It was a skimpy two piece which she had chosen specifically to accentuate her toned, flawless body at the beach. She ran her hand over her bare belly, which, despite not eating very much yesterday, still looked a little bloated...but felt more soft than full. She quickly avoided focusing too much on her stomach and slipped the bikini on. <i>\"Still fits,\"</i> she thought, though she had hardly expected to have outgrown it this quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when she turned to look at her reflection in the mirror, it didn't fit quite as perfectly as it used to. For the first time, she became aware of the fact that her breasts looked bigger...they were pressed together in the red top, creating an impressive display of cleavage which wasn't entirely unwelcome. She spun around and saw that the bikini bottoms now clung to her butt, which was sticking out a lot more than it used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison sighed and turned back around before running her hands over her stomach. \"No more abs...\" she lamented, poking the soft flesh of her growing belly. She wondered how much weight she had gained, but then decided she was better off not knowing, it would just have made her feel worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they left, she put on a pair of short shorts, only to find they had grown uncomfortably tight. She chose a large, oversized shirt that hid most of her body, hoping nobody would notice. When she met up with Cassi in the hall, she was dressed in an almost identical outfit, except her gain was far more obvious. Her thighs touched, her belly bulge was visible under her shirt, and her ass was almost bursting out of her shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to go?\" Cassi asked. \"I had to borrow a bikini from Rebecca, we're about the same size now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat explained that then...there was no way Cassi would have fit into one of her old swimming costumes. Cassi's Dad gave them a lift to Amy's house, where Amy quickly welcomed them into the garden. There were only six guests, from the looks of things, two guys and four girls. When Madison saw the other girls, she suddenly felt a lot more at ease; one of them was even bigger than Cassi, another had to be a good twenty pounds heavier than Madison, and the other two were curvy, with minor beer bellies beginning to show. The two guys were in much better shape, and sported lean, muscular bodies with rippling six pack abs. Madison was impressed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was the fittest girl there, possessing a body that resembled the one Madison had at the start of college, only with bigger boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, the tub's heating up,\" Amy announced. \"Mark is going to get the barbeque going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison looked over to where Mark stood, his shirt already off. He was loading up the barbeque with burgers. Suddenly, she felt her stomach rumble. <i>\"No, got to control myself tonight...\"</i> she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, everyone was in their swimswear. Madison felt a lot better now that she was surrounded by girls a lot bigger than herself. Cassi looked absolutely huge in her borrowed bikini, her boobs jiggled up and down every time she laughed, and her ass had grown so big that she nearly knocked Madison over with it once or twice. Her larger friend, Meg, had to be pushing two hundred and fifty pounds, and had chosen a one piece swimsuit that did little to hide her giant gut. The two curvier girls, Rachel and Stacey, had gotten a little too big for their outfits, and Madison saw them readjusting their tops once or twice to keep their boobs contained. The larger of the two guys, Brad, did not fail to notice this either, and was constantly flirting with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food's up!\" Mark shouted.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite her previous warning to herself to lay off food while in her swimwear, Madison didn't say anything about Mark loading her plate up with two burgers. She had assumed that maybe he just cooked too much meat, plus, she rationalized, she didn't have to eat it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was happy that the currents from the jets hid her little belly that previously was not there, as well as her small love handles that were new and seemed a bit larger than before she spent the week with Cassi. It wasn't the belly that alarmed her. She had assumed that this would go away when she started eating well again, it was the love handles that she was dreading. Madison figured that those showed a dispository of fat, something that was the long term result of eating, and not just some temporary bloat. She thought about how much she would have killed herself if she had looked this different in Miami. Madison didn't know how much she gained, and she wasn't fat, or even all that chubby yet, but way bellow the the perfection that she was used to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls and guys had a fun time in the hot tub, and she ended up sitting next to mark. They got to talking and had a fun time, before she noticed, she had finished the first burger. While Mark was saying something to her, she thought to herself, \"Hmmm, I did say one burger, but how about just one more bite of the other, no reason I can't just leave the rest.\" This was a solid plan for her, until she realized that she also polished off the second one about 10 min later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison slid her hand down to feel her stomach, and feared that it was bloated in her skimpy bikini, there would be no way to cover it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmygosh, Mark, you must think I'm such a pig, I scarfed off another huge burger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Well I'm sure you can't tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's pretty bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well okay Kraft, lets get out of the hot tub and see the damage,\" he said, smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison didn't really understand why he was doing this. Was he teasing her? But he was smiling in a flirty kind of way. She was confused. Mainly because he was hot and she wanted to see where it went, she got out, and they went around the corner, to a place where the others were not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison pointed to her small belly, which was temporarily larger, \"Yeah this used to be rock hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hitting up the cafeteria too much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark! What the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm joking, but I expected something else from Cassi's workout freak roommate I heard all about,\" right when Madison was about to throw her drink in his face he put a hand on her stomach and squeezed it a bit, \"but I think you're still pretty cute with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was confused by this whole exchange. Was he making fun of her? But he seemed to enjoy this. She had no idea what was going on, but she decided to throw out her thought process and take it down to this, a hot guy who she may never see again clearly wanted on her, and that was enough for her--so they went into a bathroom together and Madison did the rarity (for her, she wasn't a slut, she thought) of a one time encounter. </span></div></div>",

Come on Casssi.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was hoping that not everyone at the party knew about it.

Stop it, Cassi.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Look, I think Mark is cool, he's def hot, why would it matter?'' Cassi was being honest, but she also wanted to know if her friend Mark had snagged one of her friends from high school.

She then moved to write a text to Mark, <i>That moved really fast, can we please grab dinner tomorrow</i> she sent it and then realized how prudish she felt.

Mark responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that they took off on conversation about how stupid pickup truck commercials were that continued into the restaurant. While they were riding, Madison was adjusting her outfit, another one that she choose from the store they had gone to. Madison felt like she was living out of a suitcase at the moment, far away from her trendy outfits and full assortment of make-up. She felt frumpy in her cheap jeans and top. While Mark was talking, she caught herself wondering,  <i>If only he could see how great I look back home---wait, what do I care, I',m never seeing this guy again after this week.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got into town, he took Madison to one of the nicer restaurants, although for Madison's tastes it seemed rather dated, she would prefer a night at the trendy sushi place downtown back at Powers to where they were at, but obviously, she kept quiet about these things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe server quickly came, and Madison did not know what to get, and then just said she would order what Mark was having, after the server left, Mark informed Madison, ''You know, that's a lot steak I ordered,'' to which Madison look embarrassed and responded, ''well, I guess I'll have some lunch tomorrow.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they talked, Madison realized that this guy who she assumed to just be a hot hick, was actually pretty smart. She learned more about him. His Dad led their farm, which sounded very large to the point where he did not run day to day operations. Mark was going to the local college and majoring in some form of agribusiness with the intention of taking it over. Madison was very impressed by all of this, plus--he was really hot, Madison thought, so that did not hurt either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison and him talked and laughed all through dinner, and Madison realized that she really liked, him...a lot. The decision to have a one night stand with him the evening before seemed like a lucky hit and this point, and now she wanted to come to his place after dinner. As she was thinking all this, she realized that she had completely cleared all the steak, and mashed potatoes and rice...she had killed the entire meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Man, you really demolished that,'' Mark noted to Madison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison turned red, and wondered why Mark was always so eager to mention her food intake, something she was very insecure about. Madison was still pretty thin, with a bit of extra pudge on her stomach, upper thighs, and love handles, but she wanted to eventually lose it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they got back, they watched a movie together in his parents' basement and proceeded to make out. Madison was thrilled by this, but the whole time noticed that his hands were almost massaging her belly fat, and that he kept grabbing her love handles, for a second, she said through the kissing, ''stop grabbing there, I'm embarrassed.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only responded with, ''I like these'' while squeezing her love handles. </span></div></div>",

''I was caught up in the moment.'' Mark had never told anyone that he liked women who were...larger. When he saw Madison at the pool last night, the slight pudge on her figure, combined with her hot looks drove him nuts, and he got carried away just now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was not a fan of this. She misunderstood what he was saying, and thought that he was into shaming girls, getting their confidence down, and pointing out their weaknesses. ''Ugh, you know, I actually had a crush on you all through the night...I could get a lot of guys you know. You are such a jerk.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was struggling for things to say, he knew this situation was getting away from him as well. He never had problems with girls either, but he liked Madison. At the very least, she was friends with Cassi, a good friend of her's from high school, and he did not want his secret preferences getting out. He had gone a long time without any other soul ever knowing her liked girls who were chubby, but he knew know was the time to take a chance appealing to the nicer side of a girl her would probably never see again and ask her not to say anything, than to have her go back and tell Cassi that her friend was some kind of controlling guy, who loved pointing out flaws in girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wait...okay, can I please tell you something, if you promise not to tell anyone. Please.'' Mark almost begged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was angry, she wasn't giving him much time, ''I don't really care what you have to say right now, Mark'' as she walked towards the basement door. Mark ran to try to get in front of her and made eye contact with her, ''Madison, I've never told anyone this, could you please give me a second.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was still angry at him for some off form of fat shaming she could not comprehend, so she just looked at him with a 'go on' kind of face. Mark continued, ''ok, well...since I was younger, I have always found myself to prefer girls who are a bit...larger.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was just more shocked than anything, ''Umm...okay...''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark kept talking, ''Ok, I know that you probably think that I am a freak. That's fine, just please, please, please do not tell anyone.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison did not know what to say. She felt a sudden urge to go back in to kiss him. She didn't know why his being into her recent smallish gain got her going, but it did. She stood silently for a second...</span></div></div>",

Her lower lip curled in over her teeth and finally she sputtered.<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe I mis-judged you. Most jocks put hot girls who  pick up a few opiounds down so I just figured that coming from someone with your looks and family your remarks about my body were just a set-up before you dropped the F bomb on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F bomb?\" Mark queried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're an intelligent, nice girl but we just can't be more than friends because you're fat. That's what happens to fat chicks that give things away - they're fodder for guys who want to brag without commitment.  After giving in they get dumped. But I realize that's my fear, you actually never said or did that. But honestly, I've gained weight his year and I know it shows. And part of me fights doing anything effective about it. \" Madoson blurted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so why can't a nice intelligent girl who happens to enjoy food be more than a friend to a guy who happens to like her as she is?\" zeroed in Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you really don't care? Even if I gain more - which seems to be where I'm headed. You wouldn't be ashamed of being seen with a fat girl in public? What about when other guys tease you? Or your family?\" shot back Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've pondered all those issues, believe me,\" replied Mark. \"As for being seen in public, you name the restaurant or event. I've enough money to take you there proudly. And when we get there look around - there will be plenty of gals with guys just as big or larger rthan you - most of them happily married.  If anyone were to tease me about a choice I've made my answer to them would be not to judge what they've not tried - and won't have the chance to.  In short, back off. As for family, not an issue - I have both siblings and inlaws who are definitely in the upper BMI range - they would probably regard you as needing to grow a little. The question really is how does Madison feel about herself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I have been wrestling with that.  BIts like being arounbd Casse has awakened somerthing in me and I've changed. My grades have been great but my body has balooned and honestly I'm not caring abiout it the way I used to. But unlike your supporive relatives mine will likely have a cow when they find out - good grades or not!\" Madiso grumped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to let them know and tell them to let you get your own answers. Its not like you're doing anything illegal or immoral.  You're defining ourself raher than letting society do it.\"  Msark said. \"So, do you want to  put me to the test?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Test?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, make me show you off in public at a restaurant - then email your family about whatever you have, then telling them that you enjoiyed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Madison was into working out, and still liked flaunting her once thin body at the beach. She thought she had only gained 9 pounds (she was actually up to 145, a gain of 15 at that point) and she wasn't anywhere near the point of no return. However, what Mark was saying to her turned her on for reasons that she could not totally understand. \"However, I think you should get more food and bring it back here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, what do you want?\" Mark asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pick something that's fast, because I'm hungry again,\" Madison said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark left and drove to the nearest fast food place. During this time, Madison went around his basement, and found a kitchenette area, where there was a bag of chips that she ripped into. She sat on the couch, and watched some TV while she waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way to the fast food place, Mark could not believe that just happened. He had told a girl his secret, and she wasn't disgusted, or even that turned off. He was a mixture of excited and nervous while pulling up to the drive through. In a moment of panic, he just orded 3 cheeseburgers and a large fry. <i>She doesn't have to eat all of it</i> he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mark got back, he put the food on the coffee table, \"I hope you're hungry\" he remarked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison dug into the first two burgers and ate them quickly, with Mark somewhat amazed that she could do that so quickly after dinner. Madison was extremely full, and she could feel her belly pressing up against the button of the jeans she had just bought, however, she would eventually finish a third after much effort. They were about to make out again, when Madison texted Cassi, that she should wait to come pick her up until the morning. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't know how attached I can get though, I still have to go back to school with you in a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right...but you could always try long distance!\" Cassi half-joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't really see that happening.\" Madison sat there and explored the thought for a second, she really did like Mark, but she wasn't even his girlfriend yet. However, she really enjoyed the previous evening where Mark had basically fed her before they slept together. Plus, he seemed like a really nice guy who came from a good family, if it worked, why would she deny it and rule out at least keep in touch with Mark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison took a nap in the guestroom when she got back, and woke up right before lunch. As she woke up, she smelled what she could only assume was another large meal from Cassi's Mom and she felt...hungry. With the knowledge that Mark was into her gaining a bit of weight, she, at least temporarily, decided there was no downside to giving in to her temptations and eating all of the delicious food. However, she still did not think it was the right time to let anyone know about this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Madison got downstairs, she passed Erin, who had just gotten back from a run. \"I'll join everyone in a bit, I'm going to run up and shower before I eat,\" Erin told the table.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well I made enough chicken for everyone, so hurry,\" replied Cassi's Mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chicken was not what Madison was used to. At home, when her Mom made it, it was always grilled in a pretty small portion, served with a side of vegetables. Cassi's Mom served up a much different fare, fried chicken and mashed potatoes. Madison loved the new food, and had already helped herself to seconds by the time Erin got down to the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison saw Erin pick at her chicken a little bit, and wondered if that would have been her a while back, she was happy that she was enjoying herself, and with another massive meal, she was certain that Mark would be happy as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Madison wondered how it was that Cassi didn't weight as much as she did now when she came to the college, given all the cooking that her Mom did, but it all made sense as to why Rebecca had gained so much weight. Perhaps it was only a matter of time until even Erin saw the affects of a Mom who loved to cook in large portions. As they watched TV, Madison thought about how bloated her belly felt and occasionally massaged it. During that, her and Cassi got around to talking about Mark, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say I was interested in Mark--would he want to go long distance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" Cassi asked, after Madison dropped that bombshell on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...well...I don't know if I want to go exclusive or anything like that,\" Madison clarified, she was still in her first semester of college, after all, \"but maybe I could come back with you over Christmas break as well and see him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are things really moving this fast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were, somewhat. Madison was still in the infatuation stage of the relationship. It was somewhat unexpected that this would happen to her, as she had boyfriends throughout most of high school, and knew infatuation vs true love, but she still felt a rush like she had not experienced in a while towards Mark, and thought that it was at least worth exploring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I think it is. I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should do it!\" Cassi excitedly remarked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince it was her last afternoon in Kansas before break ended, Madison spent the rest of the afternoon pondering this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Madison got to Mark's that evening, they again had a massive meal, and started to make out again, with Mark's hand immediately going toward's Madison's belly, and gently massaging it, which never failed to get Madison going. After a bit of that, Madison sat down and got serious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark, I really like you. A lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark did not know what to expect, he liked Madison a lot, but like her, he assumed this was a quick fling, he knew that she had to go back to school, and he would resume classes as well, albeit locally, once his break was over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This week has been incredible, Madison\" he responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I've been thinking, maybe we could keep in touch over the semester? You know, text and call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to go long distance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not completely,\" Madison responded, \"but I am thinking about coming back down here over Christmas break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that sounds great.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was thrilled. Like Madison, he wanted to keep this fling going as long as possible, because he thought that he found something in Madison, plus, she was not turned off by this desire to see her grow larger. </span></div></div>",

Mark wasn't there to enjoy her body in person, but from the attention he had paid to her bloated belly every time they made out, she knew he wouldn't mind a glimpse of her body now and then, and the more he got turned on by her growing body, the more she got turned on. She had no desire to turn into an enormous, three hundred pound blob, with Mark as her feeder, but every time she indulged herself with a big meal, she was going to be sure to show him the results...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they went away, Madison had been trying to suppress Cassi's appetites and hold off on overeating when they ordered their customary takeouts, but this week she was putting in an extra order and hurrying Cassi to put the call in to the Pizza place while it was still light. Cassi was slightly taken aback by Madison's change of attitude, but she didn't raise any objections. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the food arrived, Madison dug in eagerly, scooping out a little extra for herself. She planned to get nice and full by the end of the meal, and was hoping Cassi wouldn't get carried away too soon and leave her with nothing. Madison ate voraciously, stuffing slice after slice into her mouth, chugging from a 2 litre bottle of soda to further enhance the size of her bulging stomach. By the time she had finished, she had consumed an entire pizza all to herself. Wasting no time, she got to her feet with a groan and hurried to the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocking the door behind her, Madison pulled up her shirt to expose the entirety of her spherical, food stuffed belly, unbuttoned her pants and took a picture with her phone. She tried several poses before finally selecting one in which she was sticking out her stomach as far as it would go, pulling a very innocent looking expression which seemed to say <i>\"oh my gosh look how much I ate!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled to herself as she sent the pic to Mark. Within seconds, he had replied. She opened the message excitedly - <i>\"Wow, you look amazing! I love that big sexy belly of yours when you're all bloated and cute XD\".</i> Madison didn't need any more encouragement than that; she hurriedly pulled her top off over her head, slid down her jeans and posed in her underwear, one hand on her bloated belly. She snapped a second pic and sent it over. Her phone buzzed again; <i>\"Oh my God you're killing me! You look like a freaking Goddess!\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison blushed a little and unclasped her bra. She used her free arm to cover her breasts and sent another pic. Mark sent back a reply almost immediately, this time, it was a picture of him, in his underwear, with a very large bulge straining his boxer shorts. Madison grinned as a follow up message came through; <i>\"Guess what I'm going to do now? ;)\" </i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison reached a hand into her panties and started rubbing, concentrating on Mark's last pic. She text back with her free hand, biting her lip. <i>\"Same thing I'm doing...\" </i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison sat on the couch clutching her distended belly. An empty McDonald's bag sat beside her with a hoard of empty wrappers strewn across the floor. Over the past 2 months she had been regularly sending Mark pictures of her bloated belly after stuffing herself with pizza, fast food, ice cream, or anything she could get her hands on. At first her belly would become rock hard after her massive feasts, but now a large enough layer of fat had settled on her midsection that it stayed soft even after eating an extra-large pizza in one sitting. Madison's shirt had ridden up from her latest feast, so she snapped a picture and texted it to Mark with the caption, \"guess it's time to go clothes shopping ;)\". After sending the picture, Madison tried to pull her shirt over her chubby belly and waited for a response. A few minutes and a few swigs of soda later Madison received a message, \"could I see a little more maybe?\" Madison took another swig of soda and attempted to stand up. Over the past few weeks, Madison had transformed into a certified couch-potato, spending the majority of her days eating, studying, watching TV, and playing around her laptop. Madison got up on her second try and made her way to the bathroom to take some more risque photos. She shut the door and slipped off her sweatpants, revealing her thick thighs and growing butt. Her panties strained from the added inches to her already sizable booty. Madison's legs were now a far-cry from what they were. Now at 175 pounds, cellulite replaced muscle tone and her thigh gap had disappeared with no chance of being found. Madison picked her panties out of her crack (which was now a common annoyance) and proceeded to take off her shirt. Now only in her bra and panties, Madison took a picture in the mirror with the caption, \"still want more?\" Mark responded almost immediately, \"yes please ;)\". She unclasped her bra and slid off her panties, revealing her chubby, voluptuous body. Madison let out a deep breath after taking off her bra. Her d-cup was starting to become especially uncomfortable. \"Maybe it's time to size up?\" she thought to herself. As she tried to find the sexiest pose in the mirror Madison caught glimpse of her double chin, which was starting to fill in. \"Do I really have a double chin?\" Madison thought to herself. Although she was overweight, Madison still didn't think of herself as fat, just curvy. She had previously associated having a double chin as the hallmark sign of being \"fat\" and suddenly realized how big she had become. She now had a certified pot belly that stuck out as far as her boobs. Speaking of her boobs, they were no longer perky as they once were, sagging slightly because of how large they had become. Madison sat down on the toilet seat to contemplate whether or not she liked her new body. When she sat down, she jiggly thighs and butt sagged over over the edges like a bag of pancake mix. Her jelly rolls sat on her soft thighs, hiding her belly button in a layer of fat. \"Jesus Christ how big am I?\" Madison asked her self as she slapped her belly, which proceeded to jiggle for a second. She then snapped a selfie of her tits and sent it to Mark. She then got up to put her panties back on when suddenly the door opened.</span></div></div>",

Madison in disbelief shrieked as she scrambled to find a towel to cover up her bare tits. \"Jesus Christ Cassie! Have you ever heard of privacy?\" Madison screamed as she quickly covered her boobs with a towel. \"Ohh sorry maddie, I didn't know you were in here\" Cassie said as she stumbled forward. \"Wowww Madison you're kinda fat,\" Cassie slurred as she poked her friend's growing belly. \"Haha Madison Kraft is fatter than me\" she jeered as she patted her own belly. Madison, in a fit of rage pushed Cassie away and stormed out the bathroom. \"I hate you Cassie!\" she screamed. Madison rushed into her room in tears and put some clothes on. She then went to the fridge and grabbed a pint of Ben and Jerry's to heal her sadness. She went back in her room and slammed the door, then sat on her bed crying. \"I hate being fat,\" she thought to herself, \" from now on I'm going to diet and exercise... After I finish this ice cream.\" Madison devoured the entire pint of ice cream along with a package of Oreos. Little did Madison know that changing her diet and routine would be much harder than flipping a switch. Despite her intent to lose weight, she was on a crash course to becoming  obese.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison did not really know how to tell Mark that she was becoming increasingly doubtful about this new direction that her body was going. She didn't mind when it was just a food baby on her otherwise good body, but know that she was fat--fat enough that a drunk Cassi was willing to point it out, Madison had changed her mind on her stuffing. However, this did not mean an end to sexting Mark. Each time she did it, she felt increasingly aroused, and she did not want him to lose interest in her just because of their geographical differences. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Madison still kept her deal about the gym up with Cassi (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/cid/1529540\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/cid...</a>), she would lay off the gym for a while, and then Cassi could lose weight without a hotter friend making her feel insecure about her body. The problem with this scenario now was that no one would ever mistake Madison for a gym rat on her new, larger frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, Cassi had begun to earn her end of the bargain. Slowly, but surely, she was losing a bit of weight, and going to the gym each day, even on days where she felt somewhat overwhelmed by school life or social demands, it may have only been 5 pounds, but a trend was started for Cassi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the following month, Madison's trend line was going another direction, something that she noticed whenever she tried to squeeze into clothes. She was mainly wearing sweats, since she hated the feeling of failure while she was putting on jeans or skirts. Part of the reason for her gain was the new habits that she had picked up. While she was constantly stuffing herself when she got back, she had expanded her stomach capacity, and now as a result, Madison found herself almost constantly hungry. This lead to around the clock snacking. Even when Madison did something like have a salad for dinner, she went and ruined it by having a family sized bag of chips when she got home. By the end of the month, Madison was up to 185 pounds, much of it being documented in her sexts with Mark, who was loving every minute of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all the negative feeling for her body throughout the day, Madison still felt odly turned on by the whole experience, and loved showing her body to mark. It was almost like the social pressures at Powers were too much, but being back in rural Kansas with him would have made this okay for her. She pondered the thought one evening when she got a text from Mark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Still have that bikini?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah, but it will not fit, I'm 30lbs larger.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You should try.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison did not know how to tell him in 180 characters that there was no way that fabric was supporting her larger boobs or bigger butt, but what was the harm in trying it anyway, she thought. As she proceded to dig to the bottom of her dresser, where her 'hot clothes' were located, Madison first found her bottoms, and then her top. Looking at them in comparison to her newly soft body made the request seem even more absurd. <i>Thank god Cassi is not home</i> she thought. Madison then proceded to lean down to try to pull her bikini bottoms on. As she did this, her belly hung over and turned into rolls, showing just how soft and large it had become.<i>Oh god</i> She thought, seeing herself in the mirror. After much pulling, Madison got the bikini bottoms on, but they did not look pretty. They pushed inward, making her thighs, love handles, and belly look bigger. She did not need to turn around to see how they looked on her butt, she could feel how tight they were, almost ready to snap off. As she moved to put on her top, she realized there was no way she would be able to clasp on something that tight, so, she did the  clasp before putting the bra style bikini top on, and slid it over the top. Her boobs fell over the tops, and she had a significant amount of backfat. Yet, he had proven her right. She still 'fit' into her bikini, even if it did not fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison walked over to her full length mirror and made a faux look of concern and she snapped her overflowing body and sent it in a text. <i>Guess you are right, but I don't know if I am beach ready</i></span></div></div>",

With flu season coming up, Madison's mom had signed her up to get the flu vaccine, along with a complementary physical. Madison took a swig from her Pepsi and sent Mark a selfie with the caption: \"at the doctors.\" Then a nurse walked in an called her name. Madison got up and followed the nurse into the hall. \"Take off your shoes and step on the scale at the end of the hall\" the nurse instructed. Madison took off her tennis shoes and stepped on the electronic scale. This was the first time he had weighed herself in nearly a month. After a few seconds a number came up on the screen. \"86.6 kg.\" Madison only knew pounds so she didn't really know how much she actually weighed. The nurse hen told her to strip down in one of the rooms and wait for the doctor. Madison stripped down to her bra and panties and waited patiently on the table. Finally after a few minutes the doctor came in. She then performed the basic measurements and tests, while jotting information down on her clipboard. After she had given Madison her shot, she began to talk to Madison. \"At 191 pounds, you're officially obese, with a bmi of 30. You're on a slippery slope Madison. Your blood pressure is higher than average, for your age. You should  really consider improving your diet and increasing your exercise.\" She then poked Madison's growing pot belly, which sagged over the waistband of her panties onto her thighs. \"Abdominal fat is a key indicator of overall body health. Having a large gut leads to an increased risk of heart disease and diabetes.\" Madison sat on the table dumbfounded. She knew she was chubby but she didn't realize that she had become obese. </span></div></div>",

She had not yet formulated any kind of plan of action to tackle her weight issue, however, all she wanted was to feel good, and food could do that for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I have a #1 and two extra pies?\" Madison asked the cashier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was waiting for her food, Madison thought about her growing gut, and thinking about how the large burger, and fries, and large coke, and pies, were not putting her in the right direction, but at the same time, she got excited for other reasons.

She quickly at the food, then went back to campus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Madison got back to the dorm, she wondered what had come over her.

As Saturday rolled around, Madison and Cassi got packed up and ready to go. Since there had been no need to, Madison didn't wear her trendy clothes at all, and just stuck with sweats, which was good, given that the food intake didn't slow down. Plus, it was a convenient excuse to go through the exercise of seeing if they fit. Even the day that she was hungover, and just laid in bed all day, Cassi's Mom brought her some fattening pastries that she scarfed down. Madison looked at her stomach, and noted that there was no way it had not grown some more. She also noted how her love handles felt softer. She looked in the mirror and wondered if her legs seemed a bit wider as well, or maybe it was just her imagination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison had a great week, but she also felt some remorse that she wasn't able to stay at Powers and work off the small amount of weight she had acquired up to that point. There was no doubt that she gained weight, all one had to do was look at her tummy bulge to see that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they left, Cassi's Mom made one final goodbye lunch for them. It was of course, Massive. She made huge servings of country fried steak, gravy and mashed potatoes. Madison had never had this before, and found it delicious. Despite her thoughts about a possible diet when she got back, she also figured, \"heck, when is the next time I'll be out here,\" allowing her to rationalize her indulgence. When they finished the meal, Madison noticed that her size S shirt was riding up a little bit and exposing some flesh that wasn't as tan as it used to have been. Madison felt sluggish again, and slowly rubbed her tummy to make some of the food pains go away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Cassi said goodbye to her parents and sisters and headed out. On the drive back Madison felt like she wanted to throw up. All the food just sat in her stomach. She also noted while sitting down that she thought her legs expanded more than usual. Was it temporary bloat? Her imagination? Or did she actually gain some weight this weekend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got back to the university, for most of the day, Madison ignored the scale. She wasn't really in a great mood to see what she had done to her body that week.

Madison stared down at the scales in disbelief, her mouth hanging open in horror. \"This can't be right...these scales must be broken!\" she said out loud, before jumping off the scales for a moment, allowing them to reset, then jumping back on. But the scales presented her with the exact same figure. 152. Somehow, she had managed to gain another thirteen pounds, and, combined with the nine pounds she had put on before break...she had gained a total of twenty two pounds overall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realization was more than she was prepared to absorb. Not only had she gained her freshman fifteen, she had <i>exceeded </i>it! She left the scales and hurried over to the full length bathroom mirror, which showed every inch of her body. Nervously, she let her wet towel fall to the floor and took in the sight of her naked body. She had avoided staring at herself in the mirror lately - something which she used to enjoy - because she didn't want to see the damage she had done to her body, but now she had to face herself. She had to see where those twenty two pounds had gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that came to her attention was her stomach, which had lost all traces of definition and now had a permanent bulge. It wasn't a pot belly yet, but it might be soon, if she didn't control herself. She ran her hands over her soft middle and poked a finger into her belly, wincing as she felt her fingers sink into a layer of flab. Love handles were starting to form at her sides, leading down to her larger butt. Madison turned around to examine her ass, and found that it stuck out a lot more than it used to. She grabbed a cheek and gave it a shake, only to find her firm ass had been replaced by a jiggly booty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap!\" Madison cursed, turning to the side and staring at her bulbous behind. \"This thing is huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, she examined her breasts, which she had noticed back at Cassi's house. Her bikini had been tighter than usual, and throughout the hot tub party, there had been moments where she had feared her boobs might pop out. She couldn't be sure, but it looked like they had gone up at least one cup size. This change...wasn't entirely unwelcome, as her boobs had retained their nice, perky shape. Her arms and legs looked a little thicker, and she had started to lose the definition she had worked so hard to get at the Gym. Fortunately, her face remained unchanged, and there was no sign of the double chin that Cassi had developed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison sighed and slumped down onto the floor, feeling utterly depressed. Her perfect, beautiful body was fading away before her eyes. She had promised herself she would never turn into one of those girls who gained a ton of weight during her first year of college, but it looked like she had failed now. She wasn't sure what to do with herself...</span></div></div>",

Since the beginning of the year she had gained over 38 pounds, and it was clearly evident on her. She wished that she had never gone to Kansas and indulged like that for the entire week, worst still, she had never been anything but thin in her entire life. She had already felt like fewer and fewer guys were flirting with her, and the hottest guys seemed to ignore her at parties for most of the past month. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was going to be hard, but this left Madison with very little choice...she was determined to lose the weight. After buying new gym clothes the following day, Madison got ready to head to the campus rec center, but she noticed that these clothes felt different than what she was used to. She had purposely put on a loose t-shirt that she had gotten from a guy friend in high school, so as to cover up the excess flab that she picked up, and her athletic shorts were intentionally long and a bit baggy, to hid her enlarged rear and thick thighs. This was in sharp contrast to what she used to work out in, a tight tank top and spandex short shorts. When she put her hair up in a tight ponytail, Madison noticed just how much softer her face looked, <i>I don't have a double chin yet--but I need to watch it</i>. Her harsh assessment of herself was correct, her face was slightly softer as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Madison got to the gym, the first thing that struck her was just how challenging it was. Before she felt like she could glide through workouts, and even moments of exhaustion made her want to work harder, like a feeling that felt good to chase. Now, she just felt pain, that and foreign feeling of the extra flesh moving around in her new sports bra and becoming moist as her out of shape physique began to sweat. Madison was embarrassed, how could the former 10 not be? But she felt like she had to keep going, even as she knew how horrible she looked. </span></div></div>",

He also noticed that the revered terms that guys used to talk about her in were no longer being used. In fact, Kyle realized, watching her soft body continue to push forward, he had not heard one of his friends even talk about her for the past few weeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, Kyle realized he probably should not be starring at Madison as intensely as he was, he had gym manners, he thought to himself.

Kyle had not told anyone else on campus, or really, ever, that he didn't mind softer women. The last thing anyone, including Kyle, wanted in their freshman year of college was to be tagged as somehow different. But this was an opportunity, he thought to himself.

If he had it could have assuaged some of the conflicts within himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe next day in class he passed Madison enroute to his own seat and smiled. She noticed and smiled back, recognizing him as the guy who the previous day she had felt was checking her out. His countenance didn\u2019t appear critical of her increased size and she wished he would say something. But he didn\u2019t and when she looked around for him after class he had disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison had returned to her former granola bar and fruit breakfast routine the previous day, following it up with a salad for lunch and a lite supper, even though she had to endure Cassie\u2019s entreaties to share her stroganoff. . This discipline, combined with returning to the gym, she was convinced should be good for at least two pounds a week \u2013 if she could keep it up. But only into her second day she felt like she was starving!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat afternoon she faithfully went to the gym again, running into Kyle as he was leaving. He smiled and held the door open, saying \u201cI noticed you in class today. My name\u2019s Kyle and even though we\u2019re in the same class together I\u2019m not sure of yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts Madison, Madison Kraft,\u201d she replied. \u201cThanks for asking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Madison hurried on, a little non-plussed that her radar was apparently accurate. He had been noticing her, and not in a critical way.  He seemed nice enough, why hadn\u2019t she taken time to let him talk more. Was she really that self-conscious about her size and fearing ejection?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening she mentioned the encounter to Kelli, who smiled. \u201cYou got a hello from Kyle Burgess, one of the shyest guys on campus? That\u2019s a first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you know him?\u201d replied Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot personally. But Beth\u2019s boyfriend, Ralph, lives in the same dorm. Claims he sticks to his books and is just quiet, sort of a philosopher and thinker, not really in sync with the campus party scene. He\u2019s apparently a simple guy from the country and would rather attend a square dance than a keg party\u201d confided Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, he seemed nice enough. I guess I\u2019ll just have to see,\u201d replied Madison. Later on, weary of diet rations for two days, she helped Cassi finish off the stroganoff from the night before and then had a large bowl of chocolate chip ice cream for dessert. She went to bed comfortably full but feeling guilty for her backsliding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning is was back to the granola bar and fruit regimen, this time a banana. Lunch was a chicken Cesar salad, with dressing she knew wasn\u2019t really low calorie.  After classes it was off to the gym for the third day in a row. She noted her stamina on the treadmill at least seemed to be improving \u2013 she put in a full fifteen minutes there plus half hour of other exercises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing back to her car she went to press her key ring \u2013 and couldn\u2019t find it. Looking in she saw it lying on the right hand seat \u2013 totally beyond reach.  Her head bent forward towards the roof and she began thumping the car with her fist in frustration. Then she backed off and just stood assessing the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProblems?\u201d inquired a voice behind her. Turning she saw Kyle, a concerned look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Yes,\u201d she said with exasperation. <br>\r\n\u201cDumb me \u2013 I\u2019ve locked myself out of my own car. Now its going to cost me a hundred dollars for a locksmith and I\u2019m upset. Can you blame me?\u201d she continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlame placing isn\u2019t called for here,\u201d answer Kyle softly, reaching into his pocket and pulling out his cell phone,. \u201cIt won\u2019t help anything. However if you will allow it a call to AAA might save you a c-note or so. May I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut won\u2019t they charge you?\u201d she stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I make too many calls, yes. But the base membership carries freebies and this will be the first one this year. I think it\u2019s a lot better than beating yourself up over something anyone could have happen.\u201d He answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis calm control disarmed Madison and she nodded, \u201cOK \u2013 and thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter first waiting in the call queue for about five minutes and talking for another five Kyle hung up, informing Madison it would be 30-45 minutes.  . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind I can bring my car over while we\u2019re waiting,\u201d he suggested. \u201cStanding like this can get rather tiring.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready weary from her workout Madison nodded. In about five minutes Kyle drove up in a white SUV. He noticed her adjusting her gum pasts, her belly pooching over the waistband, before climbing in. They chatted amiably about their majors and various other general subjects until the locksmith arrived and the car swiftly accessed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can I ever thank you enough?\u201d Madison said gratefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u201dWell,\u201c replied Kyle, going out on a limb.. \u201cAn episode like this tends to be a bit stressful and sometimes calls for a break to settle down. I didn\u2019t have much lunch today and was planning to drop by Dog-N-Shake. They have all sorts of flavors for their shakes and I\u2019d like to know you better when you\u2019re not so frustrated. Care to accompany me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison thought Kyle must be a mind reader. She indeed was stressed and felt ravenous. Without a moment\u2019s hesitation she agreed to go with, this time being sure to retain her keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only when their order arrived did she realize the special meant four burgers plus fries, but that point she didn\u2019t really care. Kyle noted that she had no problem with both burgers plus the majority of the fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle knew as they talked that there was a major cultural difference he was going to have to bridge, He had never been part of a sophisticated city culture like Coral Gables and wondered how Madison would react to the truth about himself.  Fortunately, because of Kelli\u2019s information, Madison provided the opening he needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know Kyle, you\u2019re a lot more open and conversational than your reputation says,\u201d she remarked. <br>\r\n\u201cEvery topic I\u2019ve brought up you\u2019ve gone with today \u2013 most guys would be lost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and what is my reputation?\u201d inquired Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat you\u2019re a country music lover who prefers square dancing over parties,\u201d answered Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s true enough.\u201d Kyle admitted. \u201cTry the CDs I my car \u2013 totally different from what\u2019s on FM radio. Country, jazz, even some old fashioned ballads and swing songs where the vocals overshadow the music. Have you ever heard of Mitch Miller or Perez Prado?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, no. but maybe you could punch hem up for me,\u201d Madison said. \u201cPersonally I can\u2019t stand rap and some of the other stuff on FM radio. I never listen to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame here,\u201d segued Kyle. \u201cI\u2019m an Englisher brought into the college environment and frankly I don\u2019t fit in that well. But you\u2019re right about square dancing \u2013 I can do ball room and rock and roll as well. Where I come rom they still have Saturday night barn dances, but who at Powers is into that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve never been to one but could probably be persuaded,\u201d answered Madison. \u201cThis is Kansas, so there might just be one. But isn\u2019t Englisher a term the Amish use?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, very astute,\u201d replied Kyle. \u201cI\u2019m from a community where the Amish and Mennonites make up about 40% of the populace. Families like mine share many of their moral values, but not their total \u2018simple life\u2019 commitment. Buggies and no hooking into the power grid?  I get the point of my Amish friends but its too extreme for me. Does that seem strange to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really,\u201d replied Madison. \u201cWe have people from all sorts of cultures in Coral Gables \u2013 li you, I respect their commitment, but could never embrace some of them. Right now I\u2019ve got a big enough struggle of my own to deal with \u2013 and my roommate\u2019s an enabler!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d observed Kyle. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe culture at Powers facilitates eating and gaining weight. I tried to help my roommate Cassi fight the trend and now I\u2019ve gained weight as well. The meal I just packed away is something I could never have done a year ago \u2013 now I enjoy and crave fattening foods. That\u2019s dangerous where I come from,\u201d Madison disclosed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSell,\u2019 said Kyle, \u201cyou\u2019re doing the right hg in going to the gym like you are. It won\u2019t of itself change your weight, but it will give you the muscle tissue to carry it and be healthy. Personally I like you just the way you sre \u2013 but that\u2019s your call, not mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you have been noticing,\u201d Madison sad. \u201cI suspected as much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNoticed an intelligent and attractive classmate? Guilty as charged your honor. I honestly didn\u2019t know it was a crime,\u201d answered Kyle. <br>\r\n\u201cNot really, I suppose,\u201d replied Madison. \u201cBut in Coral Gables it would mean you were considered an easy lay and a failure. That\u2019s why its tough for me to adjust to.  My roommate Cassie, on the other hand seems to be embracing it, like some others here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle nodded. \u201cOK I understand. Well, you know that I lie you \u2018as s\u201d \u2013 and if you\u2019ll allow me I\u2019ll take you places better than Dog-N-Shake in the future. We\u2019ll need to dress a little better fr those places. But I\u2019ll make you a promise: what you chose to order is totally for you to decide; I\u2019ll not push or criticize either way, .I\u2019m not trying to corner the market on you for dates but I\u2019d like the chance to know you better.  Deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK,\u201d replied Madison. \u201cAnd if I can find a barn dance within 50 miles I\u2019ll let you know. I think its time to get back to my car. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle already having paid the bill they walked back to his SUV, Madison quietly pulled her gym pants waistband lower to accommodate her surging belly. As they drove back to the gym Kyle played several songs from his CD player \u2013 Madison had never heard either the lyrics or the artists, but found herself responding favorably to them. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her mind was going over what had happened with her and Kyle. He had played Sir Galahad to her damsel in distress and proved himself to be both decent and a gentleman. But what disturbed her were both an observation and a comment that he had made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is good to exercise and have the muscle structure to carry your weight, he had said, implying that all the exercise in the world wasn\u2019t going to make her nearly 170 pound body shrink. She knew he might be right, but wasn\u2019t entirely ready to accept it yet. And what you eat or don\u2019t eat I\u2019ll never try to control, he had promised, knowing full well he was handing her a license to gain still more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warnings of Cassi\u2019s fat and thin sisters, Rebekah and Erin, rang in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cTurn back now \u2013 there\u2019s no going back later,\u201d Rebekah had effectively cautioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re already turning into another Cassi,\u201d Erin had effectively claimed during Madison\u2019s midnight snack raid. \u201cIf you don\u2019t stop you\u2019ll be just like Rebekah.\u201d<br>\r\nBut Madison hadn\u2019t turned back or stopped. Her size 14 wardrobe, her second change in a year, was getting tight and the scale confirmed it. Was what Kyle was implying the truth \u2013 was her body, plus perhaps a portion of her brain, making a choice to be fat? It would seem so \u2013 and Kyle obviously wasn\u2019t opposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Kyle, he was unexpectedly further into uncharted waters more quickly than he\u2019s ever anticipated. Prepared for finding rejection he\u2019d instead found acceptance. Madison even seemed to like his kind of music, and didn\u2019t laugh at his old fashioned values.  She actually seemed a bit disdainful of the pettiness and superficiality of Coral Gables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was back in his own dorm pondering all this on couch in the lounge. Ralph Wagoner, whose girlfriend Beth Adams had spoken with Kelli, walked in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dCogitating the state of the universe as usual?\u201d Ralph greeted Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore than the universe, Ralph. I had supper tonight with a wonderful girl who actually has a brain and doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m a freak from another world,\u201d declared Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa man \u2013 that\u2019s great,\u201d answered Ralph. \u201cI was beginning to wonder if you were secretly gay or something \u2013 this is a first for you!  How did it happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe locked her keys in her car and I summoned a locksmith. While we were waiting we got to talking and things went from there.  She\u2019s got some issues like everyone, but I think I can handle them,\u201d stated Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what issues?\u201d queried Ralph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s gained some weight and is going to be needing a wardrobe change because inside she\u2019s not ready to commit to eating bird food forever is my take. Typical Power\u2019s girl stuff, like we\u2019ve shared before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ralph. \u201cBeth is now up thirty pounds but s getting used to it. Her friend Kelli keeps pointing out that Madison and Cassi, especially Cassi, are way had of her. She fusses but I notice that she and her roomies always have snacks at the ready and never turn down a dinner date. Treat your girl like a queen and she\u2019ll adjust. Do I know her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just mentioned her, Madison, Madison Kraft.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, way to go man. I understand she comes from Florida money. She\u2019s worth everything you put out for her,\u201d Ralph responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know about that nor is it important,\u201d shot back Kyle, \u201cI liked her before I even knew her name \u2013 it\u2019s just an attraction. I do know she\u2019s a little leery of hitting her dad up for another wardrobe change, but it\u2019s nice to know they can afford it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess. But just get to know her and in a few weeks you may be able to give her a surprise. I\u2019ve heard tell of a Powers\u2019 BBW support group that sometimes gives grants for wardrobe upgrades for deserving Power\u2019s coeds,\u201d Ralph said mysteriously. \u201cYou just treat Miss Madison right and I\u2019ll check it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time Cassi had arrived home and Madison was telling her about what had happened with Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about all this,\u201d she concluded. \u201cI started out to help you lose weight but wound up gaining myself.  Now I\u2019m fat, getting fatter, and despite both your sisters\u2019 warnings I\u2019m not really that interested in going back- if that\u2019s even possible. Now with Kyle I\u2019m tempted to say \u201cscrew it\u201d and accept his advice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike he says, it\u2019s your decision,\u201d answered Cassie, \u201cBut I\u2019m glad you have him because now I can stop holding out on you.  I\u2019ve had a Kyle in my life as well, was actually with him late this afternoon, which is why I don\u2019t care about my sisters opinions. Mark and I are keeping in touch and we\u2019ll see where it goes. For the time being we both need to get our degrees.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d responded Madison. \u201cI wonder what Erin will say to that \u2013 I told her that when she gets to college her body could change as well. She didn\u2019t take that very seriously, I know, but it\u2019s the truth. Why Mark and you instead of Rebekah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst of all, she\u2019s older than him by five years, so they never knew each other in school. Marks only a year older than me and we do know each other,\u201d explained Cassie. \u201cSecondly, Rebekah as you know hasn\u2019t fully accepted herself at her current size. No guy, even one who prefers fatter women, wants to put up with fat girl complaints and whining. It\u2019s not an issue because Rebekah doesn\u2019t care about Mark anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo she knows?\u201d Madison asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s suspected but I\u2019ve not given her a firm answer; as for Erin we\u2019ll see.\u201d replied Cassie. \u201cBut now you know why I\u2019m not seriously dieting. I\u2019m happy for you and Kyle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d murmured Madison, has her hand subconsciously massaged her belly. . \u201cSo am I\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the next few weeks, Madison and Kyle continued to meet up. With Kyle's influence, Madison was gradually swapping out leafy salads for burgers and pizza.  Often times, Madison went to lunch intending to go back to a less filling diet, only to find an item in the dinning hall that she simply could not pass up, always one day away from starting a diet that Rebecca and Erin would have pushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, there was something else that Madison could not put her finger on that was causing her to indulge. She could not fully articulate it, even in her own thoughts, but every time she came back with a slice of pizza, as opposed to a garden salad, she felt a bit...mischievous, like she was skirting rules. The idea that her size 14s were a bit tighter, and she was contributing to it when she knew her Mom or friends back home would not approve made her feel a bit sneaky. These feelings were fleeting, and in constant juggle with her pings of remorse after a large meal, but were present enough that it was causing her to eat more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite these dietary changes, Madison was still working out at the gym, which was becoming harder both physically and psychologically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhysically, Madison felt like she was becoming more out of shape. Her attempts at the treadmill were now largely being scaled back to time spent on an elliptical or exercise bike. The treadmill had simply tired her out too much, at least with the other two workout machines, she could move at her own pace, which Kyle noticed was slowing down a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPsychologically, the gym was becoming less fun for her. Back when she was a 130 pound, fit college girl on the path to joining a hot sorority, the gym felt like a place for her to cool off and let extra energy go. Now, the gym was having the opposite effect. She often wondered if people were judging her and her ill fitting clothes as she stumbled through workouts. She already knew that she needed a new sports bra, as her current one became woefully ill-fitting. She was thankful for elasticity, but also knew her shorts were getting tight as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one thing that was keeping Madison full of confidence was Kyle. Seeing him brightened her day, regardless of what had happened up to that point, be it an awkward encounter on the quad or challenging exam coming up, he always was upbeat and supportive of her. His previous declaration on her weight was a load off her back (which may have gone to her thighs), but it was one less thing to worry about, and she appreciated that. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At Ralph\u2019s suggestion he and Kyle had taken Madison and Beth dining twice over the past month. The first time was to the Mediterranean Grill a Wichita institution known both for its variety of cuisines from the mid-east and their uniquely American buttermilk biscuits. Kyle noted that the somewhat dated d\u00e9cor hearkened back to the day when cafes were truly run by family owners, not hooked into a chain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison raved over the lamb kebab with fatoush salad; Beth declared that the Pene Alfredo could have fed both her and Ralph but managed to eat everything on her plate. The tiramisu for dessert was enjoyed by all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo weeks later it was he Public restaurant ion Wichita\u2019s old town. Around for over 100 years (founded in 1910) the courtyard featured live music \u2013 folk rock with the PBJ band. Madison apologized to Kyle over the style, only to be reassured that while maybe not his favorite is was quite enjoyable. The fact was that he was happy Madison was demolishing an espresso &amp;\u200f porcini mushroom seasoned bison cheeseburger burger while he had a pair of brisket tacos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure know how to pick unique restaurants,\u201d he noted to Ralph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just read he reviews on Yelp, then ask around to verify them,\u201d replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle smiled, at the same time being unable not to notice how tight Madison\u2019s dinner skirt appeared to be. He and Ralph had been discussing a surprise and he suspected Madison might be ready for it. But this evening wasn\u2019t quite the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to her apartment full and floating on air, feeling that she was being treated like royalty, Madison indeed did have a wardrobe concern.  She suspected that, despite all her efforts at the gym, the momentum of her previous eating habits might not have run nuts course. She might have gained a few more pounds. As she looked at herself in the mirror she couldn't help but wonder. With some trepidation she got onto the scale, which at 172 confirmed that she\u2019d gained four more pounds in just six weeks,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis news caused her to virtually fast on Sunday and eat a small breakfast and lunch on Monday \u2013 leaving her totally without energy for her workout,  This was painfully obvious to Kyle as she half-heartedly worked the exercise cycle for about shelf her usual time.  When she was finished he came over and said kindly, \u201cMaddie, I think we need to talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot another burger and shake \u2013 I\u2019ve got to diet and lose weight,\u201c she declared, speaking with more frustration than conviction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK \u2013 no food at all if you insist \u2013 but seriously, what have you had today so far?\u201d he inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably too little, It\u2019s why I\u2019ve no energy here today. But Saturday I was stretching that outfit to its limit despite skipping lunch and having a lite breakfast. Then I found out I\u2019m still gaining. You and Ralph surely don\u2019t want me going out in gym clothes, do you?\u201d she declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle smiled. \u201cNo, not that. But the other extreme isn\u2019t the answer either. What about a fruit and cottage cheese salad to help tide you over, he offered. \u201cI do have something we need to discuss when you\u2019re not feeling starved.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison hesitated, but wondered what Kyle was talking out and agreed. Soon they were at the Piccadilly Grill where Kyle cautioned, \u201cnow I know there\u2019s a lot of other items on the menu but I\u2019m not here to dissuade you \u2013 let me just order he fruit and cottage cheese with some tea. OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK,\u201d agreed Madison, who shortly thereafter found herself regretting her commitment. The menu had items like Veal Cannelloni, Eggplant Parmesan. And Bierock meat pie made with chopped steak, cabbage and cheese.. But Kyle placed two orders as he had promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI maybe could be cajoled into changing my mind,\u201d she suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, then kick yourself later and blame me for tempting you. I\u2019ve got to take a hard line, sorry,\u201d replied Kyle. \u201cBut I will bring you here again when we haven\u2019t made a compact. It does look good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, sighed Madison. \u201cAnd I guess I have to wat till the food arrives before you tell me what\u2019s on your mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but it was a simple order and it\u2019s on the chef\u2019s counter waiting right now,\u201d answered Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was pleasantly surprised that the cottage cheese and fruit was actually two separate menu items with reasonable size, almost like a double appetizer It would at least, she thought, be filling until supper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she\u2019d finished about a third of her combo Kyle began talking. \u201cMaddie, being in shape should be fun \u2013 as in riding a bike in the country or hiking in a state park. Exercise on a treadmill alone is boring and ineffective. But to do the other requires certain types of clothes and accessories, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, you mean like a bicycle\u201d she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and clothes designed for outdoor wear. The bike is a barely used ten-speed that\u2019s available for $40. But I can\u2019t go out and just make a wardrobe appear. For this I need your cooperation \u2013and it won\u2019t cost you a dime. I know you don\u2019t want to utilize your dad\u2019s \u201cemergency\u201d card again, but you really do need some things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dNot just for weekend outdoors, but across the board.\u201d Madison acknowledged. \u201cBut what are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLetting you be a walking display ad of great looking clothes from a store in exchange for endorsing them; it\u2019s a promotion for which eligible persons can be given a one-time allowance of $1000 \u2013 but you will have to write a letter and then share it with pictures on their website and social media.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat type of stuff is for size four models, not size 14 going on 16,\u201d responded Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it were available would you do it?\u201d Kyle responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm, well, maybe. Are you serious?\u201d asked Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery much so \u2013 every year a few Powers girls are given this opportunity and you can be one of them.  How that happened I\u2019m not supposed to tell, but I\u2019m sure you have gotten your clothes you can do a little sleuthing and figure it out. What you can\u2019t do is talk to anyone prematurely or others might try to apply \u2013 and there are only so many slots. Those given this offer have to be nominated, checked out and approved by others first.  Its invitation only.\u201d\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I\u2019ve already been nominated, checked out and approved?\u201d Madison sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I just get to be the lucky messenger because I know you, Kyle confided. Incidentally the $1000 isn\u2019t full retail \u2013 those who do this get to use it at store cost + 10% markup, so were talking several outfits,\u201d. I\u2019d like you to have a gown and some dinner dresses pus more casual school and weekend wear. But its your call. My job is to make the offer and, if you accept, arrange for you to meet with the store\u2019s consultant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is really unexpected, \u201cMadison stammered. \u201cDo I have to answer this minute?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not. I was told on Friday I had ten days to get your reply and this in only day four. Why don\u2019t I take you home since we\u2019ve finished our little repast \u2013 then if you say \u201cyes\u201d we can come back here Saturday night to celebrate?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d answered Madison, \u201cthat might be a good idea \u2013 I\u2019ll try to get back to you as soon as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Kyle and Madison took his SUV back to the gym so that she could get her own car. When she got home she was happy to see that Cassi was cooking supper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cScrew the diet for tonight,</i>\u201d she declared to herself.<i> \u201cI need a full belly to think straight.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that evening, with three pieces of chicken, plus healthy servings of potatoes and asparagus plus two helpings of Boston cr\u00e8me pie giving her focus, Madison sat in her chair, her hand caressing her midriff while observing her belly resting on her thighs. She felt under her jaw and realized she was now getting a slight double chin. Her arms also showed more fullness than she had had in high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cWho am I kidding? This body\u2019s not disappearing anytime soon. It needs a wardrobe that fits</i>,\u201d she admitted to herself. She took her cell phone and tweeted Kyle <i>\u201cOK to set up the consultation \u2013 hope it works out.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Immediately upon getting Madison\u2019s message Kyle smiled. He would have to wait until Monday to make a phone call, but Ralph and his contacts had already briefed him on what to do to schedule her interview. . As a result Wednesday afternoon found him ameliorating Madison\u2019s stress at Dairy Queen with a pair of mushroom Swiss grill burgers and accompanying   strawberry cheesecake blizzards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow as I understand it this is all about your choosing a wardrobe with a consultant after you\u2019ve been briefed on the contract. You pick the clothes and can back out anytime you want to just by paying for the clothes. But every year a few Powers co-eds get to do this and I\u2019m told no one ever has,\u201d he said reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I know,\u201d replied Madison. \u201cI\u2019ve visited the Torrid website and have seen their \u2018insider\u2019 models and \u2018fan crushes of the week\u2019 \u2013 some of them are huge yet the clothes I have to admit are great. But I\u2019m on the low end of their range. And none of the ones I saw were from Powers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d noted Kyle, \u201dI looked as well \u2013 they don\u2019t say where they come from or how long they\u2019re up. There are more on Facebook as well. It\u2019s not exploitation so much as making a statement about the universality of beauty in every size \u2013 including the fourteeners like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\u201cFor now \u2013 enroute to 16 or 18, if I can keep it to that without becoming a whale</i>,\u201d thought Madison, who knew how tight her clothes were feeling. Towards Kyle she simply said \u201cI guess. Well, OK, it\u2019s time to go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the store they were cordially ushered into an office where Asst. Store manager Roger Weatherly reviewed the arrangement and gave Madison an agreement to sign. She noted that it allowed her to back out at any time until she took delivery of the clothes without penalty \u2013 after that she would be obligated to pay for them if she reneged and withdrew her authorization or didn\u2019t supply the endorsement letter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath and signed, after which Mr. Weatherly introduced her to fashion consultant Delores Walker. Delores was a friendly black lady, attractively attired and probably weighing over 250.  She replaced Mr. Weatherly at the desk and told Kyle he\u2019d be called for in around two hours.  Kyle nodded and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne thing we need to do is get you comfortable in your clothes.  Take your bra for instance. Ever find yourself having to adjust things after you reach up or bend over?\u2019 inquired Delores<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, uh yeah. My twins have grown some this year and that is sort of comes with the territory,\u201d replied Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t have to,\u201d replied Delores. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing a bra with what\u2019s called a camisole back \u2013 it allows for more fasteners but is more prone to slippage. There are leotard style bras with kicked in back straps that minimize this sort of thsat.\u201d Delores informed her. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a set, then let you pick up a pencil from the floor and put it on a ledge over the door-sill; you tell me how it works.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, OK,\u201d replied Madison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother factor is strap width. 2.5 centimeters is standard, but hose with more to carry should be around 4.5 cm with embedded gel pads. If you have that kind of support and develop your back and shoulder muscles you shouldn\u2019t be experiencing pain or discomfort. And you can now have clear transparent straps that create the illusion of going strapless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext, \u201ccontinued Delores, \u201cwe\u2019re going to match clothes to your body shape. In our world you\u2019re not actually pus size enough to be classed as either an apple or pear \u2013with your height, I\u2019d be surprised if you\u2019re even classed as officially overweight. Still, you\u2019re definitely not a pear so I\u2019m going to build an apple style wardrobe for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErrr \u2013 and what does that mean?\u201d asked Madison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor school wear, two piece outfits with bright skirts and capris but conservative tops. Also, full length custom fitted colorful formal wear, plus recreational wear designed for comfort rather than impress. We want four of the first, 2-3 of the second and third. And of course there are shows and accessories to think about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMentally Madison was adding numbers. All this at Torrid for $1000? She was definitely getting her money\u2019s worth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, enough of this,\u201d prompted Delores. \u201cI\u2019ve asked my picker Irene to make some selections which match your size \u2013 let\u2019s go to the dressing room and see what you think\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Delores arose and Madison, who was wondering how Delores and Irene could know her size without taking measurements, compliantly followed. For the next 75 minutes she tried on an array of outfits. Each fit fairly well, although two skirts were a bit snug and had to be ratcheted up a notch. Delores faithfully capturing photos of each one.  Finally she tossed a pencil in front of Madison and asked her to pick it up. She did and instinctively reached to adjust her bra straps, being surprised that after over an hour she didn\u2019t need to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, put it on the ledge over the entrance to the dressing room\u201d Delores command. Again no strap adjustments were necessary and Madison realized that her shoulders weren\u2019t fatigued after standing for a prolonged period either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, bra fitting chalked up. Now which outfits do you want in each category?\u201d inquired Delores.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, there are least two in each class that are definite keepers, but beyond that I\u2019m not really sure,\u201d she replied. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you choose?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot allowed \u2013 you could have rejected everything if you\u2019d wished. Right now you stand at $540 \u2013 after we go to shoes and accessories you can wait up to 30 days to use up any remainder. Should be around $300.\u201d Delores paused. \u201cI\u2019ll tell Irene to have these wrapped up while you get back into your original clothes. You can text Kyle to get back here in 45 minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter emerging from the dressing room Madison turned to Delores. \u201cWhile were waiting on Irene and Kyle cam I ask a question \u2013 why is Torrid doing this for me? I\u2019m not a celebrity with a following. How are they going to make their money back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelores smiled. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to worry about that; apparently no one has told you that all this is paid for by a grant- it\u2019s from an outside group that picks the awardees and gets to pay wholesale. Torrid gets whatever advertising mileage they can; the group uses the Torrid ads   in their BBW support efforts to prove that we big girls can be beautiful. And while I\u2019m a wardrobe consultant not a sales person Irene and your boyfriend aren\u2019t forgotten either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyle gets paid for bringing me here?\u201d Madison said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot in money, but yes. Usually a 2:1 dinner certificate at some place like he cheesecake factory. But he has had to jump thru some hoops along the way \u2013so you should give him credit for doing it,\u201d the consultant confided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so,\u201d murmured Madison. \u201cBut he and I are going to have to have a talk.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You know this isn\u2019t going to just stay I Kansas,\u201d noted Madison. \u201cBut I feel just daring enough to assert my independence by this bit of mischief.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne picture, with no name or location, isn\u2019t likely to become big news in Coral Gables either,\u201d replied Kyle. \u201cSometimes I\u2019m told even those at Powers don\u2019t notice immediately because the shots from Wichita are mired in with those from everywhere. But I\u2019ll be looking, I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you will \u2013 but you apparently know a lot about this. Do you know anther grantee or something?\u201d Madison enquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s no secret. You know her too \u2013 your friend Beth. UMILA gave her a grant six months ago - I\u2019ve not noticed her on the website yet, though,\u201d Kyle responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUMILA,\u201d responded Madison. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA networking organization of college BBW supporting alumni, especially from Powers but I understand from elsewhere too,\u201d answered Kyle. \u201cIt stands for Upward Mobility Initiative for Larger Alumni and the local chapter is a businesswoman named Gwen Porter. I guess they\u2019re tight with Torrid. At least that\u2019s what Ralph tells me. He\u2019s the one who helped get this started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what did you have to do?\u201d asked Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBasically certify that you were of good character, not into addictive habits or drugs that could reflect unfavorably, and not obsessed over having gained a few pounds. I certainly hope I\u2019m right about my call on that one,\u201d he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, as she knew was becoming a habit Madison\u2019s defenses meted. Although it went against her attitudes in high school she had to admit Kyle was right \u2013 although she\u2019d gained nearly fifty pounds she really had no motivation or desire to lose them. What had started out merely as a support effort for Cassi had changed her life.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd assuming you\u2019re correct it makes you happy because, like it seems many men on the Powers campus you like larger girls.  Why?\u201d asked Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve asked myself that and have no answer. The preference has been with me since grade school. I\u2019ve seen the energy of the many heavier women in the Amish community so I know being both fat and healthy is completely possible as long as you\u2019re active. They do it by working from dawn to dusk \u2013 not from forcing themselves to a gym. For city folk I think it means physical activities like cycling \u2013 don\u2019t forget that used bicycle I told you about,\u201d commented Kyle<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison had forgotten the bicycle, but mention of it returned to her memory as Kyle brought it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what Delores was referencing,\u201d Madison exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Kyle responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe said I\u2019d likely be needing a unique pair of shorts that\u2019s with the stuff in the back. She said it had something she called flat-lock stitched seams and multi-stretch padding \u2013 in other words, something someone on a bicycle seat for a long time would probably appreciate,\u201d answered Madison, who was wondering just how far Kyle would expect to ride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sounds like she did her job.\u201d Grinned Kyle. \u201cSo I guess we need to plan a cycling outing \u2013 assuming you like the bicycle, which we haven\u2019t looked at yet\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe? You\u2019re not going to just go get it and stick it in my dorm?\u201d said Madison. \u201cSounds like you\u2019re talking joint decision making.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d answered Kyle. \u201cI like you \u2013 but in a way that\u2019s part of what makes me different from a lot of guys.  I\u2019m looking for a partner, not someone to be my property. I think it would be good both of us to have recreational exercise and I hope you\u2019ll like the bike \u2013 but its not for me to just decide. I want to hear your voice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm \u2013 OK, I can understand that. When do I or rather we, get to go look at this bike?\u201d asked Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile you\u2019re putting the clothes away I can try making a phone call,\u201c offered Kyle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds fine by me, partner,\u201d smiled Madison, who noted that she was starting to feel hungry. Luckily for her Cassie was already preparing tacos and invited Kyle to stay after they\u2019d unloaded the clothes. Since Cassi was in the kitchen she didn\u2019t really; pick up on many there were. She, of course, so far as Kyle and Madison knew, wasn\u2019t aware of the source.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Following dinner, Kyle stepped out of the dorm for a few minutes, when he came back in, he looked pleased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good news! We can go look at the bike this weekend,\" Kyle announced to Madison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Madison replied. Even though she didn't really know what to expect; she had not really biked in Miami after getting her license, she was still excited for the possibility of more adventures with Kyle and the chance for them to have some dates off campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the week, Madison stayed away from the gym. Although she figured that her and Kyle could burn off some calories biking over the weekend, that was not the only reason she was laying off. The photos that were going up on Torrid served as a subtle release for her. Even though she rationalized that there were slim chances anyone she knew would see them, the knowledge that those photos were soon to be out there made her ease up. The idea that she didn't have to hide her body and gain was reducing some of the anxiety that she had surrounding her gain. Sure, this often receded into brief moments of panic that someone she knew would see them--most of all her high school friends, but this week, she was doing fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Saturday morning rolled around, Madison and Kyle jumped into his SUV to take the 10 minute drive away from downtown to check out the bike. Like Kyle had mentioned, it was a fairly standard, but well maintained used 10 speed, owned by a couple whose daughter had left for school on the east coast, \"Didn't make a whole lot of sense to ship it out there with her,\" the father explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, $40 seems more than fair to me,\" Kyle said, handing him two crisp $20s. With that they took the bike back to his SUV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got back to campus, Madison quickly ran up to change into more athletic clothes, while Kyle went and got his bike, and then proceeded put both his and Madison's on the tailgate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Madison came out, Kyle asked, \"Ready for a fun afternoon?\", to which Madison smiled and jumped in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle drove for about 30 minutes out of town, where the stopped near a park. \"This is one of my favorite paths,\" he stated, \"it takes us around the countryside and some nice streams. It isn't exactly leisurely, but we can take it at whatever pace we want. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they got the bikes off the SUV, Madison and him started riding and talking, Madison felt herself getting rather winded. <i>I wonder if I would have been able to smoke Kyle on this path a few months ago</i> she wondered to herself. Besides the fatigue, Madison was having a fun time. She enjoyed the unstructured ride time, and the chance to learn more about Kyle and his upbringing. She found his more traditional family upbringing and lifestyle interesting as compared to her more contemporary one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the clothes that she was using from Torrid were performing as expected. Nothing would have made the ride more unbearable than her previous wardrobe, which would have left her love handles exposed, her butt uncomfortable, and her things constricted. As they rode, she was thankful that these were working out, and hoped that these trips meant the size 14s were all that she needed for a while. </span></div></div>",

Madison especially was tired and Kyle looped back to the SUV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOK \u2013 early afternoon, and I didn\u2019t have any breakfast. Are you up for Mediterranean cuisine,\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison, waking late, had only grabbed a muffin and banana, and was feeling famished. Anything sounded good at this point and she readily accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, its quick 10 minutes to Caf\u00e9 Maurice \u2013 some call it the best Mediterranean food in Kansas,\u201d remarked Kyle. \u201cBeen around since 1955 \u2013 the same family does French pastries for hotels all over Kansas through their wholesale bakery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was startled. \u201cWhat do you do? Research these places on the Internet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, including the reviews. I just share the better ones,\u201d answered Kyle as he pulled into the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce seated Kyle opted for Hummus Beef Shawarma while Madison ordered a Kafta Kabob Platter. Kyle mentioned to Madison that there would be complimentary tiramisu for dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that Italian,\u201d she sked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Kyle. \u201cThe family mixes up the menu a bit \u2013 for instance, what is a Mexican dish like pasta Diablo doing there? It\u2019s their place, they get to play by their rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison nodded, then changed the subject \u201cBeth and I had a talk about UMILA, i thought you should know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK by me. All I know is that they advocate for certain Powers alumni.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, apparently the fat ones,\u201d answered Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd this is bad, or good, because?\u201d asked Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet \u2013 but in addition to fashion awards they apparently fund tuition for a number in the student body. I\u2019m wondering now what brought me here, because my parents got some special deal as well,\u201d Madison noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d ask them,\u201d suggested Kyle. \u201cIt\u2019s not in my research data base to know what they fund and why. What I do know is that I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here and this food is great,\u201d parried Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDelores at Torrid says they\u2019ll be giving you a reward for talking me into being their poster girl,\u201d probed Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPossibly true \u2013 likely a gift certificate to a restaurant I\u2019m told, but I haven\u2019t been given it yet\u201d confessed Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just hoping I don\u2019t outgrow this new stuff too quickly \u2013 I\u2019m not as sanguine as Beth about getting fatter.  She seems to think it\u2019s her family legacy and is adapting. Mine may hit the roof.\u201d Worried Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you need to share with them what you\u2019ve experienced and ow you feel about it \u2013 like a preemptive strike,\u201d answered Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Cassie and Beth suggest as well,\u201d concurred Madison, \u201cBut I\u2019m just not confident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvery parent has to let loose and accept changes in their kids \u2013 certainly ginning weight as an issue  is better than dropping out of college because you get pregnant or busted for drugs or deciding to become a camp follower of some rock star. You\u2019ve got great grades, a supportive boyfriend who\u2019s helping you stay in good shape and a whole career ahead of you. Why not thank them for making that possible, hen throw in a \u201cthings that can be surprising\u201d bulletin,\u201d Advised Kyle. \u201cI think they\u2019ll adjust \u2013 the alternatives are to try dieting or letting them find out by accident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was silent for a moment. She knew she had no will to diet, and the folly of an accidental discovery she understood. Then nodded her heed. \u201cI know you\u2019re right \u2013 just not confident. Its scary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle and Madison drove back to campus and unloaded the bikes. Then Madison went off to prepare an email.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Dear Mom and Dad:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI now have a bike \u2013 courtesy of a guy here on campus I guess you ab call my by friend. I think you\u2019d find him quite acceptable \u2013 he was raised as an Englischer adjacent to an Amish community and has old style values that you\u2019d expect from that culture. I find the refreshing and more filled with purpose and wisdom that what guys in Coral Gables usually have to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe had a great ride today, although rather tiring, followed by a great dinner.  He also gave me some great advice \u2013 I need to preemptively share with you some things myself before you find out by surprise and feel I\u2019ve held out on you. That s not the way one honors their parents. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst of all, I\u2019m not pregnant, flunking out, in trouble with the law, addicted  or broke \u2013 which are probably the five worst things thsat could happen. But there has been a big change in my life that I\u2019ve come to accept and need your acceptance of.  Powers is a school where a large portion of the student body is frankly overweight, and it is due to a culture here that I\u2019ve been drawn into further and faster than I\u2019d initially wanted or anticipated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially it was an accident \u2013 exercising less to help a roommate with her problems. Then it was peer group friendship and just a few pounds. Then it was visiting a family where size didn\u2019t matter and more pounds. Then frustrated but half-hearted attempts to reverse what was happening. Finally I had to ask myself \u2013 am I wrong for not being more upset? Thanks to Kyle and others I\u2019m now content and no longer agonizing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that I\u2019m in sync with the culture here it feels right, so I thank you for sending me here. I hope you can accept a fat, non-dieting daughter as easily as Kyle does a fat girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, now I\u2019ve said it. I hope you\u2019re able to accept this change in your no longer \u201clittle\u201d girl. I know I will be criticized and judged by society for not caving in to the common fatophobia, and also what I need to do to handle the health risks, but I need to decide for myself what the priorities are in life for myself. Existing on turnip greens and rye crisp isn\u2019t on the list \u2013 not now, possibly never.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you for your understanding  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, she pasted the letter into an email and clicked on \u201csend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n. \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a rather uneventful evening, so he was expecting to just read some articles and go to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got back to the house, his wife, Cecelia, was in the kitchen, reading an email that had just been received by her phone. \"Hey, Chris, did you see what Madison just sent us?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, driving,\" He responded. \"What did she say? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should probably just read it for yourself,\" she said, about to slide the phone over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris held up his tablet with a chuckle and went into his email app. He started reading, and figured it was a pleasant status update from the midwest, however, his raised and eye brow, <i>This tone is getting awfully serious...</i>. When he got to the portion of the email where she described her weight, Chris was a bit surprised. He figured his daughters would stay trim, like his wife, who at 50 was still in great shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's unexpected,\" he said upon finishing the email. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" Cecelia asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I feel bad she thinks this is such a huge deal. Lot of kids gain weight in college, so long as it doesn't get to a place where it affects her health, I don't really see any reason to be concerned about it.\" Chris was one to pick his battles, and this was something that he treated with relative indifference. He loved his daughters, so the last thing he would ever do is crush their confidence by nagging one of them about their weight. Although he shared his wife's fitness oriented lifestyle, he wasn't one to look down on others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's where I'm at as well,\" Ceclia responded. \"I just hope that other girls don't give her a had time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all about her disposition, and she's 18 now, she'll have to learn to roll with the punches regardless of her weight.\" He responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison's Mom typed up a nice response back to Madison, she laid out that basically said, \"Well, we wanted you to experience a different viewpoint. Guess it worked out more than we anticipated - but you're now emancipated and we wish you well.\" If all things were equal, Cecelia would have prefered her daughter not to gain weight, but she wasn't giving it much thought, better to let Madison live her life. Still, she was curious how much weight her formerly trim daughter had put on, and where her weight would crest. <i>Maybe we could come up and visit her sometime</i> Cecelia thought to herself. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison was pleasantly surprised by her mm\u2019s response \u2013 saying it was her life to live and not even inquiring how much weight was involved. Madison recognized that Cecelia\u2019s seeming nonchalance was likely due to her Dad, who had always had a less judgmental attitude than her mom in such areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought a little more about her own presence at Powers \u2013 which she knew was in some manner due to a gift she suspected had come through her aunt, her dad\u2019s sister. Aunt Rachel was a successful married career woman with three kids \u2013 but was also comfortably over 200 pounds. As far as Madison knew Rachel had never been to Powers, but could she be involved with UMILA and their grant program?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison wrestled with calling her Dad and asking directly, but decided that wouldn\u2019t be wise. She had Kyle, as well as Cassie Beth, Ralph and other new friends. Trying to dig too deeply might just upset things \u2013 especially if her Dad knew what might happen at Powers but her mm didn\u2019t.  She decided to keep her suspicions to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the week Madison\u2019s relaxed ting habits continued but she did make an effort to workout. As a result she had greater energy, felt better and wasn\u2019t focused on her weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle kept his word about returning to the Piccadilly Grill, the place where she\u2019d nearly fallen off the wagon and ordered and entr\u00e9e but Kyle had helped her keep her promise to hold back. This evening there were no pre-agreed restrictions and Madison wore one of her new dinner outfits. It was size 4 and not at all tight. <br>\r\nMadison didn\u2019t hesitate to share a sampler platter comprised of hummus, tabouli, stuffed grape leaves, and fried kibbi, pus an entr\u00e9e   of slow-roasted Portuguese Pot Roast with Ancho peppers and Port wine.  It came with sides of carrots, potatoes and green beans. Kyle had Piccadilly Meatloaf served with baked <br>\r\npotato and steamed vegetables,    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was happy to hear that Madison had told her parents about him and her changes and that there was no blowup. He also concurred in her decision not to push matters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeth\u2019s mom is in UMILA,\u201d he noted. \u201cShe can probably find out if they\u2019re involved if you really want to know. What I\u2019d like to talk about is Hillsdale Lake and the Walleye Egg Harvest\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe what?\u201d exclaimed Madison. \u201cAnd where?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHillsdale lake - man made super pond to the east near Paola,\u201c answered Kyle. \u201cThey have an egg harvest each spring \u2013 people from the general public catch female fish, take their eggs, turn hem over to officials who introduce male sperm so as to increase the fertilization rate, then release them into the water to become baby fish. It\u2019s a seasonal thing and guess what \u2013 it happens next week. And yes, we can use the bikes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cWow,\u201d</i> thought Madison, \u201c<i>talk about unique date thinking.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAloud she replied, \u201cso, that\u2019s pretty far. How early should we start?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a three hour drive \u2013 so probably 6:00.,\u201d Kyle observed. \u201cThere\u2019s a buffet breakfast in Paola at a place called Molly\u2019s Table and afterwards we can go to a place called Beethoven #9 \u2013 I\u2019m told it has lasagna and beef stroganoff to rival the Amish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn east Kansas near a man-made lake where they harvest fish eggs?\u201d answered Madison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds adventuresome. Why not invite Ralph and Beth? Do they have bikes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d replied Kyle,\u201d but we could ask.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs turned out Beth was able to borrow a bike and Ralph had his own but only two could fit in Kyles SUV so Ralph and Beth had to use a second car.

A few had noticed her gain, but must hadn't, focusing on her academic work that showed she was breezying through entry-level courses and ready for more advanced work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there was one sorority girl that Madison knew she had to impress...or rather, one ex-sorority girl, her Mom. Something that she assumed she would not have to deal with in person until the holidays, or summer break, but unexpectedly sprung on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecelia had been checking back in at her frequent flier account for for most of the afternoon. It started as just a cursory glance, then she had started pricing out flights to get to Powers. Now, she was waiting for Chris to come home to tell him her great idea. They could visit Madison at college! She knew her husband was sitting on hundreds of thousands of miles from his business travels, going to other offices in the firms, why not use some of those to go see their daughter? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Chris got home, Cecelia directly brought up her idea, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chris, I miss Madison, let's go visit her next week.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" He replied, with a slightly surprised look on his face. This came out of left field. He had tickets to go see the U play next week, but it's not like those were hard to get...so her couldn't really see a reason why not. \"I suppose we could....\" he continued, \"Two short term plan tickets are going to be pricey\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can afford it, Chris,\" Cecelia responded quickly, \"plus, we can just use your miles, for both of us it will cost 50,000 miles, tops.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I'll just put it on my card, I want to get to the next medallion status this year. What about Alexa?\" Chris asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's 17, we'll leave her some cash for food while we're gone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris couldn't believe this level of willingness in his wife. She was usually the one who was critical of parents who left town for the weekend, which was basically begging their high schoolers to throw parties...which he was almost certain that Alexa would do while they were gone. <i>Better lock the liquor cabinet if this trip actually happens</i> he thought. This all struck him as odd, why did she want to go up there so badly? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, you do know how cold it is up there this time of year, right?\" He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Chris, it's November, and it's not Canada!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis struck him as even odder. One year before they had Madison, Chris had taken his wife to New York for New Years eve. They had a great time, but the whole trip, whenever they had gone outside, Cecelia would complain about the cold, and constantly ask how anyone could live in that climate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSearching, Chris asked, \"Are you going to make sure Madison's boyfriend is up to your standards?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooooo,\" she said to Chris' grin. \"Well...maybe a little bit,\" she responded, with a little chuckle. Cecelia continued on in response to a eye brow raise from Chris, \"Well we don't know anything about this guy, other than that he had a traditional upbringing, and he doesn't mind if she's as big as a house.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris did a full eye roll at that one, and jumped in, \"It's her life, we didn't raise her to be stupid about these things. I highly doubt she would change herself for a guy, and even she did, what would visiting her do to change it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, but I just want to meet him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResigned to the outcome, Chris obliged, \"Fine. I'll book two tickets. But don't think I'll give you my seat when I get bumped up to first class.\" Chris was going to get his small victories where he could that weekend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison, unaware of her parents' deliberations, was caught off-guard by the phone call she received from her Mom the following evening. After a bit of chit-chat, her Mom pounced with the same decisiveness she had used with her husband, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison, your Dad and I would like to come visit you next weekend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you surprised? We thought it would be nice! We could take you out to dinner, and you could introduce us to Kyle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison had realized that this was the echo from her email. Her Mom may have been nice enough in the response, but she wanted to check out her daughter and her boyfriend, to make sure all was actually well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I guess, Mom. I was just going to study that weekend,\" she replied, knowing that Kyle's date plans were shot at that point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison took a deep breath. Her grades were great, her relationship with Kyle was fine, and she was happy both with her body and health \u2013 the combination of cycling plus 2-3 gym workouts a week and a wardrobe that fit finally made her unconcerned about her weight, which was just over 180. But the message about her parent\u2019s visit made her suspected that her mom was less sanguine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had continued to wonder about her presence Powers. It had a fine reputation as a .liberal arts college, but the make-up of the student body seemed to reflect an agenda. Knowing that Beth was on an UMILA grant Madison had asked her to inquire whether she was secretly as well. It turned out this was not the case. She and Kyle even met with UMILA\u2019s local coordinator, Gwendolyn Porter. She was an administrator with the Wichita Social Services department, approximately 260 pounds at 5\u201910 or so, and impeccable dressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cObviously a Torrid customer,\u201d</i> thought Madison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did check out your Aunt,\u201d she had said, \u201cShe is part of some size acceptance groups we work with and has served as a UMILA scout, but you were never one of her candidates. I even went so far as to call her and confirm that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison had been visibly startled. \u201cYou what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI checked it out. UMILA is essentially a networking post-graduate group for the size acceptance community. Beth and people like her we help after they\u2019ve already shown themselves likely to be receptive to our approach in key areas,\u201d Mrs. Porter explained. \u201cBut you were not at any time part of that matrix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike being from a larger family and not minding it\u201d concluded Madison. \u201cThat is how Beth thinks of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly. We don\u2019t try to identify and lure people to Powers in some clandestine manner.  Part of the endowment here comes from those favorable to our community but it\u2019s a convergence of values, not a plot. Like any alumni group we facilitate participation by those who seem pre-inclined to want what Powers has to offer. Whatever your Aunt arranged with your parents, or more precisely your Father if I understood correctly, was entirely separate from UMILA,\u201d Mrs Porter assured Madison. \u201cBut that said, we are pleased to have you here and can be available after graduation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think Madison\u2019s mom thinks in terms of sororities rather than post-graduate networking,\u201d observed Kyle. \u201cNothing wrong with that, but a different paradigm. Personally I\u2019m not into fraternity life myself \u2013 too much wildness and not very real.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt can get rather petty at times, but not all letter groups are that bad. But you\u2019re right \u2013 UMILA is neither fraternity or sorority \u2013 and I suspect your mom might regard us with some disdain, so it\u2019s probably just as well that you\u2019re not one of our grantees right now,\u2019 noted Mrs. Porter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that they had had left, Madison commenting to Kyle, \u201cSo my dad worked one of his deals with his sister, probably without telling Mom much because she usually doesn\u2019t take an interest in his wheelings and dealings. And I wind up on a campus geared to graduating fatties. How do I explain that,\u201d Madison fussed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t, \u201creplied Kyle. \u201cI mean, you can\u2019t because you don\u2019t have the facts and probably shouldn\u2019t even try. . All you can do is be yourself. Your Aunt may or may not have done what you suspect deliberately and your Dad may or may not be complicit, for whatever reason. But what your mom has to deal with is your choices \u2013 including me.  Have you considered that I\u2019m as much of concern to her as your weight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light bulb went on for Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe best defense is sometimes a strong offense, as my dad sometimes says. So if you come with me to the airport to greet them you and not my waistline becomes the focus. Since they\u2019ll only be here for the weekend you can keep things in check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrecisely,\u201d ginned Kyle.\u201d Your Dad seems like a fascinating person I\u2019d enjoy getting t talk to. Who knows, maybe your mom will talk with me as well. I just hope I make a good impression.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso, if we take them to the dining hall and they see how many size 12 and up students are here they may get the point without either of us saying a thing,\u201c  noted Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing possibly stormy seas ahead  Chris took the precautions of any navigator, including touching base with his sister Rachel, asking her to look in on Alexis in his and Cecelia\u2019s absence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d Rachel replied. \u201cAnd you may find that Cecelia isn\u2019t the only one with questions. Madison is doing some digging into how her presence at Powers came about. She thought it might have been a grant from UMILA, so she asked them about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you find that out \u2013 and what is UMILA?\u201d Chris had asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s an affiliate of a group I do size acceptance work or \u2013 some of their grants fund scholarships at Powers, but there is no way Madison would have qualified. I found out because they called and informed me. I told them to assure her of that and ask one of us if she really needed to know.\u201d Answered Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d answered Chris, \u201cCecelia would have had a fit if one of your groups had sent her \u2013 but are you saying Powers is a school that caters to fa people, I thought you said its graduates had one of the best employment outlooks in the country?\u201d said Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey do. I gave you the statistics. Maybe not hounding people about their waistlines is part of the curriculum, but don\u2019t quote me on that. I just now made it up.\u201d Rachel said coyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but I know your advocacy and if this UMILA recommends them I\u2019m sure its part of an gender. Just how much weight has Madison gained?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve no idea, but if she has friends who are UMILA scholars they\u2019re probably size14 or 16 \u2013 not huge but bigger than Madison,\u201d Rachel opined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cOr bigger than Madisen used to be,</i>\u201d thought her Father.<i> \u201cBut not all that big \u2013 she could carry that kind of weight easily \u2013 and give this Kyle fellow less grief than I sometimes have to endure from Cecelia\u2019s fatophobia. It would be a real joke on her if Rachel added five pounds to Alexis while we\u2019re gone.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree days later Mr. and Mrs. Kraft were on their way.  The pilot advised them hat due to weather conditions they could expect heavy snow in Wichita and temperatures below forty degrees, but the storm had passed. At Powers Madison noted the weather. She was thankful she had an excuse to wear a heavy overcoat. This would not immediately reveal that she\u2019d gained nearly fifty pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Wichita Kyle decided to use his SUV because it had 4 wheel drive; Madison had decided the icy conditions would make her mom\u2019s traditional high heels a slip risk and therefore she would put her mom in a wheel chair as a distraction while the men handled the bags. Kyle thought this amusing and immediately agreed. With the storm knocking out electricity many restaurants were closed so he decided to use the Powers dining hall for food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the Kraft home Alexis had discovered a treat \u2013 a bakery fresh strawberry and almond chocolate pie with a note from her dad \u201csorry we have to be gone \u2013 enjoy this before we return.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She pondered throwing a party, but her Dad assured her that her Aunt Rachel would be checking up on her while she was gone, and if anyone was over at the house, she would be grounded for quite a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents had left her money and a credit card for any emergencies that popped up, but even her ability to use that was limited, as she had no car. They had taken the SUV to the airport, leaving only Chris' car, a sport sedan with a manual transmission that Alexa could not drive, even if she had wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back from school that day, Alexa texted some friends to see if anything was going on that evening, and was coming up short. Most of her friends were out of town for an away football game that evening, something that she just wasn't interested in, after breaking up with the team's #1 receiver a few weeks prior. So, Alexa just sat on the couch and turned on the TV, while helping herself to some pie that her Dad had left for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of this, and overcome with boredom, she decided she was done with this, and was going to go out somewhere. Hopelessly far away from any public transit, she decided she was going to learn to drive her Dad's manual transmission. Determinedly going into the garage, Alexa went into the drivers seat, and adjusted it so she could reach all three pedals, the third of which, looked completely foreign to her. After opening the garage door, and with the early afternoon dusk of November illuminating the $55,000 car she was sitting, Alexa turned the key....and....was greeted with nothing. The teen sat there dumbfounded. <i>Why won't this turn over</i> she thought to herself. Not knowing to push in the clutch, she just assumed a manual transmission meant pushing the stick into gear, and had no idea how to even turn the car on at this point. After few minutes of trying random combinations, Alexa gave up, closed the garage door, and went back into the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what am I going to do tonight?!\" she said outloud, to the empty 3,500 square foot house. With that she walked to the dinning room table, and saw the circular in the Herald, with pizza coupons enclosed. \"I'm treating myself.\" she thought, dialing up the number, and ordering a large pizza and bread-sticks, using the cash her Dad had left. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Madison waited nervously in the baggage claim area she was fighting stage fright despite having rehearsed carefully with Kyle how they would handle her mom. Outside the terminal the weather was bitingly cold, a circumstance that had helped turn a serious snowstorm into a blizzard. But there was a four hour window for planes to land and she was at the airport because one of them carried her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plane had landed sixty minutes before, two hours behind time, but was waiting for a departing flight to load and take off before it could be given a terminal berth. Madison had talked via cell with her dad and they\u2019d agreed to meet in the baggage claim area, then summon Kyle with his 4 wheel drive SUV as soon as they had retrieved the two checked bags.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe key, Madison knew, was to keep focused on logistics, letting her show off her strength and conditioning, thus depriving her mom of any immediate opportunity to focus on Madison\u2019s already acknowledged weight gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was dressed warmly for the weather \u2013 this was the eighth or ninth snowfall for the season and she\u2019d learned quickly what to do. She wondered if her Mom even owned a heavy coat suited for below freezing temperatures. She knew that this could work to her favor \u2013 giving her mom something else to worry and complain about, but she did feel sorry for her. Mrs. Kraft had lived all her life in the sun-belt and hadn\u2019t been trained in cold weather precautions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the plane Mr. Kraft was sanguine. He\u2019d been in scores of cities on hundreds of flights. As long as it was just waiting in line for a berth he knew there was no danger \u2013 he\u2019d been held up in Chicago\u2019s notorious O\u2019Hare for 2-3 hours at least a dozen times. These things happened and he knew passenger safety had to trump convenience. He felt it was inevitable.  Mrs. Kraft on the other hand was straining to keep her cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWhy do we have to have a docking berth,\u201d she asked, \u201cwhy not just use portable stairs to get off and walk into the terminal? It isn\u2019t that far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d observed her husband, \u201cand that works fine in a small airport with a half dozen flights a day with a dozen or so passengers each. But larger airports have to process multiple mobs of 250 people all at the same time. Trying to do that without berths would tie up movement of all the baggage carts, fuel tucks, and so forth. You can\u2019t move several big planes around with 2000 civilians who move at different speeds and have no idea really where they\u2019re going. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the plane lurched gently as the captain released the brakes and the 727 began easing its way towards a freshly vacated berth. Mr. Kraft\u2019s cell phone sounded and Madison reported that the bags should be available in 15 minutes, so there was plenty of time to disembark and make it to the baggage claims area. Originally Kyle and Madison had planned to use icy conditions and Mrs. Kraft\u2019s proclivity for high heels to justify putting Mrs. Kraft in a wheel chair, but Chris Kraft had rejected Madison\u2019s offer in that regard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the late arrival Madison wondered if she and Kyle could still implement their original plan \u2013 taking her parents to the campus for lunch since the power was out for many restaurants and it wasn\u2019t yet check-in time at the hotel where her father had made reservations. She needn\u2019t have worried \u2013 upon feeling the cold Wichita weather all her mom wanted was a place that was warm. Her father had already been talking about being hungry. While chatting via cell they\u2019d already decided that Kyle\u2019s SUV and the Powers dining hall sounded like a great combination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison met her parents in the baggage claim area. Her mom was already feeling the cold enough that she merely looked at her bundled up daughter and felt envious. Madison for her part had deftly pulled the two bags, each weighing over 50 pounds, onto a cart, then whipped out her phone and called Kyle. Her dad marveled at her energy and efficiency while his wife\u2019s teeth began to chatter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cHmm,</i>\u201d observed Chris Kraft to himself,<i> \u201cobviously not all her weight gain is flab; but, of course Madison never was weak to begin with. I think Cynthia may be getting all worked up over something Madison needs to decide for hers</i>elf. \u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle had the SUV\u2019s heater on, much to Mrs. Kraft\u2019s relief \u2013 although Madison didn\u2019t really feel the need and would have turned it off if it were just her and Kyle.  As they drove towards Powers Kyle talked casually with Mr. Kraft about the just completed trip. Cynthia Kraft, for the moment, was neutralized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they reached the campus Madison, wearing a heavy coat over three layers of clothing, was sweltering. She suggested leaving the cost in the car, but Kyle countered by suggesting her mom could use it. Mr. Kraft agreed and before she could say otherwise Cynthia Kraft was wearing a cost obviously several sizes too large but feeling warmer. Mindful of Madison\u2019s concern about high heels in the slush Chris stayed close to his bundled up wife and walked with deliberate slowness. As a result nothing adverse occurred, but the effect was to diminish attention on Madison.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWith the coat gone Cynthia, though sidelined, was able to better assess Madison\u2019s gain, which she correctly guessed to be at least fifty pounds. But Madison obviously was full of energy, happy and seemed be as strong as an ox. Cynthia knew she had to hold her peace, but it wasn\u2019t easy \u2013 and her uneasiness was made stronger with the realization that Powers was a campus of equally larger women.  All around the dining hall she saw students eating meals that were anything but low calorie. What type of school, she wondered, had her husband\u2019s sister gotten Madison involved with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle graciously invited Madison\u2019s parents to have whatever they liked \u2013 he was picking up the tab. He and Madison then both filled their trays with generous but not excessive portions and Mr. Kraft did likewise. Cynthia took a deep breath and followed her husband\u2019s example.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, according to script, Kyle engaged Mr. Kraft in conversation, the two hitting it off quite well. Madison on the other hand interrupted by introducing her parents to various passing classmates, sometimes with their significant others in tow. Mr. Kraft noted their maturity and social skills, his wife that every one of the co-eds were at least thick around the waist and many very much so. This was obviously a different kind of school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunch Kyle started to take Mr. and Mrs. Kraft a tour of the campus, but then noted the weather beginning to change.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we need to get you to your hotel,\u201d noted Kyle and the foursome returned to the SUV. The Kraft\u2019s were staying at what Kyle regarded as the rather pricy Ambassador Hotel.  As they arrived snow was already falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would invite you to stay,\u201d said Mr. Kraft, \u201cbut I think it might be wise for you to get back to the safety of Powers. However, if the weather allows would the two of you like to join us for dinner tomorrow night? I understand the restaurants there is very exceptional \u2013 Its called the Sienna Tuscany Steak House and I\u2019m sure they must have auxiliary power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looked at Madison, who said, \u201cSure, why not. I have a new dinner dress I\u2019ve been wanting to wear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod and a wave the two college students headed back to Powers while Me and Mes Kraft headed for their room.</span></div></div>",

He had checked the weather earlier in the day, and it wasn't supposed to accumulate, but he was starting to think that outside things were taking an unpredicted turn for the worse. <i>Getting back to Miami is going to be a mess</i> he thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, however, things were good, for now. Ceclia was just getting up from a quick nap. His initial fear that Cecelia would get grumpy at the sight of Madison's gain had gone unfounded. Whether it was her preoccupation with the cold weather, or just letting this thing go, she hadn't brought up the subject and seemed to be more focused on learning more about the college and city in general. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, that was so much food for lunch,\" Ceclia said, breaking up his moment of thought while putting a hand over her barely bloated stomach. \"No wonder Madison gained so much weight!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris decided not to bite at that jab against Madison, instead focusing on the food, \"Yeah, I haven't had a lunch with such generous portions in a while, and unfortunately jogging outside looks out of the question.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecelia wasn't going to let it go, however, \"Chris she looked so puffy, it was kind of surprising seeing her like that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...yeah,\" her husband responded, \"but she's clearly not just lounging around all day, look at how she handled those suitcases, I'd like to see you try to throw them around like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hope that dinner isn't huge. I don't want to be the second member of this family who has to go up a size.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris rolled his eyes, \"Eh, vacation calories,\" he said, while chuckling at their less than exotic destination and weather. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Madison was looking at her dresses. Her deal with Torrid was coming up huge in situations like these, and not just because it was providing her with clothes. She was actually getting clothes that were playing to her strengths, and keeping her looking respectable. Back when she was thin, she had never thought of it as an issue, but before she had gained some skill from the Torrid advice, she was a bit lost when it came to the new clothing reality she found herself in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the previous time that she had went to Torrid, she found a size 14 dinner dress that would be perfect for dinner with her parents that evening. When she had tried in on in the store, she liked the way that the cut of the dress had minimized her hefty rear and helped hide her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the hotel room a while later, Chris got back from the gym, which seemed to be the only part of the hotel that had been neglected. Following a quick shower, he was greeted to a scene where his wife was slipping her dress on. \"Chris, does this seem a bit tighter to you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe honestly could not tell, \"I think you may be playing head games with yourself,\" he responded, while also wondering if the somewhat tight dress showed a bit of a convex line on her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn sharp contrast to the snow storm in Kansas, back in Miami Alexa was experiencing typically serene weather as she ate a pizza with the door to the pool open. Before she had known it, she finished half of the slices, but still felt a bit hungry. <i>What is going on with me today?</i> she wondered. Alexa wasn't alarmed with her sudden tick in consumption, figuring she was just in a funk and assuming that her speedy metabolism would burn off the pizza-- in a place where it was always bikini season, she counted that. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Chris was off in the hotel gym Cynthia had been basking in the luxury of the Ambassador \u2013 she had never been in a hotel suite with walk-in closets!  The corner windows gave a spectacular view of the surrounding city, especially the Intrust Arena. She had to agree that he refurbished old Wichita style skyscraper\u2013 fourteen stories tall and built in 1926 to house a major bank -  was exceptional. After renovation the building now was a truly distinctive luxury hotel with elegant custom furnishings that showed attention had been paid to detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had considered pursuing her astonishment over the extent of Maddison\u2019s weight gain with her husband. He had always simply respected her position regarding food. She\u2019d told him early on that that in early high school she\u2019d endured a lot because of her weight, finally losing it and resolving never to become fat again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris Kraft was neither a chubby chaser nor a fatophobe. He was a builder of enterprises and manager of projects. If his wife wanted to ban desserts and avoid restaurant meals he could accept that. But he\u2019d made it clear that this was her decision, not something he was concerned about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia in her heart knew Chris could care less about what she saw in Madison \u2013 all he wanted was for her to be productive and happy. It was of no concern to him that Madison\u2019s once angular jawbone was now swathed in a coat of flesh which Cynthia knew was developing into a double chin. Nor would he be disturbed that her expanding belly was noticeably riding on her thighs when seated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Cynthia\u2019s husband this was all just part of his daughter trying to define and find herself On the plane he\u2019d bemusedly remarked that Madison and her new beau were trying to orchestrate attention elsewhere as he demurred from the offer of a wheelchair for his wife. He similarly chuckled at the transparency with which a fellow student was controlling visitors to their dining hall table at Powers via text message on signal from Madison while Kyle carried the conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia was not so amused. She saw Madison becoming what she once had been \u2013 a fat girl destined to live life as a lonely fat woman, with all the prejudice and hassle that went with it. She didn\u2019t want that future for her daughter, but it seemed beyond her control. Madison had declared as much. Cynthia wanted to call Powers \u201cPachyderm University\u201d from what she had observed, nut she knew Chris would only say \u201cit\u2019s her life an out of our hands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia knew Chris was right, but the effect was strange. If her own daughter could indulge, she had begun to think while Chris exercising, why shouldn\u2019t she?  So when Chris suggested that they use the suites separate sitting room as a dinette for a meal using room service she readily went along. He ordered a plate of chicken sofrito (chicken legs costed in chili powder and cooed with a blend of rice chopped onion, garlic and bell pepper). For himself he ordered lasagna blended with ground sirloin and a rich Italian chicken sausage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than discussing Madison Cynthia noticed the clouds parting. She soon found herself relaxing and falling under the spell of the flavors and aroma from the delicious meal, the stars and the snow in a rare evening of romantic peace with Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Kyle and Madison were laying plans for the next day. Maddison had reached her dad via cell phone while he was in the gym. She had extended an invitation to continue their tour of the campus and take in old town as well if the weather allowed. Chris tentatively accepted the proposal, but felt that another blizzard wave might greet them instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned our Chris\u2019s premonitions were not unfounded. Around 4:00 am he awoke to the sound of howling wind and cold sheets of sleet and snow. Fortunately Cynthia was sound asleep and Chris, unperturbable as usual, felt everyone was safe. He let his wife sleep until mid-morning, then ordered omelets from room service.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt about 10:00 he checked the news \u2013 Midwestern airports were locked down and probably not opening till Tuesday.  He called Alexa and told her that they\u2019d be gone longer than expected. A few moments later Madison phoned and suggested everyone stay warm. Chris immediately thought of Cynthia\u2019s Sunbelt wardrobe and agreed.  Around 1:00 he ordered a pair of Turkey Focaccia bread Club sandwiches with a Special Cranberry Mayonnaise and a lovin chocolate cake for dessert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia knew she was eating calorie bombs, but with the stormy weather and a pampering husband she just didn\u2019t care. It frankly was fun throwing off the restraints of thirty years for a short time.  About half an hour after lunch she decided to take a nap. It seemed only minutes I Chris notified her that things were safer, Madison and Kyle were on their way.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly thereafter there was a knock on the door. Cynthia opened it to see a Madison and Kyle she hadn\u2019t anticipated. Madison had a spectacular red dinner dress which seemed to scream \u201clook at me because I\u2019m stunning.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was wearing a suit underneath his overcoat. Both looked more mature than their actual ages, which of course was the desired effect, and Cynthia was speechless.<br>\r\nChris recovered more quickly, greeting both of them and expressing appreciation for their safety. Kyle informed him that he had a tie in his pocket but didn\u2019t know if the restaurant\u2019s dress code required it.  Chris informed him that he didn\u2019t need to and Kyle smiled. He\u2019d wear a tie if he had to, but it wasn\u2019t his habit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison caught the view and the commodiousness of the suite, as well as the hand selected furnishings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201c remarked her father, \u201cIf I have to be stranded and cooped up its best to do it in style.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle grinned. This was the type of place he\u2019d love to take Madison to if he could afford it \u2013he was happy Chris felt the same way about Cynthia for he felt that meant Chris had a good heart.   Before he could start a conversation, however, Chris gestured towards the on door and suggested they be on their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon being seated both Chris and Kyle noted a special notice informing patrons that all beef dishes came from  the Creek Stone Farms natural beef program - in Arkansas City, Kansas and would be served\u201d grilled to Temperature with Olive Oil, Sea Salt and Cracked Pepper and Accompanied by Silena\u2019s Signature Chianti Caramel Sauce.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cObviously they\u2019re proud of their sources,\u201d noted Kyle. \u201cAgri-business is finally catching up to the Amish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d asked Cynthia, obviously not getting his point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCreekstone has a line of beef which is corn fed and totally vegetarian - no hormones, no growth promoting drugs and no mixing of their meat with stuff from other countries.  Its been a big deal in the beef industry just the last few years, but its been that way in Amish areas forever. Thing is, since they don\u2019t have websites and do things in small lots few are aware of it. This farm is part of agribusiness trying to do the same thing on a bigger scale. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich means you\u2019re going to try it to compare, I suppose,\u201d interjected Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think, Mr. Kraft?  I take it you\u2019ve been here before.\u201d asked Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris laughed. \u201cCall me Chris, and yes I plan on having some so you and Madison are entirely welcome to. You won\u2019t be sorry But for an appetizer can I suggest a serving of Arancini.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what is that, pray tell?\u201d said Cynthia, for whom restaurant dining was a self-imposd novelty and the $36 per plate price tag on the steak astonishing. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStuffed Sicilian rice balls,\u201d replied her husband. \u201cIt takes fancy place like this to do them right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefinitely not what you\u2019ll find on the drive thru menu at McDonald\u2019s,\u201d quipped Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf we weren\u2019t already committed to beef I might have suggested a platter of Antipasto Misto. It usually has a variety of meats served Tuscany style,\u201d Chris said almost laconically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I need to study up on Italian food styles,\u201d remarked Madison, \u201cit seems every province has unique dishes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTraveling as much as I do you see them all and you can\u2019t help become a bit of an Epicurian,\u201d remarked Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEpi-what?\u201d stuttered Cynthia.:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEpicurus was a Greek philosopher who believed in the pursuit of happiness and pleasure as the great goal of life, so nowadays someone who likes searching for exotic foods and flavors today gets called an Epicurian,\u201d blurted Kyle.\u201dAs a hobby its fun, but if you go overboard it can get very expensive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re a student of Greek philosophy?\u201c inquired Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really,\u201c answered Kyle. \u201cMy own philosophical views are more conservative Judeo-Cristian \u2013 pray for god\u2019s guidance, then go where you\u2019re guided. Asceticism is the opposite ditch but in-between there is a balance based on loving and serving others. /I guess some might call it realistic altruism of youth, but our family\u2019s practiced it for ages,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat he is saying, Dad,\u201d explained Madison. \u201cis that  he wants people to help one another rather than fearing and controlling each other.  But not everyone is ready for that so you do what you can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the food arrived and met all expectations. Chris Kraft was left to his thoughts, which he suspected were far from those of his wife.  But Cynthia seemed preoccupied with devouring her meal and was the first to accept the suggestion of dessert.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was now Sunday and the Krafts were being visited in their Ambassador Hotel suite by their now borderline Rubenesque daughter and her boyfriend. The weather was predicted to continue rough for the next few days and the Krafts knew they  were tethered to Wichita. They had informed Alexa, then called Madison who in turn called Kyle. . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, since you\u2019re stranded here on our account I guess that sort of makes you our guests, right?\u201d suggested Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm \u2013 well in a sense. Did you have something in mind?\u201d Chris Krsdt inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the Ambassador hotel is literally next door to Wichita\u2019s old town district \u2013 and since you like unique eateries I could introduce you and your wife to things you\u2019ll not likely have in Florida.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting to me, to be sure,\u201d stammered Chris, \u201cbut when it comes to eating out in restaurants Cynthia \u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Chris\u201d interrupted Cynthia, I know what you\u2019re thinking but maybe I need to relent a bit. It would mean not being cooped up in this hotel for four days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes \u2013 and you don\u2019t have to worry about walking in the cold. The Ambassador has a complimentary Cadillac Escalade to ferry guests anywhere around Old Town and even beyond that they want,\u201d interjected Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK,OK, I\u2019m persuaded \u2013 but you youngsters only get to play hosts in picking the places - I insist on picking up the tabs.  Agreed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I was going to ask for Dutch treat but that\u2019s far better, Mr. Kraft, err, Chris,\u201d replied Kyle. \u201cSo for lunch could I suggest that we start with a place that\u2019s been around since 1910?  They have a choice of pot pies, bison and mushroom burgers, or a corned beef Reuben sandwich. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou left out their pizzas,\u201d interjected Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThat too,\u201d admitted Kyle,\u201d and chicken with waffles if you want to go crazy.  Its called the Public and they do have quite a variety.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou save me drooling already,\u201d exclaimed Chris, who with a glance noticed a strange craving o his wife\u2019s face. Was this discussion of food exciting Cynthia he wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia indeed was excited, but why she couldn\u2019t entirely understand. She was out with her husband, daughter and boyfriend with no pressure or responsibilities. To her it was becoming obvious where Madison\u2019s added pounds were coming from \u2013 with such food readily available. It was making her hungry as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was something else. Sure, Madison\u2019s flaring hips and what Cynthia observed was a gradually accumulating layer of back fat were noticeable, as were her plumping upper arms, but for some reason Cynthia didn\u2019t care. She was in fact intrigued when after a full lunch Kyle proposed an afternoon adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do dinosaurs, Egyptian mummies, Indians and WW2 have in common?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThings that kids would love?\u201d asked Madison innocently, knowing full well what was coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are all featured in the museum of national treasures right down the street,\u201d commented Kyle. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we make an afternoon of it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia was buttering her third corn muffin and was feeing full, but the idea appealed to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think Chris,\u201d she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re he guests, so let\u2019s go where our hosts suggest?\u201d he replied \u2013and so they did, developing a fresh appetite over the next four hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, our hosts, what do you suggest for supper?\u201d asked Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201chmm,\u201d hummed Kyle. \u201cYour suite has a microwave. What about some woodoven pizza. Ever hear of it\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied Chris. \u201cWhat\u2019s unique about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe way the dough is flash cooked,\u201d answered Kyle. \u201cYou can only do it in a special oven. If we got a couple of boxes I figure we could play cards and graze \u2013 give you and Madison some quality time. And honestly, let us get to know one another as well. We can walk over to Vicimo\u2019s and order two pies \u2013 cheesecake for dessert if you wish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm pass on the dessert but go ahead and surprise us,\u201d replied Chris, failing to note his wife\u2019s slight pout. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foursome walked the few short blocks to the restaurant where Kyle ordered an Angeli (Roasted chicken, sweet balsamic marinara sauce, mozzarella, gorgonzola, portobello mushrooms, artichoke hearts, plus fresh rosemary) and a Melanze with ground beef (Marinara sauce, mozzarella, beef. grilled eggplant, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, oven roasted tomatoes, and fresh basil). Meanwhile Chris called the hotel and requested a pickup in the Escalade.<br>\r\nWhile waiting for their pickup Kyle noticed an adjacent convenience strew and excused himself. He soon returned with 3 two litre bottles of soda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we can depend on the hotel for ice,\u201d he remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the Kraft\u2019s suite everyone enjoyed their food long with several hands of rummy. Cynthia, to her husband\u2019s surprise, finished her four slice share first, while Madison finished last. After Kyle and Madison had departed he wondered whether he should say anything, but she spoke first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking. I\u2019m indulging and enjoying myself like I haven\u2019t since middle school \u2013 and don\u2019t ask me why. Maybe because Madison\u2019s able to be happy with her body I\u2019m remembering what it could have been like for me,\u201d she declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine by me sweetheart,\u201d her husband replied. \u201cI\u2019m just sorry its taken so long \u2013 but its never too late to choose a different path as long as you\u2019re alive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, she said. \u201cThe kids left us a liter of soda. What do you say we order some sundaes from room service?\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll be emailing your teachers to check\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, Mom,\" Alexa told her mother, who had called to inform her that she would not be back late Monday, but rather later in the week, possibly as far off as Thursday or Friday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I do for food?\" she asked her Mom, not really asking, but more doing it to complain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use your Dad's credit card. I'm also calling your Aunt, she'll be checking up on you Monday evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" Alexa complained, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Alexa, someone needs to drop by to make sure everything is alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...fine.\" Alexa said, somewhat underscoring that she had no sway in the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit more chit chat, she hung up the phone and pondered what to eat for dinner that night. The materials to make a salad were still available, however, she also had half of the pizza she had ordered on Saturday, her second one of the weekend. <i>Better just distroy the evidence...</i> she thought as she pulled the box from the fridge. In addition to food, over the weekend she had started binging on shows online, blowing through multiple seasons of comedy on their TV, and she again plowed through a few hours of sitcoms, pushing off a run for when her parents would be back home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Monday morning, Alexa showered and got ready for class. She wondered if she seemed a bit softer than usual, or if she was just bloated from her indulgence over the weekend. Regardless, she was running late, and heard a familiar honk, telling her to just grab a few pop-tarts in leu of a bowl of cerial to join her friend, and ride to class, Chrissy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got to the car, Chrissy looked somewhat dreadful, \"Do you have to be late every Monday?\" she asked Alexa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!! My Mom isn't here to wake me up,\" she said defensibly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Chrissy replied, \"you missed an awesome weekend, Chris had a huge party, the cops got called, but it was later in the night, and we were able to run out of their before the po-po got to us. What did you do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa felt somewhat embarrassed. She didn't want to tell her friend that instead of partying and living it up in the 'in' crowd, she sat at home and veged out. \"I visited my aunt,\" she lied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't she live in town?\" Chrissy asked, her 8 year old hand-me down luxury car now turning out of their neighborhood towards the direction of the high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...but...my parents were out of town, so they wanted me to stay with her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, that makes sense, I guess,\" Chrissy said, unconvinced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a somewhat boring morning of class, Alexa got to the lunch line, and saw a large group of people waiting for salads. <i>Ugh...I don't want to wait in line for that...</i> she thought to herself, while she saw almost no one under the \"Homestyle\" line. Alexa decided to try something new. She had never ventured in to that line before, mainly because she never thought she would like anything that greasy in the middle of the day. However, as she got closer, the smell of the food...fried chicken and mashed potatoes with gravy looked too good to pass up. She decided to continue her indulgence, <i>Just until Mom gets back</i> she told herself, and get the chicken and mashed potatoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat down at her table with her friends, Chrissy raised an eyebrow, to which Alexa shot an indifferent shrug back, \"Just this once,\" she said to her surprised friend. </span></div></div>",

She blithely zoned out and ignored the critical eye of Chrissy and her figure-obsessive friends.  Alexa wasn\u2019t model thin but was comfortable with her size 6 clothes. She enjoyed eating on occasion but in deference to her mom\u2019s concerns only occasionally let her self go \u2013 usually as a result of stress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now the press of classwork, absence of her parents and ho-hum social life were generating stress and she didn\u2019t feel like hearing her peer\u2019s chirping, so she simply blocked them out. After she was finished she actually felt like having a dessert, but refrained out of concern for criticism from Chrissy and Co. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt an adjacent table Bobby Wentworth noticed the contrast. He was puzzled by the new appetite of his slender classmate, who appeared ravenous compared to her friends. He knew Alexis casually but had thought of her as being just another weight obsessive coed, which wasn\u2019t his preference. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby wasn\u2019t a feeder or even aware of acronyms like FA but he himself was slightly husky with a good appetite. He knew he usually preferred larger girls than Alexa who could eat like he himself enjoyed doing.  Unfortunately most of them tended to be shy and into themselves. Alexa\u2019s intelligence and general sociability were nearer to what he felt comfortable with in those areas. As he observed her packing her lunch away he found himself thinking \u201cif she always enjoyed food like that she could easily be a bit larger. That would be nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis thought stuck with him into the afternoon, where the two shared a class together. By then he\u2019d decided to make a point of talking to Alexa at the end of the period. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what\u2019s been with you,\u201d he asked. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you hanging out much lately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d sighed Alexis, \u201cmy parents are out of town and I\u2019ve been working on studies. I\u2019ll get back into things soon I hope.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s a drag,\u201d replied Bobby. \u201cA girl in that situation deserves something to perk up her spirits. What about we meet up and let me buy you a sundae after school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis normally never indulged in sundaes, but after denying herself dessert at lunch she was in a different frame of mind than normal. The idea instantly appealed to hr. She knew Bobby was more grade and college focused than most and from a respected family. She\u2019d thought him reserved but nice and while the sudden invitation surprised her she accepted. It would be her first date in two months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby met Alexa and escorted her to his 2012 Chevy Aveo hatchback. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, not as fancy as a Corvette but it gets great gas mileage\u201d he joked half seriously. \u201cThirty miles a gallon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Alexa it was just fine, she saw nothing to criticize and scooted in. \u201cOK, where are we going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSwensons \u2013 where else for ice cream,\u201d grinned Bobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they arrived at around 3:30 Alexa was a little nervous and genuinely feeling hungry. As she and Bobby perused the menu he remarked that having a burger to balance out the sundaes might be a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo in other words you\u2019d really like one yourself but don\u2019t want to do it without me?\u201d she challenged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yeah, sorta \u2013 as you can probably tell I have a good appetite,\u201d Bobby answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s not my normal style, but this week I\u2019m stress eating and not apologizing,\u201d Alexa declared. \u201cSince I don\u2019t normally do this sort of thing which do you recommend?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suggested a Greek Paleo sandwich (chicken with a lettuce wrap, black olives and tomatoes served with sweet potato fries) for Alexa and a Miami Burger (angus beef topped with fresh avocado, jalapenos, Monterey jack cheese, lettuce and tomato) for himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sundae selection was generous and took some time to review, but ultimately the duo decided to each have a Coit tower (vanilla and chocolate ice cream layered with cold chocolate fudge, strawberry topping, banana slices and diced almonds topped off with whipped cream, chocolate Jimmies, a wafer and a cherry. Alexa\u2019s mind spun as she considered having such a concoction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the waited for their order Bobby channeled the conversation to the school reports Alexis was working on. She found that he was familiar with some of the materials she was dealing with and readily offered constructive sources and ideas she could use.  He appreciated her questions, pointing out that the challenge for grades under common core come from showing that students are thinking creatively, not just parroting back what\u2019s in the text book<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like to include off the beaten track material that makes the teacher have to verify my sources. Every paper I\u2019ve done it with comes back with an A and sometimes a side note,\u201d he confided. \u201cWith the internet its easier than it was for my dad - but he did the same thing using the traditional library.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir conversation became so engrossing that before either of them realized it over an hour had passed; their burgers and sundaes had both been slowly but totally consumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know,\u201c mentioned Bobby, \u201cCoral gables is called the burger capital of Florida on the Internet if you haven\u2019t heard. They even have a contest to see who\u2019s is best. They call it the Burger Beast Burger Braawl. This year\u2019s winner was Jrs Gourmet, which is a place we might check it out some time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa paused. Her belly was full, even stuffed, but she was charmed by his offer \u2013 and still having mixed feelings of elation and dread over what she\u2019d permitted herself to do. . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, but let\u2019s make it next week, OK?\u201d she replied. Bobby nodded his assent, smiling to himself. Alexa had shared with him Rachel\u2019s cornucopia and he felt she wasn\u2019t really against it. She\u2019d also had a 1600 calories mid-afternoon meal on top of a 1000+ calorie lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they got up to leave Bobby offered to let his date think on the school things they\u2019d shared overnight and suggested that they could talk more the next day over lunch. It was a deliberate ploy which Alexa was thankful for. She appreciated Bobby\u2019s help and friendship \u2013 and it would be a good way to not having to deal with Chrissy\u2019s shallow thinking without giving offense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa next headed directly home, not overly surprised to see her Aunt Rachel\u2019s car in the driveway. Her Mom had told her to expect a visit.  Alexa came in thru the kitchen door and was surprised to see her aunt fully engrossed in cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Alexa. I was hoping to be further along before you arrived,\u201d Rachel said with a smile.  \u201cYour uncle won\u2019t be here for supper until after seven, but if you\u2019re hungry there\u2019s pastries in that box over there \u2013 donuts, bear claws, turnovers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, thanks but no thanks,\u201d replied the still full Alexa. \u201cI had a bite after school with a friend. A late supper is just fine \u2018cause I can get some studying in. What is all this cooking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re having lasagna with vegetables tonight, there\u2019s a casserole for tomorrow and Wednesday cooling on the sink counter. I also made a quiche, which I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy for breakfast. The pastries are for breakfast or whenever and there\u2019s ice cream in the freezer,\u201d her Aunt reported. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll that for just three days? You must think I eat like a lumberjack!\u201d exclaimed Alexa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re sharing the lasagna with you and probably the ice cream,\u201d Aunt Rachel reminded her.  \u201cIf you have leftovers on the casserole Chris and Cynthia may finish them; <br>\r\nI\u2019m just doing what your mom instructed \u2013 making sure there is enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, er, thanks. I guess I\u2019ll see you later,\u201d replied Alexa as she headed for hrr room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner that night was excellent. Alexa\u2019s appetite had returned enough that she even had seconds plus a small serving of ice cream.  The next morning she enjoyed a third of the quiche with a bear claw and a turnover, thinking \u201cthis decadence is going to have to stop, but when mom gets back it won\u2019t be here. So why not enjoy it now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt school she informed Chrissy in first period that she would be eating with Bobby and reviewing some homework, to which Chrissy retorted, \u201cOh, him, the porky nerd?  Have fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis slam rankled Alexa, who shot back \u201cBobby is no nerd, which you might have known if you\u2019d ever bothered getting to know him. And as far as I\u2019m concerned he carries his weight just fine.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Alexa walked off, barely hearing Cassie exclaim \u201cto each their own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat lunchtime Alexa deliberately loaded her plate with cub try fried steak, beans, macaroni and cheese plus a small salad with ranch dressing, making sure Cassie saw her as she joined Bobby.  Later on she readily accepted his offer to get her a piece of apple pie for dessert.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What orginally was planned as a quick weekend turned into a 6 day trip. He secretly wondered if his wife would have preferred they stay even longer, as after Sunday evening, her indulgence on room service had been notable. Going back to Miami for her would mean a return to diets and a beach life, at least, he assumed. As her looked at his wife finish off a non-diet coke, he wondered if she was bloated, or if a bit of pudge was forming on her stomach. <i>She would have killed herself over that earlier in the week,</i> he thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe texted Madison about their evening departure, which allowed them to grab an earlier dinner with their daughter before going to the airport to head home. They went to a burger place that Madison had recommended, and Cynthia did not hold back, on the rationalization that they were still treating themselves on the trip. \"Well, I'm happy that you both made up, even if it ended up being longer than you had planned,\" Madison told her parents between bites in her burger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay,\" her Mom replied, \"I think this weekend was good for us. It gave us a lot of peace of mind.\" her Mom said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was a bit curious about the phrasing, \"about my size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Mom replied, \"About everything, really. Chris, the city, even helped us rethink things about ourselves a bit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison could figure out what her Mom meant, she had never seen her Mom order something as fattening as a burger before. She assumed her Mom had adapted a \"when in Rome\" type attitude towards it, but she was happy to see that the time spent near Powers' campus had melloed her previously high-strung Mom out slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some goodbyes, the Krafts went back to the airport, and hopped on their fight. Although he had a good time, no one was happier than Chris on the flight to get out of the city, and back to a warmer climate. Although he loved his daughter, he was ready to be home, and go back to work. However, as the plane was in the air, neither him nor his wife expected any of the changes that greeted their younger daughter back home. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison was thoughtful after being dropped off by Kyle. They\u2019d just seen her parents off at the airport after sharing their final burger meal together. Sshe hadn\u2019t forgotten the private talk she and Kyle had shared the day before with Chris Kraft.  He\u2019d treated his wife to a room service break after sleeping in, then sent her off for a day of tourism and shopping while he caught up on work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe mentioned to Cynthia Kraft in passing that she could take her time because he might share some \u201cquality time\u201d with Madison and Kyle before her slated return \u201cif Madison was free.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ploy was disingenuous for a purpose. As soon as Cynthia was off in the hotel\u2019s Escalade he texted Madison asking that she call him. At the end of class she did and he invited her (and Kyle if he could as well) to come by as soon after class as possible \u201cfor a private talk.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison contacted Kyle at lunch and they agreed to go directly, not even changing from their school clothes. They arrived before 4:00, Kyle bringing a gift of genuine Amish non-microwave popcorn. Mr. Kraft, who indeed had been attending to business in the interim, greeted them cordially. He could not help but notice Madison\u2019s face and figure in her school slicks and to \u2013 they reminded of his sister Rachel in the later years of high school, 70 pounds lighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the earlier experience with Rachel he could tell Madison\u2019s jowls were rapidly filling out, her cheeks becoming more flesh with a slight dimple. The underpart of her jaw was rounder with the promise of a future double chin. Her stomach was larger than it had appeared in her dinner dress earlier in the week, about to extend out past her bust line, but proportional to her expanded hips and thigh\u2019s. Her upper arms were noticeably round as well, complimenting her larger breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u201dYes,\u201d thought Chris to himself, Madison and Rachel share the same genes. It\u2019s a good thing she\u2019s comfortable with her size because she\u2019s likely to get bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Kraft offered the two college students glasses with ice and a 2 liter bottle of soda for refreshments, then gotten right to the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMadi,\u201d he had told her, \u201cI think you know this trip was your mom\u2019s idea more than mine \u2013 although its been a pleasure to meet you, Kyle. Your mom was really concerned after your email and I think you need to know why.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d suspected as much.\u201d Madison answered. \u201cShe\u2019s been super weight conscious all her life \u2013 but after being here at Powers I\u2019ve learned there is another road.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich I fully grasp,\u201d relied her Dad. \u201cI\u2019m a bit husky myself and you know how the genes run in my side of the family. But I love your mom and have been understanding of her feelings for the sake of our greater relationship. Frankly it\u2019s not a big issue for me. But I think you deserve to know the full story of why she has been this way \u2013 and how your decision has apparently gotten her to begin relaxing a bit.  No promises, but I\u2019m hopeful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean,\u201d Madison had replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimply stated, she was bullied over her weight at one time and hasn\u2019t wanted you or Alexa to go thru what she remembers as having happened to her. She was teased and made fun of in grade and middle school before she lost a fair amount of weight \u2013 then saw others shamed and held back from being accepted by the in-crowd in high school,\u201d Mr. Kraft related. \u201cBy the time she reached college she had bought in to the idea that, for women at east, figure counts before anything. If I want to eat well on the road and carry forty extra pounds its my business, but she wouldn\u2019t participate because no matter what I said she just felt I was being a gentlemen. It\u2019s taken being stranded from a blizzard to get her to enjoy what most people do regularly \u2013 just go out to restaurants.,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut now she\u2019s enjoying it?\u201d Kyle questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeems so \u2013 although she hasn\u2019t promised it will continue. But that\u2019s for us to work through, What you need to know that she realizes that you are past the age which caused her so much pain with no defense. She knows, and I know, that you\u2019re happy and can handle your own life, and that\u2019s what counts.  Just don\u2019t try to reconcile your view with where she is \u2013 that\u2019s something she needs to work out herself, and it may or may not happen. OK?\u201d her father had requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDone,\u201d Madison had responded with a smile. \u201cBut now a question for you: was my coming to Powers a set-up? This college seems to be actually geared towards helping support the size acceptance movement like Gallaudet does for the deaf, Rutgers for women or Tuskegee for blacks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dad grimaced. \u201cI know that now, having checked things out more than I did initially. I\u2019m sure your Aunt probably knew. But, no, I didn\u2019t deliberately plan it to work that way. She gave me, and I confirmed the average salary of their graduates and their track record with corporate head hunters. When Rachel said she could arrange funding I and your mom went along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I called her and she admitted she arranged thanks,\u201c acknowledged Madison. But what do you mean by your having learned more by further checking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPowers started out as an agricultural school back in the land grant era with the Morrill Act of 1862. That\u2019s for you Kyle, because its your field. But Powers built on that to the point that they\u2019re also strong in business, economics and liberal arts. That\u2019s because during the depression they almost went under; instead a family with some money paid the bills. After WW2 this same family gave them a fairly large endowment \u2013that\u2019s where the newer buildings came from.\u201c Mr. Kraft informed them. \u201cMembers of this same family today are active in the size acceptance movement.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich is probably where UMILA comes in,\u201d commented Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUMILA?\u201d her father asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe alumni group that faclitates graduates careers and finances grants for probably a quarter of the student body,\u201d answered his daughter. \u201cI asked Aunt Rachel about that because she\u2019s been one of their field birddogs, but she said I wasn\u2019t a candidate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I never heard about that, \u201c Chris acknowledged. \u201cBut that explains a lot of what your Mom and I observed in the dining hall. The relative size of the student body as compared to other campuses is definitely larger than average.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound as though you disapprove, though,\u201d noted Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly, no. I\u2019m not a committed chubby chaser like a small percentage of the country, but if it\u2019s a choice I would lean more that way than towards these ultra-lean skeletons who call themselves models,\u201d remarked Chris. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo if Mom grew to the size of Aunt Rachel or your mom you wouldn\u2019t mind?\u201d  Madison asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs long as she was healthy and happy, not at all,\u201d her dad acknowledged.  \u201cThat\u2019s just not an item on my bucket list. But no, it wouldn\u2019t be an issue,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that\u2019s true of most men. Mr. Kraft, errr I\u2019m sorry, Chris,\u201d said Kyle. \u201cMadison will tell you I\u2019ve encouraged her to match her muscle mass to her weight to stay healthy. That\u2019s how the larger Amish girls handle it, and they are frequently both heavier and healthy and happy. I\u2019ve been the outside Englischer, but I think they set a great example.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point Mr. Kraft got a text from Cynthia saying she was on her way back to the hotel. The trio quickly picked out another fine restaurant for the evening. Mrs. Kraft had purchased several new items of clothing, including a dinner dress that was noticeably looser than the one from earlier in the week. Madison and Kyle noticed that she thoroughly enjoyed her meal \u2013including a rich dessert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The last of the donuts and most of the ice cream had disappeared the evening before along with the rest of Aunt Rachel\u2019s casserole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been nice,\u201d she thought with a feeling of regret. \u201cBut no way can I keep going like this with Mom back. Probably a good thing because I could actually blow up like Madison.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she realized something. She was feeling sad, first about criticizing her sister and, deep inside, about not having the courage to follow her sister\u2019s example. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pondered the conflict. \u201cSo why doesn\u2019t gaining a few pounds bother me? Is it because I know that I\u2019m going to get huge? Is it because of Bobby?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa didn\u2019t have time to sort it out. There was barely enough time to clean up and dispose of the evidence. But she knew that for nearly a week she\u2019d been consuming nearly twice her usual caloric intake. Before leaving she decided to get on a scale ad see the damage. To her surprise the digital number was exactly the same as it had been two months before \u2013 132.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u201d thought Alexa \u201cI must have a faster metabolism than I thought. All that food and no change? Well, good to know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did she realize the difference between metabolism and initial weight gain. The former burns calories, the latter is a process that begins with the formation of fresh new balloon like special cells; the weight comes from subsequently bring filled. For someone with few or no available cells it takes time for there to be actual weight gain. New fat cells were in fact being created in her body but hadn\u2019t yet been filled and expanded. One week of indulgence wasn\u2019t going to show immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa went off to school where at lunch Wednesday she had fried chicken and mashed potatoes with Bobby, letting him very obviously buy her cake for dessert just to spite her queen bee clique friends, who had been glaring disapproval of her appetite and association with Bobby all week. They dug in on her report to be turned in the next day and confirmed their plans for Saturday night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn class she got a text from Madison. \u201cenroute to airport \u2013 mom dad have a question about restaurants. Italian or Mexican preferred?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe message startled Alexa. She couldn\u2019t remember ever going to a restaurant with both parents \u2013 her mom refused to step into them. Confused, she texted back \u201cItalian\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. Mid evening arrival \u2013 be at airport after 8:00.\u201d was the cryptic reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass began and Alexa focused on the work at hand. At the end of the school day she was feeling stressed. She felt like asking Bobby for a sundae but instead went home to an empty larder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d she thought. \u201cIf we\u2019re going out I\u2019ll at least be able to justify my appetite. And there is a pot pie from Aunt Rachel still left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pot pie was supplemented by the last of the ice cream and a cheese sandwich by 6:00, Alexa correctly rationalizing she\u2019d not be eating until ten. Promptly at 8:30  her parents arrived and her dad announced that they were going to Bugatti\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat,\u201d replied Alexa, \u201cbut what\u2019s the occasion?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the storm forced your mom and I to share fine dining with Madison. It just seemed right to extend the same honor to you,\u201d Chris Kraft replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded good, but Alexa was dubious about this being he full story, and looked at her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what you\u2019re probably thinking\u201d Cynthia said. \u201cBut I knew that there wasn\u2019t much to cook at home and I\u2019ve loosened up after seeing everything in Wichita. Let\u2019s see what adventure your dad has in store.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus assured Alexa went out, aware that her belly felt empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter entering the fine Italian restaurant and being seated Alexa opened the menu and was dumbfounded. She had no experience with the myriad of Italian words confronting her. \u201cItalian\u201d food to her meant pizza, spaghetti and maybe spumoni ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad,\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cyou\u2019re going to have to help me interpret this \u2013 I have no idea what I\u2019m doing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he replied, fully aware that although he regularly ate out on the rood his wife\u2019s weight concerns had preluded his giving his daughters a proper culinary education. Silently he promised to begin correcting this going forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand,\u201d he replied. \u201cLet\u2019s start with chilled potato soup. It\u2019s called Vichyssoise:.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought Vichy was French,\u201d commented Alexa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery perceptive,\u201d noted Mr. Kraft. \u201cTechnically you\u2019re right \u2013and although it\u2019s on the menu here Wikipedia will confirm it was put together by a French chef in a New York hotel around WW1. But it is popular among Italians. Are you willing to try it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, why not?\u201d responded Alexa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, here is another item to whet your palate \u2013 Ravioli Bombay,\u201d her Dad noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know Bombay is in India \u2013 what does that have to do with ravioli?\u201d queried Alexa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ravioli stuffed with curried chicken \u2013 curry is of course typical of food in India. This chicken has been drenched in a spicy curry sauce that has, the menu notes, diced apples, raisins, roasted almonds, and whipped cream,\u201d her father replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s different alight. OK, I\u2019ll try it,\u201d replied Alexa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll stick with what I can understand - Penne al Salmone. That\u2019s cylinder shaped pasta with smoked salmon cream sauce, right?\u201d interjected Cynthia,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and I\u2019m going to go with a tasty dish with a real jaw-breaking name - Scaloppini di Pollo alla Piemontese: that translates as thinly sliced chicken breasts that have been soaked in a light Gorgonzola cream sauce. Its served with fettuccine noodles drenched in a sauce with mushrooms and bell peppers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia shook her head. Alexa obviously was enjoying herself \u2013 every bit on her plate was being consumed plus several rolls. She knew her husband dined out a lot but didn\u2019t realize he was such a food hobbyist. The trio enjoyed their meal and let Alexa know of their time in Wichita, with Alexa noting her mom\u2019s frequent comments about food. What, she wondered, was happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally dinner was finished and Chris asked if everyone was ready for dessert. Cynthia reminded him that they hadn\u2019t eaten since breakfast, so she had a Torta di Mele (home made apple tart).On her dad\u2019s suggestion Alexa went with Crostata di Ricotta (Ricotta cheese cake with raspberry sauce). Chris himself had a two-chocolate mousse with vanilla and raspberry sauce<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got home it was after midnight. A perplexed but comfortably stuffed Alexa thanked her parents for a great evening and retired to her room. There she texted Madison \u201cwhat have you done to our mom? Call me!\u201d She didn\u2019t expect an immediate answer, but was herself full after four meals that day. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She didn\u2019t know Emily well but had noticed her in classes they shred together. Like many Powers students she had gained the Freshman 15 x 2 by this stage \u2013 Madison noted that she could use a Torrid wardrobe upgrade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure \u2013 what about this evening, say around seven?\u201d Madison suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily swallowed nervously, \u201cThanks, I\u2019ll try to be there on time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison went about her routine for the rest of the day, alerting Cassie that after supper she was expecting a visit from Emily. Cassie promised to retire to her own room unless called upon. Madison also told Kyle she\u2019d be tied up. As for Alexa she\u2019d asked her to call after their parents were in bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily showed up precisely on time. Madison had a two liter bottle of soda and a large bowl of chips on the coffee table in front of the living room divan. The two Powers students settled in comfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMadison,\u201d Emily began, \u201cthis may sound cray but I want to let you know that you\u2019re an example and inspiration to me; I want to be like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d queried a surprised Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike me you\u2019re bigger than when we came to Powers but you\u2019ve handled it so much more positively than I am. You have clothes that are terrific \u2013 which tells me I can do the same thing if I can just adjust my head to what\u2019s happening to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you explain a little more?\u201d Madison inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I came to Powers I only had a few extra pounds after being up and down all my life. It was a counselor at school who knew I\u2019d been harassed about my being a bit larger that advised me. She said that there was a special way of funding my coming here and that I wouldn\u2019t get the grief over my belly that I might other places. So I got to come here on a special grant. What she didn\u2019t tell me was that, hassle free from others or not, I\u2019d gain thirty more pounds!\u201d Emily poured out. \u201cHow do you adapt so positively to a gain like that? Please, let me know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison grappled with how to respond. \u201cI can tell you what happened with me. But everyone\u2019s story is unique. Can you share yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrankly I wasn\u2019t paying attention at first. Like I guess everyone I was focused on being in college and getting good grades. And like everyone here I really enjoyed the buffets in the student center. And I became friends with Gary Hendricks, who like a lot of guys here seems alright with fat girls. But there was something else as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did like my roommate suggested and began drinking hot chocolate when I studied. She said hot chocolate is actually found to increase blood flow to the brain and improve memory. I checked on the Internet and found that is true \u2013 studies even indicate that long-term use may be a possible preventative measure against diseases like dementia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, when I needed to study really hard, I had a couple cups of hot chocolate, which is only like what, 300 calories? It allowed me to focus and concentrate much better as well as retain information. But just chocolate got boring, so I also started grazing on food like pretzels, chips and the like. So it was like 700 calories extra three times a week, but at the time I wasn\u2019t counting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison nodded. \u201cSo you\u2019re naturally been picking up a few pounds?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Emily continued. \u201cAlthough at first I really didn\u2019t notice it. But then I began to notice that my top wouldn\u2019t tuck into my shirts \u2013 instead my belly was bulging over the waistband and you could see a roll when I sat down. But it didn\u2019t seem like all that much so I just bought some larger clothes. But that only helped for a while. What used to be a belly pooch is now a muffin top with love handles and my thighs are starting to resemble oak tree trunks. Yet Gary says I\u2019m beautiful and just need to dress for my size \u2013 like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I get my clothes at Torrid \u2013 ever been there? It\u2019s pricy at times but Gary is right. They can make even those with figures over 300 look stunning,\u201d Madison answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re no 300 pounds,\u201d Emily answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but close to 200. But those are just scale numbers anyway,\u201d Madison replied dismissively. \u201cIt seems to me you came here on one of the UMILA grants but now are fighting with your mental self-image instead of taunts from classmates.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that and my eating habits. I know I\u2019m going to only get bigger unless I cut out the snacking, lay off the Power\u2019s breakfast buffet and the lunchtime dessert cart \u2013 but they make it so temping here,\u201d Emily fussed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, tell me about it,\u201d agreed Madison. \u201cI didn\u2019t get my figure from the salad bar, believe me! Eventually you\u2019ll reach a set point where consumption and basal metabolism match. Exercise helps as well, but where that point is for you I can\u2019t tell. I know I\u2019m comfortable now in my body and can do what I want to. That\u2019s the important thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least my belly and butt balance out and my boobs have grown two sizes,\u201d Emily went on, not really getting Madison\u2019s point. \u201cGary says I\u2019m pretty and should just embrace it and flaunt it. Guys back home never talk like that. Gain five pounds and they\u2019re all over your case.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe guys back home that like larger girls are generally in the closet \u2013 the few with balls enough to be open come here and enjoy the show, or so I\u2019m learning,\u201d answered Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSwell, I guess, because my belly has really grown. It just pours over my waistband when I sit down and I\u2019m starting to get another roll near the bottom of my ribcage. I think I\u2019m about to get a double chin. Doesn\u2019t that make me officially fat rather than just thick or chubby?\u201d Emily continued to ramble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not for me to hang labels and call people names. Some in my dorm claim that fat can stand for \u2018fantastic, adorable and terrific,\u2019\u201d answered Madison, \u201cbut this is your mind playing games with you. You need to resolve it with your mirror and your guy, not someone like me. I can help you with clothing but you have to make the mental adjustment.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s strange when your belly starts to rest on your thighs, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d asked Emily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI noticed that when it happened to me, yes,\u201d agreed Madison. \u201cBut where is it supposed to go? It\u2019s not a big deal to me. What I\u2019ve begun to notice lately is an accumulation on my back up near the shoulder blades. I needed to get another bra and my belly hangs down and jiggles a bit despite all my exercise. My roommate is well over 200 and her\u2019s veritably shakes when she walks without any support. Kyle and I are trying to make sure I get enough exercise with the gym and cycling that I have the muscle tissue a larger person needs to handle their weight.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGaining just fat tissue results in carrying around dead weight. That becomes an invitation to store toxins in our tissues. Exercise removes the toxins and makes sure there are enough muscles and blood circulation near the fat cells for a person to retain both strength, energy and health.\u201d answered Madison. \u201cCan you press your body weight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, I\u2019ve no idea,\u201d replied Emily. \u201cI never go to the gym.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMight be advisable \u2013 you\u2019ll not lose anything but you\u2019ll feel better after you get used to it. The first few weeks won\u2019t be easy if you\u2019re not in shape though. You might ask Gary about taking up cycling as well.\u201d counseled Madison. \u201cNow I can give you the name of a wardrobe consultant at Torrid if you want. She\u2019s anything but a twig so she is one of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm \u2013 ok,\u201d said Emily as she finished off the last of the chips which both she and Madison had been sharing. \u201c\u2019l\u2019ll think about the gym.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Emily left Madison sighed. She thought she needed to talk with Kyle \u2013 but knew she\u2019d promised Alexa as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She pulled up Alexa's cell number and gave it a ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Madison\" her sister answered, somewhat muted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you're trying not to wake Mom and Dad?\" Madison asked her sister. She knew that Alexa was probably calling from her room. Although far away from their parents' room in the sprawling house, she new that Alexa wanted to have this conversation in private, away from her Mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Alexa replied, \"I don't want to wake them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, what's  up with Mom? She is absolutely ravenous right now, and all she said was she 'loosened up.\" Alexa responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, knowing Mom, I kind of assumed she would just go back to her normal self after the week,\" said with slight surprised. \"I don't really fully know what happened. When they got up she seemed flustered from the storm, Dad was fine, but she seemed off for a few days. I had prepared for the worst, since I'm, umm, obviously bigger now, but Mom never said anything. After she met Kyle, she seemed to be a bit more at ease. I think her and Dad were even indulging on room service when Kyle and I were not going to dinner with them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really??\" Alexa asked, surprised, given that their Mom had never been a snacker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't know. Did you go out to eat again?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got Italian, and after a huge meal, <i>Mom</i> was the one who suggested we get dessert.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Yeah, maybe the Mom of old is gone...or at least in a food comma.\" After saying that, Madison heard a slight chuckle out of Alexa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa changed gears on the conversation, \"I guess I'm happy Mom is making this change, but, I don't know. Part of me was hoping that Mom would be the one to instill my willpower again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Madison asked, knowing exactly what her sister meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...I've just been enjoying myself this weekend, and I assumed Mom would me back on a salad run when she got home.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison, feeling it was her job to provide a bit of guidance to her sister, responded, \"I don't know if depriving yourself can be considered will power, Alexa. Plus, you're younger than me, I don't think you'll put on a ton of weight, and even if you did, it's not the end of the world.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa seemed somewhat content with that answer, so Madison left that point alone and moved on, \"Anything else new with you, while we're talking?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...there is one thing,\" Alexa replied, \"I think I'm kind of interested in a guy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is this why you're stressed out about food, Alexa? Because anyone who treats you like this now---\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa quickly cut her sister off \"---No! it's actually the opposite! I think he may actually like it. His name is Bobby. He's not really like the usual guys I date, he seems fine with more food, he's actually a bit on the larger side himself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" Madison said, surprised her formerly vain sister would go for someone like that, \"what do you friends think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not taking it too well. Chrissy keeps shooting daggers at me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, listen, I know it's tough now, but maybe this is a blessing in disguise,\" Madison said, thinking of her own experiences. \"Anyone who only wants to be your friend when you're exactly like they want you to, isn't a very good friend.\" Madison also had slightly sneaky motives in so freely handing out that advice. She had never been a fan of Chrissy, who always had come off a bit entitled and bratty. Alexa's life was fine without that presence in it, her sister thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talked for a bit longer about other more chit-chatty stuff, but as it reached later in the night, the call ended, and Madison went back to her desk to study. Sitting down, she noticed her new rolls, which seemed larger after the weekend. <i>Hmm...I hope that was good advice</i> </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After talking with Alexa into Thursday morning around 1:00 am Madison nearly skipped breakfast in order to make it to her fist class. All she had was a quick energy bar and a large cup of coffee.  In Coral Gables things were in a similar state, Mrs. Kraft apologized to her daughter, \u201cwe seem to be out of everything \u2013 perhaps I should just give you a few dollars for breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm, sure mom,\u201d replied Alexa. She realized she\u2019d used the last of the eggs he day before and there was no cereal or bread. She knew she could grab a double cheeseburger at Wendy\u2019s by 7:30 and still make it school since Wendy\u2019s doesn\u2019t have a separate breakfast menu. But it was unheard of for her mom to suggest such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom seemed aware of Alexa's puzzlement, but her next statement surprised her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know it\u2019s unusual \u2013 but it\u2019s only this time. By tomorrow we\u2019re going to have a different breakfast regimen here, so go ahead and splurge on fast food tis once.  OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a problem, Mom.  A burger in the morning isn\u2019t my usual thing, but I get it,\u201d replied Alexa, thinking of the omelets, quiche, bear claws and corn beef hash menus of the prior week. . \u201cWhat kind of changes are you thinking of?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter Wichita I\u2019m thinking we might have a little variety instead of just raisin bran and fruit.  Maybe some French toast or a breakfast burrito. What do you think of that?\u201d Cynthia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom,\u201d exclaimed Alexa, \u201cyou\u2019re beginning to sound like Aunt Rachel! Do you know that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, not quite. She's into quantity as well as variety, but I think maybe I\u2019ve been overly concerned in some areas.  What is your feeling?\u201d her mom pressed.<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly? I think I\u2019d love it \u2013 but if I begin adding a few pounds please don\u2019t lecture me, OK\u201d Alexa responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom sighed, \u201cSweetheart, we may be adding few together. I won\u2019t\u2019 criticize you if yu don\u2019t get on my case, agreed?  It\u2019s not going to be a great deal, but after this trip I\u2019m going to try changing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa left the house with a $10 bill for breakfast, which she knew she\u2019d only use in part.  She wondered if she should have told her mom about Bobby and their upcoming <br>\r\ndate at Jrs Gourmet Burgers, but decided it was best not to.  She and Bobby did, however enjoy another good sized lunch, during which he commented that after their planned date at Jrs he had something else in mind for another night if she was game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me cook a meal for you at my place. My family will be there, so it\u2019s safe, but I think you\u2019d enjoy it. I usually do a dinner or so a month and would love for you to be a part.,\u201d Bobby said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo cooking as well as dining is another of your hobbies. Are you planning to become a chef,\u201d she remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, our family businesses ae my future, but cooking is something I got into from being a bit of a latchkey kid and it grew into an interest,\u201d Bobby sad. \u201cA lot of this belly came from having bath after school snacks pus a meal later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not that big a belly and I think I\u2019d enjoy seeing you whip something together,\u201d answered Alexa. \u201cI\u2019d do more cooking but my mom tended to discourage it. Never have quire understood why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dProbably afraid I\u2019d develop a preference for high calorie desserts, she thought to herself.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back at Powers, Madison was talking with Kyle about her conversations with Emily and Alexa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know I told dad I wasn\u2019t part of UMILA,\u201d she said.\u201c But the way I\u2019ve talked with Emily and now Alexa plus what I\u2019m doing with Torrid I think I\u2019ve crossed over to their world view. My body\u2019s not getting any smaller and I frankly don\u2019t care.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, intelligent and now I can add free-thinking to the list. Congratulations.  It sounds like you\u2019ve taught your mom some things as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d acknowledged Madison. \u201cAnd dad seems happy about that.  So do you think we should ask Gary and Emily to join us on a double date with something active - maybe bowling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that\u2019s a suggestion from the past if ever I heard ne,\u201d Kyle replied. \u201cBut why not? Since I don\u2019t know Gary why don\u2019t you set it up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDone,\u201d replied Madison.  \u201cI\u2019ll see about Saturday night if we can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day she texted Kyle \u2013 6:30 @ Westacres Bowl \u2013 their sports bar serves pizza\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, in Coral Gables, Alexa arrived home to find a meatloaf cooling on the kitchen counter, baked potatoes in the oven and vegetables boiling on the stove.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, no desert tonight. Full meal cooking is harder than I thought it would be,\u201d her mom remarked. \u201cDo you think perhaps we could work on this new menu business together?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean as in me cooking,\u201d Alexa responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking it might be a good idea, yes,\u201d her mom replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHummm.\u201d Alexa responded thinking quickly. \u201cWould it be alright if I enlisted the help of a friend from school? He fancies himself an amateur chef and already has invited me to his place for dinner some time with his family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d her mom replied in surprise, \u201cYou\u2019re going with a boy?  When did this start?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going steady, just a friend that I\u2019ve studies and shred lunch with a few times,\u201d she relied. \u201cWe have our first formal dare-date Saturday night. I haven\u2019t had chance to tell you and dad, but I\u2019ll be home before 10:00.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat type of person is he,\u201d he mom probed. \u201cThis is all very sudden.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great student, clean living and comes rom a good family \u2013 trust me. You might not think of him as a stud, but he\u2019s very kind and intelligent,\u201d she answered. \u201cIf I invite him to help with the food here you can get to know him, then let me know if he\u2019s as good a cook as he claims. So, is it a go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know,\u201d her mom hesitated. \u201cI\u2019ll need to as your father - what did you say his name was?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlsea rolled her eyes, \u201cBobby, Bobby Wentworth. You ask Dad to check him out. His family supposedly has money but they don\u2019t flaunt it. Now, can I go to my room?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I suppose so,\u201c her mom said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d replied Alexa in a bit of a huff as she left.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After their large meal of meatloaf, Cynthia and Chris lingered in the kitchen while they cleaned up. Half joking, Cynthia asked Chris, \"why did we even get this gourmet kitchen if we never intended to use it all these years?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows,\" Chris laughed, \"home equity?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm thinking about getting into cooking more,\" Cynthia responded, \"Alexa seemed to be open to doing it together, and it seems like a good way for us to get closer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris felt this was a good thing. His wife had always been somewhat distant; loving, but at the same time, somewhat detached, as if her daughters knew that their mother would judge them if things fell out of line-- if they failed to live up to expectations. Over the years, he had tried to curb this, but, until Madison had gone to powers, it seemed to have been futile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That seems like a great idea,\" Chris responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to mind if I leave my diet of kale?\" Cynthia half jokingly said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, afraid you'll get a little fat? Honestly, Cynthia, you know I've never cared about that. I just want all of us to be happy. Look at Madison, she seems happier now than she ever was in high school. She's excelling in class, and she's met someone great.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia, had to admit, even with Madison's growing body, she had seemed to gracefully go from someone who was clearly conventionally attractive to a cute girl that was on the plump side. Perhaps it was good genes, or perhaps it was the confidence that her daughter had. Regardless, hadn't she shown that gaining a bit wasn't the worst thing in the world, especially if it reduced some excess vanity? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day at the store, Cynthia loaded up her cart with culinary items she had always wanted to make, but stayed away from for dietary reasons. Ribs, huge steak, and a variety of ingredients for new deserts. Cynthia figured that she could effortlessly pursue this budding hobby, while still making it to the gym once in a while. Plus, it's Miami, not Kansas, how many pounds could she really put on? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at school, Alex forwent her typical salad and went for a burger. All her life she had been following Madison's lead and sticking to mainly greens. Now that her Mom had opened this door to a whole new line of food, she felt empowered to eat whatever she wished. In the back of her mind, Madison had already drew all the attention away from her. Even at her most shallow, she doubted that a few pounds would go noticed by anyone when her sister had so drastically changed her appearance. She didn't let any of her friends at school know of this paradigm shift, well, besides Bobby, of course, but Alexa figured that anyone who would react negatively wasn't worth her time anyway. As she worked on fries next to her friends at the lunch table, Alexa felt truly content -- and increasingly full. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the talk with her husband, Mrs. Kraft and Alexa began their journey into discovering the kitchen. They went on a cooking and baking rampage, making everything from Italian food to the most decadent and rich desserts. They had a lot of misses towards the beginning, considering neither of them knew what they were doing at first. But they were improving with each dish and now finding some that are becoming their staples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was Saturday, which meant it was a kitchen marathon day. Saturdays were now entirely for cooking, with the Kraft women making breakfast, lunch, and dinner from scratch, something that they can't do when everyone's busy during the week. So at 7:30 AM, two alarms went off and the Kraft women began their day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa sloppily reached out a hand to turn off her alarm and then sat up in her bed. She stretched her arms above her head and looked down when she felt something funny. Her shirt had come up some when she stretched, but when she brought her arms back down her shirt stayed up, like it was caught on something. And when she looked down, it definitely was stuck. She tried to tug it down but it wouldn't completely go down, which struck Alexa as funny. She knew that she had been eating a lot more lately while cooking with her mom and on her dates with Bobby, but she hadn't realized that it had been enough to impact her body this quickly. She stood up and went over to her mirror to survey the damage, and she was a bit shocked to see exactly how much damage there was. The reason her shirt wasn't going down was because she now had a belly. Not a layer of pudge like she'd had coming before, the onslaught of food had given her a proper belly now, beginning to hang over the waistband of her pajama pants, which were starting to get tight around her thighs. Her thighs were getting bigger too, the gap that had been pretty sizable before was almost gone. The rest of her body was fairly untouched, maybe slightly thicker arms and a less angular face, but if you only saw her chest up you'd never know that she had put on any weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa wasn't sure how she felt about this new version of her as she stood and played with her new poundage a little. While she liked the new curves she had gotten with her small gain when her parents went out of town, the fact that the weight wasn't settling in the most visually pleasing way was making Alexa a bit uncomfortable. She decided it was time to hop on the scale and see how much damage she had done to her body, and the number that came up was not one she was expecting. When she last had checked she was almost at 125 pounds, but the number that flashed up at her today was definitely not that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n148. She had managed to put on over 23 pounds in less than a month. That number left her a bit shell-shocked, but it wasn't also the most unexpected one either. \"I mean, it's not like I've been the gold standard of health the past couple months, this was bound to happen at some point,\" she told her reflection in the bathroom mirror. She sighed and went back to her room to get dressed for the day, choosing a pair of jeans and a t-shirt. She started with the jeans, attempting to pull them up over her now thick legs and middle. She was able to (barely) get them on her legs but then couldn't get them buttoned. She even had to suck in her stomach to get the two flaps to meet, but the button simply wouldn't fit. She sat down on her bed with the jeans still stuck on and tight around her waist, her belly filling every inch of the jeans. Even having seen the scale and her gain, she figured she would still have been able to fit into her clothes! But alas, the jeans were simply not meant to be, so she opted for a pair of sweatpants instead. She pulled the t-shirt over her head only to discover that much like her pajama shirt, it didn't completely cover her stomach either, and it was one of her largest shirts. So she simply gave up and left it on to go help her mom with breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, sweetie! I thought we'd give French toast another go today,\" her mom said cheerfully to her daughter. Mrs. Kraft had already begun cooking before Alexa had come down, today with some help from her dad, and it was apparent that their cooking endeavors hadn't just left their mark on Alexa. The apron pulled tied tightly around Mrs. Kraft's waist left an indent in her back from the back fat and muffin top the eldest Kraft woman had been developing over the past few weeks. However, unlike Alexa, most of her weight settled in an hourglass instead of an apple shape, meaning her clothes were straining her chest and hips more than ever before, giving her more of the middle aged mother look she had managed to avoid for so long, even rounding her face out some. And her dad wasn't exempt from the effects either. While he may not have sampled as much during the process of making the food, he certainly ate his fair share when it was presented to him, and considering how calorie laden it was it's no wonder he had developed the body of a middle aged man who had definitely overindulged. His face looked strikingly different from the slender one he once had, his cheeks always looking like there's something in them and a double chin that was now always attached to his face that seemed to be growing more steadily every day. His whole upper body quite frankly looked like someone had inflated it, with his stomach being perfectly rounded out and firm at all times, like an oversized beer gut framed with small moobs that showed through the t shirt he was currently wearing (that as another note, barely covered his belly button). He was standing at the stove to monitor the pan, but he kept having to readjust the knob on the stove since his gut kept pushing it to a different setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you're here, Alexa! Can you monitor the stove for me? I think I keep messing with the dial, but I don't mean to.\" Alexa chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I will, but do you think it maybe had to do with the basketball-sized stomach you have now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexa, don't talk to your father that way!\" Mrs. Kraft chided. \"Plus, it's not like you have any room to talk young lady, your shirt isn't covering your stomach either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, mom, I know. Speaking of that, instead of cooking lunch today can we go to the mall? I think I need some new clothes, with exhibit A being the reason why,\" she asked as she gestured down to her exposed midsection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, honey, we can go. In fact, I think we all probably should because as great as all of the cooking is, the 25 pounds it's added to my already 10 pound gain from earlier in the year has not been forgiving to my clothes,\" her dad said sheepishly. Mrs. Kraft rolled her eyes as she continued to chop the fruit for the homemade mixed berry sauce she was making to go with the French toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By all means go buy new clothes, but if you two would just do like me and exercise once in a while you may not be in the situation you are,\" she retorted. But she was really in denial of her gain, having also checked the scale this morning and seen that 20 additional pounds had settled on her body despite her best efforts to keep her gain minimal, although she could still tout it as being less than her children and husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the family sat down to enjoy their breakfast when suddenly there was a loud POP! Alexa checked to make sure it wasn't her only to hear a cry from her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can't be! These are my favorite jeans!\" Mrs. Kraft cried. Everyone saw what the problem was: she had popped the button on her favorite jeans clean off, with her stomach now surging forward to fill the gap. The table suddenly got very quiet, no one sure what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what time should we leave for the mall?\" Mr. Kraft asked, with everyone finally agreeing that they all needed a wardrobe upgrade.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison was waiting a baggage claim for her suitcase, beginning to get impatient for a couple reasons. A) her bag still wasn't there despite waiting for nearly 20 minutes and B) her family was nowhere to be found, and they promised her they would pick her up! So here she was, standing and waiting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after half an hour of waiting one of the two things she was waiting on came, and it was safe to say it was larger than she remembered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison!\" she heard her dad call out from behind. She turned around expecting to see the same svelte family she had seen a couple months before in Kansas but the three people standing in front of her were far from that. Gone were the fit, skinny Krafts of the past. As they came closer to the baggage claim, Madison could see even more clearly how the Powers mindset had impacted them once they returned to Miami. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the front was her mom. The woman who once had been borderline fatphobic now carried around a lot more heft. Her chest was nearly double the size it used to be, probably close to a DD. Her hips jutted out further than ever before, with thick love handles and a muffin top spilling over the waistband of her jeans. Her stomach, while not her most prominent feature, was solidly in chubby territory, pushing out from her body but not as far as her breasts. <i>She has to have put on at least 50 pounds</i>, Madison thought, still shocked by the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen was her dad. While he had never been particularly thin, he always had at least appeared in shape. Now it looked as if he had a small beach ball where his stomach should be, it was so round and perky that it practically floated out from his body is stuck out so far. Gone was his neck, now surrounded by an incredibly thick double chin and round red cheeks. His legs were thicker, needing something to help balance the large ball of a belly he carried.<i> And he's probably put on just as much as mom</i>, Madison thought. But the real kicker was Alexa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer younger sister resembled Madison now more than ever. Much like Madison, her weight was concentrated in her stomach and legs. Her weight had settled in more of a flabby way around her waist than the rest of her family, meaning there was no way to disguise her added poundage. There wasn't really shape it it, it just kinda hung off her, making her look bigger than she actually is. Her legs had taken the brunt of her weight, leaving her with a slight waddle when she walked since her thighs had become tree trunks. Her face was slightly rounder, with the beginnings of a double chin appearing, and her chest had grown a little bit but was still small in comparison to the rest of her body. My god, she's blown up, thought Madison, standing and pretending to be prepared to embrace her now larger family as they came up to her for hugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, everyone,\" said Madison as she began awkwardly hugging her family. \"I'm still waiting for my luggage and then we can go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, we'll wait here for it. Alexa, you and your sister go get the car and bring it here so once the suitcase is here we can just pull away and go finish getting dinner ready at home,\" said Mrs. Kraft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good!\" said Alexa and she and Madison walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happened to all of you?\" Madison asked Alexa. Alexa shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, after mom and dad visited you they decided to have us learn to cook a bunch of stuff and... well... here were are,\" she huffed. They reached the elevator for the parking lot and stepped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But all of you have put on a ton of weight!\" Madison exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"65 pounds to be exact, I'm now at 190 pounds,\" she told Madison. \"Mom's been in denial a bit but I think she's around 175. Dad, I mean, he's easily put on 60 pounds too, I think he's about 230 now. And what about you, when was the last time you saw your feet?\" Madison looked down and realized that her feet had long been obstructed by her stomach, a fact that she still found weird, but now even seeing anything beyond her bulbous belly was becoming a feat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I passed that point around the time mom and dad came to visit, I think I'm now around 235. But I haven't checked in a while, I was afraid of what I'd have to tell mom... not like that's a problem anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we don't care about weight anymore around here,\" Alexis told Madison as they stepped off the elevator and began the walk to their car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I guess I have to ask how you feel about it all? I mean, even though I like how it feels on me now but it took me a while to get there. You guys... I mean, You've put on almost as much as I did in 6 months in only 4 months,\" Madison said to Alexa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be honest, I didn't like it at first. Especially with how the weight fell on my body, it always felt awkward. But I liked eating what we cooked too much, so I just gave in and here we are,\" Alexa responded, shaking her belly as emphasis. Even though she was standing still at this point, her stomach was so flabby it kept quivering for a few seconds even after she let it go. They were finally at their car and Alexa got into the front seat and Madison in shotgun. As she buckled her seat belt, she had trouble getting it to stretch around her rounded gut, having to split it so the seat belt went under the bottom of it and over the rest, with her stomach now taking up even more of her lap than she ever remembered. Alexa grunted while trying to get the seat belt to click, hers wass tretched just enough that it eventually wnet in but it dug deeply into her belly and left it squishing out of it in every possible direction. She hadn't been in her family car in quite a while, and it was a small enough car she couldn't help but look around and wonder how on earth all of them were going to fit in there in their larger states together. </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Dinner's ready!\" Mrs. Kraft yelled throughout the house. She set down the final dish on the kitchen table and waited for the rest of her family to make their way down to the kitchen. She sat and waited for quite a while, which nowadays wasn't unusual for her family- or herself as much as she hates to admit it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Madison home, the food had been flowing through the house even more since there was constantly someone in the house now, and it showed on everyone's waistlines. Mrs. Kraft sitting at the table noticed how she felt like she was sitting closer to the table than she used to, and it was because she was: her behind and hips had taken so much of her weight that she was sitting further up in her chair, being pushed forward by her extra cushioning. On top of that, her chest was now so large that it was extending closer to the table than ever before, even sagging occasionally onto the table. But this was nothing compared to the rest of her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Madison was the largest of her family when she returned home, she was the best adjusted to carrying her weight around even as she accumulated new pounds. She was the first of the family around the house to arrive at the table that night, but she had some trouble sitting in her chair. Between her backside being a large bubble but now and her stomach needing a lot of space to sit, there simply wasn't enough room in the chair for Madison (not that it stopped her from sitting in it though). And just in the 2 weeks she had been home, that space had shrunk even more with the additional 10 pounds she had gained from her family's constant food flow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to arrive in the kitchen was Mr. Kraft, or rather was Mr. Kraft's stomach. It was so prominent that it arrived in a room a couple seconds before he did, and considering it's roundness at 44 inches that was not a shock to anyone. His face was ever getting rounder, with him basically not even having a neck anymore, the swaddle of fat under his chin dominated what would have been his neck. His indulgence during his oldest daughter's vacation sent him up an additional 10 pounds and, when he sat at the table, making his ability to reach his food a struggle since his stomach pushed him out from the table even when it rested right at the brim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't start without me and Bobby!\" called Alexa, making the two of them the last ones to join the table at the meal where the family would all finally be meeting Bobby for the first time. It took her the longest because of her now prominent waddle, her thighs had finally spread enough that there's no way she could properly walk. Bobby came ahead of her, his weight even having gone up being around Alexa who was always wanting to eat now. He had a larger paunch and a much thicker butt, both of which were going from chubby territory into overweight, his whole body really becoming more round with the 35 pounds he had put on when he started dating Alexa 2 months ago. He pulled out Alexa's chair so she could sit right down when she arrived at the table, and after a couple minutes she was finally there, making a loud thud as she plopped into her chair which, much like the rest of her family, she was getting too big for. While her stomach had been flabby before, it was now starting to puff out more and rise like a ball of dough instead of just hanging. Her face looked incredibly cherubic, with 2 chubby cheeks and a double chin that was growing more prominent every week. Between snaking with her family and her dates with Bobby, she had managed to add another 20 pounds in the two weeks Madison had been home, bringing her over the 200 pound mark easily and catching up to Madison swiftly, meaning she was officially fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that we're all here, how about we enjoy the pot roast I made tonight?\" Said Mrs. Kraft. A chorus of yum, mhmm, and yes, came from the table, all eager to dig in. They started passing the food around to each other, with each person having a different struggle reaching it based on their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can someone put some on my plate for me please? I can't seem to reach it,\" Mr. Kraft asked, unable to reach the serving dish due to his beach ball of a gut in the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, can someone do that for me too? I'm kinda wedged in here,\" said Alexa, her thighs and overflowing stomach trapping her in her chair a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" said Bobby, who despite not being a small guy was probably the thinnest person at the table. \"How about I just serve all of you instead of making you get up? It'll be much easier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're our guest!\" said Mrs. Kraft. \"We can figure it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem, really,\" said Bobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well to that I say Alexa, you've found a keeper!\" her dad cheered. Alexa smiled and the compliment, her eyes now starting to quint whenever she had a large grin. Everyone finally got served and enjoyed a pleasant meal and conversation. When it was all said and done, it was nearly impossible for anyone to move from their chairs all of them were so full. But it was time for Bobby to leave, so they helped pull Alexa out of her chair and all went to the door to see Bobby off. When he was finally gone, Mrs. Kraft turned to her family and said \"Either we all need to lose some weight or we need to buy new kitchen chairs. We are all simply too big now for this.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison felt she understood where Kyle was coming rom \u2013 he\u2019d just followed Ralph and Beth\u2019s lead. But what about Beth? How had she gotten involved with the grant program, and why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to talk with Beth directly \u2013 asking her to join Madison for lunch in the Power\u2019s dining l. Beth readily accepted, and over a lunch of lasagna and salad the two co-eds addressed Madison\u2019s concerns as Beth related her tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth told Madison that she knew her life was changing and moving in a new direction soon after the end of the summer of her junior year in high school. This was even before her parents wrangled a scholarship for her to come to Powers. Beth was part of a family where her parents and siblings were all larger, and no one cared. Beth ate just as heartily as any of them, but never matched their size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one in the family made a big deal about this. Everyone, including Beth, realized that she was probably the most physically active person in the family \u2013 walking three miles round trip to school most days, being part of the volleyball and swim teams, and working out regularly. She commonly had a hearty 1000+ calorie breakfast of pancakes, French toast or a burrito along with a pizza or burger with fries and soda for lunch, all worth another 1000 calories. Then came family style super in the evening, usually with dessert. With all this, regularly around 3000 calories a day, her weight stayed a svelte 120 or so on her 5\u2019 7\u201d frame \u2013 until the beginning of her senior year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when things began to change for Beth. On her 18th birthday her parents presented her with keys to her own car \u2013 a recognition of her excellent grades. This eliminated her daily three mile walk while getting her home earlier, The latter frequently meant a snack to tide her over until supper here hours later. That same year both a scheduling conflict and being elected to the student council caused her to drop off the swim team and cut back on her workouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe results were subtle but predictable. Formerly svelte Beth began to have a more rounded midriff and fuller thighs, but didn\u2019t really notice the change until some of her size 4 clothes began to feel snug. She knew herself to have been borderline underweight and that her classmates were wearing size 6 and 8 clothes so her new growth didn\u2019t bother her much. Neither did it disturb her mom - who made sure to take advantage of the after-holiday sales to give Beth a wardrobe of size 6 and 8 clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Beth continued to serve on the student council, along the way each week enjoying 2-3 of the donuts and other pastries which were readily available. With wheels of her own she also partied more \u2013 and never turned down a date when food was involved. Evening snacks while studying become frequent as well. Caloric intake soared some days to 4000. By May she was able to fit comfortably into a size 8 prom dress, but her weight was 145 \u2013 a gain of 25 pounds in one school year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately none of this particularly distressed Beth. Her family was larger, she was maturing and getting less exercise; the fact that she\u2019d gained 2 dress sizes didn\u2019t bother her. Privately she wondered why her body hadn\u2019t done this before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to experiment with dieting. In her high school nutrition class she had learned that a hyperglycemic index breakfast of 265 calories of whole grains and protein combined with exercise and no more than 1200 more calories the rest of the day should produce weight loss. For two weeks she tried it, then abruptly decided \u201cOK, this isn\u2019t for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to her mom, a pleasant 230 pound fulltime homebodyand said, \u201cOK, your right \u2013 I belong in Powers.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom, a Powers graduate and member of UMILA, smiled.  Beth\u2019s sister Helen had graduated the year before and was now both employed and engaged. She was happy to help facilitate the grant.  When her parents saw her off to school she had a rather loose fitting size 10 wardrobe in her suitcases,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEgg whites and quinoa aren\u2019t what she\u2019ll find at Powers,\u201d Beth\u2019s mom observed,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope,\u201d acknowledged her dad with a smile, giving his wife a loving squeeze.  \u201cBeth will blossom into the double digits \u2013 and hopefully be just as beautiful and happy with herself as you are,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth did not disappoint \u2013 and by the next holiday season had added nearly another 20 pounds as well as getting to know Ralph. This was sufficient to became recipient of a UMILA grant, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily this transformation Beth took in stride. Her thighs continued to fill in, her belly grew softer and her derriere larger. When seated her belly roll formed a muffin top over her waistband. Her breasts were full and her arms acquired a fresh roundness as did her chin and cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth shared all of this, concluding to Madison, \u201cI\u2019m a BBW by heredity and content in my role. I have Ralph, Mom has Dad, my sister has Bob and we\u2019re all in good health. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re acting as if there was an inner fat girl palying athlete in high school,\u201d observed Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing that systematic,\u201d answered Beth. \u201cTo be skinny for someone like me is like  living the life of an ascetic. I tried t and decided I\u2019m just happier living in the fat lane. And that\u2019s OK just as those who want to live on lentils can if they wish. Fortunately there are people like Kyle and Ralph.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d agreed Madison, \u201cthankfully there are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was now more at ease over what was happening. Beth and Ralph obviously were just friends trying to help. But Madison knew that the next day she and Kyle would be picking up the bike \u2013 and then what? Would her parents be as accepting of her as those of Cassi and Beth? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Besides, it's not like she was fat yet, she reasoned with herself. She was almost flawless to being with, so even if she lost just ten pounds, she would still look great, and then she could go from there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the week, Madison kept to eating healthy and trying to avoid bad foods. Whenever she was in the cafeteria, she steered clear of the pizza and bad foods, and went straight for soup and salads. It was how she used to eat when she was healthy, and she knew that if she was ever going to regain the previous life style that she craved, she had to start with going back to her old diet. Madison even made it to the gym a few times, a relatively unfun experience, as she no longer commanded the room with her looks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a week of doing this Madison was hopeful that she could finally turn things around.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison worked out for the rest of the week and tried to eat healthy, knowing that she needed to if she had any shot of reversing the gain that had taken place during the first portion of the semester. Usually, this would not have been that hard for Madison, but she had gotten used to the amazing food at Cassi's parent's house and kind of wanted to gorge on tasty cafeteria food that she used to find greasy and unappealing. However, Madison kept her convictions, and wanted to make sure that she dropped some weight. She had a goal, by Christmas time, she wanted to lose 10 pounds so that members of her family would not completely notice that she had pigged out during the first semester, she couldn't imagine what her Mom would say, oh and her slim and perfect sister, Alexa. She knew she needed to avoid this, so she pushed herself hard during workout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a week of her unfun diet and 5 workouts, Madison hopped on the scale. She wanted to lose 3 pounds, because she knew that losing weight was hard, even if she never had any experience in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scale calculated for a second and then the digital reading came out, 155.2. ''WHAT?'' Madison was shocked. She had gained three pounds during the week where she was trying to diet. Madison stared at her body for a second. She looked at her soft belly, and realized that it hadn't really receded at all. Madison didn't fully realize it, but her great metabolism had slowed down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few weeks, Madison found it hard to keep up with her diet, and she started slacking off. Each time she would tell herself, ''ok, just this once,'' but it never was. She often would eat a fattening meal that tasted good, but then told herself she would make up for it tomorrow, and then duplicate the process each day. Her days were filled with a predictable, but often horrid diet. She would wake up and eat a pastry from the cafeteria for breakfast, and then maybe grab a granola bar on the run. Next, after her morning classes, she would eat a slice of pizza, or a burger for lunch, then a mid-day snack, such as a bag of potato chips, and finally a huge dinner at the cafeteria. Her friends on the floor, notably Kelly, were aware of the increased food intake, and wanted to say something to Madison. She noticed that the belly on her friend often was pushing out against her shirts, and was becoming rather noticeable, and when she walked, her butt also looked bigger, and if it was still shorts season, she was sure her legs would be noticeably softer. However, Kelly hadn't seen Madison in the gym for a while, so there was no way for her to verify that last part.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Madison sucked it up and gotten on the scale, she would have realized that she was up to 163 pounds, however, she was avoiding the scale. She knew it would expose to her the consequences of her decision to stop working out to make Cassi feel better. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Still feeling depressed about her recent gains, Madison spent most of the week indoors, which only led to her eating more and more, often without even realizing it. It wasn't until the weekend that Cassi made an attempt to cheer her up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we haven't been out for a while, and Kelly's friend Kyle is throwing a party later,\" Cassi said as she sat beside Madison on the couch. \"What do you say we go? It's been ages since I saw you party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison wasn't sure. She had loved her carefree, party animal lifestyle back when she started college, but that had been when she still had her smoking hot body. She didn't really want to squeeze into a dress and show everyone how big she had gotten. \"Eh...I don't know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come onnnnnnnnnnn,\" Cassi urged. \"I'm not going if you're not going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison looked over at her friend; Cassi was twice her size, and though her weight gain had slowed down lately, she still maintained her constant eating and lack of exercise. If Cassi wasn't afraid to show herself at the party, then maybe she had nothing to fear? Hell, if she stood next to Cassi all night, maybe nobody would even notice. \"Okay, I guess,\" Madison shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night presented a problem, as Madison realized that everything she owned that wasn't sweats was now rather tight. The skin tight jeans that had once showed off her shapely legs now refused to move past her thighs, despite her struggling and groaning for nearly an hour. She had finally managed to force herself into her loosest pair, only to find she couldn't button them up because of her bulging belly, which, despite her best efforts, she could not suck in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkirts were equally troublesome, as whenever she managed to get them on, they created a prominent muffin top and caused her excess belly fat to bulge in all directions. She ripped them off in disgust, one by one, until there was nothing left. Exhausted, she turned to face her reflection in the mirror; even her underwear looked too small these days. There was only one option left. Not bothering to put anything on over her bra and panties, she walked to Cassi's room. \"Cassi...do you have any old jeans I could borrow?\" She asked, pushing open the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi was wearing some new jeans that fit her big butt nicely, and a button up shirt that allowed her gut some room to breathe. She looked at Madison curiously for a moment, before gesturing to the wardrobe. \"Sure...in the bottom draw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison silent crossed the room and rummaged through the draw, which was full of Cassi's old clothes. She selected a pair of jeans Cassi had bought during the first few months of her weight gain, which she suspected would fit her nicely. After hurrying back to her own room, she slipped into the jeans and buttoned them up; they fit quite nicely. She grabbed a loose, button up shirt, but it didn't quite cover her new belly bulge. She wished she had gone shopping for new stuff sooner...she hadn't realized quite how small a lot of her outfits were now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and Cassi left for the party soon after, and were quickly welcome in by Kyle. The house was full to bursting, and Madison was grateful that she could lose herself in the crowd. There were a lot of cute guys here, and she began to feel a bit more optimistic about the evening. Maybe scoring with a guy would help restore her confidence...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison and Cassi split up, mingled and drank. Madison ended up talking to Kyle, the host, who possessed a body that was near perfection. She tried to hide her bulging stomach by sucking in as often as she could, but every so often, his eyes would drift down to her middle, or too her larger breasts, or butt...she wasn't sure if he was checking her out or noticing her weight gain, but she hoped it was the former. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...would you maybe want to get a drink some time?\" Madison asked him after some time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...you know...I really just want to work on my studies this season,\" Kyle said awkwardly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, that's cool,\" Madison smiled. At least she had tried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the party started to wind down. Madison hadn't drunk as much as some of the other girls, and when she met up with Cassi, her friend had clearly chugged a whole load of beer, because the buttons on her shirt were almost bursting off. Madison's stomach had bloated a little as well, but she tried to ease off on the booze as best she could. As she and Cassi, she spotted Kyle talking to a slender, attractive blonde girl...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, would you maybe want to go out some time?\" The blonde was saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, how's Thursday sound?\" Kyle grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison stormed out ahead of Cassi, furious. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>During the next few weeks, Madison found herself feeling completely hopeless over her recent gain. She remembered back a few months ago, when she told Cassi that she would skip the gym, as a way to make her feel better. That plan had completely failed in her overall goal of easing Cassi into weight loss. Instead, Cassi seemed fine with her figured, and Madison felt the effects of a lifestyle similar to Cassi's. After the rejection by Kyle, Madison reflected on the initial event that caused Cassi to be so angry a few months ago, being rejected by a guy because of her weight. Now, Madison realized, she was in the same boat as Cassi, guys saw her as a chubby girl, not the elite hottie that she was going into the year. This made Madison increasingly depressed, by her own action, she relegated herself down a level, she also feared further gain, for she knew if she became fat, she would be something of a joke among her peers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison knew that she wanted to rush a sorority at the start of the next semester, but she wondered where she would land now that she had killed her figure. Like and social society in high school or college, there was a hierarchy of levels, and Madison feared rushing and ending up with a ton of fat girls who pretended they didn't care, but envied the exclusive sororities that partied with all the hot guys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne would think that all of this introspection would cause Madison to workout and eat right, but instead it was having the opposite effect. Madison wasn't resigned to her fate yet, she still thought that she would lose the weight, but in almost a delusional manner, she was eating more, and her workouts had slowed to a halt. Even though after getting back from Kansas with Cassi, she told herself she needed to workout, she didn't like going to the gym and seeing all the workout queens that made her insecure about her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi wasn't helping the matter. She kept bringing back tasty food, and Madison, with her reduced willpower would eat it. Madison's palate had expanded to fully include food that she would never eat before. If she and her friends would go out to dinner, she no longer considered doing only healthy options, and she continued the previously mentioned trend of thinking, \"just this once,\" but always consuming unhealthy options and pushing off an actually disciplined diet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kyle rejection had further reaching implications in her psyche. She was losing confidence as her waste line expanded. She used to be a pro at flirting and getting guys to do what she wanted. Now that she knew some guys were not into her, she became insecure, and didn't want to make a fool of herself. Thus, she became almost timid when talking to certain guys, especially those who she thought were attractive. This insecurity made her even less attractive to the guys she used to clean up on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout these weeks, Madison noticed that she felt fuller when sitting down. Every day it seemed like her belly stuck out a bit further, her boobs were a bit less perky, and she wondered if her arms were less toned. The thing she noticed the most, however, was that her legs seemed to expand more when she sat down. When she studied, she often wore short athletic shorts. When the semester started, they were really loose, and the comfort was why she slipped into them whenever she was vegging around. Now, her legs filled up the entire opening in her shorts when she sat down. Madison would get annoyed when she noticed how soft and fleshy her thighs had become, and she knew that if she didn't cut the gain, she would get some serious thunder thighs. She also noticed she was filling up more of the rear of those shorts, with her expanding behind. She often caught herself having to pull her panties out of her expanding butt, which no longer bore any resemblance to the firm butt she used to prance around in a bikini with on the beaches of Miami. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison finally weighed herself...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One week later, Madison finally plucked up the courage to weigh herself again. It had been another week of her new routine; eat, go to class, eat, study, eat, sleep. She wasn't sure how much she had gained since her last trip to the scales, but she knew she hadn't lost anything. She had been squeezing into old outfits the whole week, and every time she sat at a desk in class, her stomach seemed to be on the verge of busting her pants. Nervously, she stripped to her underwear (which was becoming increasingly tight) and stepped onto the scale. The dial swung upwards, hesitated, then settled onto another shocking number; 175 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison stepped back off the scale and hurried to the mirror. Somehow, she had gained over ten pounds since returning from Kansas; had she really been eating that much?! She sighed as she faced her reflection, hardly recognizing herself. She had avoided looking at herself in the mirror when she wasn't dressed because she was worried what she might see. Her stomach had gotten even bigger since the last time she checked, and much as she hated to admit, she was officially sporting a pot belly now. She rubbed her hands over her bulging middle, wondering when it had gotten so big. She had been concerned that she was losing some of the perkiness of her breasts, but she saw now that her perkiness had been replaced with a larger cup size; her boobs had grown significantly larger lately...which actually wasn't entirely unwelcome. She had always wanted to be a little bustier. Her butt continued to widen, threatening to swallow her underwear, and her thicker thighs now rubbed together almost constantly. What remained of her hot body was now gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison walked out of the bathroom, just as Cassi was leaving the bedroom, dressed in her pajama bottoms and a bra. Madison couldn't find the strength to be embarrassed, she just smiled and walked past her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Cassi asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Madison sighed. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been really down lately,\" Cassi said, absent mindedly rubbing her big belly. \"I wasn't going to say anything but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because I'm fat, Cassi,\" Madison sighed, saying it out loud for the first time. \"I'm getting fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi hesitated for a moment. \"You're not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison patted her pot belly for emphasis. \"I'm getting bigger all the time,\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Cassi shrugged, patting her own gut. \"You're not the only one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you ever...think about trying to lose the weight?\" Madison asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes...I guess...\" Cassi replied. \"But, honestly, I don't mind it anymore. I'm comfortable like this. I know it's probably not the same for you; you had this amazing, model body...but I think I actually like my curves now. I haven't gained much lately, so I guess I've kind of hit a wall now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison wished she could share her friend's optimism. If Cassi was happy weighing over two hundred pounds, why couldn't Madison stop freaking out and trying to avoid even looking at herself?</span></div></div>",

Madison was so concerned about her appearance that she was taking the loss of her perfect body really hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison, it's not your fault, maybe you are just growing into your body type.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Madison said with some irritation, \"it isn't. My sister is a rail, my Mom has a perfect bod, and my Dad still runs half marathons. Oh my god. I'm going to be the black sheep.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison thought for a second about family photos in the future, where her family would look all perfect, as they usually do, and she would be in there, all awkward and fat. She hadn't really let her family even know about her gain, since she was at Cassi's over fall break, and she dreaded going home for Thanksgiving.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Madison, you're not the first person this has happened to, don't be so hard on yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi was partly referring to herself. The blonde thought about how nice Madison had been to her when she started gaining weight, and she wished there was some way to reciprocate the favor. Because of the support that Madison had given her, she had been able accept that it wasn't the end of the world. Of course, her and Madison were different people with different personalities, and Madison would always have a harder time accepting this kind of thing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't seem so alright with your gain when Chris said he wasn't into you--remember that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat stung Cassi pretty bad. She had been trying to forget about that, and to an extent, Madison's time away from the gym helped her. She stopped focusing on stuff like that, and became much more self confident, putting her gain behind her, and realizing people who she really wanted to be friends with wouldn't mind her gain. Madison's comment reversed some of that, she immediately felt the pain of knowing that she had a body that now fell outside of what society considered ideal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F off...I was just trying to make you feel better.\" With that, Cassi went into the bedroom and closed the door. Madison realized that she had hit a nerve, she didn't intend to hurt Cassi's feelings, but she was distressed by the current situation that she was in. \"Ugh, I can do nothing right,\" Madison thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm fine with my body now, but not everyone would be. Maybe if I cut down on my eating it'll help you to lose some of that weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think?\" Madison asked. \"I don't want you to starve on my account.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we could order less takeout from now on for a start?\" Cassi suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan,\" Madison smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and...friendly advice...don't get mad at me or anything...but I think you might need some new clothes,\" Cassi said. \"You look ready to burst out of that shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison looked down at her bulging stomach and the pressure it was placing on her shirt buttons. \"Maybe you're right...want to go shopping with me later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Cassi said. \"When I started putting on weight, I was popping buttons all over the place.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After class that day, Madison and Cassi went shopping. This was a major psychological boundary that Madison had just passed. If she got new clothes, she reasoned, she would have less incentive to lose some of the weight. Madison was still wearing the very tight shirt and pants that she had put on in the morning, and after lunch, they looked ready to burst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mall near the University was still about a 10 minute drive away, given Powers' close proximity to downtown. They jumped into Cassi's car and drove over. On the ride over, Cassi noted that Madison's pot belly looked even more prominent while sitting down, and she was kind of surprised that her shirt was still able to take it. Madison also had some love handles that were sticking out of the back of the shirt. The flesh was still tan, but a lot more pale than when Madison had first arrived from South Florida. While they were driving, they chatted,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you want to come back to Kansas for Thanksgiving?\" asked Cassi. It was still about a month away, but she figured that she would offer it out early. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think I have to go home to my family, my extended family usually gets together somewhere for that, so my parents will be flying me back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do they know about your weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm....probably not. Should I say something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi didn't really know what to say about that one, she hadn't even met Madison's parents, but she did not imagine they would be thrilled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey rolled into the parking lot of the mall. It was a typical suburban mall, and Cassi and Madison had never been there before. When Cassi needed new clothes, she just went to the department store near campus, however, Madison had her Dad's \"emergency\" credit card that she could use for these kinds of things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison spotted a store that she usually liked to go to, and that they had back home in Florida. Obviously the boutiques that she was used to in Miami were not going to be in this Midwestern city, but she figured she could live with some national chains that she knew were not horrid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first store that they went to was present in a lot of malls and stand alone locations across the country. It had been influencing fashion since the mid 90s, and was still widely respected today. Madison often read about it in some of the fashion magazines that she subscribed to. As she walked in, she feared that they would not have anything that fit her. She knew that Cassi was out of luck. Madison made eye contact with a salesgirl as they walked in. The employee was tiny. Maybe 5'4 130, a body that Madison used to trump but now wished she had. The girl was wearing the store's trendy clothes. Tight colored chinos with a nice shirt, a fitted blazer with rolled up sleeves, and some designer \"hipster\" frames. She eyed Cassi and Madison knew that she was getting ready to inform her that they had nothing that fit her here. Madison hoped that she wouldn't do that unless approached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Madison got to the part of the store with pants, she picked out some jeans and chinos. Mainly size 10 and 12s, but she had no idea if they would fit. Cassi quickly realized that nothing in the store was going to do her any good, so she played with her phone on a bench outside. Madison was a bit sad she did this to her friend, but it wasn't really Cassi's style to begin with, even when she was tiny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison approached the salesgirl, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, can I try these on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. And if those don't fit, we may be able to find some other stuff online that we can ship to the store!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison knew she was being polite and helpful, but she was so embarrassed. A couple of guys who were also in the store snickered at that. Madison got into the dressing room, and</span></div></div>",

The size 12s were also challenging, but she was able to close them. Madison also tried on some shirts that she bought. While she used to buy clothes that showed off her hot body, she now had a distinct shift to buying clothes which tried to conceal herself without looking frumpy. As Madison took off the size 12s, she noticed how soft her legs looked, and how the space between them had closed. She put back on her original clothes she came in, and walked back out to the cashier. On her way over, Madison noticed how tight her shirt sleeves were, as her softer arms pressed against shirt sleeves that used to be loose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to buy these two,\" Madison said, pointing to the size 12s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, I'll ring those larger two up for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison wondered if the girl put emphasis on the \"larger two\" on purpose, or if it had just come out like that, either way, Madison wasn't thrilled with the phrasing. Madison put out the \"emergency\" credit card, and bought the two items quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison met Cassi outside of the store, where she had bought a smoothie, which looked tasty, so Madison went over to the smoothie stand and got one as well. Despite the perception that she was getting something healthy, the size of the drink, combined with all the sugary ingredients, actually made it quite unhealthy, around the ballpark of 700 calories. The usually observant Madison was oblivious to this, and sucked the drink down. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After they had gulped down their smoothies, the girls made their way to the food court to grab some dinner. A huge banner hung over the entrance, which read <i>\"All you can eat buffet! One day only!\"</i> Madison eyed the banner with some anxiety as they walked inside and were shown to a seat. She promised herself she would not overdo it today. Madison and Cassi grabbed a plate and went up to the buffet table, where Cassi quickly preceded to pile her plate high with one of everything until food was almost falling off the mountainous pile she had constructed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All you can eat, right?\" Cassi shrugged, taking a large bite out of some BBQ ribs as she went to sit back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison tried to eat more conservatively, trying to choose healthy options...but the buffet seemed to be mainly composed of fattening, greasy food. She tried to load her plate up with salad, but it didn't really look appealing at all. When she got back to the table, Cassi was tearing into her plate full of ribs, fries, pasta and pizza - which towered above Madison's. Madison tucked into her own food, but found that she had completely lost her taste for salad; she used to eat one every day as part of her healthy diet, but now she found them totally bland and tasteless. She ended up pushing most of the greenery to the side of the plate and eating the few pieces of meat she had gathered. Finally, she decided she needed something different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back in a second...\" Madison told Cassi, before heading back to the buffet table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Madison scraped the leftover salad into the trash and began to load up her plate with pizza, pasta, chicken wings and fries. When she returned, her plate was looking more like Cassi's, who was almost finished. Madison began to eat again, and enjoyed her second selection a lot more than her first. Cassi went back for seconds, returning with another huge plate full of greasy, calorie filled food. She also brought over two large glasses of Pepsi for them to drink, which Madison hurriedly slurped down. With each bite, Madison's stomach swelled a little larger. Her clothes, already skin tight, grew more constricting, especially her jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Cassi had returned for her third helping, Madison had cleared her plate. With a groan, she looked over to where Cassi stood, and decided she could go for a little more of that pasta. Slowly, she rose from her chair, her jeans uncomfortably tight. Her button up shirt was under considerable strain, and if she had been paying more attention to her bloated stomach, she would have seen that her bottom button has come undone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't stop eating this stuff,\" Cassi said when she saw Madison appear at the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want a little more...\" Madison mumbled, knowing this absolutely had to be her last helping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter loading up their plates once again, the girls returned to their seats, giving a groan as they sat down. Madison chowed down on her mountain of pasta, stuffing forkful after forkful into her mouth. It was pretty dam good, though she could tell she was gradually nearing the point of fullness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>POP!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was startled by a loud noise from beneath the table, which she quickly realized was her pants. Dropping her fork in horror, she looked down and saw that, not only she was horrendously bloated, the top button of her jeans had burst open, and her zipper had been forced down, exposing her the top of her panties. Flushing red with embarrassment, Madison fumbled at the button, but found it near impossible to get it done up. \"We have to go,\" she whispered to Cassi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why?\" Cassi asked, wiping pizza sauce from her mouth. \"You haven't finished yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just bust my pants, okay?!\" Madison said quietly. \"I don't want anyone to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh...\" Cassi said. \"You hurry and go, change into your new pants in the bathroom. I'll pay our bill here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison nodded and grabbed her shopping bags, but as she stood up, her bloated belly placed considerably pressure on her shirt's buttons. Before Madison could react, a quick succession of pops came from her shirt, and her buttons burst open one by one until her boobs exploded free, barely constrained by her undersized bra. The other customers were staring at her in a mixture of shock and disgust, and she scrambled to cover herself up, holding her shopping bags up in front of her ruined clothes. Without another word, she ran from the food court until she reached a bathroom and locked herself inside one of the stalls. She placed her bags on the floor and slumped onto the toilet seat, her bloated belly in her lap, her shirt hanging wide open. She couldn't believe this had happened. She had never been so humiliated.</span></div></div>",

Jessica and never mentioned Madison's own gain to her, but she had texted Madison considerably less after Madison started gaining weight. As mentioned earlier, Kelly was one of the girls from Madison's floor and was in her core group of friends. Tall and lanky, Kelly was skinny, and never had to try all that hard to keep her figure.  </span></div></div>",

Cassi had no such issues regarding her body and was mostly gone for the entire day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her absence, Madison used her alone time to concentrate on her studies, taking up a permanent position on the sofa. Her books were sprawled out across the floor, and she didn't even bother getting dressed. Instead, she wore her pajamas all day, which consisted of a pair of silk pants and a matching tank top. They were loose enough that they didn't make her uncomfortable, and made her forget about her recent weight gain. Unfortunately, as soon as she forgot, she started eating again, and as well as her studying, her days were filled with constant snacking. She had a bag of chips open beside her all day, and with Cassi stocking the cupboards up constantly, she was never short of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, Cassi came home to find Madison lying on the couch, her laptop propped up on her bulging belly. \"Hey,\" she greeted, lazily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Cassi replied, walking immediately to the fridge and pulling out some cookie dough. \"You haven't left the dorm all week, you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just studying,\" Madison said, clicking onto Facebook and avoiding the question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi squeezed some cookie dough into her mouth and slumped onto the sofa beside Madison, her chubby pot belly spilling into her lap. She unbuttoned her jeans and gave a sigh of relief as her stomach bulged forward an inch or two. \"Urghhh...been waiting to do that all day,\" she moaned, patting her gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison rolled her eyes, uncomfortable with Cassi's growing acceptance of her fuller figure. She flicked through the news stories on her Facebook page, and squinted at a picture of Jessica wearing shorts and a bikini top. \"Hmm...\" she murmured, as she enlarged the image. A larger picture filled her screen, showing Jessica sunbathing with two friends. Her friends, who Madison didn't know, had bodies that made her jealous...while she noticed something off about Jess. Her denim shorts were unbuttoned...and her stomach had a very noticeable bulge. She could have sworn Jessica had gained weight! She glanced at the comments alongside the picture...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Looking sexy girls!\" </i>One guy had said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"BEACH BODS!\"</i> One of Jessica's friends had commented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Looks like a nice day!\"</i> Someone else had said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, at the bottom of the picture, was Jessica's comment. <i>\"OMG Why did you upload this one?!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She knows...</i>Madison thought. Perhaps she wasn't the only one who was putting on a few pounds? It made sense really. If it could happen to her and Cassi, it could happen to anyone. She decided she would keep an eye on Jessica's pictures from now on...just to see what happened. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison continued to loath her current gain, however, she didn't do much to stop it. Even though Madison could have told herself she was going on an intense workout routine, she never did, or she thought to herself that she needed to, but would think, \"Eh, I'll start tomorrow.\" She continued to be miserable about the weight, desperately wishing that she was smaller and hot, like she used to be. Madison grew jealous of the girls that she used to fit into, hot, slim, grabbing the attention of boys, but she didn't seem to have the willpower to put herself back in that direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the constant snacking, Madison gain also wasn't slowing down. One day, while she was getting ready for class, she noticed that her newer clothes were also getting tight. \"Come ONNN, CLOSEEE,\" she muttered, as she tried to get her size 12s to snap shut. Madison eventually did it, but she had a bad muffin top. Her butt was still her biggest problem, and it had only gotten more sizable while she had been vegging out studying for the past few weeks. While it continued to swallow her panties, Madison didn't want to go back to the store and get more, which would have been another concession to the new reality of a chubby girl's life that she was in.  Madison also noticed that her shirts were not concealing as much of her as they used to, and even when she tried to suck it in, her belly was noticeable in her looser shirts. Madison feared what the scale would have revealed to her, so she didn't step on it. She knew that she was larger, but she choose to wallow in her own ignorance to her weight, even if a come to Jesus moment would have forced her to lose weight...or at least start trying to combat her larger figure and slow down her gain. Had she stepped on the scale, she would have realized she was at 185 pounds on her 5'7 frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing was making Madison feel better--Jessica. In her old body, Madison would have never felt good about the struggles of others, but during her transformation, that jealously that Madison had gained towards those with killer bodies grew to consume her. She thought it was unfair that some girls were being able to have a great time in college, the life that felt she deserved in college, but never got due to her sudden weight gain. Jessica, seemed to be falling into this as well, and Madison enjoyed seeing the photo from a few weeks ago, which showcased the softening of Jessica's stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater in the week, Madison found herself walking behind Jessica on her way to another class. Sure enough, Jessica seemed to have a bit more padding on her love handles. Madison wished that she could run in front of her to see if her stomach seemed any larger, but she settled for seeing the extra flesh. It wasn't huge, but it was enough that it caused her tight shirt to ride up slightly, just barely exposing Jessica's pale white flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica knew that she had put on a bit of weight, how could she not after the photos she saw posted on her feed? It was the result of overindulgence on the good dinning hall food and constant partying. She told herself that she would cut down, diet, and only party when necessary. \"I'm not going to become a cow like Madison, or that whale Cassi,\" thought the defiant Jessica when she got back to her dorm and thought about her weight. Jessica jumped on the scale to see what she actually weighed, the digital outlook shot her back a number--139. She nearly fainted. This wasn't that much for almost anyone else in the world, but for Jessica, it was 20 more pounds than she was used to. The former stick thin girl now had to consider herself average, she was determined to work out.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison wasn\u2019t the only one noticing what was happening with Jessica. The FA encourager from the hot tub party, Mark, shared English Lit with the new plumper. He had watched with more than casual interest as she adjusted her waistband both before and after edging into her seat at class, her small muffin top scarcely concealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was also present when Jessica, true to her word, tried to work out.  She went to the gym and actually completed her routines, but it was an effort that by evening worked up an appetite. She tried to avoid seconds in the dining hall, but she couldn\u2019t resist larger portions because her body was hungry. She also forewent dessert, only to be hungry before bed or during the night, sneaking a snack. Mark knew she wasn\u2019t really doing enough to actually lose anything and wondered about the depth of her resolve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Thursday he stopped his own routine while she was resting and acknowledged their shared class. She was flattered by the attention of the slightly stocky, handsome  5\u201910 Junior and felt his kindness and interest. After nearly a week of agonizing self-deprivation a little male attention was appreciated. He asked if she were available for dinner Saturday night and she without thinking said yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night at the dining hall she was both giddy and ravenous and she allowed herself her first dessert in a week, feeling she\u2019d burned enough calories to permit herself a treat. When she got home she discovered her roommate had left her a half pizza before going out for a movie, which she initially ignored. But by 11:00 both it and a large soda were gone.  She slept soundly, thinking of her anticipated date with Mark,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning her appetite had returned and she had two crepes plus sausage and hash browns in the dining hall, bloating her belly. This bulging gut was what greeted Mark in their shared second period class. He smile warmly and told Jessica how great she looked. She smiled back and thanked him before doing the now familiar pants hitching before squeezing into her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cI absolutely have to cut back at lunch</i>,\u201d she thought, her belly rubbing against the edge of her desk. But two of her friends wanted to celebrate a birthday at a Mexican buffet. Two tacos, a Chile rellano and a burrito later Jessica was again stuffed.  The workout for the day of course had been skipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFriday evening was already a scheduled party, the one Jessica had promised herself would be her only indulgence. She danced as much as she could, but much of the time grazed through the evening, including two plates loaded with high calorie desserts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaturday morning she slept in, her belly contentedly stuffed from the night before. At 11:00 she finally awakened for brunch, preparing a pastrami sandwich to accompany some potato salad her roommate had brought home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat should hold me until tonight,\u201d she declared confidently. And for the five hours involved it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPromptly at 6:00 Mark arrived. Jessica was attired in a baby blue empire cut dress that minimized her belly but was still a bit snug.   He greeted her warmly and they were off to Ramolis.<br>\r\n\u2019<br>\r\n\u201cLet me test you,\u201d Mark asked. \u201cHave you ever had Italian chili?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI recommend it as an appetizer for any true gourmand. It is satisfying, healthful and delicious. Its made from premium cuts of lean ground beef and red beans combined with tomato and chili sauces. Of course they toss in green peppers, onions and celery, then serve it with whole grain tortilla Chips.\u201d announced Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds half Mexican,\u201d remarked Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really. Italians have chili too.  But then there will the main course \u2013 I hope you\u2019re hungry. They have flat bread cibattas and pizzas, but I suggest their pasta.  Do you know Italian cuisine that well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really,\u201d confessed Jessica. \u201cI don\u2019t get taken out to eat that much. What do you recommend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor a first timer?\" Mark responded. \" Either Spaghetti and mestaalls or lasagna pasta,The spaghetti has large meatballs wth a special sauce,  the Lasagna is loaded with delicious meatballs, provolone and parmigiano cheeses,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you recommend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe order one of each and share,\u201d Mark replied, with Jessica quickly  agreeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ambiance was excellent, with subdued lighting, a minimum of clatter and soft recorded music in the background. Mark was able to draw out Jessica and she him. The food lived up to expectations and because they were sharing Jessica didn\u2019t realize she was out eating her escort. But because they chatted so much she still had room when he suggested an upside down Italian cake called Zucotto, containing a chocolate and hazelnut mousse dusted with cocoa powder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica went home stuffed but content, totally not thinking about her waistline and workouts for the moment.  The next week she continued to try as Mark looked on. But her heart was elsewhere. She had texted him a thank you and he had promised to do an encore, which she encouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next weekend was Mexican, the one after that Armenian, then came an Indian buffet. Jessica loved every bite but was worried about one thing. She  asked Mark how he could afford to do it and he smiled, \u201cdirty little secret \u2013 I write a review afterwards using a pen name and get reimbursed half the bill. So don\u2019t worry \u2013 I just hope you are enjoying the food, because I enjoy the company.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica smiled back. \u201cWell, I hope you don\u2019t mind a sat girlfriend because I think you\u2019ve totally sabotaged my efforts to diet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark smiled to himself and thought \u201c<i>that my dear was the objective.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAloud he said simply \u201cI like you the size you are or become \u2013 so there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica had really enjoyed her night out with Mark even though she sensed and even commented on its caloric consequences. She knew she\u2019d gained twenty pounds and the slightly pudgy Facebook photo had her change displayed openly on the Internet. But Kelli had said nothing, Mark had tossed her concerns aside, and it quickly became easier for her to push her initial panic to the back of her mind. She knew she preferred donuts and cappuccino to wheat thins and diet soda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nComparisons helped. She knew she was nowhere near Madison\u2019s size, not to mention Cassi, who somehow didn\u2019t seem to care about being over 200 pounds. But her ultimate rationalization was comparing herself to Kelli. Madison and Cassi knew they were fat, but \u201cMiss Perfect\u201d Kelli was in Jessica\u2019s perception in total denial. And Jessica knew she was smaller than Ginger\u2019s expanding roommate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Jessica was a passing friend to both Ginger and Kelli and dropped in on them every week or so. She couldn\u2019t help but notice that Kelli the perfect was scarfing down just about anything her roommate Ginger made available, even as she continued to make remarks about the two larger girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day Jessica showed up when Ginger was alone. Kelli had remarked on Jessica\u2019s fondness for pizza at a dorm party, which left Jessica astonished. Ginger had heard it. She remarked to Ginger \u201cI duuno about that roomie of yours \u2013 she seems to be aware of everyone\u2019s size but her own. I bet she\u2019s bigger than me right now and doesn\u2019t even know it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d acknowledged Ginger, \"she\u2019s so wrapped up in Mike she\u2019s in denial, at least publicly. But she has developed an appetite and knows what\u2019s happening. She even has a body shaper to help her squeeze into her size 10 clothes. She was a six in September. She has to be close to 160. Ten more pounds and she\u2019ll catch me!\u201d\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis number surprised Jessica, Ginger was solid and carried her weight well, But the information confirmed her belief \u2013 and if Miss Perfect didn\u2019t consider herself fat then Jessica had no reason to feel she was either. Curvy, yes, but not fat. But, she admitted to herself, maybe it was time for some larger clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was wise enough to let Jessica reach her own conclusions. When they were together he plied her with whatever he could whether it was a waffle cone or a pot pie dinner, but he tried to let it always seem as it if were her choice. The fact, however, was that what she chose easily became a happy habit away from him. Every time they exercised she seemed to wind up at Dairy Queen or Steak &amp; Shake. Late evening snacks became routine, as did hearty breakfasts and lunch.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica and Mark became an expected item together at parties. But sometimes he was cooking burgers, giving her more time to graze. At dances he found that she was preferring to do old-fashioned slow dances, like waltzes and fox trots, which they both felt were more romantic anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe results were predictable. By spring break Jessica had added another fifteen pounds, weighing in at 154.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d she reasoned,\u201d that\u2019s near the top of the normal range for my height, even chubby maybe, but still less than Kelli and way less than Madison or Cassi.  They\u2019re the really fat ones!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it went for Jessica during the year, indulging and bulging to Mark\u2019s delight, as well as the joy of her own belly, all the while trying to deny the extent of her gain. Then she went home where her family seemed to figure it was her body and life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer was active. She did make a point of exercising \u2013 the weather wasn\u2019t that hot and they lived in a rustic area where you could walk or ride your bike, even hike in the hills, and commune with nature. She found it relaxing and insiring. But the country air and exertion also produced an appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom liked preparing generous breakfast. That\u2019s why her Dad and brothers were all larger.  When dieting as a teen Jessica had learned to emphasize smaller portions \u2013 one piece of French toast, not three; fried eggs, not omelets; only one sandwich for lunch and no cookies thsnk you. But this summer all that restraint went out the window, After all, with all the exercise she was doing how much harm could there be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom, noticing the improved appetite of her growing girl, quietly made sure suppers were ample, with seconds and snacks available. No one pushed anything on Jessica but her resistance was minimal. By the week it was time to return to college she was definitely over 170.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reviewed her body in the mirror. She definitely had a belly which was nearly out to her bust line. Much of her weight was in her thighs and butt. Her arms were full and her rib case encompassed in gentle rolls. She had to admit \u201cOK. So I\u2019ve gotten a little fat, but Mark\u2019s happy, I\u2019m happy, and who really cares?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she sat down to dinner her generous hips no longer fit entirely on the chair seat and her love handles were easily visible through her top. When standing a tight pair of shorts clearly displayed the curve of her belly. She no longer had to adjust the driver\u2019s seat of the car forward but instead had to stretch her legs.  She had gained nearly fifty pounds in a single year, but somehow it was all ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Madison, Kelli and Cassi Jessica would be a Sophomore  \u2013 Ginger wouldn\u2019t be returning.  All four BBWs had boyfriends and would now be having to deal with new Freshman roommates. Jessica switched over to a size 14 wardrobe with a few more comfortable size 16s. Then she stopped in the mall for an Angus cheese and mushroom burger combo until she got home. She felt prepared for the new school year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had left the dorm only twice last week, attending her classes on both occasions and hurrying home as soon as they were finished - she could see people studying her body in class, probably trying to guess how much weight she gained. She figured she had probably gotten enough exercise from the walk to and from classes, but had been trying to cut down on her snacking during the evening. While she had been successful in this regard, her lack of eating at night was actually leading to a lot more eating during the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi spent most of her days out of the dorm, so Madison had found herself undisturbed from early morning until about five o'clock. This gave her plenty of time to herself, and allowed her to study without any interruptions. She got up around 10am and wondered into the kitchen to make some breakfast; with Cassi gone, she didn't even bother to get dressed, and just stood there in her underwear waiting for her bacon to finish frying. Madison had become more and more aware of her curves lately, and had grown more comfortable looking at her new body. As a result, she was spending less time in her sweats and more time in her underwear - one day she had even tried studying naked, but had gotten paranoid that Cassi would return and changed back after about ten minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her bacon and a few waffles, Madison crossed to the sofa and reads from a book while she ate. After finishing breakfast, she studied for a while until midday, when she got herself some lunch and went onto her laptop. Opening up Facebook, she remembered Jessica and her latest pictures...but was distracted by a message popping up. Funnily enough, it was from Jess...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hey Mads,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is going to sound really weird and if you're freaked out then you can totally ignore me, but I've been gaining a little weight lately, and I've noticed that you and Cassi are too. I hated it at first, but over the last few weeks I'm really liking these new curves and I think I'm going to gain more! Are you guys gaining weight on purpose or trying to lose it? If you are gaining on purpose...got any tips?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess, <br>\r\nxxxx\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison just stared at the screen for a few minutes, hardly able to believe what she had just read. Did Jessica really want to gain weight or was this some cruel joke?! She had definitely been putting on some weight lately, so she wasn't lying there...but actually wanting to get bigger? Maybe she just wanted a more curvy figure or something. Madison absent mindedly rubbed her bulging belly as she considered her response...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the course of the next two weeks, Madison committed herself to helping Jessica gain. Jess was confident that she would be able to control her weight gain and work her added pounds into what she called 'sexy curves'. She relied heavily on Madison for an eating plan, which generally consisted of Jess paying for a load of takeout and her spending the rest of the night eating it. She had stopped visiting the gym, and, at Madison's suggestion, was spending more and more time lounging around snacking. Each night ended with Jessica sprawled out on Madison's couch, massaging her bloated stomach, which seemed to bulge larger with every feast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the plan had unexpectedly backfired on Madison. Despite her best efforts to get Jess to eat most of the food, she always ended up joining Jessica in her binging, it was hard to just sit there and watch without giving the game away, but the more food Jess ordered in, the more Madison found herself eating. Her food intake was being doubled, and she was ending up just as bloated as Jess every night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night, after Jessica had gone home, Madison hurried to undo her jeans before they popped open, pulled up her shirt and lay back on the couch rubbing her pot belly, which was round and firm from another overeating session. \"Urp...URRRRRP....URRRRRRRRRRRRP!\" Madison belched deliberately, hoping to alleviate some of the pressure building up inside her gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and Cassi walked in, dumping her bags by the door and walking over to the couch. Madison had told her about the plan to fatten Jess up, and she had claimed to be on board, but Madison was the one who ended up doing all the work. She didn't even bother to cover herself up as Cassi lent over the couch and stared down at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid Jess and her stupid Pizzas...\" Madison moaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you're meant to be getting her to eat, not the other way around,\" Cassi laughed. \"You look stuffed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison groaned as she ran her hands over her bare belly. \"I can't just sit here while she eats, I have to eat too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi shook her head. \"Just make sure this plan of yours doesn't backfire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRRP!\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I'll take that as an 'okay' Mads,\" Cassi giggled before walking to the bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison slowly rose from her seat and arched her back, making her stomach bulge out considerably. \"Oh man...I am getting so huge,\" she moaned as she patted her bulging belly and returned to the bedroom, stripping down to her underwear and falling into bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Jessica came round for her standard eating session, smiling eagerly as she walked through the door. Madison was wearing her tightest pair of jeans and a button up shirt that she had purchased on her last shopping trip, they were a bit of a squeeze to get into, but she had decided that the tighter her clothes were, the less she would be inclined to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check it out,\" Jess grinned as she pulled up her shirt to reveal a slight bulge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey,\" Madison said, wondering why Jess was so proud of such a minor gain. \"Your abs are gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess grabbed a roll of flab from her stomach. \"I gained five pounds!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks good on you,\" Madison said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like my stomach is the only thing to change so far though,\" Jessica said, with a hint of disappointment in her voice. \"Was hoping for some more boobage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, that'll come,\" Madison smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yours look awesome by the way,\" Jessica said, gesturing to Madison's larger breasts. \"What are you now, a D?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C,\" Madison replied awkwardly. Her breasts had actually started to outgrow her latest bras, and she suspected she might have reached D cup size a little while ago, but couldn't quite bring herself to buy new underwear yet. \"So, shall we eat?\"</span></div></div>",

If it was already hard to put on, and slightly painful, the thought was that she could hold off on eating too much. Madison wasn't like Jess, she didn't want to gain any more weight. In fact, she still was hopeful that she could lose some of it, since she didn't want to come back home looking like a whale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess walked back in with three large pizzas and soda. Madison thought that even for someone trying to gain weight, this was a lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee Jess, at least we'll have leftovers\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I may have gone overboard, but why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they started eating, they also got around to talking, something that had become dramatically easier after Jess started gaining. Their friendship had really grown since the mall incident and Jess's text to Madison. They were having standard girl time, but Madison was having so much fun, that she wasn't really keeping track of how much she was eating. She thought the pizza was amazing, and just kept thinking, \"ok, one more slice, just this once.\" If she had been tracking, she would have realized she had eaten the equivalent of half of a pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess noticed that Madison's button up shirt was extremely tight, and some of the buttons looked like they were trying hard to stay fastened. She also had a definite muffin top, with her belly spilling over her jeans. \"Man, why would she wear that,\" Jess thought, \"It's just going to be painful, she should switch to sweats.\" Jess had no idea that this was a (increasingly failing) attempt by Madison to limit her food intake.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison continued to keep pace with Jess, who was also stuffed. However, they eventually ran out of pizza, meaning each of them had eaten over a whole large pizza. Madison sat there, feeling constricted by the jeans that she was wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uggghhh,\" she moaned, she knew that she needed to unfasten her pants. As Madison tried to reach down to do that, she felt some fabric give a tad on her lowest button of her shirt. Then, PUFFT, her button two buttons snapped off, then again, the third button went. Madison and Jess just starred at each other in shock. When Madison tried to lean over to pick a button off the coffee table, her jeans button also popped, freeing her gut from the tight confines of her too tight pants. Madison was left there with a shredded shirt and pants which exposed her large and bloated belly. Jess could not believe what she was seeing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison quickly exposed herself and put on sweatpants and a new t-shirt. She was so embarrassed, how could she not realize that would happen if she put on those clothes?</span></div></div>",

After bursting out of her clothes for a second time, Madison had learned her lesson and toned down her eating. For the first time since she started gaining, she was actually having some success in controlling her hunger, and pushed the majority of the food they ordered onto Jessica, who didn't seem to notice she was the only one eating. Madison hadn't lost any weight lately, but she had stopped gaining, at least, and this made her happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter tight clothes had proved to be a bad idea, she had switched to a pair of looser jeans and a T-Shirt that clung to her stomach and enhanced breasts, but gave her room to bloat a little without ripping through any fabric. She answered the door to Jess's knocking at the usual time, and smiled when she saw her friend. Jessica's gain had become more obvious over the last week, as she bloated larger and larger after each dinner, while refusing to adjust her wardrobe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Madison greeted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Jessica smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica walked inside the apartment as Madison got a good look at her changed body. Jessica was not fat by any means, but her previously slender frame had started to bulge out considerably. She had gained quicker than Madison, with most the weight accumulating in her butt and her breasts, the two areas she had been most enthusiastic to grow out. Her stomach had a permanent bulge, and love handles were starting to appear at her sides. Her ass was beginning to strain her tight jeans, while her breasts created some impressive cleavage that she was flaunting more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was your day?\" Madison asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh, same old,\" Jessica shrugged, before pulling up her top and exposing her flabby stomach. \"Check it out. I think I'm on my way to a pot belly...not really what I wanted...but I'm gaining more up top and down below.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed,\" Madison said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess pulled her top back down and turned around to show off her butt. \"My ass is getting so big, I love it. I'm starting to get too big for my bras as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're liking your progress so far?\" Madison asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely,\" Jess smiled, patting her belly proudly. \"Let's eat, I'm starved.\"</span></div></div>",

Some chicken fell onto Jess's shirt, but she did nothing, letting the orange chicken sauce just sit there and stain on the raised area of her shirt from the bulge that didn't used to be there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was shocked at the spectacle. Jess had stopped even attempting to carry on conversation, and just tore into the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of this, Madison noticed that the temporary bloat was creating a serious muffin top, as Jess was still wearing the same clothes as before.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One month later, it was the start of the summer, and the campus was in the midst of a heat wave. Lectures were winding down, and Madison had hardly left the apartment in the last few weeks. Though she was more confident going out in public now, she found the weather to be unbearably hot - if she had still had old body, she would have probably been outside in a bikini, sunbathing, but as none of her bikinis fit her anymore, and she didn't want to go outside and expose her pot belly, she had decided to stay in and keep cool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the dorm room had not been as cool as she was expecting. As a result, she was wearing an undersized tank top and a pair of denim shorts that had been tight when she bought them. Her pot belly was fighting to escape the top, and she had a pretty bad muffin top, but it was the best she could do for now. She planned on buying some new summer clothes when the semester was over. She slumped onto the sofa and lay back, fanning herself with a magazine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi had decided to stay in today as well, and was currently lying on the floor reading a book while a large fan blew air onto her and Madison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassi...pass me a coke...\" Madison yawned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't, too hot,\" Cassi replied lazily. She was dressed similarly to Madison, but her top was much looser and her shorts a lot more comfortable. Her weight had peaked at just over two 250 pounds, and she hadn't grown much in the last few weeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was relieved to find herself sticking at the same weight too, despite her eating sessions with Jess, she hadn't gained a pound for two months, but she hadn't really lost one either. With a sigh, she rose up from the sticky couch and walked to the fridge, pulling out a coke for herself and one for Cassi. She pressed the cold can to her forehead and exhaled in relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock came at the door, and Madison walked over to answer it. Cassi certainly wasn't getting up any time soon. When she opened the door, she found Jess standing there holding an ice cream and wearing sunglasses. \"Oh, hey Jess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Jess smiled, taking a lick of her ice cream before hopping inside. \"I bought you guys an ice cream as well...but I uh...dropped them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison raised an eyebrow. \"You ate them, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\" Jess giggled. \"Hey, it's hot out there y'know! I had to keep cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she closed the door, Madison noticed what Jess was wearing. A top that clung to her chest and exposed her midriff; a midriff that had grown into a fully fledged pot belly over the last two months. Jess hadn't changed very much anywhere else; she was still quite slender, all things considered, her face hadn't gotten at all chubby, and most of her clothes still seemed to fit pretty well. Her breasts had increased in size a little, and her butt was a little larger than it used to be, but other than that, her added pounds Her belly, on the other hand, was getting huge. It was permanently round and constantly looked bloated, even when she hadn't been eating. People had actually begun to wonder if she was pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I think it's even warmer in here than it is outside...\" Jess gasped as she walked over to Cassi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jess,\" Cassi said, putting down her book and staring up at her friend's bulging stomach with some curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison noticed something else then; Jess's shorts were unbuttoned at the top, giving her belly more room to breathe. She seemed completely comfortable like this though. \"Jess, you shorts have come undone...\" she said quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know,\" Jess said, swallowing the last of her ice cream and rubbing her protruding stomach. \"It's more comfortable this way; this thing is getting big. Do you two want to go out for a while?\"</span></div></div>",

How good would that feel?\" Jess excited near-yelled at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison didn't know about that. A year ago she would have been really excited about that prospect and would have loved to show off her beach bod. Now, in her current state, despite a greater comfort in her body, she in no way wanted to bear all like that. \"I don't know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come onnnn\" Jess pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even have a suit that fits anymore. All my bikinis are from last year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's go get one on the way, Cassi? You game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not? Madison, you can just use one of my suits from a few months ago\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i></i>Because I look like a cow, that's why not!<i></i> Madison thought  to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi handed Madison the two piece and Madison starred back. \"A two piece? Cassi, there is a lot of this,\" she said, patting her own belly, \"for me to be pransing around in a bikini.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Mad, it's all I have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison tried it on in her bedroom. Madison's now 190 pound body was very evident in the one size too small bikini. Her thick thighs were rubbing together, and they led to a butt that looked like it was trying to eat up the bikni bottom. Above that was two love handles that had grown proportionally with her pot belly, which now stuck out past her boobs due to the previous period of stuffing that she had been doing with Jess before her weight had leveled off. Madison was afraid that her boobs were going to fall out of the too tight top, but at least it was keeping them from sagging. The downside from this was that her back boobs were more pronounced due to the tighter fit of the top. Madison put her tank top on over the bikini, and her tight shorts, sucked it up, and got ready to go to the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked down to the campus rec center. Being a university that offered summer classes, the a wealthy booster decided to donate enough money to get an outdoor pool as well as an indoor pool, and the outdoor one was stacked. With spa like chairs and beautiful landscaping, it was often a place where people went when it got hot like it was that day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was nervous, <i></i>Well, at least I'm smaller than Cassi,<i></i> she thought. Cassi still looked huge. The blonde barred almost no resemblance to her roommate from almost a year ago. She was a bit more constrained in a proper fitting one piece, so Madison feared that attention would be focused on her exposed belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess was wearing a bikni that showed the bloat from her stuffing, and a somewhat disproportionately large stomach and chubby butt. Even still, Madison was a bit jealous that Jess still had her hot face, while she was dealing with the effects of softening features and a double chin.  </span></div></div>",

By the end of last summer, the beach babe had such a good tan that she usually skipped that step, but her flesh had faded into an unusual paleness for her. As she sat down, Madison grimaced at her belly, which folded into a mound of flesh. She also noted her softness as she rubbed the lotion into her thighs. She wondered, a year ago, how many of the guys here would have been trying to sneak a peek of her doing this, now she felt as if she should be trying to cover up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer self consciousness was not being helped by seeing many of the girls from her dorm at the pool. Some of the girls had gained weight, but many had not. They ran around, flirting with guys who were happy to return the favor. Her contact with guys went from all the attention she could handle down to almost nothing, besides a few friends from classes. Although, she probably would have had more luck if she adjusted standards or gained a bit of confidence. But who could blame her, she had been thin all her life, and suddenly changed, and was not yet adjusted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison dozed off in the heat, and woke up a bit later, to see Jess come back with ice cream for everyone. Not just small servings, but sundays for all three of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Jess thanks!\" said Cassi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what better time for ice cream, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison starred at her's for a second. She wasn't too thrilled about looking like a pig in front of everyone, in swimwear to top it off. But she reluctantly took a spoonful and ate it anyway. It tasted great in the heat, and soon, Madison was demolishing her's at a pace similar to that of Cassi and Jess. In her quick pace, a spoonful dropped on her stomach, and she leaned over to wipe it off, causing further roles to develop. Madison could also swear she saw two fit guys laughing from the other side of the pool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour after they finished those Jess came back with rootbeer floats, Madison thought she was slowly eating those as well, but she looked over after 15 minutes and realized there was nothing left of her drink. This left her feeling groggy and bloated in the hot sun. She looked over at Cassi and Jess, \"Want to jump in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Sounds refreshing,\" Jess immediately replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey jumped in the pool, \"At least people won't be able to fully see my body in the water,\" Madison thought. </span></div></div>",

She thought about how at the start of the year, Chris was the catalyst for all of this when he said that he wasn't really into Cassi because she was larger than what he preferred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison watched as some girls with tight bodies and small bikinis ran over to him. They were laughing and having a good time, which caused Madison a bit of jealousy. Madison thought back to when she was fit, <i>I bet they are not even thinking of me, heck, I never went out of my time to make fun of fat girls.</i> In this instance, Madison was wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they got up and left. Madison pulled herself out of the pool by the ladder, giving the entire pool a view of her enlarged butt. As she walked over to get her stuff and put her tank and shorts back on, some of the girls and Chris took note. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewww, Madison used to be so hot, how did she let herself go like that,\" one said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must have been too lazy.\" said another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris snickered, but did not say anything, he did not want to be mean, but at the same time, he thought it too. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With summer fun coming to an end, most of the campus was shut away and studying for finals. Madison's confidence had been dealt a serious blow at the pool; she had spent so many hours of her life strutting around in a bikini looking amazing that to see herself squeezed into one in Facebook photos was horrifying. She had attempted to resume her diet afterwards, but her growing appetite and low self esteem were causing her to eat - and the more she stayed inside and studied, the more she ate. Cassi had also started to balloon again, after a month or so of holding back her weight gain, she was now constantly eating as she crammed for finals, consuming several meals a day, constantly snacking and barely moving from her position on her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess had been quiet lately, but from her recent pictures, she was still growing, and was often seen flirting with Jeff, which meant that her plan was working. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison, at least, had left her bedroom and studied at the table in the kitchen, but that only placed her closer to the food supply, causing her snacking to escalate - though she wasn't eating such huge quantities as Cassi, it was enough to add a few extra pounds. As she sat there with her books laid out, wearing some newly bought jeans and a white tank top that hugged her pot belly, Cassi walked into the kitchen and opened the fridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think you're ready for finals yet Mad?\" Cassi asked, giving her room mate a good view of her huge butt as she bent over and gathered some food in her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nearly,\" Madison replied. She had been studying harder than she had ever done in her life, and was sure it would pay off. Her weight gain had kept her indoors more often, and as a result, she found it easier to study. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi emerged from the fridge with some leftover Pizza and a huge bottle of Pepsi. She dumped them on the counter and tore into the cold Pizza. Cassi was wearing sweatpants and a tank top that exposed the entirety of her fat stomach - Madison didn't know if it was supposed to do that, or if Cassi had just outgrown it, but she suspected it was the latter. Then again, Cassi didn't seem to have any problems showing off her figure...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want some?\" Cassi asked, gesturing to the large Pizza box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good,\" Madison replied, trying to show some restraint as her friend stuffed herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi devoured the Pizza in no time, then chugged the Pepsi until the entire bottle was gone. \"URRRRRRRP!\" The chubby blonde belched and rubbed her bloated stomach, which had expanded considerably after her feast. She groaned and lent back against the fridge door, arching her back so that her stomach looked even more enormous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was amazed at how big Cassi had become over the course of the year, the once skinny farm girl was now pushing three hundred pounds. Cassi moaned again and waddled back to her room, leaving Madison to study in peace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, when she was sure she could cram no more, Madison headed to the bathroom and showered. As her hands lathered up her curvy body, she realized she still wasn't used to her added poundage - and there seemed to be more of it every time she looked. Despite her best efforts, she was officially chubby now, not quite in the fat range yet, but a few more pounds and she'd no longer be able to just call herself 'curvy'. She stepped out of the shower, and, with some trepidation, headed for the scales. She stepped her naked body onto the scale and watched the numbers display: 200. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison looked down in horror. She had officially reached two hundred pounds. She had feared this might be the case, but had been too scared to look for the past two weeks. She had been hoping she could hold back any more weight before she hit this milestone, but it looked like she had failed. She turned and looked at herself in the mirror, running her hands over her bulging stomach, wondering how she had let herself get this big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, she wrapped her body in a towel and returned to her bed, crawling under the sheets naked, and hoping she could somehow lose this fat. Even if it was just a few pounds. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although Madison wasn't thrilled with the reason that she had studied so hard, her insecurity over her weight, she was not angry with the results of the effort. Finals weekend went very well for her. Madison had always been bright, but with her emphasis on studying, Madison breezed through her finals. Yes, she told herself, that these were just intro classes. However, she still outperformed her peers who had been out partying all quarter. Madison knew that she did great, and it would later be revealed that she got a perfect 4.0 gpa, opening her up to pretty much any major that she wished to apply to. From a future career standpoint, Madison was setting herself up to be successful and affluent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the good news. The bad news was that Madison now had a milestone to reflect on the year she had just been through. She stepped on the scale, 203 pounds, a total gain of over 70 pounds. Also discouraging, even after her 200 pound mark a few days ago, she continued to snack and pile on weight. She looked at some photos of herself on social media from the start of the year, <i>What happened, I used to look so hot...</i> she thought to herself, as she leaned back in her chair and grabbed a pile of flesh that was her stomach. She thought back to that initial decision to forgo the gym a few days to help Cassi gain the confidence to go and workout, <i>that was the biggest mistake of my life, how could I have let myself morph into this.</i> It was true. Madison did not resemble the same party girl that she was before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Madison Kraft who came to the school watched what she ate, and had a body to show for it, now, she was just a chubby girl at risk of looking fat, and Madison knew that her high school friends were all following the gain on social media. She thought about her boyfriend from high school, who she had broken up with before the year started. He was ripped and had a great body. She remembered how confident she was breaking up with him, convinced she wanted to party for the year...now he was way out of her league. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cassi walked in, Madison wondered if she had the same feelings of regret over her body. Cassi had been a hot country girl when she came, now she looked as if she had been larger all her life. Madison suspected that Cassi's sister's gain made it easier for Cassi to cope with, since it probably was not a huge shock to Cassi's family to see this happen. After Cassi sat down near Madison, she started up a conversation, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So, how did finals go?'' Madison asked Cassi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I think they went really well, I guess I will not know for sure until grades come,'' Cassi replied. Cassi was not lying, her grades would turn out to be pretty good as well. Not excellent like Madison's, but still enough to justify her being at Powers, and nothing to be ashamed of. ''So, what will you be doing during break?'' Cassi asked Madison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison had not exactly figured it out. There was a few week break before fall classes started up. Her parents wanted her to fly back to Florida so they could see her, but Madison was still embarrassed over her weight gain. Her father understood, and told her that he bought a ticket for her, but she did not have to use it if she did not want to. She also figured that she could just stay on campus and try to work out, or meet some new guys during the layover. So, her response to Cassi was genuine, ''I don't really know, going home would be nice, but I really don't want to see everyone right now.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well, my parents loved you last time we went home together, so you are always welcome to stay there with me, if you want to,'' Cassi offered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was intrigued by this. She had a really fun time in Kansas when she went there, and she met some cute guys, including that one, Mark, that seemed to be into her. Granted, this was many pounds ago, but still, maybe their standards would be lower out there, she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison thought about her options...</span></div></div>",

Madison's parents knew that she had gained a bit of weight, and her Mom heavily disproved, but at the same time, figured that her daughter should stay away from the beach until she lost a bit of weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassi, I think I want to come to Kansas with you for the week.\" Madison told her roommate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good! I'll let my Mom know you are coming.\" Cassi ran into the other room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison knew that this was not an ideal situation. She did want to see her friends from high school, but could not imagine seeing them, most of who did not gain a pound, while she had added nearly 70.  While Cassi's friends from Kansas would surely be shocked by her added weight since the previous break, they would be more forgiving than her vain friends, or at least that is what Madison assumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Madison packed her clothes, she noted that if she gained much more weight, another size up would probably be in order, something that she loathed doing. <i>Maybe I can just go and work out with Erin</i> Madison thought, thinking of Cassi's fitness freak sister, who looked like Cassi had when she first got to college, before all the large meals and drinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day, Madison got into Cassi's SUV, and got ready for the ride back with her. Madison noticed that the car seemed a bit tighter than before, and attributed it to the much increased size of her and Cassi, another chance for her to sigh as they drove. After a while, Cassi decided to get fast food, and Madison obliged, getting herself another greasy combo meal, the first of many times she would give in to urges despite yet another resolution to try to make a dent in the weight that had gathered on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours, Cassi's SUV went down the familiar road that led to Cassi's family farm. Nothing looked changed from the last time Madison had been there, except the season. Cassi's Mom saw them running, and ran out of the house, to give Cassi a big hug, and then did the same for Madison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that greeted Madison was the sight of Cassi's sister, and nothing could have surprised her more. </span></div></div>",

Jess was coming round with alarming frequency, always with greasy, fattening takeout food which she would share out. It wasn't so bad when Cassi was around, but lately she had been spending all her time at the library, leaving only Madison to share Jess's obscene amounts of takeout. She tried to eat as little as possible, but Jess just seemed to keep forcing more and more onto her plate, while eating even more herself. After two weeks of this, Madison had gained another five pounds, which seemed to have gone straight to her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess, meanwhile, was in a permanently stuffed state, it seemed. She was always eating, her belly always bloated, her jeans always unbuttoned. She was no way near fat, but Madison had noticed her stomach bulging more obviously and her clothes tightening considerably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRRP!\" Madison belched as she set aside her plate and lay back on the couch with a grunt. Despite her best efforts, she had eaten way too much again. She had chosen to wear a tank top and jeans today, and was regretting not just choosing sweats. Her bloated stomach was painfully obvious beneath her top, and her jeans were digging in to her flab. She would have unbuttoned them by now if she'd been alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess just carried on gorging, devouring every last bite of the extra large, double stuffed pizza she had purchased for herself. She chugged down a can of pepsi, groaned and slumped back in the chair, pulling her own tank top up to expose the entirety of her bulging belly. Her jeans had been unbuttoned when she arrived, but she had eaten so much that her zipper had been forced all the way down as well, exposing a glimpse of her frilly lace panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, that was good...\" Jess smiled as she rubbed her stuffed belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison just nodded meekly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your belly looks huge tonight, let me see...\" Jess reached over and pulled up Madison's top, exposing her aching muffin top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison blushed, caught off guard by Jess's exposure of her gluttony. \"Hey...don't do that,\" she said, pulling her top back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Undo your jeans, oh my god!\" Jess said, looking concerned. \"That looks so painful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...it's fine...\" Madison lied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mads, come on, my pants are wide open here...\" Jess gestured to her bulging middle. \"Nothing to be embarrassed about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison groaned. Jess was right. There was no use sitting here in pain when she could relax with a simple movement of her hand. She sucked in a little to loosen her jeans, then quickly undid the top button. Her belly bulged out, bloating a little bigger now that it was set free. Her top also rode up a little, to just above her belly button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better?\" Jess asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison nodded. \"Much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was just about to relax when she felt Jess's hand swoop in and pull her top up again. She was about to snap at her to cut it out, but when she turned her head, Jess's face was right in front of her. She opened her mouth to speak, but instead, Jess lent in, and kissed her...</span></div></div>",

In her mind, it was a growing friendship. Yes, she enjoyed hanging out with Jessica, and yes, she did find herself oddly transfixed with making Jessica grow larger (despite her own reservations with doing so), but she never thought of Jess that way...until, that moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess could tell Madison was confused by this sudden lurch and kiss that she had made towards her, until Madison's eyes squinted in a positive way, and Madison leaned back into to kiss Jess again. Madison then moved in to grab Jess's stomach and slowly massage it while still making out with her, eliciting a soft groan from Jess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feed me,\" she whispered into Madison's ear. Despite having little idea of what Jessica meant by this, or how to go about it, Madison grabbed the nearest slice of pizza, and started to bring it near Jess's mouth so she could reach out and chew it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Jess said, \"push it into me.\" Madison, somewhat confused, but caught in the moment, pushed the slice into her mouth, and Jess tried to eat it as fast as she could. Madison was completely confused by this request from Jess, so much that it almost took her out of the moment, if not for Jess still running her hands up and down Madison's body while being fed by Madison. Jess quickly finished the piece. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison wanted to stop this, out of the oddity of this, but complied, if not just because she had no idea how to react. After another slice, Jess sat there for a second. Madison assumed that she was going to explain what was going on, but suddenly she pushed Madison back into the couch they were sitting on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess, what the hell?\" Madison asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I get to feed you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you talking about, Jess?\" Madison nearly screamed as she was stuffed with one of the three remaining slices in the pizza box. </span></div></div>",

Madison leaned in and pressed the first one into Jess's open mouth, while massaging her big tummy in the same way Jess had massaged hers. Madison wasn't entirely sure she should be doing this, but she couldn't deny it felt better being the feeder than the feedee, and she was oddly turned on by Jess's still rather slender, but hugely bloated, body. This wasn't exactly unheard of, after all, lots of girls experimented in college...she was just trying something new. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess swallowed the rest of the slice, belched, and beckoned Madison to feed her the second one. Madison pushed it in, and Jess ate it greedily, nearly biting Madison's hand off in the process. When she was done, she belched again, even louder than before, and rubbed her exposed belly victoriously. \"Ugh...so full...\" She moaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling adventurous all of a sudden, Madison stood up and sat down on Jess's lap. Their stuffed bellies pushed together, and Madison wrapped her arms around Jess and leaned in to kiss her. Jess's hands climbed up Madison's round stomach to her growing boobs and squeezed them, causing Madison to let out a quiet moan.

All week, all she had been thinking about was her next night with Jess. Every time she pictured her slender friend looking bloated and pigging out, it turned her on. She had been so horny since their last encounter that she had been excusing herself from classes just so that she could go and masturbate in the toilets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn preparation for Jess's arrival, Madison had ordered five large pizzas for them, along with fries and two extra thick milkshakes. It was a little excessive, even by Cassi's standards, but Madison had now been overcome with another urge; she wanted Jess bigger, rounder and sexier. Madison had slipped into a skin tight, black tank top that fit snugly around her chubby stomach and bulging breasts, and a pair of skinny jeans that showed off her bulbous behind. She wouldn't have worn this outfit usually, but she felt sexy in it, and was sure Jess would enjoy it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jess finally showed up, she was wearing an even tighter outfit than Madison. A short, tight pair of shorts and a tank top that was so undersized that it stopped just above her belly button. Her breasts had gotten huge, and seemed to be threatening to explode out of her top as she walked in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, soooooooooo much food,\" Jess said, licking her lips as she eyed up the stack of takeout in front of the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I hope it's not too much,\" Madison grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure we can manage it,\" Jess said, sitting herself down on the couch and opening up a box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had only been a week, but Madison couldn't help but notice that Jess looked thicker. She was rapidly catching up with her now, and her breasts were especially big, bigger even than Madison's already ample pair. Madison sat down beside Jess as they started their feast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what about Jeff?\" Madison asked, wondering, which just the faintest ammount of jealousy, if Jess was still trying to impress the guy she had started this whole process for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeff?\" For a moment, Jess just looked confused, chewing down on her first pizza slice and savouring the flavour, her eyes suddenly lit up. \"Oh...I haven't actually seen him for a while. Studying too much. Eating too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison laughed. \"You do look a little...uh...curvier...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think so?\" Jess asked excitedly, grabbing a handful of fries. \"I have been feeling a little thicker lately...by the way, I love you outfit. It's sexy as hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison blushed. \"You don't think it's a bit too tight?\" She deliberately pushed out her belly, causing her top to stretch audibly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's perfect,\" Jess said, grabbing her third slice of Pizza. \"If anyone is outgrowing their clothes it's me, I keep snapping buttons and tearing bras.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah your boobs are huge,\" Madison said suddenly, surprising herself. She hadn't really intended to just blurt that out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right?\" Jess laughed, unphased. \"They keep growing and growing!\" She placed her hands under her tits and jiggled them for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison felt herself getting turned on by the sight of Jess's bouncing cleavage, and had to grab another slice of Pizza to hide her arousal. When she turned back, Jess was already on her next - was this her fourth or her fifth? That girl was <i>inhaling </i>her food tonight. Madison could see the buttons on her tight shirt starting to stretch as her belly bloated up. \"Try the milkshake,\" Madison insisted, gesturing to the huge, thick cup on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess, almost obediantly, went for the milkshake and starting slurping. Madison just watched eagerly as her friend pigged out, her shirt seeming to grow tighter by the second. Jess pulled the milkshake away and wiped her mouth. \"URRP! Ugh...so...BURRRP...good...\" she groaned. \"Mads...feed me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all the encouragement Madison needed. She grabbed the Pizza box and crammed a slice into Jess's mouth, then another, and another...and another. Jess just gobbled them up greedily, her stomach expanding with each new slice. She let out the occasional belch, which only turned Madison on more. <i>Oh God, why am I enjoying this so much? I want bigger. I want her fatter. </i> Madison was sure that after a few more slices, those shirt buttons would pop...</span></div></div>",

For some reason, the more she lusted over Jess, the more she wanted to eat. She started shoving pizza slices into her mouth with the same enthusiasm as she had crammed them into Jess's, greedily wolfing down every slice she could get her hands on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess was looking like she was ready to explode, completely stuffed and exhausted and falling into a food coma, but she grinned as she watched Madison's display of gluttony. She let out another loud belch and groaned in discomfort, and Madison reached over and massaged her taught belly tenderly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stuffed?\" Madison asked in between mouthfuls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess groaned and nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison pressed her hand into Jess's stomach, causing Jess to moan even louder and let out another huge belch. \"Urghhhhhhhhh Mads don't doooooo that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison giggled. \"Sorry, just trying to help.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just keep eating,\" Jess said with a cheeky smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison carried on stuffing her face, her stomach growing so full and heavy that it was encroaching on her lap. It seemed to Jess that Madison's pot belly was growing bigger and rounder with every bite, swelling and bloating far beyond her own stuffed tummy. Madison started fumbling with the top of her jeans, which were now hidden beneath her heavily bloated gut. With one hand on a Pizza slice, and another down below, she finally managed to unfasten her top button and let her belly escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess felt herself getting wet as Madison's chubby belly surged forward with a wobble, almost seeming to double in size now that it was freed from her tiny jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god look at this!\" Jess leaned forward, forcing out another belch, and grabbed hold of Madison's huge, round belly. \"It's soooooooo big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison shuddered with delight as Jess's hands explored her expanding middle, and reached for another pizza slice, only to discover she had just eaten the last one. Had she really eaten the leftovers that quick?! She didn't have time to feel any shame before Jess started groping her distended stomach and massaging her chub. She blushed and let out an involuntary moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you like that huh? Chubby girl?\" Jess asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're...chubby...too...\" Madison gasped, feeling Jess massage her poor, overstuffed belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess lifted up her shirt with some difficulty, the buttons straining as she exposed her own growing pot belly, which was rapidly catching up to Madison's own gut. \"Soooo big...\" she cooed, pushing her exposed belly into Madison's own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls panted and moaned as their full stomachs pushed against one another, both of them too stuffed and bloated to really do anything but enjoy the moment...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now, however, as she continued to unintentionally increase her stomach capacity, her appetite was causing her to increase her food intake more. She would frequently eat through entire pizzas or two meal deals at a fast food chain. Madison, who had always dreaded any of her weight gain, was in shock over the display of gluttony at times, but still found the whole exercise interesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day, Jess had ordered a burger combo, and a chicken sandwich combo from the fast food place at the side of campus, and was quickly scarfing it down. Madison noticed that Jess was eating the fries so fast that she had not noticed the ketchup and salt she had spilled on her shirt. The stain made Jess look like quite the sloppy, but seemed fitting for the person that Jess was quickly morphing into. The former thin brunette had been quickly pilling on the pounds, and today's feast would only add to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Jess finished the meal, she looked bloated, as she had the previous days.

Madison had become set in her eating habits, buying and eating snacks almost instinctively now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at herself. Forget being a 'chubby chick,' Madison was fat, no ifs and or butts. Her face looked swollen, with huge cheeks and a definite double chin. Her stomach now sticked out farther than her boobs, and even this new XXL shirt could not stop her gut and love handles from steeping out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bottom half was even worse. Her hips shot out, and her butt was just this enormous thing. Turning around to examine it, she softly moaned to see she had a visible 'whale tail' with her ass crack visible. Her thighs were definitely in the thunder category by now, and she had to rub cream on them to prevent chaffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison sniffled. Just months ago, she had a perfect body, and now she was\u2026this.

Pulling her waistband back up, she exited the plane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter going through baggage, she exited to see her Mom's luxury SUV parked and waiting.

First, Christina was a bit surprised she immeditaly recognized her friend, given the chubby face that had replaced Madison's previously sharp features. It wasn't a tripple chin or anything, but Madison had clearly filled out and had a double chin and puffier cheeks. Despite the warmer weather in South Florida, Madison was wearing a sweatshirt, most likely to hide her gain, however Christina could tell she was larger. First, she could see Madison's bust was bigger, but lacking the perkiness that had made her boobs look great, and she wondered if Madison's gut stuck out further than the bloated boobs.

What happened?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story.\" Madison replied, not really knowing how to explain the journey that had wrecked her beach bod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, come on, we can't let this ruin break. Let's find some clothes, and plus, you have a ton of time to burn this off before summer.\" Christina replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they went to stores, Madison realized that she was on the top end of the sizing scale, or in some cases, they didn't have clothes for her at all. After Madison bought some size 12 pants that fit her 190 pound body, Christina brought up another thing that she didn't want to think about, \"I left my suit up at school, do you need to get a swimsuit for tomorrow as well?\"</span></div></div>",

The last few times that they had met up, Madison thought that Kelly's midsection looked a bit fuller, but she could never figure out if that was actually the case, or if she was just imagining things. When Kelly walked in, Madison could confirm that Kelly was actually starting to put on a bit of weight. Her stomach wasn't really a belly yet, but still stuck out a bit and looked soft on her shirt. Her legs also looked a little bit larger in her shorts. It was maybe 10 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Kelly to gain weight would have been the most shocking, maybe even more so than Madison. Wheras Madison was always hyper sensitive about her appearance, she was never critical of those who gained weight. Madison always felt that you played the hand you were dealt, and it would be cruel to comment on someone else's shortcomings. Kelly on the other hand, had no issue doing any of this, and often commented to Madison about Cassi's gain, with high levels of judgement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison wondered how Kelly gained this weight, because best she could recall, Kelly was usually at the gym, trying to stay in shape. As they talked at dinner, Madison noticed that Kelly was eating a bit more than usual, which she thought was odd, but maybe Kelly was just hungry, and heck, how could she judge after what she had been putting away this semester. </span></div></div>",

While Madison had noticed Kelly putting away more food than usual, her portions were nothing compared to her two, ravenous friends. When the meal was over, Madison was stuffed once again, despite her best efforts to eat conservatively. Cassi was in one of her increasingly regular food coma's, and was just sitting back idly rubbing her gut. Madison couldn't see how much Kelly had eaten while she was sitting down, but she was sure that she had to be pretty full herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know...I hate to say it, but you two are a bad influence on each other,\" Kelly said, leaning back in her chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Madison raised an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not to be cruel but...have you looked in the mirror lately? You two are getting pretty big,\" Kelly said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I know I've put on a few pounds...\" Madison blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than a few,\" Kelly laughed. \"Sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you've put on a few yourself,\" Cassi piped up, frowning across the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly's face contorted in a mixture of anger and surprise. \"What do you mean by that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Kelly...she just...\" Madison tried to explain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I want to hear it from her,\" Kelly cut her off. \"What do you mean, Cass?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi shrugged. \"Well, it looks like you're on your way to the freshman fifteen yourself. It's not an insult, everyone gets it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am <i>not </i>getting the freshman fifteen,\" Kelly snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the meal was little more than awkward silence. Madison tried to start up a conversation a few times, but Cassi and Kelly refused to speak to each other. Madison was relieved when they finally paid the bill and stood up to leave. As they rose from their chairs, she noticed Kelly's stomach had bloated out considerably beneath her tight shirt. Kelly noticed too, and tried to suck it in as best she could, but Cassi and Madison had already seen. Cassi tried not to laugh, and Kelly marched on ahead after a curt 'see you tomorrow'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told ya she was gaining...\" Cassi grumbled after she had gone. \"Who the hell does she think she is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison shrugged. \"Just says what's on her mind I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't know she had a mind...\" Cassi replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison had to laugh at that. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison and Kelli were too focused on Jim and Tom to really care about Kelli. It was nice hat she\u2019d picked up a few pounds, lousy that her \u201capology\u201d had turned out to be insincere hypocrisy, but overall our two chubbettes had other concerns in their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot so with Ginger and Kelli\u2019s boy friend Michael. For different reason they wished she\u2019d be larger and happy with it, but she was the epitome of denial. Ginger had seen it since she and Kelli were made dorm mates at the start of the school year, Michael had seen it color their relationship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet\u2019s start with Ke;;i's roommate Ginger. who happened to also look at the same exposed computer screen after seeing Madison's reaction. It infuriated her, because it was just another piece of a feeling that had been growing ince they began living together. . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they first got to school in mid August, Ginger always looked like one of those short 5'0 girls who was destined to be petite her whole life. One day in October Kelli was walking out of her room to the elevator, and noticed something. Ginger was getting a bit of padding on her behind. It looked like she had put on at least 10 pounds, which was noticeable on such a short girl. Her calves looked a bit wider, and she had tiny love handles bracketing a tiny but noticeable belly. Plus her arms looked a bit meatier than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, before was rail thin for Ginger, so she wasn't fat by any means. Nor was she concerned about her new contours. But she was surprised to hear Kelli mutter to herself \u201c''Man, I better work out soon, I don't want that happening to me anytime soon.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is she to judge?\u201d groused Ginger. \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t watch it she could be a real butterball.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been watching her roommate closely. Kelli was attractive by any standard, with soft charcoal colored hair cascading down gracefully about her shoulders, sharp facial features and bashful brown eyes that were the epitome of innocence. But under this outward fa\u00e7ade beneath this outward fa\u00e7ade was a  personality accustomed to both indulgence and denial. Her appetite had been held in check by parental monitoring and a regimen that mandated regular exercise in high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was in college, and her parents weren\u2019t in the picture nor was she actively involved in physical activity. But she was in denial that her metabolism by itself could not compensate for her enjoyment of the college scene, She did not, to put it bluntly, realize fully the risk of her becoming like her roommate Ginger, or possibly as rotund as Madison or Cassie, whom she was prone to critique in Ginger's hearing. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStung by the impact of party girl Kelli\u2019s words Ginger decided she would facilitate changes she felt were inevitable anyway. She surprised her more slender roommate the next Saturday morning by whipping up a breakfast of pancakes, meat and eggs. The aroma surprised Kelli out of a mild hangover from the previous night\u2019s party. It had only been several counterband beers and a whole bunch of pizza, but it was a far heavier ingestion of calories than Kelli was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelli, seduced by the fumes,  quickly switched into comfortable shorts and a blouse and went to the kitchen, inquiring \u201chey, what\u2019s going on? It smells great!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinger replied, \u201cjust whipping up breakfast; let me give you some coffee and it will be ready soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelli groggily complied, and soon was presented with two scrambled eggs, three links of sausage and a croissant. It wasn\u2019t a large breakfast, but more than the pop tart and milk that the prima donna was used to. Her belly, stretched from the night  before, was able to handle it easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Kelli went into the dorm\u2019s common area where a television was playing rerun of old television shows. After watching two episodes of Beverly Hillbillies and half of a Bonsnza episode she got a text from Michael. He and a friend wanted her and Ginger to go to an all you can eat  pizza and chicken buffet that night. After checking with her roommate she accepted thinking \u201cit will be fun watching porky stuff herself. I bet she has thirds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinger wasn\u2019t watching TV. After cleaning up the kitchen she was doing the laundry and offered to do Kelli\u2019s clothes as well. The couch potato roommate, used to her mother making such offers, thanked her. She then wandered into the kitchen to bring some cookies and soda to give her company while watching the rest of the program and the episode of Gunsmoke which followed..  Ginger, finished with the laundry. brought them both a couple of toasted cheese sandwiches with more soda. Kelli expressed her appreciation, scarcely noticing the smile on Ginger\u2019s lips or suspecting the reason.<br>\r\n,<br>\r\nAnother hour of tv and the sated Kelli was ready for a nap, which lasted two house.  Ginger went shopping, then came home and baked two sheets of oatmeal and raisin cookies which she put into jars in the kitchen.  The aroma eventually wakened Kelli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with the baking?\u201d she enquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust some goodies to share next week, ed. \u201cI promised to make refreshments for a club meeting \u2013 but the cookies in the urn ext to the breadbox are for us.\u201d chirped Ginger.  Kelli couldn\u2019t resist trying one immediately. It was delicious and she took two more to her bedroom.  Again Ginger just smiled, thinking \u201cshe hasn\u2019t a clue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the routine which Kelli slipped into after crisping Ginger with her tart remarks. And the consequences had produced the results Madison would later observe but Kelli failed to recognize. To her Madison was just an envious fat girl and Kelli a fashion piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of Kelli\u2019s delusion was furthered by Michael, her escort to many of the parties and that night\u2019s buffet.  He minded neither her indulgences or their consequences, and apart from food they had much in common. But he didn\u2019t appreciate the vanity of her critiquing others when she was no different. Amidst the music and gaiety of the evening Ginger noticed that Michael kept Kelli\u2019s plate fully supplied almost without her noticing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael was a kind and careful soul, ingratiating himself with Kelli by helping her with homework and preparing for tests. He forced nothing upon her, instead inquiring and catering to her culinary desires while always praising her. He wanted her to get big enough that she would forswear criticizing others and hopefully also be as content as he would be wth her added girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazingly Ginger and Michael managed to keep Kelli oblivious until she'd gained nearly twenty pounds over four months  before Madison called attention to what was happening \u2013 and then Kelli blamed the two dorm chubettes, who in truth had only let her share in the lifestyle they had all chosen. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ginger elected to keep her campaign relative  to herself, but made sure that it didn\u2019t let up. Items such as French toast, scones, pancakes, cinnabons, breakfast burritos, corn bread, corned beef hash and the like were regularly offered to Kelly, whose salivating taste buds and ever henry stomach found it impossible to resist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinger\u2019s cover story, which was partly true, was that she wasn\u2019t skilled at all these dishes and need to practice for her Home Economics Class. She did in fact take selected dishes to share there and get an A in the course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this Ginger had a secret ally. Michael was observing what Ginger was doing with some interest. He had hit it off with Kelly the second week of college as they attended some parties. He noted both her sarcasm about others weight and her own love of pizza, burgers, chicken wings, soda or just about anything else. Yet she was still a relatively lithe 129 and around 5\u201d8\u201d.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow, he wondered, with an appetite like that, is she so skinny?  Surely it won\u2019t last?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the time it didn\u2019t matter. They enjoyed each and worked ion homewiork together as well as socializing. He introduced her to various types of fast food that she\u2019d never heard of \u2013 lamb fajitas, beef gyros, and spumoni ice cream among other things. She inhaled and enjoyed it all, apparently confident that it wouldn\u2019t affect her lithe body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short time he learned why. Kelly had been involved with both swimming and soccer in high school and exercised regularly while eating just about anything she pleased. She felt that she was immune to any \u201cserious\u201d weight gain \u2013 even if she had admittedly \u201cpicked up a few\u201d during the summer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason was simple. Both her parents were one during the day and he was free to indulge \u2013 usually a lunch, some chips, soda and ice cream. It was a sedentary summer and she\u2019d only added ten pounds \u2013 she knew others had packed on ore, so felt \u201csafe.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael knew this and assured her that he didn\u2019t see the gain as serious. She appreciated his easy dismissal even as he suggested they hit the local Dairy Queen. Ginger was already on her case about her snacking at home, but she knew she weighed 30 pounds less than her roommate and certainly wasn\u2019t in the territory of Madison and Cassie. If Kelly would have just not talked about and criticized the weight others Michael might nevr have become an active encourager.  But after the incident with the message on the exposed lap top he decided a few extra pounds might humble his girlfriend \u2013 who in his view could stand a bit more padding anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was certainly true that Kelly\u2019s slight pudge noted by Madison was far less than hers or Cassie\u2019s, or even Ginger\u2019s. But Kelly\u2019s angry reaction and state of denial startled Michael.  He saw her hips and thighs filling out \u2013 the tight pants giving an ice cream cone scoop look to a tapering cone of flesh down to her knees when at the pool. Her bustline was still bigger than her belly, but the latter was fast filling in. Michael felt Kelly obviously wasn\u2019t looking in a full length mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael wasn\u2019t rich, but he had enough money to do something clever. He helped the girls with their laundry with the intent of finding out the size of Kelly\u2019s clothing. She\u2019d remarked that she knew her slacks were tighter so for her birthday he bought three pair that were two sizes larger and removed the labels. He did the same with a pair of tops. Then he told her that he had purchased them at an outlet store so the labels were removed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was busty, but also a bit pear shaped, The new weight was being distributed accordingly, giving her an increasingly ample derriere but se remained in denial about having already gained more than the freshman 15 by Thanksgiving, Her physique was in contrast to Ginger, Carrie and Madison, for whom their bellies told the story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Tom and Jim working with Carrie and Madison (as told elsewhere) Kelly\u2019s attitude finally shifted and she became less critical of others, This was part of the proves of accepting herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy summer Kelly\u2019s clothes were again getting snug. Whereas Madison had gained over fifty pounds Kelly had increased by nearly forty. Fortunately because of Michael\u2019s support it wasn\u2019t a devastating transition. But she did have a much meeker attitude towards her three friends. Her muffin top was spilling over her waistband when seated and she was sporting matching love handles. It was time for her to upgrade her wardrobe before going home to meet her family. She wondered how they would react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some anxiety she first broke the news by phone. Her grades were a solid 3.8 average but had come at the expense of what she called \u201cconsiderable stress eating. Fortunately she had a sympathetic boyfriend who appreciated her forty extra pounds. \u2013 she expressed hope they wouldn\u2019t hassle her over it when she went home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents, especially her mom, were surprised but fortunately not outraged. Her mom wasn\u2019t slender by any means and considered her tio now be an adult capable of making her own choices. Her Dad, knowing the endomorphic tendencies of the family, had as much as predicted it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat surprised her, however, was what her mom gave her during he summer.  Rather than attempting to put her on a diet her mom prepared breakfasts that rivaled Ginger\u2019s. At night there was always dessert, even if was a store-bought pie. During the day she had access to just about anything for snacks with both parents gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven this freedom, plus indirect on-line encouragement by Michael (who the final week actually visited her family and then took her back to campus) she easily packed on 17 more pounds by the time for her Sophomore year  began. Both she and Ginger would have new roommates, but she knew they would remain friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered about Madison and Cassie and was happy when Michael told her of a text message from Jim suggesting they should all have dinner.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That night, Madison woke up not long after midnight. She tossed and turned in bed as she tried to get back to sleep, but try as she might, she just couldn't manage it. She was left lying awake in bed, staring up at the ceiling in the dark. She had been feeling incredibly tired when she clambered into bed, but now that she reflected on the day's events...she really hadn't done much to wear herself out except eat. Maybe that was the problem? She could hardly tire herself out at this point, and Cassi's family would probably think she was crazy if she went for a jog at this time of night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her stomach rumbled. Madison froze in shock, then pulled back the covers in one swift motion. She was still bloated from breakfast, dinner and lunch...how the hell could she still be hungry? She sat up and rubbed her stomach. \"Seriously?\" She asked, directing the question to her bare belly as though it would respond. Then again, perhaps eating a little something wasn't such a bad idea; it was food that had tired her out earlier, maybe a midnight snack would get her back to sleep again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroggily, Madison swung her legs out of bed and got to her feet. She was wearing only her underwear, a form fitting black bra and panties that accentuated her breasts and butt, which had grown a little larger lately. She didn't bother slipping into anything else, figuring nobody would see her at this hour. Quietly, she opened her bedroom door and peeked her head out into the dark corridor; the coast was clear. She slipped into the corridor with dainty steps and slowly made her way downstairs, which, thankfully, was also clear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison crept into the kitchen and headed straight for the fridge. With all the food Cassi's Mom had been supplying over the last two days, there was bound to be some leftovers. When she pulled open the fridge door, illuminating the dark kitchen, her suspicions were confirmed - there was huge platters of meat, vegetables, cheese and all sorts of farm produce just sitting there right in front of her...but what really caught Madison's eye was the huge chocolate cake...untouched...rich...delicious. Surely nobody would notice one slice was missing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, Madison took the huge cake out of the fridge and laid it down on the table. She stumbled in the dark, but refused to turn the lights on in case it attracted attention. She grabbed a knife, and, not bothering with a plate, cut herself an ample slice of cake. It was amazing, as she had expected, and she devoured it in three huge bites. She glanced down at the cake again, and was about to put it back in the fridge...when she found herself reaching for another slice. <i>I'm sure nobody will mind</i>...she told herself, as she cut an even larger slice than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it didn't stop there. The cake was so delicious, so creamy, so rich...she had to have more. Two, then three, then four slices just weren't enough, and every time she finished one portion, she immediately went for another. Only when she found herself reaching for an empty plate did Madison realize what she had done...the cake was gone. She couldn't remember eating it all, but somehow she had managed it. The plate was bare, and when she looked down at her stomach, it was so round and full that she looked like she might burst at any moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God...\" Madison gasped as she rubbed her bulging belly in amazement. \"What have I done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up hurriedly, but was nearly dragged down by the weight of her stomach. \"URRRRRRRRP!\" Madison belched noisily as she scrambled to cover up the remains of her feast. She grabbed the plate and brushed the crumbs into the trash frantically...how the hell was she going to explain this? Perhaps they would be too polite to blame her? Her mind was racing. She wiped the crumbs from her mouth and opened the fridge again, shoving the empty cake plate underneath one of the larger dishes, hoping nobody would notice it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to shut the fridge door when her eyes drifted to the large pitcher of milk in the door...and she suddenly realized she was thirsty. Surely nobody would mind her having a drink? She took the pitcher and placed it to her lips as she began to chug the creamy milk. Like everything else in this house, it tasted amazing, and she continued to chug it down greedily. Her stomach bloated even larger as she swallowed a good pintful of the stuff before finally placing it back in the fridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!\" Madison groaned as she rubbed her painfully full stomach. \"I'm such a pig...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the lights flicked on...</span></div></div>",

Much to her embarrassment, it was Erin, Cassi's sister in high school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was panicked. Here she was in someone else's kitchen, scarfing down food, in nothing but her underwear. The next few seconds felt like an eternity. Suddenly the pains in her stomach didn't feel so pressing anymore. She looked down and she noticed that some of the chocolate cake had fallen onto her belly, and was just sitting there. Speaking of her belly, it was bloated and the biggest that she had ever seen it. Madison tried to suck it in a tad, but could not really, since it was so stuffed with food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was wearing some tight shorts and a skin clinging tank top, showing off her runner's body. She looked at Madison with a face of confusion, awkwardness, and disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I'm sorry...I just heard something that woke me up...and umm, why are you in your underwear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's a good question.\" Madison had no answer for her. </span></div></div>",

She had never been so humiliated, and really didn't know what to say. \"I just felt like a little midnight snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little?\" Erin laughed, pointing at Madison's globular stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison tried folding her arms across her chest to hide her exposed tummy, but it was a useless effort. It wouldn't have been quite as embarrassing if Cassi had found her...but it had to be Erin, the slender, athletic one. Just looking at her perfectly toned body made Madison envious. Not long ago, she had had a body to rival that, maybe even better it...but that wasn't really the case anymore. She had gotten soft, there was no denying it, and right now she looked bigger than ever. \"Yeah...guess I overdid it a little...my stomach is kind of bloated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean your belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A stomach is what I have,\" Erin said, lifting her shirt to display her toned abs. \"You've got a belly, like my sisters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't...\" Madison said. \"I'm just full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right,\" Erin smirked. \"That's how Rebecca started you know. She used to be like me, then when she started college she packed on the pounds, just like Cassi has. I don't know what it is with this family, but the women can never control themselves where food is concerned. I thought Cassi might be able to resist, but looks like I was wrong, she's ballooning even faster than Rebecca did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you so sure you won't be next?\" Madison asked, trying to divert the girl's attention away from her own overindulgence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made Erin frown. \"Me? Seriously?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same genes as your sisters,\" Madison shrugged. \"I've put on a few pounds lately, and my body was no different to yours at the start of the semester.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin looked nervous for a moment. \"No...no...I'll be fine,\" she said. \"I work out every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did I...until...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until?\" Erin raised an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until I stopped going to the gym to make Cassi feel better,\" Madison sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Erin asked. \"You should go back, don't worry about my sister, she'll eat her way out of her clothes before thanksgiving...you should get your old bod back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison ran her hands over her bloated belly. Erin was talking sense...but how would Cassi feel if she decided to go through with this? Besides, did she even need to go back to the gym? She had been bloated for most of this week, and wasn't sure her current state was an accurate reflection of how her body looked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, see you in the morning,\" Erin said, stretching tiredly as she walked out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was left cradling her belly in the middle of the kitchen.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison walked back throughout the large house and went up the stairs. Even though no one was initially there, she tried to suck in her swollen and painful stomach. At the top of the stairs, she heard someone coming, \"oh great, I guess everyone in the Mitchel family will get to see by belly hanging out,\" thought Madison. As the person turned the corner, Rebecca appeared. She was wearing only panties and a tight tank top that rode up on her large belly, exposing ample pale flesh. It was clear that Rebecca wasn't planning on running into anyone either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison what are you doing up?\" Rebecca asked her sister's friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, just went to get a cup of water downstairs,\" the moment that Madison said that she knew it was apparent that Rebecca wasn't going to believe that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must have been a big glass of water, Madison\" noted Rebecca, while she patted Madison's bloated belly, which caused Madison to instinctively suck in her gut. Which also caused Madison to get defensive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's not that bad, I just overindulged a little this week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's how it started with me. I was a twig when I first went to college. Here, follow me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison, kind of surprised that Rebecca didn't mention her current wardrobe of only underware, followed Rebecca into another room, the home office. Rebecca sat down in a desk chair, causing her tank top to ride up above her exposed belly. Madison stood behind her, looking at the computer screen that Rebecca had just powered on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca then went online, and pulled up photos from her profile. You would have never guessed it, but this was me in high school. As she clicked on the photo, Madison saw very surprised. Rebecca had been gorgeous. Her and her girlfriends were all in prom dresses. It was clear that she had hung with a pretty elite crowd in high school, well at least as elite as it could get in a rural area like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Rebecca went to so photos from Halloween of her freshman year of high school. She was wearing a pretty revealing Indian costume. Madison thought it was kind of hick and unpolitically correct of her, but she cast that judgement aside for a bit while Rebecca talked. \"I should have taken alarm when this came in,\" she circled the cursor over her gut, which looked notably softer than her high school photos. Rebecca was still surrounded by hot girls and ripped guys. \"I was also dating a guy who I thought was really awesome, Steve, and as you can see, he didn't hurt the eyes either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the spring semester, things started to pile up.\" Rebecca went to some spring break photos. Although she was wearing a bikini, it was clear that fat was starting to pile  onto her stomach, which looked perpetually bloated. She also had love handles, and softer arms, with some expanding thighs. \"I should have known to stop partying then, and clamp down on working out. As you can see, I became the chubby girl in the friend group then. Steve would kind of casually mention things, but I tried to ignore it. That summer, I went home and got a job serving at a sports bar in town. We got to eat a lot of the leftover food, like fries and onion rings, at the end of the night, and being cheap, I kind of just made that my dinner each night. So I blew up that summer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca moved to pop up another photo, which looked closer to the person Madison knew now. \"When I came back to school that fall, I had gained 60 pounds in a year. Steve told me things were not working out shortly after that. The people who I thought were my friends responded less and less to texts, and I kind of had a falling out with some of them. I never realized that people could be so vain. I spend the next few years adjusting to my new social status. I joined a sorority, although a lot of the girls were not all that cool or fun. And I never really had a long term boyfriend since that. I'm not really into the type of boys who are into me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was shocked that that evolution from hottie to fatty that Rebecca had gone through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, what I'm trying to say, Madison, is that if you can help it, I would try to work out more before this happens.\"</span></div></div>",

When Madison got to the party, at an old, large house, about half a mile off campus, she started to casually walk around in search for Rob.

She would do almost anything to stay with him, and she wished this had not happened, although she knew that she had to tell him. If he was going to find out, it was best that she inform him, as opposed to him having to hear from a friend, or worse, seeing a photo of her falling all over a random guy online. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison dressed up in her cutest clothes and walked over to Rob's dorm room. She knocked on the door, dreading what she was about to tell Rob, putting their half year relationship at risk. He came to the door and let her in, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison tried to speak, but nothing came out for a second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Rob asked, sympathetically, coming to hug her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob...I accidentally slept with someone else,\" Madison said, trying to make avoid using the word 'cheat'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved away, instantly hurt. \"Please leave,\" he said, moving away from Madison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob\" she was cut off by him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get out of here,\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison went back to her room, and cried for most of the day. She waited for a text, or something, but he did not respond. Madison was crushed, he was a great guy and she was the one who was solely at fault for running it. She had dated other guys in high school who were selfish, or needy, but the connection that she had with him was just so unlike anything that she had ever been a part of, and would do almost anything to get him to stay with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Rob texted her, \"Come over.\" It was brief, but it was enough for Madison, so she went over. When she got in, he started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some other people have told me the details, and it's pretty bad. You betrayed my trust, I do not think that I can trust you anymore because of it.\" He paused again, before proceeding. \"I do not know if I want this to end, but I do know that I cannot trust you anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything I can do to change that?\" Madison asked, hoping there would be some way to make it up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I want to you get fat for me,\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's the only way that I can make sure that you will not do this again. For the rest of the year, I want you to come over here and have huge meals, then I will not have to worry about guys hitting on you and you sleeping around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was shocked that this was even happening. \"Is there anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, if you want to stay together this is the only way, and you cannot tell anyone about this, or we are finished.\"</span></div></div>",

She did not want to give up her figure, but at the same time, she wondered if she ever would have cheated on Rob if she looked worse. In a very odd way, she almost felt it to be punishment for her bad choices. However, at the same time, was it really worth losing her perfect body? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison thought about it, maybe the food would not stick. She had never been fat before, and with over half the school year over, she still had not gained a pound and remained at 130, with a 5'8 height.  Even if she did gain some weight, it would be worth it, and she could always just diet, was her line of thinking. Of course, Madison had never had to diet before, and had no idea if it would be challenging or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but only because I want you to be able to trust me again.\" Madison said, still conflicted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the end of the year, we'll see,\" Rob said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next week, Rob gave Madison huge meals in his dorm room. Madison never had felt so stuffed in her life, but she held up well, only revealing a marginally softer stomach, that mainly just looked bloated. As part of the deal, she was not going to exercise either, a huge departure from her normal routine.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob would have felt at least marginally bad about doing this to Madison, but he was angry, at it was hard for the feeling to go away when he heard from his friends the extent to which she was all over another guy. He previously had never been the controlling type, and plus, he told himself, Madison was not being forced into this. \"I was prepared to break up with her,\" he thought, \"but she was willing to show me it would not happen again.\" Rob also thought about the implications of having such a large girlfriend while he was in shape, but per his plan, he really did not plan on going out much with her as she got larger. </span></div></div>",

After another session with Rob, Madison got home and weighted herself, with the digital scale jumping up to 152. \"Ugh, why did it have to go this high?\" She wondered to herself as she pondered working out in secret. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison took this time to examine herself in the bathroom mirror. She first looked at her stomach, which had no resemblance of its former toned self, instead sticking out and making a pot belly. Madison knew that it was 20 pounds that she had gained overall, but she still hoped that it would not show up this much in her bloated stomach. Next, she turned to her butt which looked softer than it ever was in her life. Madison did not need a mirror to see this, as whenever she sat down, she noticed that everything felt softer as well. It was not a huge amount, and Madison was not fat by any means, but she was getting dangerously close to being considered chubby, and she felt like she needed a way to stop this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat Friday, there was fraternity semi-formal that Rob had invited Madison to over a month ago, right before she told him about the incident. As far as she knew, they were still on for the evening, although part of her wished he would call and cancel while she was getting ready. The first thing Madison did in preparation was to get some shape-wear out of the shopping bag that she had brought home earlier in the day. At the store, Madison had been extremely embarrassed to buy the product, but she felt she had no other option, lest everyone see her belly, and the extent that it had grown. After Madison put her dress on, which fit far tighter than she preferred despite a larger size than normal, she inspected herself again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Hmm, my belly is still a bit bigger than preferred, and I can't really do anything about the bit of chub that fell onto my upper thigh. Ugh..these</i> she thought as she poked her love handles. Madison looked over her face, realizing it too looked a bit fuller, but with no signs of a double chin coming in, she figured that it could be worse. </span></div></div>",

Where once was rock hard abs there was now a soft potbelly and chunky love handles to match muffintopping over her overly tight jeans. Rob had insisted on having a say in her wardrobe from now on, and Madison, still feeling guilty for cheating on him, agreed. Now she was regretting that decision as the pants he had chosen for her were incredibly constricting against her growing thunder thighs, and the shirt was far too small putting her belly on full display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the worst part for Madison. She had always been proud of all the hard work she put into getting a six pack. She used to love to show it off and brag about it. Now she had this big squishy gut hanging out for everyone to see. It jiggled with every step, and Madison could hear the snickers of people as she walked past them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob was loving all of this. It wasn't so much because of a particular attraction to her growing body, but the control was an incredible turn on for him. He had never realized he had this darker side, but now he was quite enjoying himself. He grinned as Madison sat down next to him in the dining hall, her flabby belly rolling over her jeans, threatening to burst the button. She was ready for another stuffing. </span></div></div>",

Despite feeling lethargic and full from another huge amount of food, she was determined not to let the arrangement between her and Rob harm other things like her studies. Madison was wearing pants that felt particularly tight, and a shirt that showed a bit of her backside when she sat down. She quickly found a desk and got to studying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she did not notice was that two girls who were behind her were also from her down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, can you believe how big Madison is getting?!?!\" one of them wrote on a sheet of note paper and slid to the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey exchanged a look at each other and the other girl responded, \"I know, look at those love handles, and I'm pretty sure you can see a bit of her crack, since the top of her panties are being pulled down. Ugh, how could anyone let that happen to them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Madison was studying, she had no idea of the criticism she was facing by even being out in her current clothes. Although, at times when she broke her intense focus from studying, she noticed just how much her belly now fell forward onto her legs. It was not huge, but it was very chubby, and for someone who was used to previously having no fat there, it was a world of difference, and always made Madison feel uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours, Madison felt she was sufficiently prepared for class, and began to walk out of the library. Before she got to the door, she felt a bit thirsty, and decided to get a diet soda from one of the vending machines. Madison briefly snickered at her choice, <i>Ha, why do I even bother with the diet cola right now...</i> before just deciding that every little bit counts, plus, she previously had drank so much diet soda that she had grown used to it and liked it better than regular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was putting in her last quarter, it dropped on the ground, and Madison instinctively went down to pick it up, just at the moment when her fingers touched the quarter, she heard a loud, RIPPPPPPPP. She quickly went back up fully erect and turned around, but it was far too late to conceal any of that. A Senior had been sitting in the common area in almost perfect view of Madison's butt while her pants had ripped straight down the center seam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhhhhh my god!\" He said barely able to contain his own laughter. \"I'm really sorry, I can't help it, sorry.\" He said, still not composed, as he texted his friend to let him know what happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison quickly ran into the bathroom and tried to lower her backpack to cover up the tear. It was of no use, everyone would see that she tore the pants. she briefly thought about texting Cassi to get her more jeans, but she visiting relatives that evening and was unavailable to help. Suddenly, it hit her, although the freshman dorms were located on the other side of campus, the gym was right next door, she could just run to the locker room, and get her workout gear and slip on her athletic shorts. The only problem was, those were very short, and from before the start of her 'diners' with Rob. </span></div></div>",

When she finally got into the locker room, she took off the ripped the pants, wishing that she had not destroyed a pair that she actually liked. While she took her jeans off, Madison noticed how her belly seemed much more prominent than she was used to, bunching up while she moved each leg up. There was only one other girl who was sitting in narrow the bay of lockers with Madison, and she tried not to stare, but she could not help but notice Madison's too small underwear that struggled to keep her growing behind in check. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Madison opened up her gym bag, she saw the pink athletic shorts. Cut very short, Madison slid them up, using most of the short's elasticity as they stretched to cover her growing butt and legs. Madison went over to the mirror, and did not like what she saw. The shorts, which used to be a bit loose, showed off almost her entire thighs, which had grown immensely. When she looked to her rear, she saw that the stretching not only showed the color of her underwear through, but also bad panty lines.  Figuring that this was the lesser of two bad options, Madison quickly grabbed her things and hurried up the stairs and out the door to get back to her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard for people not to notice Madison as she quickly paced up campus to the freshman dorm, with her brisk pace shaking the growing flab on her legs. It's not that  they were comically large either, chubby yes, but Madison was certainly not obese. What was not helping her, and drawing criticism from others, was how tight the shorts were, giving off the impression that she was still trying to be the hot skinny chick, when in reality she had gained around 30 pounds in the past month. People snickered as she walked past, wondering what world she was living in where she thought that looked good, not knowing the shorts were a last move of desperation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Madison got back into the dorm, Cassi gave her a weird look as to why she was wearing her work out shorts at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story.\" Replied Madison, as she got out some ice cream to try to relieve some stress. </span></div></div>",

She was alarmed that she could put on so much in one month, however, Rob had not let up on the stuffings, if anything, he accelerated them.  She often left his room feeling massive bloated, but now also was snacking late at night, as urges began to pop up in hours of the night that they never had before. Prior to the meals with Rob, Madison had been a sparse eater at all hours of the day, and now it looked to flip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison had taken to wearing stretch pants and leggings, since the elasticity made them last longer than the jeans that she was constantly growing out of. Yet, even those got tight, and people who would walk behind her to class could swear that at times they were being stretched to a point where the design of her panties would be evident. Even though Madison had previously wore thongs, her underware was becoming increasingly conservative as she found trendier fits to be uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn day 1 of her first final, Madison awoke and showered. As she did so, she took notice of her growing belly, which was now almost always bloated and impossible to conceal. She also knew that it had led to very prominent love handles. She had taken to pulling her leggings up to her belly button to try to keep it from creating any kind of overhand, but that just made them tighter around her growing behind, which was another problem for her. The butt which was once very tonned, now kept on growing with the rest of her body, and along with growing thighs that she had, was collecting some cellulite, something unthinkable to her. Madison threw on a bra, which was too tight and resulted in excess flab on her back side, and sipped her Powers University sweatshirt over her slowly wrecked body. As she caught herself in the mirror, she noticed that a double chin was coming in, and her sharp facial features seemed to be dulling. </span></div></div>",

It was not like she was huge, just chubby, and that was enough to shock a family accustomed to their fit daughter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quiet dinner where Madison was thrilled to not have to eat more than necessary, Madison got a text from her friend Christine, <i>Hey- going2 the beach 2morrow to celebrate evryone being back</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the last thing that Madison wanted to deal with, but she really wanted to see Christine and her friends, and they must have seen her gain online, she reasoned, so she obliged. <i>Great, what time??</i> Madison also came to the realization that this meant she would need to buy a swimsuit, or some kind of beachware, since her old stuff was from 60 pounds ago. She walked down the hall to Alex's room, \"Hey, want to go shopping tomorrow? I need a swimsuit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well yeah, you look huge.</i> She thought to herself, but would never say that out loud to her sister. The following morning, Alex met Madison in the breakfast nook, and quickly noticed how Madison's gut stuck out, something she never would have guessed after years of seeing her sister sit in the same place with a much thinner body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the drive over, Madison and Alex talked, all while she wondered how Madison could let herself get this large, but still never said anything. \"So where should we go first?\" she asked Madison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison did not really know, she usually went to trendy places, but she realized that it was quite possible that they would not have swimwear in her size, she eventually figured she would give it a shot, and went to the same place they always went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Madison quickly went past her beloved chinos and sweaters, and went to the swimwear section in the past. She figured she would need a one piece, to hide some of her dignity. She flipped through, finding it annoying to see a lot of her old size, 4s, on the rack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what size do you think I am right now?\" She asked Alex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I have no idea,\" Alex replied, wondering if Madison would be angry if she bought a bikini, since she needed something too, but did not want to flaunt her still pristine body, \"you could always go ask the salesperson to measure you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather not...umm...\" Madison said while she grabbed a size 12 and a size 14. \"Hopefully these will work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suits were two colored, yellow on top and navy blue on the bottom, which was in at the moment, and Madison hoped that the darkness on the bottom would make her look a bit slimmer. Madison tried the size 12 first, and immediately knew that one was not going to work. Besides being skin tight, she noticed that her excess flab was on full view, so she tried on the size 14, which was tight, but wearable. She quickly called Alex into the dressing room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe?\" she  asked her, hoping it looked better than it felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex could not believe she was here, looking at her now chubby sister and wondering if she should tell her the suit made her look fat. Madison turned around, \"She got a suit with a back cut off?\" Alex thought. Alex wondered while noting how the tightness of the suit gave Madison back boobs. She also noticed how Madison's butt looked so...well...chubby, and saw a hint of cellulite. Her thighs also clearly had grown, and Alex remembered when Madison used to be so proud of her thigh gap. Now, Madison looked completely different, especially given how the suit showed how her belly had grown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks alright,\" Alex lied, partially because being honest with Madison in the close quarters of a dressing room would be awkward. \"Maybe we can go to a store with larger sizes to see selection? Madison knew what that meant. Alex did not mean just any store, she meant plus size. Madison felt emboldened by that suggestion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. I'm getting this.\"</span></div></div>",

She was a bit shorter than Madison, had blonde hair and a body that had looked like Madison's at the start of the year. Christine was somewhat aware of Madison's gain by seeing the photos on social media, but in person, she was absolutely shocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Madison approached, she ran up to hug Madison, \"HI! It's so good to see you again!!\" she said, while she noticed Madison's back fat up against her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" A somewhat scared Madison responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it looks like you've been enjoying college.\" Christine bluntly said. Madison was getting tired of people saying some variation of that phrase. Did they think it sounded better than just flat out saying that she had gained a lot of weight? Madison wondered if they thought saying it was in any way better. But she did not want to start the day off by protesting, so she responded, with a sigh and a, \"yep\" while patting her belly, the outline of which was clear through the swimsuit fabric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Madison walked with Christine towards the group she saw some guys that she slept with in high school, all of whom used to jump at the chance to talk to her, now, they seemed to avoid her, or she was the one who had to initiate the conversation. Back when she was thin, Madison never thought that beautiful people had an easier go at things, but now, she wished she could go back in time and tell her younger self to have enjoyed it while it lasted. She just wished one of her other friends had gained weight, but all of them kept in shape, even the guys, causing her to slide into the roll of the token fat friend, which left her quiet and embarrassed while around the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friends' appraisal of her Madison was only marginally kinder than her own. They wondered how someone as energetic and vibrant as their friend could let herself just completely go. She looked tired, and puffed up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison ended up leaving early, and got fast food on the way home. <i>If I'm going to be fat, I may as well enjoy it.</i> she thought to herself while she ordered a greasy value meal. </span></div></div>",

She never would have guessed that going back to the source of her fatness would please her, but anything that got her further away from the judgement of home was something she was okay with. On the way out the door, Madison's Mom handed her a workout tape and told her she should consider it, saying, \"I don't know how much longer you expect Rob to put up with your weight problem.\" <i>If only she knew...</i> Madison thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her flight, Rob picked her up from the airport and was warm. It was an odd paradox for Madison, for everything outside of the meals, Rob was being a great boyfriend to Madison, so she did not want to break up with him. Plus, she reasoned, who would want to go out with her now, with her current size? She assumed that a guy as hot as Rob was out of the picture, so she stayed in the relationship, hoping, one day Rob would finally consider them even for the affair she had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob on the other hand, had no short term plan to stop with the stuffings. He was still hurt by the affair, and enjoyed the power dynamic of having one's partner truly pay for the trespass. Perhaps if Madison was older, or thinking more rationally, she would have realized how unhealthy the relationship had become, but as it stood, she allowed him to continue to wreck her body. </span></div></div>",

Soon after she got back to Powers, she noticed that she had gone over 200 pounds. Her only recourse was to go online and order more clothes to try to adjust. Madison had previously loved shopping, but this was a new experience. Shopping out of this kind of need was uniquely dreadful for Madison, and she loathed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison constantly thought about just calling it off with Rob, but always pushed back the date where she would actually pull the trigger on it. She feared that no one would date her now, with her growing body and shrinking social commitments, she just wished she could go back in time to warn herself not to cheat on him, or at least break up with him before the large meals and retribution stuffing went into effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the end of the second month, Madison weighed herself, and she was up to 220 pounds, a staggering, nearly 100 pound gain since Rob had paid her back for her cheating foray. She felt sluggish all the time, and was amazed at how soft her entire body felt. Her butt had grown to a huge state, but at the same time, it was being outpaced by her stomach. There was no way around it, almost anyone who saw her would call her fat, and her size 18 pants and XL shirts she saw when she was getting dressed each day only backed that up further.  </span></div></div>",

She assumed that her stomach capacity was growing and she was right. She still missed her thin body, and desperatly wished she still had it, but while she was being fed for this period, she thought, why not indulge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started with lunch, Madison went from trying to eat less and to make up for the food, now she was indulging at lunch. She looked forward to trying to decide between a tasty burger or delicious slice of pizza. Soon she would move onto dessert. For Rob, it provided cover, the whole student body saw this newly fat girl eating greasy foods, and thought things like, \"Rob needs to dump her, look at that.\" Girls were especially mean, hiding sympathy for Rob as an excuse to attack Madison, saying things like, \"poor Rob, his girlfriend got huge. He's so sweet to stay with her after her problem.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the double duty of a large lunch and dinner, Madison continued to grow at an alarming rate. By the end of the month, she was up to 237 pounds. She felt massive, and she looked it. Her previous round of 'fat clothes' had become far to small, and she knew she had to size up to keep a minimal amount of decency. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was not looking forward to this trip, and prayed that the boutique store that she went to, would still have her size. Madison knew that she needed to size up to an XL shirt, and a size 18 pants. When she got to the store, Madison noticed how much thinner everyone was than her, something she had never picked up on. She decided look around and see if she could find her larger sizes. After a while, a saleswoman came up to her. From behind, the saleswoman almost snickered at Madison's butt, looking larger than it actually was due to her tight sweatpants she was wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything I can help you with?\" The saleswoman asked, trying to sound approachable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison reluctantly gave in, \"Do you have anything in a size 18 or 20?\" she asked, turning red from embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I'm so sorry, we only go to 16. Maybe you can try 'Lynn's' down the hall?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison dreaded hearing that answer. Lynn's was a nationwide chain of plus sized stores that had just opened at the mall near Powers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Madison said, almost wanting to tear up as she left the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison's reaction should have been to break up with Rob and try to turn her weight around. However, after enough of these experiences, she felt lucky to even be with him. Yes, he was extracting an unhealthy revenge on her, but she knew that he was now way out of their league. When they went out together, people whispered, and she knew it. In Madison's mind, she had no choice but to stay with Rob and hope he stopped the stuffing. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Another month had passed, and Madison was now up to 245 pounds. Everything about her was now larger. She felt bloated and tired all the time, and hse seemed to lack motivation that she once had in many of her classes. It didn't help that Madison's confidence was now shot. She knew that she had a double chin at all times, and that she was the butt of joke across campus--the hot girl that blew up, and yet, she didn't blame Rob for any of it, she almost felt it was her fault. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass was just wrapping up one afternoon when Madison's professor Jennifer McArthur called her to the front of the class. Madison was wearing another new Powers sweatshirt, this time an adult 1XL, and sweats, a far cry from what she wore before. She hadn't worn makeup in forever, and her hair was pulled back. She looked like someone who had never given a ton of thought to her own appearance. Once she got up front, while everyone else was leaving, it was brief, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Dr. McArthur?\" Madison asked, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison, could you walk with me to my office?\" Dr. McArthur asked? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison obliged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they walked, Madison noticed how good off shape Dr. McArthur was in. She was in her early 30s, Madison guessed, fresh off an impressive string of getting published, and someone who was extremely fit. She still ran marathons, and kept appearances, it was everything Madison had previously been on track to do. She had taught Madison a year ago, and was shocked to now be in her office, sitting down, starring at this blob of a student who was looking back at her now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison,\" she asked, \"How do you think sophomore year is going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a lot of things that Madison wanted to say, horrible, maybe? Worst year of her life? But she didn't want to let on, lest it lead back to Rob finding out and breaking up with her, it was really all she had left at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Madison said, her voice trailing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only ask,\" Dr. McArthur said, \"Because you seem like you are somewhat distracted, do you feel a bit off this year?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess.\" Madison said, hoping that would end things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has there been a disruption in your personal life?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...my weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. McArthur was somewhat shocked Madison went there, she was hoping she came across more subtle than that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, Madison, that's only part of it. You seem like a different person. Less energy and focus, your grades have slipped, and I have worse students than you, but the trend lines are going in the complete wrong direction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison just sat there silently while Dr. McArthur went on, \"Have you spoken to any medical professionals of late?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, for my weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than that Madison, I just wonder.\" Dr. McArthur paused, she didn't take what she was going to throw out lightly, \"if you are experiencing symptoms of clinical depression.\" She starred at Madison, who seemed a bit taken aback by the line of questioning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Because I got fat you think I'm sad too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It goes way beyond that, Madison, it's a disease that happens to many people your age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't think that's the case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Madison glanced at the clock, and became frazzled, \"Oh my god, I need to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. McArthur looked confused, \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Madison responded, \"I forgot, I told my boyfriend, Rob, that I would meet up with him right after class!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. McArthur immediately responded, \"Madison, it can wait, this is really important.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it can't he'll freak out if I'm late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only reason the shock coming from Dr. McArthur went unnoticed by Madison was her rush to get out of there. For Jennifer, the case for Madison being in an abusive relationship was building in her mind. She wasn't going to accuse such a drastic thing because of a gut reaction, but it was worth exploring. \"Madison,\" she said, \"anyone who doesn't understand that you will occasionally be late isn't valuing you or your time properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't understand, Dr.\" Madison said, walking out of the room while pulling up her sweatpants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer suspected that all of this was linked. How could someone who was as driven and popular as Madison just fall off a cliff like that? She decided to look into it further. </span></div></div>",

For the former hottie, the humiliation was too much, but at the same time, it was also a rush for her.

He then used his other hand to grab her now prominent belly under her sweatshirt, and continued, \"Oh, remember how flat this used to be too? Such a shame.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison didn't know how to react, except to be overwhelmed by the entire situation.

Indeed, as her growling stomach reminded her, part of her had no desire to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally stood up, hurled the note at the waste basket, surprisingly finding the target. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll just be a fat coed student and focus on my grades,\" she declared to herself. \"At this size and eating all the time I'm not likely to be part of the social scene anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact Rob's control had effectively already largely excluded her from consorting with others for months. Madison therefore went to what had become her comfort place, the campus food hall.  There she loaded her tray with mashed potatoes, meat loaf and veggies with a piece of pie, then went off to a solitary table to do what her favorite activity - eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half way into her meal she heard a throat clear. She turned and found Brad Richards standing to her right. As a freshman she'd once shared a class and done a project with him. They'd worked together well, but she'd never taught of him then as being in her league. She'd impressed her as being the intellectual type, nice but not anything beyond that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" Brad said. \"If I'm not disturbing your reverie I wonder if I could put my tray down here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison looked around. There were plenty of empty tables. What was going on?  Curious, she decided to find out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh sure,\" she motioned with a plump arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking his seat Brad began eating his meal and engaging in small talk, then finally got to the point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've wanted to talk to you for quite awhile because there's something I need to thank you for - but with Rob being in the way I couldn't risk making things worse for you.  I guess now its safe,\" he began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what are you talking about?\" she stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember that project we did together - where you did the research and then I did the writing?  Well, your being such a help in making things so clear is what enabled me to write as I did - that A we shared was the first I'd had in that class. It emboldened me to try harder. By semester's end I got a B that would have never happened without you. I've wanted to find a way to say thanks ever since, but with Rob in the way it just wasn't possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're welcome, But what and how do you know about me and Rob?\" replied Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you got a spiked drink at a party and wound up being pretty giddy and in bed with some guy you didn't even know - then Rob decided to get his idea of revenge - which according to my friend Chris has now happened. I think he's a jerk!\" exclaimed Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chris was Rob's roommate so I get that much if you know him, but what do you mean about a spiked drink?\" inquired Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither Rob or Chris had anything to do with it - neither of them were even at the party. But the story is that you and a few others got a drug that threw off your inhibitions and wiped your memory; some of the people there then took advantage.  I understand two got quietly expelled.  Rob? He just went crazy and blamed you instead of those who did it. But that's not what this is about - I wanted to say thank you because you're a nice person who helped me gain some much needed confidence.\" confided Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now a hundred plus pounds later I'm the one needing the confidence, \" remarked Madison. \"All anyone sees in me is a 250 pound blimp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe what you need is a special guy, One who both appreciates you as a person and isn't trying to control you - one who knows that beauty starts from within and comes in many sizes,\" answered Brad, taking a deep breath. \"250 sounds like a big number but that's all it is. There are any number of people your height and weight who dress and act great - and if you need some proof I'd recommend looking at the plus size fashion sites and rending blogs by size-positive women.  It frankly in my belief  reflects more courage and character to do what they do than to cave in to the \"thin is in\" mantra most automatically buy into.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound like one of these chubby chasers I've heard about,\" mused Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, put it this way - I'd not have asked you out as a girl friend when we were sharing the project because I knew my preferences then - but now I'm looking at what I see as a stunningly attractive girl. I'm today hoping I can ask and get a yes response.  But unlike Rob I'll never be controller. I'll not try to make you eat or gain, or fuss if you try to lose,because what you do with your body is your choice. Fair enough?\" answered Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough - but before you actually ask can you give me some time to recover?  Because I don't want to just rebound.  But right now I'll exchange numbers if you' like?\" offered Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad proffered his cell phone bad Madison did likewise - both of them optimistically wondering what the future would hold<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When she was slim and with Rob, she never would have considered this blimp. Now, he seemed to be the only one interested in her fat butt. And was it fat. Madison stepped on the scale expecting it to continue its upward trend. It did as it weighed her in a 282 pounds. Her butt, thighs, and hips seemed to be taking the brunt of her gain lately. Her once smooth walk had turned into a hefty waddle. Madison quickly noticed that Larry left the tv on again. As well as all the pizza they were eating. Since Rob had left her Madison completely gave up on reclaiming her old self. She resigned herself to being an obese bitter loser, doomed to keep packing on the pounds. Last night certainly indicated that. She herself ate two whole pizzas. Lately however, Madison had found hotdogs to be her major weakness. Beer, with all its calories was in good supply too. It was also the only way to get past Larry\u2019s fat dopey face to get some action. Larry wasn\u2019t all bad though. He had introduced Madison to the Flash tv show. She still hated super sentai though and always complained when Larry watched. In addition to her greasy breakfast, Madison was making a coffee that was 50% syrup. Her relationship with Larry was no where near as fulfilling as Rob. As she with Larry was laze, eat, and have sex. To call him the rebound guy would be false. Wearing nothing but panties and a flash t-shirt that couldn\u2019t even cover half her big fat stomach Madison just stood there wondering what to do now.

The trio had been there for several hours now, enjoying their first night on the island. Madison had arranged for a table with bottle service and the whole bit, all on daddy's card, of course, but the dollar does stretch further down there. By hour one, Madison had drunk her two friends absolutely under the table. She ate nachos and polished off her fourth margarita, while Greg was practically hammered off three shots of watered down tequila, and Cassi nursed her third Corona as she chatted up a cute, young, and Costa-Rican gentleman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg was out of his head, making a fool of himself with his ape-like dancing, when his drunken robot brain told him to go to the rooftop. Stumbling up the rather steep stairs, He was happy to see Cassi in silhouette against the brightly lit street. God, she looked awesome, he thought, her trim form complimented by a tight, bright blue cocktail dress. It was sexily short, but not enough that it spoiled the surprise of her perky butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi sensed a presence behind her and it smelled of liquor and sweat. Turning around, she wasn't surprised to find Greg, his towheaded countenance pinkish from a day in the equatorial sun. \"Where's Madison?\" she asked. \"Oh, you means the cow?\" Greg slurred. \"She's probably wandered off to get a fucking tacos, or something.\" Cassi was offended by Greg's brazen remark, and responded in a biting tone. \"You're drunk, Greg! Watch your mouth. Maybe its time we all left, come on!\" Her words flew right over Greg's head, as he leaned into Cassi, reaching around her slim waist for her supple rear, hand just making contact before he felt a rapid smack across his glassy-eyed face. To him this was simply a further invitation. Next thing, he lunged forward, wrapping his hands around a reeling Cassi, while attempting to place a wet kiss on her neck. He figured this would really turn her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there you guys are! Wait? What the fuck Greg? Cassi, you whore!\" Greg and Cassi froze in their awkward embrace upon hearing the familiar voice. Cassi took the opportunity of the diversion to push the drunken fool off of her, but by the time she turned to the doorway, Madison was already gone.</span></div></div>",

Not only was it another weekend in which the social queen of Powers U would be able to hit the town with her and her sorority friends, but it also happened to be her 21st birthday, and after what had felt like forever, she would finally be legally able to drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't to say that Madison had not been drinking before, with a deep list of friends, she was always just one call away from procuring some Vodka for her and her sisters to drink in the sorority house. However, she could now go out to bars with the upperclassmen, something she was never able to pull off after the police started cracking down harder on the fake IDs that were previously used. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison's late birthday had been of great annoyance to her. Her other best friends in the sorority had already been 21 for months, and although they often stayed in to hang out with her, she felt somewhat left behind. There was Cassi, her friend since the first day of school two years ago, when they were freshman roommates. Despite their differing backgrounds, they became best friends, and roomed together in the house. Cassi was slightly shorter than Madison, and had blonde hair, and was slightly shorter than Madison, and was pretty skinny, coming in at 5'5 120 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Madison glanced away from the notes on her desk, she looked at a photo of her and Cassi, and their other two close friends in the sorority, all of them looking stunning. There was Kelsey, who was 5'6 125, and Asian, with black hair, who had only turned 21 two weeks prior and had already made Madison quite jealous, with her trips to the bars, and Anna, who was 5'9, brunette and weighed 130. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison had not really gotten to know Anna until they each took a calc class together sophomore year. Despite her usual academic prowess, Madison found herself struggling, and Anna, who she sat next to, offered to do study sessions with her, raising her grade in the class to a level that Madison was okay with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few additional hours of studying, Madison went to bed, as she lay there, waiting to fall asleep, she thought about the success of her first two and a half years of school, academically, and socially, and heck, even physically. Even though some girls had gained a bit of weight, or in rare instances, ballooned up, Madison with her strict self control, had not gained a pound. If she ever was going to drink at the house, she was sure to limit what she ate throughout the day, thus keeping her from throwing off her diet, that kept her weight at 5'7 130. </span></div></div>",

She was finally 21, and could partake in what she considered to be the last 'adult' milestone, drinking at bars. Dressed in their trendy outfits, the group; Madison, Cassi, Anna, and Kelsey went down to the warehouse district near campus, the Powers entertainment district. Given the close proximity of the campus to downtown, they were able to walk, which was a good thing, because by the time 9:30 rolled around, they were already quite lit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison had led the way, with her lower tolerance, and excessive birthday drinking. She had already consumed 4, <i>or was it 5? </i> beers beforehand, and a few vodka cranberrys in the sorority house with the others while they pregamed. As they got to the bar, there were no shortage of guys who were willing to congratulate Madison on her 21st with a drink, and the opportunity to chat her up. As more and more drinks came, Madison lost her remaining competence and Cassi took the role of making sure Madison wasn't going to fall into any trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not to say the others were not drinking as well. Anna, one who was always down for a good time, had gotten very drunk, but was overshadowed by Madison on this rare occasion. Her reasons were different. Yes, she was out to have a good time, but it was also because she wanted to run into a guy, Aaron, and be loose enough to just talk to him, without any nervousness. It was not typical for her to have this kind of trouble, but he was special, she thought, so she wanted to make sure it worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey mainly worked around the bar, running into people she knew, and drinking with most of them as the night progressed. It was a clinic in drinking for the girls, yet not out of the ordinary from any other college campus on a nice spring evening. This was how they partied at Powers, and Madison was happy to be a participant. </span></div></div>",

During the week (save for nights after chapter, or the occasional Thursday) she had been studying, and keeping up with her assignments and notes. However, the weekends were another story. Madison, Anna, Kelsey, and Cassi had been going out--and going hard twice every weekend. Madison was having a blast. She had slept with a few guys that she wanted to throughout this period, and was continuing the social climb that had began when she stepped on campus. As she put on her underwear, she thought to herself, what could be in store for her. Sorority executive board? <i>Please</i> she thought, that was a given. Class President? <i>Too time consuming.</i> Sorority President? <i>Now that's something to aspire to.</i> It was the perfect fit for Madison. Something to show off her total package of looks, smarts, and social achievements. <i>Next fall is when it will all come together,</i> she thought as she grabbed a skirt and pulled it on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Madison noticed that it felt a bit tight. It was going to button, without much effort. But still, the skirt used to be, well, a bit looser. As she looked at her still shirtless body in the mirror, she noticed that she hard washboard abs in the mirror she noticed that they looked just a bit softer. Not even the precursor to a gut was there, but still, <i>We'll have to watch out for that.</i> For Madison, it was only a casual thought. Nothing to be alarmed by. She was still working out, and plus, when summer came, she planned to have everything cool down a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the hall of the sorority house, Anna had already gotten ready and poured herself a gin and tonic while browsing through Facebook. <i>Soooo many photos have been uploaded this month</i> she thought, while browsing through the ones from last weekend. <i>Man, do we look good.</i> However, as she got to a few of them, she wondered about the angle of a few photos. <i>Is that the outline of my belly?</i> Anna looked in closer. It wasn't so much pressing up against her shirt in front as on the sides, but it looked like she had small love handles. Five pounds max, she thought to herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night while pregaming, they discussed their summer plans. Kelsey seemed to have the most exciting ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo, are you excited for Houston?\" Cassi asked Anna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's going to be such hard work, but it could be a once in a lifetime opportunity.\" Anna responded. She had gotten an amazing internship further south in Houston at one of the top oil companies. Anna always seemed like the odd one out, with her petroleum engineering major, chosen to put her intellect to the test quite quickly, in one of the most lucrative fields. If her work was deemed of high enough quality, and her grades senior year held, she could have a job that paid over $250,000 per year out of college, the reward for years of hard work. However, this meant that she would be gone for the summer, and wanted to get every last night in that she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison, did you get your internship?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'll be working downtown in the 31st street office of HDK.\" She responded, quite pleased. HDK was a well known investment firm that was located in Powers. Although her parents were rather torn up about it, Madison decided to try to get a summer internship in Powers, as opposed to back home in Miami. Yes, Miami would have been more fun, but she thought she should focus on creating a network in Powers, and this was certainly a good first step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky, I'm back at the SAT prep course,\" Kelsey chimmed in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you'll be out earning all of us,\" Madison replied, trying to remind Kelsey of that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now.\" She said. Kelsey did not completely know what she wanted to do after school, Madison assumed it would be law school, or maybe an MBA, get a academic track PHD?. <i>Never-mind</i>, thought Madison, <i>Kelsey has no idea what she wants to do next year. She'll probably be content just working out the whole summer, it's all she seems to do now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi sat there silently. She knew that her accomplishments were not going to look as great in comparison. She was bar-tending over the summer. She knew it was going to be as good of money as Kelsey was making, she could stay in town, plus, it was fun, so she thought it was a good way to kill a few months, however, it seemed much less door opening to her, something her friends seemed to care very deeply about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of these girls had grand plans for the future, yet they were half an hour away from being extremely college, and they finished their drinks and got ready for another night on the town. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was Thursday, and Madison had just finished her last final of her junior year and walked up into the top level of the sorority house where Anna's room was. On her way to her room, she walked past a still studying Anna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you drew the crap finals schedule this year.\" Madison said to Anna from the hallway. Turning around, Anna responded, \"It always seems to break this way. The last two years I've had at least one Friday final. I'm going to be sooo happy when it's over.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad, some of us are going out tonight.\" Madison replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not a shock\" Anna said. She knew first hand that all of them had been constantly frequenting the bars and partying, and her bank account was a testament to that. From an extremely middle class family, Anna at times felt out of place amongst her girlfriends in the sorority, and Madison, Cassi, and Kelsey in particular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had already gone to Cassi's parent's farm once, and saw that although the family didn't control an agribusiness empire, they were clearly doing well. She had met Kelsey's Dad, Dr. Jeon, a surgeon. Then, from spring break her sophomore year, she remembered her awe as she stepped into Madison's house and saw how nice everything looked, and it's proximity to the beach. These girls were all of varying levels of privilege, but higher than her's. Perhaps that was why she was the only one who got queezy when she opened her credit card bill a few weeks ago. <i>I know we were spending a lot, but not this much.</i> She thought to herself at the time. Luckily, her summer internship was paid, but her budget was seriously strained by the many nights of bar tabs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't the only thing that was strained. In the weeks since they had started drinking, Anna thought that she noticed her friends looking a bit more...soft. It was only something that would be noticed by a roommate-very minimal, but Madison and Cassi in particular seemed to lack their hard abs she was used to seeing when they all worked out together. She had no idea what they weighed, and did not give it much thought, but once in a while, she noticed. One person she never worried about in this respect was Kelsey. She knew that Kelsey's family was thin, and Kelsey was far to in love with her fit/sporty appearance to never put anything on. <i>Whatever, they'll all work it off in the summer</i>. Between the risk of gaining some weight and the money all of them were spending, Anna was increasingly happy that she would be in Dallas on the internship for the summer, earning money, and avoiding parties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 5 minutes later, Anna heard a door close, it was Madison, leaving to take a jog around the neighborhood and then through campus. She had kept up her running regine. She wasn't stupid. She knew that this level of partying was not good for her, so she tried to step up her workouts. A jog with the briskly paced Kelsey was always something to look forward to, and with the hot guys in the gym, she didn't mind making trips over there either. Of course, there were limitations. Whenever she was hungover, gym was usually out of the question, instead getting a burrito or something greasy from the cafeteria usually had to suffice, since it made her feel better, and during hangovers, she was in no mood to count calories, but that was only two-three days per week, she reasoned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile jogging, Madison ran into Kelsey, who was just leaving the gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going out tonight?\" Madison asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it. Have to celebrate the end of finals.\" Kelsey said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've done for a whole day now.\" Madison was correct in that, Kelsey had one of the better draws, being done on Wednesday morning, at the expense of an earlier study schedule than the rest of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, after how much work these were, I think I deserve another night of going out with Powers' preeminent party queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No complaints over here.\" Madison responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Madison finished her jog. Sweaty and exhausted, she got back to the sorority house and walked past Anna's room again, where she was still studying. <i>She never quits...to have that kind of work ethic.</i> Madison thought as she got into her room. Following a quick shower, Madison, not wearing anything except her towel, saw her scale on the floor. It had not been used in a while, since nothing felt tighter, but know this weekend was going to be one of indulgence, Madison decided it was time for a look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>137.9</i> was the number that starred her in the face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<i>Oh...that's not good.</i> Madison thought, as she looked at it, thinking it was about 4 pounds more than she expected. She looked at her stomach. It was flat, and still the envy of many, but it was indeed softer, and could not longer be considered six-packish. <i>Better watch out for that this summer</i> were her final thoughts on the subject, before trying to decide what to wear that evening.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kelsey walked into the SAT test prep office. She was not particularly excited for another summer at this job, but at least it paid well--very well. Everything about it struck her as unexceptional. It was a nice building, but unremarkable. The work was tedious, but not hard. It was more well respected than waiting tables for the summer, but nothing people would ever be impressed by. She had gotten the job somewhat easily because of her very high SAT score, so high in fact, that she had surprised herself when she got it. She politely greeted her old boss Brad, who was the owner of the company, and about 40.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Brad, how was your year?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Busy,\" he cordially replied, while they walked to his office, \"there is someone I want you to meet, his name his Kyle, I brought him on this summer as well, to handle the extra influx of students we have this year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kelsey walked in, she was greeted by a gorgeous guy. A bit ovr 6'1, with a trim physique that seemed to match her own. Dark hair and a strong jaw line, Kelsey was caught off guard a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Kyle, I hear we are going to be working a lot together this summer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Umm, Kelsey, ah yeah.\" was her first lines that she could spit out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle is home from college out of state,\" Brad filled her in<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, senior year is next year, so I'm excited to get back.\" Kyle continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Perhaps there will be something fun about this job</i> Kelsey thought as the meeting got started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around lunch and Anna was starting to get a bit hungry. Over her first day at Williams Energy was a busy one, getting to know the team members, meeting her boss, going over her duties, and paging through the handbook. She had just gotten into Houston a few days before. Anna had not been lying when she said it was a great internship. Put up in a four star hotel in Houston downtown right next to where she worked, she was surprised by her nice digs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe casually walked into her boss' office and asked, \"Hey Susan, what is the lunch policy around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, did I not mention it?\" Susan responded. She was a friendly, middle aged woman, who looked good for her age, but over the past 10 years, around 20 pounds had floated on to her 5'8 frame, putting her at 160. Susan continued, \"right now, over the summer when it's rather busy, we just order in food and the company picks it up in exchange for us working.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's great of them.\" Anna remarked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a nice perk.\" Susan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Powers, Madison was hungover from another night of partying. Her internship did not start until next week, so she had taken advantage of her free time in the form of socializing. She had been eating out nearly every night, and then hitting the town. Unfortunately for her, this week of non-stop indulgence took a tool. After using the rest room, Madison saw her scale in the corner, unused since she last saw she was at 137 pounds. She could not decide if she was bloated at the moment, or if she actually had picked up weight, so she bit the bullet and stepped on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n142 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ohhh....shit!</i> Madison was not happy about this. 12 pounds was actually something signficant for her. This was no longer just a bit of weight she could lose overnight. <i>Crap, if I get to 15 pounds, that would be a big deal</i> she thought to herself. For Madison, she always had been slightly smug that she was never one of the people who always talked about shedding that \"15 pounds\" or \"last bit of fat\" but here she was, 12 pounds heavier and looking at her body, trying to figure out how noticeable it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe no longer felt completely comfortable with her stomach. It was soft, and she knew that was the result of the partying. <i>Hmm, I'll have to cut back.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cassi walked out of the bar exhausted. It was 2:30, half an hour past close, and the streets of the entertainment district were starting to thin out, with some people trying to sneak in a late night snack from a food truck before ending the evening. She had been working since 7 PM, so all she wanted to do was get back to her SUV, and drive back to the sorority house. However, on her way back, she ran her intoxicated roommate at a food truck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEYY!!!! CASSI!!\" Madison screamed, hugging Cassi with a high level of enthusiasm for someone she saw nearly every day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Madison, are you in line?\" She asked, thinking about how Madison usually avoided these things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the rest of the group I came with went home,\" Madison said, trailing off with her voice and not even attempting to make contact with Cassi. At that point the people in front of Madison got their change and left, leaving Madison up to order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I have 2 gyros pleasseeeee?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Thanks Madison!\" Cassi said. Thinking,  \"<i>Even when drunk, she's thinking about her friends, that's so nice of her.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\" She said, blankly starring at Cassi, before suddenly putting her head up into the truck window to yell, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!!! Can I add another gyro please?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi was somewhat surprised by what she was witnessing. Her friend being sloshed in public, without the assistance of anyone else to make sure nothing happened, before she had gotten there, that is. Beyond that, Madison was ordering a huge amount of food for herself. After thinking about it for a second, Cassi realized that she had seen a lot of fast food wrappers around the house after nights on the town, drunkfood to appease Madison's growing appetite after an already high amount of liquid calories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Madison's food came, they walked to Cassi's SUV. Madison quickly jumped in the passanger side, and started on the first gyro, before Cassi had even gotten in the car. As she was eating, Cassi took the chance to look at Madison's stomach, which was visible under the short dress she was wearing.  Cassi also took note of Madison's legs. It seemed her drinking demeanor was not the only thing that had changed since Madison became old enough to go out to the bars, as Madison's thighs looked slightly larger and a bit softer. Her skin was still very tan from hours of being outside this summer, and the indulgence was not really too noticeable, however, Cassi realized that she would probably not consider Madison to be 'fit' anymore, as much as average. Given Madison's great looks, however, she was still something close to a 10 for nearly every guy in the school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following evening, Kelsey and Kyle got back from dinner absolutely stuffed. It was their 3rd dinner date of the week, something they each really enjoyed. They were not officially dating yet, but each of them went out of their way to have lunch every day together, many times a quick trip to a fast casual place, and they were now hanging out after work as well. They had gone to a new gourmet burger place that just opened this evening, and he was dropping her back off at the sorority house. Kelsey had indulged with fries, notable, because she already had been indulging all week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was making the job something Kelsey looked forward to, in sharp contrast to previous summers, where she had to drag herself out of bed to go teach somewhat spoiled high schoolers some of the most stale material imaginable. He had been enjoying it as well. They shared many mutual interests, from the Powers basketball team (Kelsey being a current student, and Kyle growing up in the area), to crappy reality television (a guilty pleasure for each of them), to even cars (Kelsey had grown up reading her Dad's auto magazines, Kyle worked at a mechanic's garage in high school.) Given the series of things they hit it off on, it was odd that they never considered working out together. Both Kelsey and Kyle had rigours workout scheldules throughout the school year, Kyle, because it helped him relive stress, and Kelsey because she always wanted to look her best to make girls jealous and guys interested. Now, with each of them in deep infatuation, neither was really working out like they would have in a normal summer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere Kelsey usually took the time to jog after work, she would invite Kyle to a happy hour, or grab dinner with him. When it got to be later in the evening, she would end up just running to Madison's room to talk about how excited she was about the relationship, or invite Kyle to stay for a movie in her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kyle dropped Kelsey back off at her car, she got out, but then turned around and leaned down into the open window on the passenger side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle, you also have work off tomorrow morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think Brad had the offices closed because they were spraying or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....want to maybe crash at my place tonight?\" Kelsey wondered why she was inserting 'crash' in, when each of them knew what she was asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Kyle said, trying not to sound too excited. \"I'll park the car and be right there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJubilant, and a bit nervous, Kelsey walked to the front door, waiting for Kyle to walk up, <i>Crap</i> she thought to herself, <i>I hope we don't have to file any HR paperwork</i>. She also moved to touch her bloated stomach, still feeling the effects of the meal, <i>Hopefully he'll realize I'm just full, and it's not always like this.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kelsey anxiously waited in the foyer of the sorority house with her sundress over her bikini, which she now knew was tighter than she had previously remembered. After another month of dating Kyle, she knew that she had lost some tone, but when she tried on her bikini, she never expected love handles to be present. She had known all month that she had picked up a bit of weight, but she was trying not to think about it, and Kyle never mentioned anything, so how bad could it be? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her credit, Kelsey had tried to weigh herself a few days prior, mustering up the courage to figure out what her actual weight was. The fit 3rd generation Korean had always been extremely fit, so she had been noticing, with displeasure, that many of her clothes felt tighter. As she stepped on the scale, she was nervous, <i>Here goes...</i> she thought, while she stepped on the digital scale that her Mom had gotten her before she left for college. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>E</i> was the reading that starred back at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me?! It's broken?\" she said, angry that an expensive piece of equipment had failed at the only job it was purchased for. What she did not know was the batteries were just dead. Another girl, Megan, had been using the scale in the bathroom that was shared by both their rooms. However, this allowed Kelsey to put off actually finding out just how bad it was. <i>5 pounds...tops</i> she thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had reason to fret, for the past two weeks she knew about the pool party that Kyle had been invited to by one of his friends from high school. Kelsey was not all that concerned about Kyle seeing her in a bikini, he had already seen a lot more than than, but she was concerned about making sure she looked the best in public, especially compared to the other girls that would be there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer concern turned into nervousness as she tried on her bikini that afternoon. It was her bikini she had used for the past two years. She got it from one of the trendy stores in town, and although it was not racy, like any bikini, it showed a lot. When she pulled it up, she noticed that she could feel the fabric up against her butt much more closely than she ever had before. More worrisome, the previously mentioned love handles were ever slightly present. When she put the top on, she did not notice it to be much different than she remembered, but her bottom half had definitely gotten a bit bigger. Kelsey was not looking forward to the afternoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they drove up to the house, Kelsey was a tad more at ease. It was about 45 minutes from campus, safely in suburbia, clearly one of Kyle's friends parent's house, very typical McMansion, and very large with nearly identical houses sporting manufactured differences. The overly green lawns and landscaping that hugged the curvy, non-grid roads temporarily threw off Kelsey, as it stood in such a difference from the Powers campus. However, when they exited the car and got down to the pool, she immediately felt insecure again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were about 10 other guys there and 10 other girls, and all 10 of these girls had bodies that rivaled Kelsey's a month ago. They were gorgeous. It should not have surprised her that her hot boyfriend hung out with these people, heck, Kelsey was one of them too, but she was kind of hoping that he maybe was a nerd who got hot later, so her recent softness would not stand out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything okay?\" Kyle asked, noticing how stiff his girlfriend seemed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's fine.\" Kelsey said unconvincingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well, I hope you like everyone, we've all stayed in touch.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were suddenly interrupted by a girl who hollered from the pool, \"KYLE! Is that her?! We want to meet your new girl!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to Kelsey, \"trust me, let's go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were standing at the top of a hill in the backyard, next to patio furniture that everyone else had put their clothes on, so Kyle removed his shirt. Kelsey noticed something...Kyle had a bit of a belly. It wasn't huge, but it was there...and it was also soft. For someone who had a great six pack when they first started hooking up, she wondered how she had not noticed this. Wishful thinking? Seeing him shirtless from a distance of more than a few feet perhaps? Regardless, he had definitely gained weight as well, and seemed able to roll with it. Even though she was in no way okay with her own gain, he boyfriend's confidence gave Kelsey the push she needed to disrobe and meet the waiting peers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison checked her phone while at her cubicle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna: Ugh, they are giving us so much food here during lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe texted back, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it. All the middle aged women who work here always seem to bring in food, it's insane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna: Well, at least we can work it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison didn't know what Anna's weight situation was in the slightest. She was not going to ask, since she suspected someone as image conscious as Anna would be fine, but hers had now reached a point of very serious concern. Her work appropriate skirt was beyond tight. When she sat down, and even when she stood up now, the outline of her stomach was clearly visible, being hung up by the tightness of the fabric. Her button up work blouse also felt tight not only in her stomach, but also the arms, which also alarmed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse, she just received an email,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi everyone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan brought bagels for everyone in the accounting team! Help yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison knew that she should not, but she was so hungry. She glanced at the clock in the corner of the computer, trying to figure out if she could make it to lunch. --9:47-- She then knew it was not going to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the kitchenette, she politily greeted a coworker, who had just grabbed an onion bagel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Man, that butt looks larger than in May</i> he thought to himself, before his mind wandered back to if him or his wife was taking their youngest to soccer practice that evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison looked over the bagels, and saw the one she wanted. A large cinnamon one, starring back at her. She knew it was not healthy, but she could not resist. She grabbed it, and after brief dilberation, gave in to her momentarily limited self control and grabbed both halves, then proceeded to coat them in cream cheese. After two months in the office, Madison had discovered how much she loved large amounts of cream cheese on her bagels, but always felt guilty, knowing that each one was a calorie bomb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater in the day, Madison was walking back to her desk after grabbing some copies. As she sat down, she heard a slight tear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh no. Oh no. Shit!</i> she thought as she paniked and tried to find where the rip was. She knew it was not a total tear, but hoped this was manageable. Madison quickly located it on the right side of her skirt, a burst seam the culprit. She tried to walk to the bathroom, while covering that side of her skirt with her notepad to shield the damage. When she got in, she realized she could conceal it to her coworkers by untucking her blouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5:00 could not come fast enough for Madison now. When she got home she raced upstairs and to the scale to see what the damage from her indulgence and sedentary work lifestyle had been. She quickly took off her clothes, and jumped on her scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n156 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" screamed Madison, in deep shock. She knew she gained a lot of weight, but this much? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over her body, and it had dawned on her, she needed to lose this weight if she wanted her senior year to be as planned. Sorority President, hot guys at the formals, being able to own a room when she walked in, all of it hinged on her spending the second half of her summer getting back into shape. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Neither of them wanted to mention it, the end of summer was coming, and both Kelsey and Kyle were not ready to part ways. Despite the potential awkwardness of an office romance, neither of them ran into much trouble during the summer at the SAT prep office. They had informed their boss Brad that they were seeing each other, but rather then have any policy against it, he had just responded with a polite, \"Well, just don't let it interfere with your tutoring. Remember, these kids and their parents are paying money to take classes from each of you,\" and that was it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow however, the summer romance was coming to an end. Kyle had to go back to school on the east coast, and Kelsey, with only one year left of school, was going back to Powers. Neither of them thought following the other was a good idea, each had already made their class schedules, but they vowed to visit. Over dinner, they made a plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, it's only a 2 and a half hour plane ride,\" Kelsey said, \"and you could always come back to visit your parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true,\" Kyle responded, \"fall break is right around the corner. Plus, maybe the down time can help me shed some of these pounds.\" While saying that Kyle, motioned, touching his belly. The fitness freak had gained around 15 pounds over the summer, most of it going to his stomach, as he had enjoyed going to the bars and hitting up restaurants with his girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really.\" Kelsey responded, \"You're not alone in that\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe past month had been one of expansion for Kelsey. She was especially thankful that the pool party had been in mid July, and not a month later. Since then, she had been indulging even more, as summer bliss had moved to the realization that her and Kyle would have to part ways in a bit. Because of that, she had gained 15 pounds over the course of the month, something she was only recently aware of, after Megan had finally replaced the batteries in her scale. However, on top of the previous weight, her total had come to 150 pounds since Madison's 21st birthday, a gain of 25 pounds on her 5'6 frame, and it was noticeable. Her legs had continued to grow, and she thought that her thighs looked almost chubby at this point. Additionally, her stomach seemed like it was on the verge of being a belly. Her butt had also seen significant growth, and she had already had to buy new size 10 pants, temporary ones, as she told a still-thin Cassi, who had gone shopping with her that day, however, having to move up regardless was still a slap in the face. Kelsey probably was not considered chubby, but this still devastated her to be this size. In an odd way, the only thing keeping her from feeling worse. That and Madison, who had put on a ton of weight this summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the week, her summer job would be finished, Kyle would be back at school, and Anna would be back from Houston. Kelsey had not seen Anna since she left for her summer internship months ago. She was not looking forward to having Anna see her bloated body, especially since she knew the place Anna had been staying was a gym, and she doubted that the image conscious Anna would look any different from the day she left, especially with the heavy workload and non-social summer she had. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison had originally planned on putting on a skirt with a cute top during that late afternoon to great Anna at the airport, however, as she soon found out, that was going to get a bit more complicated than she had planned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, clooosseee\" she said, sucking in her now sizeable gut, trying to get it in the flaps of the skirt. After a few tried she sat on the bed, dejected, letting her gut almost sit in her lap. \"Fine.\" She said out loud, to no one in particular, \"I guess it's time to face reality,\" and followed that up by walking to the scale in the bathroom, unused since July. She nervously disrobed, and expected the worst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-164.2-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood there silently, with the 164 pound reading staring back at her. <i>Oh my god, I've gained 34 pounds since the spring, oh no no no.</i> Madison looked at the mirror, and should could tell. Her muffin top was now rather obvious. Her boobs looked bigger, but also lacked the previous perkiness that she really loved, and considered to be better than her current situation. She looked at her thighs, which had clearly grown, and then moved to her butt, a location of significant deterioration. Even her arms seemed softer than she remembered them being last month, and she wondered how pinched they would look in the sleeves of some of her polo shirts she had not worn for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Screw it,</i> Madison thought, <i>sweats today.</i> The former hottest girl in the class, now on the verge of being considered chubby decided that for at least today, she would be seen at the airport, in sweatpants and her Powers sweatshirt, because dressing nicely did not feel worth it. After she had pulled the sweatshirt over her head, she heard Cassi yell from down the stairs, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison! We're ready, where are you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming!\" she said as she sliped a pair of women's boat shoes on, and ran down the three flights of stairs, to the foyer of the sorority house, where the other girls were waiting. She starred at her two other best friends, and took inventory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi was there, wearing shorts and a Powers-T shirt. Despite working at a bar all summer, it appeared that Cassi had sustained the least weight gain, nothing that could be seen from her eye, leaving her with her great figure to complement her cute face and blonde hair. When Madison turned to Kelsey, the same could not be said about her body. Kelsey had landed somewhere between Madison and Cassi in terms of gain. Kelsey had clearly gained some weight in her legs and belly, but seemed to be pulling it off in well fitting shorts and a nice top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ride to the airport, Madison was the first to touch the subject, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How quickly until Anna brings up my weight?\" she asked. Madison knew that Cassi and Kelsey shared her assumption that Anna kept her perfect figure, given her tendencies for perfection, and her desire to stay fit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it, Anna would not do that.\" Cassi said, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, you're not the only one who indulged this summer.\" Kelsey said, \"I think we need to worry about girls we are not as close with anyways.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison nodded her head silently, she knew Kelsey was right. Just as they had done in previous years, she knew other girls on campus would use any imperfections in a sorority's members against them during recruitment. <i>If we become known as the fat sorority, we're finished</i> she thought to herself while she looked out the window. She also wondered how this would affect her chances of being President of the sorority, but she figured she still had the hold on the 60 other some girls in her chapter to make that happen regardless of what had happened to her figure over the summer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the airport, they waited, until they saw Anna...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The girls all waited curbside in Cassi's SUV for Anna to emerge from the doors of the baggage claim. They all were expecting her, but had no idea what was about to greet them. They were expecting the 5'9 stick think brunette who weighed around 130. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she emerged from the doors, and all three girls immediately saw her at the same time, falling into stunned silence as she walked towards the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi leaned over to Madison, and quietly said, \"Oh my gosh, Anna got chubby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison never would have suspected this, Anna was always the most health conscious of all of them, all she could spit out in response; \"Wow, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all scanned her body through the windows of the SUV. Her face looked, softer, throwing all of them off guard. Unlike Kelsey's slight pudge, and Madison's gradual gain, this was the first they had seen of her since the spring, and were not used to seeing the start of a double chin forming on her. Her arms had also grown, looking soft. Not huge like that of a 200 pound girl, but clearly soft, in sharp contrast to the sticks that she used to have. It didn't seem like her belly had gained a ton of weight--it was clearly there, with lovehandles on the side to match, but it just wasn't a gut hanging over her shorts. Speaking of which, her shorts showed off the largest extent of her gain. Gone were her toned and slimmed, seeming never ending legs from the spring, now, shaking as she walked towards the car, were pale thunder thighs, soft, and long past the point where she would have a thigh gap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls in the car all wondered how much she gained, the answer, was a whopping 45 pounds in 3 and a half months, an incredible gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got to the car, she threw her stuff in the trunk, and jumped in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison who was sitting in the back couldn't keep herself from starring at the pale flesh off her thighs that seemed to spread in the rear bench seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So great to see everyone! Thanks so much for picking me up!\" Anna said to everyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison, Kelsey, and Cassi all wondered if they should say something, or just never reference the weight...ever. None of them had the courage to bring it up, or at least before she could drop another bomb on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I wanted to keep it a secret until we could properly celebrate...\" Anna said, with excitment, \"but I can't wait to tell you girls, I GOT A JOB OFFER!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instinct for the rest of them was to scream with her in excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH YAY!! Madison said in response, \"Where at?!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to be in Houston at Williams Energy! They were so impressed with my work, they signed me to begin next spring, after we graduate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to celebrate tonight!!!!\" Kelsey chimed in. </span></div></div>",

If you haven't noticed, I struggled with that too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just...they kept ordering in lunch so we could continue to work over lunch, and staying in a hotel...I kind of ordered in most of evenings and just lounged around watching TV. I'm so stupid, I should have never let this happen to myself.\" Anna said, dejected and sad about her situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's make a work out plan this fall! Come on, this isn't us. We can lose the weight,\" Madison suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess. We have a bigger problem in front of us, our clothes.\" Anna said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Maybe we take a quick trip to the mall?\" Madison suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May as well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they got to the mall, they noticed that each of them were not particularly excited to be shopping, as opposed to normal. Anna learned that she was now a size 10, and proceeded to buy some skirts that were longer than normal, in addition to some short shorts. In the dressing room, Anna looked at how the shorts reflected on her legs. She knew she was not fat yet, but the line was certainly in sight. She would describe herself as curvy bordering on chubby. She was not used to seeing her legs have this kind of circumference, and she sighed as she saw how soft they were. However, she knew her weight wasn't ideal, but she also wasn't atrocious yet, so she decided to get them and wear them that evening. She also got a shirt that somewhat showed off her softer arms. This disappointed her more, as she used to be so proud of her subtly muscular arms. \"Well....\" she thought to herself, \"maybe I can get some cardigans when fall rolls around to cover these up. Or better, yet, work this fat off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna stepped out of the dressing room as Madison was leaving her's. Madison wardrobe looked similar. She had a bit more of a belly that she was trying to hide in her purchases, and now had shapewear to help her support her new bulges. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they drove back to campus, Anna turned to Madison, and asked \"Hey...we can lose this weight...right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison sat there quietly, paused, and answered, \"Yeah, I think so, I mean....this just isn't us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them were thrilled about their situation, and each still felt they were thin girls trapped in curvy girls' bodies. </span></div></div>",

Sure, none of them were huge yet, but the rest of them; herself, Kelsey, and Anna, were no longer model thin. Of those three, Kelsey had fared the best, even though she herself did not feel that way. She was wearing dark navy shorts and a summery top that was a bit loose. Even with the looseness, Madison could tell that Kelsey's newfound softness was mainly in her lower half, with a slightly larger, and much less tonned butt, to go along with legs that were no where near as jiggly as Anna's, but still clearly softer and larger than they had previously been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the bar, a group of guys they usually hung out with were already at a table near the end of the bar.  The one that Anna had been previously pursuing, Aaron, leaned in towards his friend Jeff, and whispered, \"Umm...do they look larger?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff scanned the room and saw the girls walking in, clearly curvier and in Madison and Anna's case, maybe even running the line between curvy and chubby. \"Oh dude, yeah, that's not good,\" he agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey still drank with the girls, but no one went home with many of them, and Cassi seemed to be getting the most attention, with her thin body and still hot,blonde package. Madison could not decide if it was because of her weight, or if guys were just gunshy, but one thing was clear for her, she was going to need to lose the weight to get more action from the hot guys she was used to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey was not really in the mood to hook up anyway, she was still looking forward to the occasional weekend  with Kyle, however, that did not restrict her from having a good time, and she, like the rest of the group, overindulged on beer again that night. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison was fairly confident that she had the support to do this. Heck, didn't most people expect the sorority presidential elections to be a cakewalk for her? Now a senior, Madison had done everything necessary to put herself in the position to be the next President of their sorority. Ever the impressive student, the grades were there. Her outside extra-curriculars, with her past time put in at the student newspaper, and community service, were solid. Plus, she had been one of the most outgoing Juniors last year to the incoming freshman who were initiated, surly that had to mean something. At the moment, she could not even think of anyone who was running against her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got into the chapter room of the sorority house, she was alarmed to see a projector set up with the words shot onto the screen, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"President:<br>\r\nMadison Kraft<br>\r\nJennifer Stacy\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jennifer? </i> Madison thought, <i>I didn't even know she was interested in this.</i> This gave Madison some pause, but she was not overly concerned. Jennifer Stacy? Please. What could she edge her on? Jennifer was just a girl Madison considered to be a slut. She never had held another position in the sorority. If there was any reason for Jennifer to be in college, it was to get her \"Mrs.\" Degree. Always a marginal student, Jennifer did not have the natural smarts that Madison did. However, Jennifer did have one new advantage over Madison, she was a knockout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would not have been an issue the previous year. As Madison was her equal in that area, each looking hot enough to be models. However, as another girl put it, \"Madison just looks so bloated this year.\" Now, there was no contest, Jenifer was a knockout, Madison had an imperfection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer, of course, was willing to exploit this. She always thought Madison looked down on her, and since Ms. Perfect seemed vulnerable, she decided to take from her what every one in the sorority knew she wanted most--the distinction of being sorority President. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she was not as smart as Madison, but Jennifer knew how to work her angles. Avoiding Madison's friend group in the sorority, she had spent the previous few weeks reaching out to girls who Madison considered friends, pealing away votes, and using less then fair tactics. Jennifer mainly focused on recruiting, using arguments like, \"Listen, I hope she loses the weight, but you know how freshmen are. We are going to get the worst class of new pledges ever if we let her represent us. Girls want to get into an elite sorority, and we need an elite sister leading us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an unfair attack, but there was a bit of truth to that, so many members of the sorority were swayed. Madison did not know it, but she had a tough road ahead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna, in her position as the sorority member with with highest GPA from the previous year, chaired the first meeting in the absence of an elected President. Cassi and Kelsey sat in one of the chairs, assuming that Madison still had this thing in the bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter speeches, the three of them assumed Madison still was on path the breeze to the Presidency. Madison gave a great speech, talking about specific plans to appeal to new pledges, ways she could raise alumni donations, and her plans to get administration off their backs to avoid probation if things ever got out of hand during parties. Jennifer, on the other hand, gave a disjointed speech, full of vague statements. After it was over, Kelsey leaned over to Cassi and muttered, \"I feel bad for Jennifer, Madison is going to crush her after that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna was part of the group of 4 other girls who counted ballots as they came in. As the first few trickled down, and heavily favored Jennifer, Anna thought to herself, \"That's weird, these must have been from a pocket of Jennifer's friends.\" As more and more came in, it became clear to Anna that Madison was going to lose. She could not text Madison to let her know her fate, she just had to go ahead with it. She shot a grim look to Kelsey, who was equally surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh,\" thought Kelsey, who knew immediately that something was wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Madison and Jennifer were brought back into the pledge room, Anna announced, \"I think we can agree that either of these girls would have been great Presidents.\" It was a lie, she could not believe the decision she was about to announce. \"I hope everyone can congratulate Jennifer on her election as President.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was shocked. She looked over at Anna confused. <i>How could this be?</i> she thought to herself. <i>I courted all those votes last year. How is this possible</i> She congratulated Jennifer, and walked out of the room, to her bedroom. Anna followed her into the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck, Anna?\" Madison asked, starting to cry, \"how did this happen?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea.\" Anna said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it close?\" Madison said, prompting Anna to look at the ground, not wanting to lie to her friend if the results go out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm,\" Anna said, \"No. Not really, she kind of ran away with it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison ran up to her room, but not before grabbing some ice cream to eat while crying. She was humiliated, and could not believe what had just happened to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs was typical for a group of college students, it was hard to keep secrets, and it eventually got back to Madison how Jennifer had won. \"That bitch,\" Madison said to one of the Sophomores who told her what Jennifer had said about her. Madison had moved from being sad to angry, but the lingering insecurities about her new body were only further entrenched.   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kelsey weighed herself after another workout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n159. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ugh,how is this possible</i>, she thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far she she knew, she was doing enough work to lose some of the pudge she had picked up during the summer. She knew that was not the case, given that her new clothes felt tighter, but she was doing the things that used to work. She jogged and hit the gym, even though those had become major struggles. She was trying to eat right, so what was the X factor that was changing everything? She knew the answer, the drinking. All of the girls had been drinking more than they previously had, now that they were able to go to the bars. As Kelsey looked at her body, she was surprised that her stomach was still somewhat soft, but that most of the it had gone to her butt and thighs, again, she knew that would change if more weight went on--something she was determined to avoid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she walked back to the dorm, she saw Anna leaving the library. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ugh, how does she do it?\"</i> Kelsey thought to herself. Anna had clearly lost around 10 pounds, something that she was proud of. Anna was able to sneak in workouts between classes, stick to a diet that mainly consisted of salads, and when they did drink, which was frequent, she stuck to gin and water. Anna was functioning at an extremely high level, as she was used to, and it was paying off, now that she was already down to 160 on her 5'9 body. This was still unacceptable to Anna, but she was pleased to be going in the right direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she exited the library, Anna spotted Kelsey, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Anna said, seeing the sweaty sorority sister, \"how was the workout.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...sometimes I wonder if it is all worth the effort.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up,\" Anna said, \"you'll work the weight off, you already look better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Kelsey and Anna knew she was lying. The new weight was clearly evident in Kelsey's lower half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you get to the gym so often?\" Kelsey asked Anna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not act like I'm a good roll model here, I still gained all the weight this summer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...yeah, but.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, it's hard. I feel like I'm barely keeping up in class, and the gym has just been a release for me. I enjoy being able to sweat it out after a rough day.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey wondered how Anna could keep going like that. She knew that Anna put the most time of all of them in at the library. It just seemed like Anna never had any personal time, it was always go, go, go, with her, and she wished she had that kind of drive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Anna got back to her dorm room, she saw she had an email from her Mom that read, \"Anna, please call me when you get a chance.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna was alarmed. It was not like her to be intentionally vague like that. She had no idea what to expect, but she immediately called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, it's Anna, is anything wrong?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna,\" from the first line, Anna knew the news would not be good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your Dad...he got laid off from the company.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna gasped. Her parents were very middle class, and although she knew her parents had some put away in savings, she could not imagine it had been much, given how much she had received in financial aide during her time at Powers. She heard her Mom crying on the other end of the line. This was bad. Anna did not really know what to say, so she just asked about the situation, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does he, umm, know what he is going to do?\" She asked, feeling awful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know...we just assumed that his branch was safe, but they closed the whole office,\" her Mom responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the call did not go much better. After Anna hung up, she started crying. She wondered what her parents were going to do? How would they afford their mortgage? Or their bills? Would she have to drop out to start work and help them out? Anna had no idea what to do. At that moment, she felt hopeless, so she just started crying. After a few minutes, she went to the fridge, and just started eating. It didn't matter what it was, leftovers, snack food, ice cream, Anna cleared out the contents of her fridge. In the moment she didn't care, she just wanted to focus on eating, as opposed to what her parents were going through, and her uncertain future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna decided not to tell any of her friends what happened, since she was embarrassed. However, when Madison greeted her for dinner that evening, Madison noticed how much Anna pilled on her plate. Multiple slices of pizza, and a non-diet soda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tired of salads?\" Madison asked, somewhat sheepishly, since her weight had stayed frustratingly present since the start of the year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had a rough day.\" the pale brunette said. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She set her phone back down to grab a bite of her Chinese takeout, in which her intake of has increased in the past few of weeks due to her struggles with classes and making an effort to raise her grade. She needed to study, and this need meant she got hungry more, which showed itself more on her body, something that didn't make Kelsey happy to say the least. She set her container down again and took a look down at her stomach, something that was becoming more prominent with each one of her orders and the new 10 pounds she had aquired, and sighed again at the sight. Kelsey picked her phone back up and resumed her conversation with Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough about me, how's everything going for you? We haven't talked in such a long time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Kyle began to say, then paused. \"Why don't you open your door and ask me to my face?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey sprung off the couch (or as fast as a girl who's still adjusting to a now 35 pound gain can) and bolted to the door, throwing it open to see Kyle standing in the frame with a small suitcase and one of the biggest grins someone could have on their face. She threw her arms around him, though when she did she noticed that something felt off. Nevertheless, she cheered, \"You're here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say it a little louder so the whole building can hear you, why don't you,\" Kyle chuckled as he stepped into the apartment. He placed his suitcase in the corner of the living room and took a look around the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well when you said you've had a lot of Chinese food lately I definitely wasn't expecting this much,\" he said while surveying the piles of Chinese containers littering Kelsey's coffee table. She punched him in the shoulder and retorted, \"It's hard to do much else when I'm studying, I already told you that!\" Kyle laughed at her response then sat down and started eating her current open order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmmm, good pick,\" he told Kelsey while he chewed the chicken. Kelsey sat down with him and finally took in all of Kyle. She was so surprised by him being in her apartment that she hadn't really looked at him until now, and what she saw was not what she would have expected to say the least. As he opened his mouth to put the next bite of chicken in, there was a noticeable double chin forming when he opened his mouth. It wasn't a permanent one yet, but there was no denying his face had put on some weight, and that was certainly not the only area of him to have some added padding. Kyle's stomach resembled a beer gut, not huge but definitely rounded and was slightly beginning to sit on his thighs, another area that had without a doubt expanded. While Kelsey had no room to talk about weight gain considering her figure, she wasn't wrong to be a bit surprised by her boyfriend having looked to gain about the same amount of weight she had in a shorter period of time. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison couldn't believe that tomorrow was her twenty-eighth birthday. She felt as though just yesterday had been her first lecture in Carlton Hall, a bright faced freshman, so eager and full of promise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alarm woke her from a wistful dream of lying on the emerald-green quad at Powell, surrounded by warmth and belonging, back when her fantasies and aspirations had teemed with lofty visions of a professional career. These hopes had then blossomed into the search for true love, but her passionate affair with higher education proved to be a day lily, bursting forth with fire like a dwindling star. She thought of the lovely grass, a perfect kelly green, standing in sharp contrast to the red brick footpaths witch traversed it in number, forming a constellation from above. As she brushed the sleep from her eyes, sitting up in bed to undo her hair, these brick walkways brought to mind that bloody dress, how its strappy back of deep ruby red pressed tight against her skin, the goddamned Prada rag that Steven had gone to such trouble to bring back for her from Austria. Why on earth had she promised to wear it for her birthday party? She had gotten that dress months ago. Fashions had changed by now, Madison rationalized. How could she be expected to wear something like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, this was the last thing she wanted to be thinking of right now. On her birthday of all days, truly unbelievable. This was <i>her</i> day. This was Madison day. For once it wasn't Steven day, but still she was thinking about what <i>he</i> wanted, the bloody ungrateful bastard. He expected too much of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the curtains rose on an automatic timer and light streamed into the room, Madison noticed her reflection in the many-mirrored surfaces of the sleekly appointed bedroom. The fact that her glass likeness was the only object not like the others in the room deposited itself discretely into her vast library of denials. Steven, usually only a rumple in the down comforter at this hour, had not even left an imprint last night, the linens still pulled tight. Instead, there was a crystal wine glass laying on its side, above an angry red stain. Madison cursed under her breath. She would have to replace it without Steven noticing. She simply couldn't be bothered by these sorts of things, on today, of all days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly roused from her morning fog by the ringing of her phone on the bedside table, Madison felt a wave of comfort and reassurance pass over her, to see Cassi's familiar face flash onto the diamond-crisp display. Cassi would make everything right, just like she always had, for practically as long as Madison could remember. She had always been her most loyal friend, confidant, and sorority sister. They had stuck together like glue all through their time at Powell and even afterwards, Cassi finding work in retail, and Madison as a secretary for a law firm downtown. Cassi hadn't shared in Madison's \"luck\" in finding a rich man such as Steven. She was still a working girl, a single, but relatively prosperous regional director for a mid-level clothing chain by now, with an office at corporate out in the Midwest. Madison could never admit it, but deep down, she was jealous of her best friend's independence and success. Cassi made good on her own. Had Madison chosen the easy route like so many others? She always felt a strange breaking feeling deep inside of herself to see Cassi\u2019s frequent postings of exotic vacation photos on FaceTab. Steven took her for a week in Cabo on their honeymoon. She remembered him getting so drunk onetime he shat the bed. Madison had not been far out of the suburbs since. She let the phone ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMotion sensing lights flicked on, as Madison stepped into the master bathroom. Her feet were cold, until the heated floor was finished warming. She had become an expert at performing her morning toilet routine without ever catching a glance of her own reflection. Like a vampire only to herself, she did not appear in mirrors or photographs. If she had examined her appearance on this particular day, she would doubtless recall a number of things, not the least of which being that it was clearly evident her weight was becoming a serious problem. Madison would have surely noticed that her face appeared puffy and had an almost swollen quality. Her beautiful features had become buried under a thick layer of fat, like the mad impression of an over-zealous pottery sculptor, massing on ever more clay, the product of her endless pattern of overeating, and not to mention frequent over consumption of alcohol. A corpulent roll of chin fat, visible from every angle, had replaced Madison\u2019s neck. With her thick black mane of hair, well puffed up from a tumultuous night\u2019s sleep, reaching down to her well-padded shoulders, Madison would definitely have then been astounded by what had become of her pert young breasts. They had ballooned to an impressive size, but at the expense of their once pleasant perkiness, hanging a bit lower than Madison probably would have liked. Luckily for her, she now had a thick spare tire of a gut that her heavy boobs could rest on, giving her over-taxed back some much needed respite. Madison\u2019s bulging belly hung low and did a nifty disappearing trick on her lacey underwear that probably should have been replaced about 15 pounds earlier. From profile, her ample paunch extended several inches past her bust and transferred to far thicker hips at her sides, which often popped buttons and always fought a losing battle with elastic waistbands. She had know idea what she weighed, but the last time she dared to peek at a scale, the number had been 227, but that was months ago now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the steamy stream of the multi-head shower, Madison began to clean her growing body with a fluffy pink loofah, as she loathed to feel the spongey quality of her fat flesh. It was becoming harder for her to get to every deepening nook and cranny of her form. Spending nearly half an hour under the almost painfully hot water of the shower. She used this time to meditate on the day ahead, to calm her obsessive mind by coming to terms with her day\u2019s responsibilities. Madison could reasonably count this as a fairly stress-free day. All she really had on her to-do list was her birthday party later in the evening. Beside that, the entire rest of her time could be devoted to getting good and plastered, surely to be followed by a lot of greasy takeout.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison looked up from the crumpled remains of a couple of Big Macs, her favorite drunken meal, and glanced at the clock in the center console of the brand new white Mercedes CLK AMG. Yikes! She had let the time get away from her at the bar of a chain restaurant. Although, it was known more for its pancakes than it's Long Island iced teas, Madison preferred drinking there because she knew that she would never run into any acquaintances. She had few friends these days and had become a bit of a recluse, her out of control weight being a large blow to her once shining self-confidence and bubbly personality. When she did interact, it was usually with some of Steven's cadre of yuppie friends, or as they liked to be called, \"young professionals.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a fry from between the crease of her constantly touching thighs and popping it into her mouth, Madison put her spaceship-like vehicle hastily into reverse. She was really hoping to wait out and soak up her buzz with fatty food. But damn, it had gotten so late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was taking a major risk by driving in her still drunken state, but as is so often the case, the alcohol still very active in her system impaired her judgment. Madison struggled to keep things in her path from cloning themselves in her vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the saying goes, \u201ceverybody get\u2019s one,\u201d and Madison got hers in not being pulled over on her way home from Mcdonalds. Stumbling through the entryway, she did not expect to see Steven, who chastised her for making them late for the party. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRidiculous, she thought, the nerve of that foul man, especially hating how the veins in his forehead popped out when he was angry. She found it grotesque how they continued up his shiny scalp, ravaged it was by male pattern baldness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been handsome once, but now he seemed like an ogre to Madison. She wasn\u2019t sure whether it was his aged appearance that caused her to look at Steven differently, or if her more learned experience with his dysfunctional personality painted him in a more dubious light. This wasn\u2019t what she had signed up for, but then again, events had transpired which Steven had cause for grievance with as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Steven\u2019s point of view, Madison, his beautiful and voluptuous young Latino wife had turned into a total pig before his very eyes. Sure, she had a fair amount of junk in the trunk, by the time they met, and he had seen old photos of when she had really blown up in college, but she had to be even larger than that now. Madison had an even bigger beer gut than that fat fuck Larry from accounting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman he had married was practically a health nut. Steven had been more than happy to pay for her thrice-weekly Bikram yoga classes and expensive Nike running gear. He had even paid for a fitness room to be added onto his already spacious 3-bedroom six-bath house in a great neighborhood. Now he had lost 15 pounds and was running up to 6 miles daily, training for a marathon, while Madison\u2019s elliptical machine gathered dust in the corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe used to be a vegetarian, only drinking biologically diverse white wine with meals, but now he had decided to turn a blind eye to the astronomical bar tabs on her visa. Steven figured he might as well own a fast food restaurant for the level of those receipts alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the guise of becoming a wine connoisseur, he had allowed Madison to sign up for a mail order \u201cDistinct Wine List\u201d subscription. Stains everywhere now, two new sofas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven found her appearance to be disheartening. While he disliked yelling at her, he had always had a bit of a temper and it made him distressed to see her this way, clearly drunk, with smeared make up, standing in the hall with her pants unbuttoned. Her fucking stomach was literally oozing out of the too-small trousers.  He could see her ass from the front. The t-shirt, sporting a fashionable Chanel logo, hardly recognizable across the chest, was hardly much better. She had fifteen minutes, and that was final.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpstairs, in the master bedroom closet, Madison scrolled through her clothing hung on a powered rack. There it was, the fateful Prada dress, the dreaded rag. She didn\u2019t even think it was pretty anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was the big deal about Prada anyway? They had to seriously get over themselves. All these yuppies were so materialistic, only concerned with conspicuous consumption, keeping up with the Jones\u2019.  Madison seriously considered not even attempting to put on the clearly under-sized garment. Deep down, though, she knew she had to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding before a full-length mirror, forced to confront her countenance for aid in navigating the red cocktail dress up the treacherous slopes of her stout frame, Madison struggle to pull the haute couture past her fat thighs. The dress had refused to move past a point barely above her dimpled knees. Frustrated beyond all belief, Madison gave one final tug, and that was when she heard the first horrid sound of ripping fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck it, she thought.\u201d This damned thing was going on anyways, rips, or no rips, but as she would find, definitely rips. With the first tear allowing for the dress to come up to her butt, Madison now struggled to pull it over her lumpy rear. Finally it went, but at the expense of a rip in the hindquarters, exposing her pink panties and jiggly cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was the belly, or the Battle of the Bulge, as one might call it. Madison was really having a hard time fitting the front-piece over her huge gut. The dress zipped up the sides and was strapless with an open back, she was simply too wide for it, but damned if she didn\u2019t try her best. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe broke both the zippers and burst into tears, running down the stairs to find that Steven had left without her, on her fucking 28th birthday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Still \u201cwearing\u201d the remnants of the very expensive dress, Madison wailed madly as she shuffled down the main stairway, into the dining room, and over to the zinc-countered bar, tears further streaking her already ruined eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching her fat arm across and under the bar to grab a shiny new bottle of Stoli, her exposed belly pushed up and over the countertop, the cold metal making her shiver, plush body quivering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison filled a cut-glass tumbler almost to the rim, with the almost oily, clear liquid. The smell of it alone, was enough to send warm tingles down her spine. She had never quite recovered from her day at the bar, so it went down in a couple gulps like so much water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes later, the vodka bottle lay in a dry pile of glass upon the dining room floor. Madison, surely blacked out, had retreated to the kitchen pantry, sitting upon the floor with a bag of chocolate chips between her wobbly thighs. Her hands and mouth were covered in melted brown residue. She had even wiped some errantly across her swollen gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother twenty minutes of gluttony, and Madison\u2019s insides began to protest. Enough food, she thought. Time to grab a beer for the road and go to her fucking twenty-eighth birthday party, for christsakes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorona in hand, Madison swerved her way dangerously down the wide residential streets of their upscale neighborhood. This was her last chance to find some sense and turn around, or even get out and walk back, before she hit a major arterial and would get called in for DUI for certain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was too far gone, though. Subconsciously unable to confront her birthday party in this or any other state, for that matter, Madison\u2019s hedonism drove her towards the McDonalds she had visited earlier in the afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven glanced at his watch for what seemed to him like the thousandth time that evening. Where was she? At this point he was as much worried, as he was annoyed and frustrated. She had done some outrageous things before, but this made absolutely no sense. She had been talking about this party for weeks, as though thinking about nothing else, and now she doesn\u2019t show up? He felt guilty and at fault for leaving her at home. He had even driven back to the house an hour ago, to pick her up, having been gone for less than an hour and a half, but Madison was nowhere to be found and her car was missing from the garage. His many calls and text messages had gone unanswered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bright pearlescent face of the Rolex Mariner, read 10:45 PM, and Steven was beginning to fear for the worst when an attractive blonde waitress approached his table in the rented out lounge space, to inform him that a phone call was waiting for him with the ma\u00eetre de. <br>\r\nGulping down a final sip of cabernet, Steven followed the pretty young woman through the darkened space, past many confused looking friends, to the swanky club\u2019s lobby. He admired the fine lines of the waitress\u2019s rear-end as it moved, slinking from side to side with each step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulled from his daydream, by the attention of a man with a mustache and a cordless phone on a tray, Steven almost hated to pick up the receiver, absolutely certain that it would be bad news. He was absolutely right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt approximately 10:23PM on the night of Friday, September 3, Officer Robert Guevara of the Miami-Dade Police Department observed a white, late-model Mercedes sedan (license plate #981XXH) driving at a high rate of speed through the intersection of 4th St and Deltona. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing also that the vehicle appeared to be swerving, as though the driver was having difficulty maintaining a lane, Officer Guevara flicked on his lights and proceeded to give pursuit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the vehicle continued after three blocks with the Guevara signaling a stop, he engaged his siren and decreased the follow distance between his patrol car and the suspect vehicle. With headlights shining through to the interior of the Mercedes, Guevara was able to identify the driver as female, possibly Hispanic, with a heavy build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was positively freaking out! The cops were after her. The game was up. Why was she running? What the fuck was she doing? She had absolutely no idea at this point. Things were absolutely out of control. Planting her foot down hard on the accelerator, the powerful car shot forward down the strip-mall lined street. She took one last swig of her beer, before tossing the bottle out of the driver\u2019s side window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuevara had already called in for backup, in pursuit of what he now strongly suspected to be a DUI, judging from the beer bottle, thrown from the suspect\u2019s window, that whizzed past his car, shattering on the pavement. The chase had escalated to about 70 mph on a busy Friday night in Miami, and Guevara decided it was time to bring it to a swift end, before bystanders were put in any more danger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer drunken brain drawing a blank on how to proceed in this fantastic scenario, Madison locked her eyes on the golden arches visible just then about six blocks ahead down the strip. It was her birthday, and she needed a fucking Big Mac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing fuzzily over the cruiser\u2019s radio-set was an O.K. from the air unit for Officer Guevara to move in and terminate the high-speed pursuit. Other units had already blocked off all intersecting streets, and placed a spike strip about two quarters of a mile ahead, should he fail to stop the suspect vehicle by other means. A spiking at this speed could easily prove to have a deadly effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Close now, images of French-fries and chicken nuggets floated through Madison\u2019s detached mind. The police car was almost in her back seat now, the luxurious leather cabin aglow with red and blue lights. She leaned in over the steering wheel, engorged stomach pressing firmly into its lower curve. Madison was practically naked, the tattered dress mostly deteriorated at this point, only her lacey panties and overstressed bra maintained a speck of decency. She spilled out of the German-engineered driver\u2019s seat, hips bumping into the console and cup holder alike, shining brown eyes agleam in her fat face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it, the first time that Officer Robert Guevara would actually execute a \u201cPIT\u201d maneuver in the field. He remembered spinning out on the blacktop of the training course at the academy, as a few beads of cold sweat formed on his brow. Ok. He was going in on the count of three: 1, 2, \u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d Madison chimed to no one in particular, as she yanked the wheel in a sudden, violent movement to the left, badly overshooting the Mcdonald\u2019s parking lot entry in a skidding turn. Had it not been the terrific suspension designed by those boys in Baden, the car certainly would have flipped. Regardless the front-left tire exploded on impact with the raised curb, which also made a joke of the bumper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah,\u201d Guevara said loudly to himself, turning around in his seat to watch the white Mercedes fly off the curb, clearing a row of shrubs, only to touch down briefly in a parking lot, before barreling into the plate glass window of a lighting store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot far enough down the road, the four officers manning the spike strip began to grow increasingly concerned by the failure of the speeding patrol car to show any signs of slowing down before them. Seconds later, applying brakes far too late, distracted by the spectacular crash behind him, Guevara shot over the spikes at about 60mph, spun out, rolled twice, and came to rest overturned in the middle of the next intersection.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Madison decided last night, that it was her 30th birthday so fuck it, she was eating cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat across the line of the small studio apartment, where the kitchen turned into a cramped living room. Filling out a slightly shabby green recliner, her mountainous stomach rose and fell with each breath, deep she was in an alcoholic slumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer laptop on the coffee table still played through a season of MTV reality show, a cigarette still burned in the crowded ashtray, next to a purple, plastic bong. The walls of the apartment exuded a smoky musk. The digital clock on the stereo in the media cabinet read 4:00 AM, then 6:00.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 7:30 AM, Madison\u2019s cell-phone alarm went off where she left it on the apartment\u2019s small, dingy balcony. Well insulated in both sleep, and a thick woolen blanket she had donned, half awake in the early morning hours, Madison slept soundly through her wake-up call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrifting through a vague dream, Madison was laying on a white sand beach, the whole of it, for only herself and some hot guy she had fucked her freshman year. He was a total dreamboat. Tan skin covered his limber, toned features, with a full head of sun bleached hair and pearly smile to match. She, herself, was in the prime of her physique, a skimpy black two-piece hugging her slender curves. Her hair raven hair was wet with seawater, and flecks of sand peppered her perfect skin, resembling the surface of a caf\u00e9-au-lait. As they moved toward each other, under the tropic-sun, about to join in passionate embrace, when a loud knocking sound distracted Madison, jolting her into an unwilling wakefulness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie was frustrated. This was the fifth time in three weeks, that Madison had gone MIA, and Josh, their manager, had sent her a few blocks to Madison\u2019s apartment to try and fetch her. One more round of knocking and that was it, if Madison wanted to get fired, that wasn\u2019t Frankie\u2019s problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat on earth was up with that girl? When they first started work together at the restaurant, Frankie had found Madison to be fairly chill. They had even gone out for drinks after shift a few times, or smoked a joint in the parking lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison had certainly had her issues back then, always drinking Frankie under the table, and it was almost like she thought the rest of them didn\u2019t notice her snacking off of customer\u2019s plates and eating all the go-backs. Frankie found it funny, originally, and she empathized with Madison and her evident weight problem, but Christ, She had gotten even fatter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching out a closed hand to leave a final rapping upon the door, Frankie\u2019s fist made only two knocks, before the door opened inwards, and there was Madison, bleary-eyed and fitting the doorway tightly. She mumbled something like \u201cjust a second,\u201d and lumbered off again into the darkened dwelling. Frankie supposed she could step in for a moment, take a load off, and smoke a cigarette or something. Late as it was, a couple more minutes would hardly matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie could only describe Madison\u2019s apartment as \u201cdank,\u201d and not in the new meaning of the word, which is \u201cgood.\u201d She meant like a dungeon. The windows were all drawn, and very little outside light found its way in through the blinds. She also noticed an empty handle of cheap vodka on the kitchen counter, standing beside smudged tumbler and forest of empty cans of Miller Lite. No wonder Madison had such trouble waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took far longer than \u201cjust a second\u201d for Madison to collect herself and head off to work with Frankie. By the time they arrived at the restaurant, after the short walk, Madison was winded, sweaty, and a bit rumpled, her dark hair a tousle from the wind. She did not know it, but she would now tip the scales at over 300 pounds, meaning she had more than doubled her weight in the decade since her first days in university.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClumsily fumbling around with the apron strings behind her back, Madison\u2019s massive belly dominated her appearance, as usual. It kept on peeking out from beneath her too-small work polo. \u201cDamn it,\u201d she cursed under her breath as her sausage-fingers struggled to tie the strings above her bulging posterior. There just wasn\u2019t enough slack in the line. How was this possible, the apron had fit yesterday?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot until she glanced in Madison\u2019s direction and saw that her apron\u2019s nametag read \u201cFrankie,\u201d did she realize that Madison was attempting to put on her smaller apron, and that she herself was wearing Madison\u2019s, which now seemed comically oversized on her smaller frame. Would Frankie need to babysit Madison all day? Perhaps a bit cruelly, she let her co-worker squirm with the incompatible garment for a few extra moments, before alerting her of the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBroken into a visible sweat, Madison accepted the apron wordlessly, from Frankie. It was 2:30 PM and time for her to begin the shift, more than three hours late. It was then that Josh, the manager walked into the back room, looking quite irate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He thought about how when she started, he actually thought she was not the worst looking girl in the world, and when he had saw photos of her from her college days she was a total babe. <i>What the hell happened to her?</i> Josh wondered to himself, trading off astonished disbelief at this, and anger that she could be late again. He wanted to ask her how things could have gone off the rails this bad. Clearly, she had a drinking problem, but did that really explain the complete lack of motivation besides that? He knew she had a college degree and a failed marriage, did she thing it was below her to be working at the restaurant? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of asking her these things, he directly took action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison,\" he said, \"sorry you came in today, but you're fired.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she said, somewhat shocked by that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, this isn't working out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison got up and approached him, trying to playfully hug him like she had when he started. Possibly trying to flirt her way out of a problem as she had so many times in her high school and college years. However, she was no longer in the same universe of appearance as that version of herself, so it failed, and Josh stood firm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison, I'm not kidding,\" he said, \"don't make me have to call security. If you leave now, I'll let you leave out the back so you don't have to walk past anyone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was defeated. As meager as the pay was, she needed this job. She wanted to cry on the spot, but she kept her composure, and walked out the back door. After she left, Frankie walked to Josh's desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh, was that really necessary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, Frankie? You of all people should know how big of a drag Madison was on this restaurant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on.\" Frankie wanted to vouch for her friend, who was clearly having some kind of problem with her life. Madison just was not the same person she was when she started working at the restaurant, and Frankie feared what would happen without the (albeit small) level of responsibility and structure that came from this job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was not going to let Frankie get out a rebuttal, however; \"I should have fired her weeks ago, and you know it. She was dragging you down worst of all. I know you two get along, which makes you a rarity on the staff, but believe me, you're better off without someone like that derailing your career.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>My career? What, as a waitress?</i> she thought to herself. Frankie figured this was a fight she was not going to win, so she gave it a rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Madison had gotten back to her apartment, and cracked open a beer. What was she going to do? She had not spoken to her parents since the divorce, and, well, she knew what had happened with Cassi. Madison seemed out of options--there was not much breathing room left in her checking account, so she needed something quick, and she figured she could always find some kind of entry level job somewhere. </span></div></div>",

Madison would never say it outloud because she was nice to nearly everyone she met, but she was happy that she didn't look like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she was done working out she took some laps in the pool to cool down.

On top of all that, she also wasn't working out given her ankle and crutches. When all of this was combined, it made sense that Madison had gained another ten pounds over the course of two weeks. Madison knew she had gained some weight, but she was exerting a willful ignorance and thought she had gained only half of the 20 pounds that she actually did. Even gaining 10 pounds was cause for alarm in her mind, but she figured she would power workout when she healed up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison's belly was now getting obvious even when she was trying to suck it in.

It was mid October and it was getting a bit cool outside, so Madison's standard outfit of sweatpants and a sweatshirt fit the weather well. She hadn't tried on any of her jeans since the day a week and a half ago when she barely got them up and closed. It's probably good she didn't attempt to put the jeans on too, since he had gained another ten pounds in the week and half since then. Madison felt bigger, but she hadn't stepped on a scale in months. She knew that her scale was going to tell her a number that she didn't like. She was ballparking it to be 150, in her mind, she definitly gained her freshman 15, but she had no issue working out, so she figured, ''Hey, working out will be crummy, but I can shed 15 pounds somewhat easily.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Madison got to the campus medical center, she saw the same doctor as before, and he seemed a bit surprised by her apperance. They went through the normal procedures after her cast came off, including taking her weight. ''This isn't going to be fun,'' Madison said in a nervous mood. As she stepped on the scale, the number that she saw horrified her, 171.2 came on the digital read out. Madison nearly screamed in the room. 171 pounds. She had gained 40 pounds in a month and a half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I don't even know how this is possible.'' Madison said, still shocked by the number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, it is rather odd that someone of your age gained weight in such a rapid pace.'' Her doctor said in an uncomfortable tone. ''But this wasn't impossible, we're you active in high school?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, I worked out all the time before this stupid ankle injury.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''And have you changed your diet at all?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison thought to herself and felt guilty. ''Yeah, I guess I haven't eaten quite as well as I did in Miami.'' Madison knew that this was a huge understatement. She thought off all the sweets that she consumed from Cassi's cooking class, all the greasy meals she ate in the cafeteria, the snaking she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well I guess this combined with your body's reaction to the non-addictive painkillers caused this.'' Her doctor noted in an academic tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wait...what about the painkillers?'' asked Madison, now wondering what he meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''The perscription I gave you, you asked me to write you a perscription for non-addictive painkillers, which was very responsible of you by the way. If you look at the bottle, one of the possible side affects is weight gain, there was a big article in some of the journals about how doctors have fretted to perscribe it long term because of the adverse affect it could have on patient weight, but in short term, it beats the risk of growing addicted to pain medication.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison looked at him in a mixture of shock and anger, ''wait, so the painkillers made me fat.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well, you do now have a BMI around 26, which makes you only overweight, but you are certainly not obese yet. And the painkillers usually only create a minimal weight gain if all other factors are held constant. You may want to try to recreate your acitivity level from high school and go back to that diet, since your metabolism won't be altered anymore.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison left the doctor's office in the worst mood she could remember. </span></div></div>",

She slapped and squeezed and the pleasure that plowed through her body was unfathomable.<br>\r\nHer thighs expanded as well. She had jiggly thighs and there was no doubt that each thigh had grown about 4'' and slapped together whenever she walked.<br>\r\nNext was her belly. Although it had not grown like the rest of her body, there was no doubt it had become large, She pinched and prodded it and each time she <br>\r\npoked it, it was like she was about to have an orgasm.<br>\r\nLastly, she focused on her chest. Her C cup breasts have expanded to at least a D cup now.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison knew that she needed to lose the weight. She didn't know why she was so turned on by it, but the social repercussions of being a fat girl were too great for her. All her life she had been popular, and she wasn't about to accept a reduced social status now, in college, when she was supposed to be in the best years of her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I can do this. It will take a while, and it won't be easy, but I can get back to my normal form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Madison attempted to go to the gym, but first she had to deal with her workout gear. Madison hadn't worked out in a while, since before the cast was on. \"How is my luck that bad, I get fat because I was working out,\" thought Madison in a moment of self pity. She first tried to put on her shorts, which were a somewhat loose fit back when she was thin. Since they were strechy fabric, she could get them over her thighs, but it took some effort to get them over her larger butt. Plus, since they were tight, they just enhanced the appearance of her love handles, and made them look huge. Her belly also stuck out, which was a foreign feeling for her. Madison looked for a loose t-shirt to wear as well, but the only thing she had was a size that was a bit too small for her current weight. With all the added girth in her boobs and tummy, she had to constantly pull the shirt down to keep her soft midriff from being exposed. Gone was the former workout queen from the beginning of the semester, replaced with a girl who was struggling with her weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Madison got to the gym, she attempted to do her normal workouts, but she got fatigued extremely quickly. Madison had always been tonned and never had to workout with a larger body, so she was shocked with how much her bust bounced around while she was trying to run, and she pretty much tried to give up on keeping her shirt from riding up. This kept her belly exposed almost up to her belly button, and of course this meant that her love handles were in full view as well. In the same way it had in the room, this new feeling felt somewhat arousing, however. But, this wasn't at the front of her mind, she was more embarrassed. It was quite a sight for anyone who remembered her from the start of the semester, and many people did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap,\" noted Dave, one of the guys in her classes, \"Madison got huge. What the hell did she do while she was on the cast\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah I don't know,\" replied Quinn, a friend of his, \"She must have really hit the buffet. She's turning into a cow, and fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison didn't hear them specifically, but she knew people were talking about her. She felt insecure like she never had before. Especially since she got exhausted about twice as fast as she usually did, gave up, and walked back to her room. </span></div></div>",

Her stomach now stuck out and looked bloated. Madison was about to wrap herself in a towel and go shower, but instead, maybe due to the ice cream, she felt sluggish for a second, and just sat down on the futon. As she sat there, she examined her body some more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ugh, how did these get so huge,'' she thought, as she poked her chubby thighs. It seemed like just yesterday they were lean and toned, from hours of running. Madison also noticed as she was sitting down that her butt seemed to spread from her hips when she sat down, almost like she was sitting on a foreign object. ''Ugh, I'm disgusting, I need to do something about this,'' she thought in another moment of self pity, ''thank god my girlfriends from high school can't see this.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her moment of self pity, Madison suddenly felt a turned on. For reasons unknown this moment of self pity and gluttony made her horny. Madison caught her hand moving to a similar area, before she realized what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What the heck, what am I doing, I'm a pig right now.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison's entire life had been spent as a slim beauty queen. Someone who worked out, and reaped the rewards. She was the main beneficiary of a society which said that the only way to be truly elite was to look amazing, and to look amazing you had to be under a size 4. She wasn't outwardly mean to others, she just benefited from her previously amazing looks. Thus, even though Madison was turned on by her body, she was in a state of non-acceptance. She didn't want to be on the outside of the exclusive circle of people she used to run with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I need to go shower. Cassi could come in and see me.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison went down to the shower with a towel draped around her expanded body. After she got in her stall and closed the door, she turned the water to a level hotter than normal. She walked in and began her normal routine of cleaning. However, as she washed and lathered herself, she was getting turned on again. Something about feeling the softness of her body, and her newly sensitive boobs was making her go nuts. Then she moved to her butt and made a pass with the soap. Feeling the softness, and the give of her cheek, she felt a rush as she closed her eyes and made a slight sigh. She nearly feel over, and instead gently put her weight on the back wall. With the hot water pouring down on her, she forgot about washing her body, and moved her hand between the top of her fat thighs. She had forgotten how good this felt. </span></div></div>",

She was already in an extremely tight dress, and she knew how bad it would look if she was the girl who everyone knew gained a ton of weight, and she lost and had to plow through a platter of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Cassi, do we really have to do the food part? I mean, I really need to watch what I eat.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, that's why it's fun, it's like high stakes.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison wasn't totally buying this. But she starred at the two other girls who were with Cassi, Claire and Sarah, she did think it would be pretty fun to see those two lose and have to scarf down a ton of food at social outing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Okay, I'm game.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got to starting, and Madison realized that she had lost her touch since she had last played in high school, and wildly misfired. A hot guy was walking bye as it happened, ''yikes, you should have gone out in high school.'' Madison shot him a glance. She always went out in high school. She was one of the hottest girls in her high school. Guys sucked up to her in high school. These kinds of exchanges made her loathe her extra weight she had gained in college, because she knew her added pudge was hiding the hottie that she knew she still was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the game went on, they traded cups for a while until the two girls nailed 3/4 shots. Cassi and Madison responded by getting the other two girls down to their final cup as well. Madison got nervous, ''it was never supposed to be this close, I used to own this game in high school,'' she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir opponents got ready to cast their shot. Madison watched intently, while Cassi looked like an idiot and tried to distract them. The ping pong ball slowly hung in the air and made a perfect arch into the cup, splashing a small amount of beer on Madison's shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''F---. Okay, we still have our rebuttal,'' noted Madison as she chugged that glass of beer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Madison's shot. She badly wished that she had not had to consume the 5 beers already from the game. She felt bloated and somewhat unbalanced as she tried to focus on the cup. Madison flung her arm and flicked the ball out, it sailed perfectly towards the cup. It had some good arch and Madison smiled as she let it go, it came down towards the cup--but hit the side and did an in-and out. They had lost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison stood there stunned. She was going to have to eat the food. ''Oh dear god, please let this dress hold this,'' she thought as she sat down and grabbed the first thing off the tray, a hamburger from one of the fast food places. Madison guess that there was 4 dinners worth of food on each platter. There was a sign on the table that said, ''Beer Pong losers.'' Well, thought Madison, at least they don't think I am spontaneously doing this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison made it through the first portion of the food alright, she was drunk from the game after all. But, as time went on she felt herself getting more and more full. Her dress was also feeling extremely restrictive. She noticed that she was a point of conversation as people walked bye and saw her and Cassi stuffing themselves. She had never been so embarrassed. </span></div></div>",

Madison's Mom was thin and constantly passed judgement on those who were larger. Madison looked down at her fat body, and wondered if her Mom had seen any of the photos on her online profile. She had assumed not, but she couldn't imagine how insufferable her Mom would be if she saw her like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison tried to start her diet that day, but she was hungover, which made it even worse. She eventually got another large meal of fast food west mex. \"Uh, okay last day I do this.

Sure, she used to work out all the time, but she did that to maintain. Not to lose weight. Now, she would have to try to lose weight, which was much harder because with her added size, exercise was much more exhausting, and she had to resist food that she had grown to love.

She thought about her bad luck and it only made her more frustrated. This in turn led her to get energy at almost a nervous level. Before, she probably would have gone and worked out during this, but she didn't want to go to the gym and see all the thin girls right now so she grabbed her cell phone and laptop, and found the worst order in place that she could find. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually settled on a deep dish pizza place. Madison heard that the Pizza was legendary on campus, but she had tried to avoid it so it wouldn't wreck her figure, \"screw it, my diet wasn't working, why can't I just indulge for a few days.\" Madison ordered a large double pepperoni pizza. While she was waiting for it to come, she went to the vending machine and got a bottle of non-diet soda, and a bag of chips that she blew through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the pizza came, Madison was hungry again, and she tore through the first few slices very quickly, not really noticing that some of the sauce was falling onto her shirt and her sweats. At this point she was almost eating in some sort of self hatred, since she wasn't all that hungry anymore. Madison demolished half of the large pizza, which had to be over 3,000 calories in that one sitting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Madison cracked open another bottle of whiskey and figured that it would also help in making her feel better. <br>\r\n--<br>\r\nA few hours later, Cassi came walking back to the dorm and unlocked her room to be greeted by a drunken Madison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CASSI, HOWS IT GOING?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison, are you drunk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe already knew the answer to that as her larger roommate bounced on over. Madison looked sloppy. In her intoxicated state, she didn't bother to pull her shirt over her belly, and Cassi could see it was bloated from the half eaten pizza that was sitting on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison then came up and hugged Cassi and she realized just how much softer Madison had become as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison, why did you get drunk so early?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I got fat. Look at me,\" Madison noted, as she poked her belly, \"you should see my ass, it looks even worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi didn't really know what to say, Madison had packed on a ton of weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...let's put you to bed, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi helped Madison go to bed, and noted how her belly stuck out even while she was laying down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\nFor the rest of the week, Cassi noticed that Madison wasn't attempting to go on her diet anymore. She was eating as she pleased, and to the looks of it, may have been eating even worse food than before, as if Madison had acquired a sweet tooth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison had decided to postpone her diet for a week. She felt like crap, and had a hard week of classes. She didn't notice her clothes getting any tighter because she was mainly confined to sweats, but in her mind, soon, she would go back to her diet and actually make it work this time. </span></div></div>",

Her once ample breast that were a D cup had jumped their way to the higher end of Double D's. Her arms lost all tone and now were soft. Her ass was beyond large now, it looked like it could crush a small animal. Her hips had become soft and fleshy, with hints of stretch marks showing. Her stomach now pushed itself out to poke out of every single one of her shirts, and was beginning to poke out of her sweat shirt too. Her once clean face had started to become greasy and bloated.

When they got there she tried on the largest pants that the store offered. To her horror, they could not get over her evergrowing ass. The former toned and firm butt had been replaced by globular orbs of fat, and there was no way the denim was making it over that. Cassi was a bit smaller, and she was able to buy a few things there, but it was clear she was growing as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison realized that she would need to go to a plus size store. For her, this was a major turning point--she could not believe that she was doing this. Madison used to be the hottest and most popular girl in school...and now she was too big for normal sizes, ''how did I let this happen,'' she wondered as she walked in. The store was tastefully done, but Madison still walked in with her head down. She was among the smallest people in the store, around her were women who almost looked to be near 300 pounds. ''ugh, well at least I'm not like that,'' Madison smugly thought while going through a rack of shirts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried them all on, and depressingly, they fit. As Madison walked to the cash register, the cashier noticed her demeanor, ''must be your first time here.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sorry-''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Is this your first time buying these clothes in this size?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison looked at the woman, she must have been 270 pounds, and she had a massive stomach with thick arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Umm, yeah, although hopefully it's my last.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was slightly taken aback from that. Although she had once been smaller, and remembered the pain of gaining weight, so she decided not to get hostile to Madison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well, good luck on getting back to where you want to be.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Thanks''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison could not believe that she just had that encounter, and vowed to try to lose her weight. </span></div></div>",

Her belly started to bloat even further over her workout shorts while she was sitting down, and her thighs felt further restricted by the fabric. Madison was getting used to feeling an orb of fat around her when she sat down, almost like her legs and butt were spreading. If she had looked in the mirror, she would have noticed that cellulite was forming on her butt, but she had still alluded stretchmarks anywhere, an amazing feat, given her gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Madison was eating, a bit of frosting fell onto her stomach, and she rubbed it off. It was an odd sensation, feeling how soft her body had become, still moist with sweat from the workout, Madison didn't know how to describe it, but it was almost pleasureful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat piece of cake set Madison off on another week of heavy eating, sure she continued to workout, but this wasn't combating her gain when she would get home and eat a huge and calorie laden meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison knew what was coming up, it was getting near finals and the end of the semester break. Her friends at Powers had seen the gain first hand, but none of her friends back home knew it was this bad.

Madison's Mom was a health nut who was always critical of people who didn't keep her figure. This was part of the reason that Madison had stayed so fit in high school.

Before she put it in her carry-on, she went online and found a photo of herself from last summer. She was at the beach and she was wearing a bikini. Her beauty was abundant, and she had a body that any girl would envy. She was surrounded by her hot friends and good looking guys. This lifestyle felt like years ago, despite being only half a semester away. Madison fretted going back home. While she gained a ton of weight, she assumed that her friends stayed the same, and they probably didn't know about her gain. She had been removing photos of herself now from her profile, so for all they new, she was still the bombshell that left for Powers. Madison continued to nervously think about this during her ride to the airport, and in flight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison anxiously waited for her Mom to come pick her up near baggage claim after she landed. She was dressed in sweatpants and a sweatshirt, hoping that may mask some of her huge first semester gain. However, it was a tad warmer out than usual for December in South Florida, 81 and sunny. ''Damn this great weather,'' Madison thought to herself. She began to feel a bit uncomfortable for a few reasons. First, with the heat she could feel a bit of sweat run down her back, highlighting the fact for her that she now had back fat that she was never used to. Also, her sweatpants look wasn't in sync with what everyone else was wearing. At Powers, in the midwest in the Winter, she could totally get away with covering up, in Miami, she was surrounded by girls in short skirts and cute outfits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Madison saw her Mom's luxury SUV coming up. Madison's Mom, Jen, was a huge fitness nut, and she looked it. Shorter than Madison, about 5'5, and having to weigh less than 120 pounds, Madison's Mom had a body that most women were jealous of. She had married Madison's Dad right after college, and he became successful somewhat early in life, so Madison's Mom had lived the life of a pampered housewife for a while now. Madison could see the moment when her Mom, scanning people in the pickup line, saw her. Madison's Mom was wearing sun glasses, but Madison could see her Mom's jaw drop as she slowly moved into the lane next to her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Mom jumped out of the car, and didn't yell, but was alarmed, ''Madison, what the hell happened.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Gee, Mom great to see you as well.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I'm sorry, I'm just surprised, Madi'' Madison's Mom leaned in to hug her daughter, who she was legitimately happy to see, she was just genuinely shocked this had happened. Her daughter looked huge. ''Ok, well tell me about your semester in the car.'' While Madison was lifting her suitcase into the car her shirt rode up, exposing her belly and lovehandles, ''oh my god,'' thought her Mom, ''she has become a whale.'' Jen tried to rationalize it, she guessed it started when her daughter rolled her ankle, but she never heard of someone gaining weight this fast, it was like she was a different person now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their car rolled towards Madison's parents house, her Mom filled her in on normal details of the year, while constantly thinking about her daughter's gain. Madison's parent's house was a gorgeous home that was built in the 1950s. One level, and about 4000 square feet it was large, but typical of the homes in the area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison walked in and her Dad, Chris, walked over and hugged her. He couldn't believe that this was his daughter, but he was much nicer than Madison's Mom, and didn't want to hurt Madison's feelings, so he didn't say anything. </span></div></div>",

Even without the powder, Madison's metabolism had slowed down dramatically, and when she didn't watch what she ate, she was bound to gain more. The added weight brought her up to 228 pounds. Madison also hadn't been on a scale. The one she used in high school had either broke or been moved since she lived there, but she knew that she was gaining more. She could feel it when she sat down, and her stomach felt larger while it broke into rolls, or when she put on shorts, and her legs felt constricted. The problem for her was that she had yet to combat the gain. She feared that she was reaching a point of no return on her weight, where she would never be able to lose it, and always be fat  for the rest of her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex also gained a bit, giving her the curves that she desired. For her, that was enough and she was hoping her weight would hold steady at around 115, which looked normal for someone as short as her.

Madison was thankful that she at least seemed to have stabilized, but still missed the attention she used to get from guys. She realized that she hadn\u2019t had a date in over two months and that was depressing, especially in light of the dismissive comments of Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour days before Madison was due to fly back to Powers she received a text from Jim, one of the editors on the school paper, the Powers Proclaimer:  \u201cAm in South Florida, heading back to Kansas. Could I drop by to take you out to dinner and maybe book on the same flight back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was startled. Jim was one of the kinder people she knew, but an upperclassman. They had never dated and she knew he was aware of the embarrassing beer-pong fiasco.  Why would he want to date her, the campus clown and resident blimp?  Her confidence level in the pits, aware of her seeming addiction to food, perverse enjoyment of her ballooning weight and her mother\u2019s adverse opinions she found it hard to believe that Jim would even offer. She started to blow him off, but instead took another tack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you come here you\u2019ll need to first meet our family before taking me out. Its your call,\u201d she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer came back within minutes \u201c\u201dNot a problem. Can be there and meet them Friday evening, take you out Saturday and we fly back Sunday if that\u2019s suitable. Please supply your flight numbers so I can try to match them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain she hesitated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould this be some sort of prank?\u201d she wondered. \u201cPlay with the hapless fat girl\u2019s feelings and then brag to your dorm buddies about how you embarrassed her? \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew some guys did that kind of thing, but Jim\u2019s reputation was one of being totally straight arrow.  He encouraged the reporters, suggested sources, rewrote material without asking for credit. When he had to reject a story, never one of hers that she recalled, he seemed to almost apologize, like he regretted having to do it.  She concluded that she actually wanted to know what he had going on inside his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe checked the confirmation slip in her purse wallet. And responded \u201cDelta 1258 @ 11:45 from Jacksonville to Atlanta, connecting to flight 5043 (Delta Connect) at 1:40 \u2013 both in terminal S\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK \u2013 will try. If it works we can call together and see about seating. Expect me Friday around 2:00\u201d Jim answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison considered her now nearly 220 pound frame with opulent derri\u00e8re and thought \u201cI hope we don\u2019t get squeezed \u2013 it seemed snug flying in<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim on the other hand was ecstatic. He had ideas about where Madison could go on the paper but needed her commitment. Besides, he had always been attracted to her and her weight gain for him wasn\u2019t a turnoff at all. Privately, as one who had had both ft and slender friends in high school,  he\u2019d been fascinated by the transformation. But he knew some of the guys thought she and Cassie were into one another, something he found hard to believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr and Mrs Kraft were surprised by Madison\u2019s announcement of a visitor but Chris immediately suggested that Jim shouldn\u2019t just drop by on Friday \u2013 he should be invited to dinner. Madison and Alex agreed, volunteering to prepare it since their mom would be working. Jennifer Kraft, still struggling with her own weight issues, didn\u2019t want a large dinner like she knew the girls were thinking of.

The Kraft residence he estimated to be relatively new and wondered if the Christ and Jen Kraft were the original owners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short driveway had concrete slabs near the garage for up to four extra cares. Only two were occupied so Jim took one of the empty ones. He  went up the walk intending to knock on the door when it was opened by a lithe brunette who greeted him \u201cHello \u2013 my name is Alexis. Madison\u2019s setting things up in the dining area and I presume you\u2019re Jim?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and since you\u2019re too young to be her mother I presume you\u2019re her sister?\u201d he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well, yes. I guess she\u2019s not told you about me?\u201d Alex replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot her fault. We take classes together but I\u2019ve not taken time to get to know her very well personally, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Jim conceded as he entered the spacious but conservatively appointed living room. On the far side with a picture window he saw the dining room. It had a large table with a white table cloth and five place settings.  Three match ing chairs on the side told him it probably had an expander panel for up to eight. Madison, now 50% larger than her sister, emerged from  the kitchen a little hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello there,\u201d Jim erupted with a greeting and smile. \u201cAre you ready to greet a weary traveler from St Petersburg?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSt Pete? I thought you lived in the Midwest?\u201d replied Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was raised there and that\u2019s where my home is. But I\u2019ve been down here or a reunion with my grandparents for the last week,\u201d he explained.  \u201cI\u2019ve met your sister but where are your parents?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorking. They\u2019ll be here. Alex and I have done most everything so shall I take you on a tour?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy all means,\u201d he replied. They had finished the interior and were viewing the veranda when Chris Kraft drove up. They went to the living room and greeted her father.  Mr Kraft noticed Jim\u2019s courtesy and conservative although casual dress, deciding that he was a serious student and not a loser.  He wanted to know more about this young man but before they could converse much Jen Kraft arrived and things appeared not to be good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello there, you must be Jim \u2013 happy to meet you,\u201d she greeted him curtly before turning to her husband. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be impolite, but this day has been horrid. Will you pardon me while I find some Tylenol?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim had proffered his hand but she hadn\u2019t even noticed. He lowered it and looked at Madison as Mr Kraft followed his wife.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this a bad time? Should I leave?\u201d Jim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d declared Alex. \u201cWe made this supper for you to enjoy and you are here to see Madison. This isn\u2019t normal for mom and she would feel bad if you split on her account.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison nodded her head in agreement.  \u201cUnless Dad indicates otherwise I think you should stay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three young people sat down in the living room and spent about ten minutes until Chris Kraft reappeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJen is sorry about all this and asks that we forgive her and get supper going. I\u2019ve given her pulls for her headache. She\u2019ll join us in 10-25 minutes.\u201d He announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex and Madison arose and went to the kitchen. Mr. Kraft seated himself next to Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts good to meet one of Madison\u2019s classmates and friends,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dActually we\u2019re both on the staff of the campus paper. She\u2019s a real writer and reporter, not just a composer.\u201d Jim replied. \u201cMost freshman don\u2019t do features because they can\u2019t research. The same for unique commentary, but Madison is a natural. That\u2019s not just my opinion but the evaluation of our faculty advisor. She could be offered an editorship next year, which is rare for a sophomore. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo is your interest strategic or personal?\u201d Mr. Kraft inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably a bit of both. Madison has been so busy, and me too, that we\u2019ve just crossed paths a lot but have never had a chance to connect. We\u2019ll see what happens but I promise not to do anything to hurt or offend. In fact if you have any suggestions or pointers I\u2019m open to advice.\u201d Jim responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, between us, I think she\u2019s heard enough about her weight from  her mother. I\u2019d advise letting her sort that out rather than trying to lecture her.\u201d Mr Kraft said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a problem,\u201d replied Jim. \u201cShe and her roommate Cassie are probably among the largest girls on campus and I\u2019m sure they know it. I\u2019ve known larger girls with the nature of angels and slender ones with mean streaks you can\u2019t believe. I\u2019m charmed by the former and repelled by the latter. Madison\u2019s size doesn\u2019t bother me and I\u2019m with you about not interfering with her life in that area. Some people of size are simply meant to be that way and its judgmental for others to be condemning what for them is natural.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris Kraft sighed \u201cI wish my wife were so open minded. She thinks Madison is influencing Alex \u2013 who appears to have put on a few this holiday season as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPardon me, sir, but Alex is, well, shall I say, on the low end of slender even now.  If she\u2019s gained some she may have wanted it.\u201dJim asserted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou perceive correctly and she\u2019s told Jen as much. So you understand my position in all of this,\u201d Mr Kraft lamented.\u201dI agree with you but my wife is having her issues with the girls. She thinks the meal tonight is going to be hog heaven and she\u2019s totally lost control.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s the cause of her headache?\u201d concluded Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe would say no, but I suspect there\u2019s a stress connection,\u201d Mr Kraft replied laconically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t control other people, especially teens. They need space to make their own decisions, even unwise ones. That\u2019s what becoming emancipated and an adult is all about,\u201d asserted Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a smart cookie for one so young,\u201d observed Mr. Kraft. He found himself liking Jim, a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK guys, dinner is served,\u201d Alexis announced from the dining room. \u201cI\u2019ll go knock on Mom\u2019s door.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The whole ride home from the airport she was shocked that the tiny 130 pound perfect daughter she had dropped off at college had ballooned into a 210 pound whale, in her opinion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she made dinner, Madison's Mom pondered her options. Maybe she could enroll Madison in some kind of weight loss boot camp for the duration of the three week break? Maybe convince her to transfer to a more self-conscious coastal school, <i>I knew we never should have let her go to the midwest</i>. Then, Madison's Mom began to think about diet pills. Were they unsafe? Possibly. But Jen wondered, they have to be better than just letting Madison stay obese, with the health risks of that, didn't they? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she researched online, she found one with great results and somewhat good reviews, XC900 pills. However, Jen overlooked that they have never been long term tested on a sample size that was significant, beyond the first costumers. Even if she had seen that the FDA was nowhere close to approving them, she may have jumped at it anyway. Excited to get her daughter's old body back, Jen overnight-ed them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plan was simple. Just keep making Madison dinner, and grinding the pills into the meals. Then, after some lost weight, she could convince her daughter to keep it going, and maybe even reveal the plan at the end and send her daughter back to school with motivation and a bottle of pills to fight her gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, things in no way went according to plan. </span></div></div>",

It turned out to be a mundane survey, but Jen decided to take it anyway. Dinner and the phone were not a hard thing to multi-task, but for some reason, Jen lost track of which plate contained the the XC900 pills. She assumed it was the third plate over from their fridge, when in reality, it was the second, altering who it would go to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, this would have little repercussion, besides Madison not getting the intended pill. However, Jen failed to read the warning label on the pills, and notice their most risky side effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Warning: Only administer if above 24% body fat. If taken below suggested levels, serious side effects can occur.</i> For people with less body fat, which Madison's siblings safely were, their metabolisms had the chance of being altered for over year, almost slowing down the process completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 20 minutes later, Madison's family sat down to eat. Madison noticed her Mom was starring at her as she ate her first bite, <i>Ugh, she's judging me again</i>, Madison thought. However, Jen just could not contain her own anticipation of Madison consuming the food and her plan starting. However, what she didn't know was someone else had the pill laden dinner, and was about to significantly affect their future appearance. </span></div></div>",

Cassi was growing into her gain better than Madison, whereas Madison was downright hot before, Cassi was just cute, something that carried over into her chubbiness better than Madison, who's sharp features were being drowned out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor dinner that evening, Madison had a salad, which she didn't enjoy like she used to, but figured that she needed to make a stand here. Madison did not want to have to deal with a reality where she was over 200 pounds. It was just a number, but going over 200 pounds would be crossing a barrier in Madison's mind. Once she hit 200 there would be no way for her to ignore that her weight was a serious issue, and her mind, fairly or not, it would start to define her. She already feared that guys were not seeing who she was, the smart and charismatic girl that she had always been, but rather just some fat girl who annoyed them based off nothing other her appearance.

She decided to try a trendy new diet she had heard about, figuring there was not much reason not to at least see what would happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, when Cassi came home from class one day, she saw Madison reading a book titled, \"Cut Grain Out!\" and realized it was probably a diet book. \"Are you trying a new diet?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going to,\" Madison responded. \"According to this book, grain and some other processed stuff are really bad for you, and cause a lot of weight gain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi had to sit there a bit dumbfounded.

She thought he was really cute, and had been wanting to run into him socially for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she had gained weight, Madison would have been fearless about this kind of thing, and it would have been flirt city, now she was uncertain. ''Hopefully this dress doesn't make me look like  cow,'' she thought, ''eh, at least my boobs look huge in this.'' She regained her confidence and went over and talked to him and broke the ice.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Greg, nice seeing you out of Spanish,''<br>\r\n''Ha, Madison, I'm sure you love it, you're the ace of the class.''<br>\r\n''Well, growing up with a Mexican mother probably didn't hurt.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got in a good conversation and Greg offered her a beer, which Madison took as a sign that things were going well. While the were chatting, Greg subtly checked out Madison. ''Man, she has bulked up,'' he thought to himself, his face doing a good job of not betraying what he was thinking. He looked at her dress, and he could tell it was chosen to cover up some added girth. Greg had seen the photos of Madison when she lived in Miami, this wasn't someone who had previously been against showing skin. He also noticed that she had a bit of a double chin coming in, and her arms looked soft. </span></div></div>",

Whereas Madison used to be the girl who always had her hair done in time for class and put on a perfect outfit that made her look hot without being slutty, now she always had it back in a ponytail and was wearing sweats everywhere. Her ambition just seemed to be lacking, and not just in the physical area. Madison used to be a library warrior, but Cassi observed that she was now just getting home and watching shows on cable and marathoning tv shows, it was if she had changed her life paradigms to short term pleasure over long term benefits. Cassi wondered what the Madison from the first week of school would think, looking at this girl just sit here and increasingly fall into a lazy routine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison's body obviously took a hit as well. Given the lack of workouts and her bad diet, her butt had continued to get bigger, and softer, and was starting to consume some of her small panties. Although her stomach had been growing at a slower pace, it was now a tummy that sat a bit on her lap, and was starting to fade out of her hourglass body type. Yes, her boobs got bigger, but were starting to lose perkiness, and she was getting some back fat. Madison's legs also enlarged, and were starting to become some real thunder thighs and looked huge while she sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hopefully she will start caring again,'' thought Cassi. </span></div></div>",

In the six months since she had been rejected by Greg on account of her weight, Madison had packed on at least fifty pounds by Cassi's estimate. It was simple in reality, though. Madison stuffed her face all day with greasy food and sweets. She drank cherry Coca-Cola by the pallet, it seemed, and seldom finished the night without downing at least a sixer of Budweiser tall boys. This binging, in accompaniment with her adoption of a sedentary lifestyle (seldom even attending class and never exercising) was certainly a recipe for massive weight gain in a relatively brief period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cassi observed her from across their small two-person dorm, Madison was as usual attired in her once comically loose-fitting pink velour sweat pants. She had picked them up for a steal at an outlet mall in her skinny days. The top that had made them a suit, had been retired a few months previous after it became to constraining for her growing belly and breasts, the former primarily. It had been replaced by a grey Powers U sweatshirt that was now looking a bit tight, itself. <br>\r\nSitting on the couch, watching TV shows on her laptop as it rested on her meatier thighs, sharing space with Madison's pudgy gut which pressed ever so slightly into the keyboard, she snacked on her large order of cheese fries between gulps of beer. Her thick black hair was cut shorter than before and brought back into a manageable pony-tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi noticed that Madison's body would visibly jiggle each time she would chuckle tipsily at the sitcom on the screen, a smile breaking across her fleshed out face, with full cheeks and an increasing double chin. She was beginning to feel a bit concerned about her best friend's health.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The only issue was that it didn't fit in quite the same way that it did before she had gotten injured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, Madison struggled to get her underwear over her now plump behind. She also realized that her former sports bra had no chance of fitting. She wanted to work out, so she texted Denna, one of the larger girls on the floor and asked if she could borrow one of her's. Denna accepted, although she was shocked that this situation had unfolded. Dena had remembered coming to campus and being jealous of Madison's great figure, now she was sharing clothes with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison realized none of her previous workout shirts would cover her fuller figure, so she took a shirt that she used to wear to bed, due to it's larger size, and flipped it on. She also found a pair of elastic shorts, which still were extremely tight, and put those on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got to the gym, Madison quickly learned that it was much easier to work out when you were in shape. She attempted to go on the treadmil, her usual foe. After a few minutes she felt herself becoming exausted, and getting side aches. Madison had to slow the machine down and walk for a few minutes. There was another row of machines behind her, and some of her classmates saw Madison get tired out quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh my god, look at Madison, I can't believe she let herself go like that.''<br>\r\n''Yeah, I know, she got so out of shape, I guess some girls just can't handle college.''<br>\r\n''Seriously, what a fatty.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison couldn't hear them over the hum of the machines in the gym, but she felt like crap regardless. Working out as a chubby girl was much different than what she was used to. While she tried to run her legs shook, and her boobs constantly bobbed up and down. She got tired more quickly, and she had to deal with the embarassement of going to a gym where she was surrounded by attractive girls with toned bodies. All of this was new to her, and she wasn't enjoying it. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Madison was walking into the locker room to cool off, she ran into Kelly, from her floor. Kelly was 5'10 and a very lean 115 pounds. It made sense that she played basketball in high school, and was a pretty good low post player. She had worked out hard, since she liked the attention from guys. Her and Madison were friends, but she couldn't resist making the former hottie talk about her 40 pound gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wow, Madison, it's too bad that you gained all that weight, where did you find clothes that fit?''<br>\r\n''I borrowed some, and yeah, I'm a cow, I really need to drop all this weight, I never thought I could become this fat while I was in a cast.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly came up behind Madison after she had turned around and playfully grabbed her butt, ''Geez, this wasn't here before.''<br>\r\nMadison was shocked and embarrassed by this aggressive form of teasing, but replied, ''Well it was there, it just wasn't huge yet.''<br>\r\n''Yeah, you're getting a ghetto booty, I bet the guys down in Miami are going to love that.''<br>\r\n''Not so much in Coral Gabels, no.''<br>\r\n''So what are you going to do with all your clothes?'' Asked Kelly, trying to get some trendy shirts.<br>\r\n''Fit into them after I lose the weight.''<br>\r\n''Well hopefully you can, you know a lot of girls can never burn off what they gain freshman year.''<br>\r\n''Well Kelly, most don't bust their ankle the first week of school.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly couldn't resist, she remembered how Madison and her had gossiped about some of the style choices of the fatter girls on campus when they first got there, and she wasn't going to pass up the chance for a little playful teasing of her friend. Madison took this as further motivation to lose the weight, because she knew that Kelly was saying out loud was what everyone else on campus was thinking. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison was getting fed up with Kelly's teasing, and wanted to do something about it, except there was not much that she could do. Madison was chubby, and Kelly wasn't, it wasn't like she had much of a comeback. In her mind, Madison knew that she was going to lose the weight eventually, even if the odds were against her on that front. Then she realized, maybe there was a way to make Kelly gain a few pounds and see what it feels like. She thought of stuff, she wasn't about to harm Kelly and break an ankle or anything, but maybe she could do it in a bet or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey Kelly, you played basketball in high school, right?'' <br>\r\n''Yeah, varsity, why?''<br>\r\n''Well how about we play a little high stakes game.''<br>\r\n''What do you mean?''<br>\r\n''A bet, first to 21, you vs. me pickup on the gym basketball courts.''<br>\r\n''You can't be serious, I'm going to distroy you.''<br>\r\n''Okay, lets see then, and let's do some terms, if I win, I get to choose what you eat for the next 2 months.''<br>\r\n''Eww...no, what are you a freak?''<br>\r\n''Hey, I said high stakes, what is higher stakes than that?''<br>\r\n''Ugh, fine. But when I win, you have to....umm...'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly paused and thought about it. Madison was already chubby, so it's not like the food thing would do much for her. And then she realized that she could really get to Madison's social life, which had already taken a hit due to the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Fine, Madison, if I win, you have to walk down the mall wearing a bikini, and attend class for a day in your clothes from before you gained weight.''<br>\r\n''Yeah, I don't think I'm fitting into those.''<br>\r\n''Try.''<br>\r\n''Ok, deal.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went to Cassi to officiate the bet, and she was somewhat weireded out, but was witness, so neither party could sneak out of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, after some rest and class, they went to the gym to play. Madison never told anyone this, but she played some basketball in high school, and was, in fact pretty decent, varsity as a junior. She was never good enough to have played in college, but neither was Kelly for that matter. Madison quit before her senior year of high school. Her coach that she loved got a new job, and in her place, they hired a total bitch. After consulting with her parents, Madison figured that she could focus on other clubs she was in instead. Madison played shooting guard in high school, so she wondered if she would still have the agility and her pretty good shot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they started it was apparent that Kelly didn't expect Madison to be this good. Of course, Madison didn't have that much speed and less agility due to her weight gain, but she still had her fundamentals. Madison started out with a quick 2 pointer before Kelly realized what happened, and after Kelly failed to bank one off the backboard, Madison grabbed the rebound, took it back out and hit another 2 from the top of the key. Madison used some more of her girth to play a more aggressive D, and stuck on Kelly, screwing her form. Kelly hadn't played basketball for months, and her style usually relied on getting open down low and getting a shot, not having to do all the work against someone who was going to press her with every chance she got. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a compeitive game, but, Madison quickly got up 12-6, and did a bit of trash talking, ''Damn Kelly, you wouldn't want to get beat by some fatty, would you? I hope you work out a ton because you're going to become pretty used to the cafeteria after this game.'' Kelly couldn't figure out why Madison knew how to play such a tight D, and she was getting in her own head, and forcing stupid shots. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite the early lead, Kelly wasn't going to let Madison run away with this, and blocked Madison's long range attempt to go ahead 14-6. After a quick rebound, Kelly got past Madison for an easy layup, 12-8. Madison tried to go past Kelly on her next possession, but got the ball stolen and Kelly took it back, and nailed a jumper, 12-10. They traded baskets and possessions for a while after that until it was 18-18. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was exhausted, and sweating from head to toe. She had never felt this kind of fatigue before, and felt like she could barely move. Kelly quickly looked over while Madison was dribbling to take it back out. ''This girl is finished,'' thought Kelly, and it certainly looked that way. Madison's chubby face was covered in sweat, her hair, which was tied back in a pony tail, was drenched, and the shirt she was wearing stuck to her larger tummy due to all the sweat running down her body. The wet shirt made Madison look a bit more tubby than she actually was, but Kelly saw a girl who didn't have the stantima to keep going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison dribbled back slowly to try to conserve some enegry. ''Come on Madison,'' she thought to herself, ''You can do this, keep going, push yourself, think of that bikini down the mall, you don't want to do that, push it, push it.'' Madison then dribbeled and could not get past Kelly, she wasn't going to plow her over because 1, even though this was pickup, neither side, or Cassi [who was watching on the sidelines] was going to allow that, and 2, she was so tired she didn't think she could even push Kelly over at this point. As Madison was about to try resetting, and creating some space, Kelly's legs caught the gym floor awkwardly, and she fell over. Madison could not believe her luck, she then went to the hoop uncontested, and scored an easy layup, 20-18. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly got back up off her butt, somewhat irritated, ''how the hell did that happen,'' she thought. Neither girl was talking to the other anymore, they just kind of grunted and exerted effort. It had gotten intense. Cassi who was still watching, was happy that no one else was on the basketball portion of the gym floor, because they probably would have found two girls pushing each other to the limit on the floor somewhat wierd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly took the ball off the floor and dribbled it back to the top of the key, Madison was still tired and Kelly faked left fast enough that Madison bit, and gave her enough space to run to the hoop for another easy layup, 20-20, next point wins. It was clear that Madison had become too tired to play the good D that she had played during the early portion of their game. This made her next possession even more important. If she didn't get past 21 here, both sides knew that Kelly was probably going to wizz past her and get it on her next attempt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison took the ball and slowly dribbed it towards Kelly, who was determined to shut Madison down. Madison, dribbling with her back to Kelly, tried to push her with her larger behind to create some movement, but Kelly wasn't letting her push her backwards, and was keeping her at the top of the key. After a few more tries, Madison realized she wasn't getting past Kelly. Kelly had the longer wingspan and would probably go for the steal if she tried to go around her. Earlier in the game, Madison still had enough quickness to create a short burst and avoid this, but now she didn't have this. Eventually, Kelly was going to just reach in for the steal, so Madison decided she just had to go for a jumper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison, still dribbling with her back to Kelly, moved one foot away from the basket and Kelly, then quickly pivoted, pushed off against the gym floor and launched a fadeaway jumper just over Kelly's block attempt. Madison landed on her butt, and tracked the ball through the air. Cassi and Kelly intently watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh my god, that has an arc to it.'' Cassi thought for the second the ball was in the air.<br>\r\n''no no no no no no no'' Kelly was thinking as she ran to the hoop to position herself for a rebound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball continued in a good arc towards the hoop in its decent, and then swished though the hoop to secure Madison victory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''S--t'' screamed Kelly, realizing she had just somehow lost to Madison.<br>\r\nSimultaneously, Cassi screamed out, ''OHMYGOD'' as she just watched a completely unlikely shot go in by Madison. Not only was the positioning bad, and the shot likelyhood low, she just watched an out of shape Madison take it to Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison after watching it go in while sitting on the court after her fadeaway, just let her back fly to the ground and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were walking off the court, Madison turned to Kelly and frankly told her, ''You shouldn't have made fun of me, have a fun 2 months.''</span></div></div>",

In take out bags were nachos, fried chicken, and mozzarella sticks, all food that Kelly usually avoided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well you weren't going to go easy on me if I lost the bet.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, I guess that's true.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Kelly about 20 minutes to eat all of the food, and when she was done she noticed that she had a slight bloat on her stomach from taking in all the junk food.

Kelly was completely unaccustomed to this kind of diet, and she noticed that her stomach looked a little bloated at the end of most evenings. She figured that she could work out more than she had in the past, and maybe make up for the increased food. At the same time, she was eating so much, that she often felt sluggish and opted to stay in her dorm, rather than try to push herself to work out on a full stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was also spending time with her previously unmentioned boyfriend, Rick. He also was a gym rat like Kelly, in fact, that was where they started seeing each other outside of class.

Madison's bikini bottom didn't do an adequate job at covering her inflated butt, and her butt cheeks flowed out of each side. They also left two love handles that drooped over the bikini bottom. Her thighs. looked wider and shook while she walked, and there looked to be a bit of cellulite forming on the backside of her formerly tonned thighs. Madison had a persistent pot belly that stuck out infront of her. Her boobs looked like they were going to fall right out of her top, and there was a grouping of fat above the string on her back. Madison's arms also looked a bit enlarged and softened. It was clear, the 170 pound girl should not be wearing that bikini. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Okay, you know the deal, you just have to do a lap around campus.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I hate you by the way.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison went outside and had never been so embarressed. She wore the biggest sunglasses she could find to try to obstruct her face and hide a bit. Luckilly it was a seasnably warm day, but still cold to be wearing a bikini, you could say it nippy, based on her reaction to the cold. Madison walked, students looked up and couldn't believe what they were seeing. Most assumed it was some kind sorority dare. They tried to hold their stares until after she passed them, only to see her butt eat up the back end of her bikini bottoms and wobble up and down as she walked. Madison lucked out in that she did not see any proffessors, public safety, or admin, this entire series of events would have been unexplanable if Madison got caught. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing a lap of campus, Madison walked back to her dorm where a male desk worker looked up, very confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I lost a bet.''<br>\r\n''Ah, I see.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat there as she and a fully clothed friend boarded the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Is this the kind of thing I report?'' He wondered, ''what would I even say? You know what, she didn't get caught, good for her, I'm just pretending this never happened and hoping it never comes up again.'' And with that he went back to doing his chem homework, and Madison had escaped getting in trouble for the stunt. Of course a ton of students just saw her chubby body on display, so it's not like Madison was having a great day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Holy cow, you got some stares.'' Kelly said to Madison when they got back to her room.<br>\r\n''God I wish I never made that bet with you.''<br>\r\n''Yeah, I  bet you do, I would hate to have that on display,'' Kelly poked Madison's soft belly, ''and we still have tomorrow and your tight clothes left to go.''<br>\r\n''Don't remind me.''</span></div></div>",

This wasn't an exercise that she was enjoying, most were not even getting close to going over her enlarged butt. After a while she found a pair that had a bit more give in them, and she was able to not only get them around her butt, but also close the flasp. It was not a pretty sight. She had a bad muffintop, and the legs looked like they wanted to explode as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison heard a knock on her dorm room door, and it was Kelly. Kelly walked in and couldn't believe how tight the pants looked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yikes, Madison, how did you get those on?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, they are going to do future physics studies on how I got through today,'' joked Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still only in her tight pants and a bra, but then she found a polo shirt that used to be pretty large on her. She tried it on and found out that was no longer the case. She had to constantly push it bellow her belly, so it wasn't exposed, and even then, you could see her fat pushing up against the shirt. She was also going to have to deal with love handles being present, since the shirt was struggling to get over her fat belly. Her arms took up all the space in the shirt, and even looked a bit constricted  by the tight sleeves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison looked like a girl who was in denial about her current state, and Kelly was loving it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was about to walk out the door, when Cassi, who had been silently studying got her attention,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey Madison,''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Take this just in case,'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi threw an over sized sweatshirt off the back of her desk chair into the arms of Madison, who but it in her book bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Thanks Cassi.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Good luck.''</span></div></div>",

She quickly put the sweatshirt that Cassi gave her over her shirt, because her belly was in clear view of anyone who had cared to look. Madison's pants were heavily strained, and it was a miracle that they had not burst open already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuys in the classes could not believe it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Holy crap,'' one thought, ''She got so fat, what the heck happened.'' as he starred at her from a row behind. He could see lovehandles peaking out from under the sweatshirt, and Madison's beginnings of a double chin were doing her no favors. <br>\r\nGirls had also noticed, and it was clear that Madison was no longer considered a hot girl, but rather someone who got chubby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison skipped lunch that day to avoid making her clothes any tighter, and tried to keep everything together through her last class. There was a guy in it, Tom, who she had wanted to get to know a bit better, and didn't want him to see her falling out of her too tight clothes. After class got out they started talking, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Mannnn that class dragged on today.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah seriously, Madison, I don't know why he just repeats what was in the readings the previous night.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Really, it's like, why even do the homework.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''For his class, I don't''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison found this funny, because she didn't either, she laughed, and was about to tough his arm in a flirty manner, but the combination of the laugh and the sudden movement caused her pants button to give way. Madison saw the button on the ground, and a passerby also saw. She knew there was no way Tom missed that. She was crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey Tom, sorry, I need to go.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Madison ran to her room to cry. She took off all her clothes, sat in her underwear, and examined the pudgy body that replaced her former toned and athletic look. </span></div></div>",

Just a little something to cheer her up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce, not long ago, resisting the urge to eat would've been the easiest thing in the world for her. But after months of sedentary snacking, and with no fitness obsessed mother to watch over her, Madison's rock solid self-control seemed to have drained away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheepishly she grabbed herself a box of ding dongs and dug in. She'd meant to only have one, but before she knew it the entire box had disappeared between her greedy lips. Without a though she moved onto a leftover slice of pizza, then a box of twinkies and tub of Ben and Jerry's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to stop herself she shoved it all into her mouth. She ate and ate, taking all her frustrations out on the calorific goodies. She binged like she never had before, paying no mind to whether the food she was stuffing into her mouth was hers or Cassi's. Anything was good so long as it gave her the sugar rush she craved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the growing girl was left lying on the floor, lips covered in smidges and crumbs, belly stuffed to the brim with sugary snacks. She was too full to get up. All the once slender stunner could do was lie there, surrounded by wrappers and cartons, groaning as she rubbed her bloated midriff.</span></div></div>",

It was 2:00pm, she had binged for almost 30 minutes, and then rested for another 15. <i>\"Ughhh, why did I do that?\"</i> she thought to herself. Then suddenly, she heard the creak of the dorm room door. Too full to be frantic, all Madison could let out was a subdued, \"oh. noo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi was having a good day. She continued to enjoy the benefits of being a hot girl on campus. The blonde from rural Kansas was happy to finally be at college, where she finally could see guys who cared more about their studies than trucks or the gossip of the day. In fact, she had taken advantage of that, at lunch she talked with a few guys who were clearly interested in her and been invited to parties that they were throwing that weekend. However, it seemed rare that conversation did not veer to her roommate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's the deal with your roommate, she really blew up.\" One of the guys asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi was used to that sort of question by now, especially after the bikini stunt that Madison pulled the day before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather not talk about.\" Cassi said, not wanting to criticize her roommate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't afraid that having a cow as you're roommate will give you bad habbits?\" Another asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on guys, it doesn't work like that. She got injured and couldn't workout, it could happen to anyone.\" Cassi said, trying to help her roommate's rep out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, she sure grabbed a lot of huge meals during that time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi got irritated at them. \"What, all of us can only eat salads now?\" she said, somewhat angry that Madison was being this objectified. \"Come on, she still has a cute face.\" That remark was greeted with silence. \"What? None of you would hook up with her now?\" Still silence. \"You know what guys, maybe I'll come to the party. But I'm done with this lunch.\" And with that, Cassi stormed out, she checked her watch, 1:50 pm, and realized Madison was probably back from class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was on her computer during English lit. It was her last class of the day, and she could not wait to get back to the dorms to ask Madison how the day went. Kelly wasn't sinister, or...at least she didn't think she was. She just got a huge rush out of this girl, who used to be hot, and vain, getting knocked down a peg. Plus, reasoned Kelly, it was always nice to get rid of some of the competition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly's class ended at 1:45, and she had a long walk back to the dorm. On the way, she ran into one of her friends, Jessica. Jessica grew up in a rich suburb, and showed it. Never really having much critical thought, and thinking of the world at the surface, she was slim, but never had to work for her figure, the beneficiary of a perfect 10 trophy wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" Jessica asked, \"did you hear about Madison!? She walked across the mall in a bikini?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Kelly responded not wanting to tell Jessica that she had actually put Madison up to that. \"She must be going off the deep end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it,\" Jessica responded. \"If I were that tubby, I think I would wear a burqa to hide all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, yeah! No one wants to see any of that.\" Kelly shifted, trying to seem somewhat empathetic, despite no genuine feelings of empathy existing towards the situation, \"I mean, I just feel so bad for her? How can someone let their body go that bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knowwwwww!\" Jessica said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe talk continued like that for a while, until Kelly got back to the dorm, she checked her watch, 1:58 p.m., <i>\"Now, let's go see how Madison's side of the bet went.</i> she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She let them rain from her hand, down on Madison\u2019s belly. \u201cBecause these tell a different story. If you keep this up you\u2019re gonna have to kiss your old figure goodbye for good.\u201d<br>\r\nMadison tried to push herself up off the floor. But it was no use, she was so full. One little push from Kelly was all it took to get her on her back again.<br>\r\nKelly dug her finger into Madison\u2019s belly and watched as the poor pudgy girl squirmed.<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously, what\u2019s happened to you? You used to be cool and hot. Now you\u2019re just a fat has been.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t my fault and you know it.

Just how much have you put on since then?\u201d<br>\r\nAt this point Madison was fighting back tears. With everything that had already happened this was just too much.

The thought of both of these roommates blowing up, and Madison betraying her friend excited Kelly.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have my reasons, Madison, but that isn't important to you right now, is it?\" Kelly continued, \"The only thing that should matter to you is that I am one click away from showing all of campus what happened to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Madison, this should have been an easy decision, but it wasn't.

She knew other girls had gained weight before, but few had done it in such a dramatic fashion as her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Madison thought about it, could she really sell out her friend like this? Cassi was about the only person who was still being actually nice to her? Maybe she could just say yes to buy some time, was her initial thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly, can't we think of something else?\" Madison asked, nearly begging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. I don't know why you assume you have any bargaining power here, Madison. You were the one who blew up. If you hadn't lapsed in self control over and over again, I wouldn't have any material to haunt you with. So what will it be?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly. Stop. This is bizarre.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"10, 9, 8,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you're counting now? Seriously?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"7, 6, 5....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"4, 3, 2, 1.....\"</span></div></div>",

She originally had been excited to pledge, but that was before she blew up, now, it sounded like a horrible idea to her. All the upperclassmen who would evaluate her would know her story. Hot girl who blew up freshman year, and Madison assumed that meant that any chance at an invite to a good sorority was probably shot. \"What? You want me to pledge?\" Madison asked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than that, tubs,\" Kelly responded, \"We're going to go to the TTK sorority kick off party.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison knew what that meant. TTK had a recruitment pool party that most everyone tried to go to. The sisters in the sorority used it as a way to see who was popular among freshman, and who still had a great overall figure. It was an event Madison would have shined at before her softening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Kelly. Why would I go to that?\" Madison asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So everyone else can see what you've done to yourself. I expect you there in a bikini. As a prime candidate for their recruitment, I'll obviously be there to make sure you went through on this.\" Kelly responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Madison reiterated. \"Why would I do that? I'm trying to have people not see any of this.\" Madison grabbed her belly, \"A bikini is the last thing I would do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're sure then, I'll just put these photos up online. If it were me, I would rather be somewhere in person, without food smeared all over my disgusting body? Are you sure about your decision?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison thought about it for a second. She realized she may not be the biggest girl at the party, before the current binge she was on, she knew she only weighed 174. Who knew, maybe it would rain and get cancelled, or Kelly would have a change of heart before it? </span></div></div>",

She was somewhat nervous, not really for the academic part, which she knew she would be fine in, but socially. After being so popular in high school, she hoped the ability for her to make new friends would still be present. As she paced the campus, Madison looked at what she had written on a small sheet of notebook paper, Lit 101, Old Main Rm 3004. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally got to the classroom, Madison saw that most of the seats were filled, a bummer for her, because she wanted a bit of control in who she sat next to. The closest open seat was next to a guy who looked pretty large, at least 270 pounds, and seemed to be somewhat uncomfortable. Madison sat down and did not say anything, creating an awkward silence for a second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you a freshman as well?\" the guy asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what gave me away?\" Madison responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had kind of the same look of nervousness as I did walking in.\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Yeah, I don't have that great of a poker face, I guess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Alex,\" he responded,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they waited for the professor to come in, Alex and Madison got chatty. She learned that he was from Chicago, and was looking to go into business. She liked that he seemed laid back and easy going, and was outgoing enough to take the first step in talking to her. Madison wasn't mean, but she knew she was hot, and that it sometimes intimidated boys, which alternated between annoying and flattering her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison and Alex became friends that day, and throughout the beginning of the semester, Madison looked forward to her literature class and getting to talk to Alex about class, gossip, or other things. She never really invited him out  socially though, even though he would have enjoyed it, Madison just didn't really think about it on Fridays or Saturdays when her and girls were thinking of hitting up a party on fraternity row, or when she was going to grab dinner with friends, they just seemed to be class friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis arrangement worked fine, until Alex decided that he wanted to see more of Madison.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few months after they first met, Madison and Alex were walking down the campus mall and chatting, when Alex went forward and asked Madison if she was interesting in becoming more than friends. They had been having lunch together on days where they had class, and he thought there may be a chance. Alex wasn't stupid. He knew that his size was going to present a challenge to his goal of going out with her, but he thought they had a solid enough connection that perhaps she could see past that kind of thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison,\" he asked while they were walking, trying to balance casualness with importance, \"would you ever want to grab dinner sometime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison stopped walking. She was really hoping that he was not asking her out. As a hot girl, she hated finding out that someone who she thought liked her for friendship was actually just interested in her physically. She liked Alex enough as a friend that she doubted that was just the case, however, she liked things as they were. Her and Alex worked well as friends. It didn't help Alex's case that as bad as Madison felt about it, she just didn't find him very attractive, he was larger than her tastes, and for Madison, that was enough for her to decline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean...like on a date?\" she asked, making direct eye contact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, yeah, I guess.\" Alex said, immediately regretting his decision. His heart was racing, and he was getting a rush from this moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex, I umm, I think it's really sweet, but...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Alex's heart sunk, he knew that was it. He felt so stupid for even trying. Would Madison want to be friends with him any more? Would she even talk to him? Madison continued, \"...I just think we are better as friends. Since I've gotten here, you've been one of the nicest people here to me, but I don't want to risk losing that.\" For Madison, it was part truth part whitewashing. He was a friend that she held in deep regard. However, had she been sexually interested in Alex, she would have happily taken that risk. Madison continued, \"I'm sorry, you probably hate me right now.\" she said, trying to deflect blame on herself to make it less awkward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Alex sad, crushed, \"Forget I ever brought it up, that was stupid of me.\" He said walking away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, Madison was on her laptop, typing from the desk in her dorm room, chatting online with Cassi, who was stuck in a night class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Madison: Yeah, I feel bad, but I just am not going to go out with him. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, another blue tab popped up on her email server, a chat message from Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Alex: Sorry about this afternoon, I agree about being friends.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison thought about what to say, when her original tab with Cassi popped up, reading, <i>Cassi: Is it his size?</i> Madison generally didn't like to highlight the imperfections of others, but she was frustrated by the day she was having, and was still vain enough to care deeply about these things. She wrote in a chat window, <i>Yes! He's just so fat. I don't mind Alex, but I find his fat depressing. He struggles to fit in the desks at class, and what would people say if we went out? Why would I go out with him when guys with 6-packs are checking me out! I just find it disgusting.</i> and she clicked enter. Until she realized something horrible. She had written the message to the wrong window. That message was not sent to Cassi, reading it while bored in her lecture hall. It went to Alex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"no. no. no. no. NO. NO. NO.\" Madison screamed \"DID I REALLY JUST DO THAT? OH GOD NO.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantaneously, in his dorm room, Alex got a message response tab from Madison, and saw the entire message. At first he didn't understand. Then he realized that the message was intended for someone else. Alex started to cry a bit. He knew he looked stupid, crying, but he was alone in his dorm room and couldn't help it. Not only did this girl not want to date him, but she was more than fine with making fun of him to other people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in her dorm room, Madison was panicking. She wanted to throw her $1,500 laptop out the window in a fit of rage, she quickly typed up another message, <i>Madison: Oh my god, Alex, I am so sorry. That message was supposed to go to Cassi.</i> she hit send. \"What am I thinking?! I just confirmed to Alex I was talking about him.\" Madison thought, so she typed up another message. <i>I was just trying to be sarcastic with Cassi---you know, over the top, I don't think that about you. I've changed my mind, we should grab dinner on Friday. Just us.</i> Madison was now crying in front of her computer as well. She could not believe she had done this to someone. She anxiously waited for a response from Alex that evening, but one never came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex's opinion of Madison Kraft changed that evening. He had gone from holding her in admiration, to thinking she was fake and shallow. Someone who was nice to everyone for social perception, but just like the popular girls from high school, and he wanted to make her pay. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was two years following graduation, and Madison felt as if she were finally an adult. After two years of living with Cassi and Kelly following graduation, at the age of 24, Madison finally had enough money to move in on her own into a stylish apartment downtown. She was making pretty decent money working in corporate, and felt it was time to get her own place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollege was by all accounts, a wild success for Madison. President of her sorority senior year, high grades, prized internships and an immediate job offer. Madison was marked to be a rising star and everything, including her looks continued to be flawless. Despite the temptations that popped up during college, Madison had stayed at 5'7, 130, and if anything, became hotter, as she grew out of her teenage body into that of a 20somethings young professional. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving into work the following Monday, Madison received a message from her boss, Dale which read, \"Madison, I we filled the open position on your team, please get a chance to welcome Alex Hackard to the company when you get a chance.\" Madison sat in silence, starring at the screen. She had somewhat forgotten about Alex, one of meanest, although unintentional, things she had ever done to someone. She never saw Alex again after that chat. He was not in class the following day, and when she went to ask his roommate, she found out that he accepted a transfer offer to U Chicago. This whole situation made Madison extremely nervous, but she figured she needed to walk over to his workspace and make sure everything started off on the right foot. As Madison turned the corner to the previously empty cubical, she was greeted by a complete surprise. Alex...got hot?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGone was the 270 pound somewhat shaggy looking college student she knew freshman year, replaced by someone with model-quality appearance. Alex looked to be down to 160 on a 6'0 frame, he was wearing a tie, dress pants, and dress shirt, but she could tell he had a six pack, or near one. \"Alex?\" she said, to the person slouched over, checking his email. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex still remembered the voice from their friendship freshman year, before he transferred into a much better situation. He remembered his lack of confidence after the incident. How he decided that was when he was going to start working out every night, when he was going to start eating kale and other vegetables instead of his previously red meat heavy diet. That, along with his rigors studies had completely flipped his life. Alex now looked like someone who worked out their whole life, a stunning turnaround. At the firm at which he now worked, he was considered actually slightly more senior than Madison. He still had resentment towards Madison, yet, he was never going to play his hand that early. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison!\" he said, turning around and jumping out of his chair to great her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We're coworkers?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" Alex responded, \"Just like lit 101. This should be fun!\" Madison has no idea how fun, he thought to himself. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the next month, Alex and Madison hit it off like she had remembered. Madison never brought up how their friendship had ended at Powers, since she didn't want to create an awkward situation, for Alex's part, he didn't bring it up either. For Alex, the last thing he wanted to do was alienate Madison so quickly after their reacquaintance. Because of this, their chemistry returned almost immediately. They started eating lunch together, either at the break area or out of the office somewhere. Their bosses noticed how well the two worked together, and praised themselves for their ability to hire teams that worked well together. Co-workers often gossiped, wondering if they got along that well because they were screwing, or because they were just two likable people. It was like the freshman year situation again, but, as adults. However, there was one difference this time--Madison grew a desire to take it further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day after work, Madison agreed to grab drinks with Cassi, who was now in year three of law school. Madison was already midway through discribing her Alex delema to her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...does that make me shallow?\" Madison asked, sipping some wine while Cassi shrugged. \"I know,\" Madison continued, \"it does...I know, but like, would he notice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Cassi interjected, \"beyond that, do you really want to date a coworker? Doesn't corporate have something against that kind of thing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure we could get around that.\" Madison replied, \"I mean, we can probably let HR know or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would hooking up with a coworker this early damage your career?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was something Madison had not thought about. Yeah, it would be technically okay, if certain avenues were taken, but would an office romance slow her rise within the company? She already knew an offer to get an MBA on the company's dime had to be coming soon, why risk that for a guy? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may be right, Cassi.\" Madison responded, \"but he's just sooooo cute now, and his personality was never the issue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...as long as you know what you're getting into. Another round?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it.\" Madison responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a month after, Madison finally got the courage to ask Alex if he would be willing to grab dinner. It was now the mid summer, and Madison had invited him for post work socializing on a rooftop patio downtown one Thursday. They looked like model young professionals. Madison, tan from weekend activities, in a work appropriate tan pencil skirt with a trendy blouse. She brought her sunglasses, but left her acompanyng jacket at work, no need for it on a warm day like the one they were currently enjoying. Alex was still as fit as ever, in a grey suit and white undershirt, sans tie now that work had ended, and he had thrown his jacket on the back of the chair. After typical conversation that heavily focused on office gossip, it was Madison, this time, who gained the courage to ask out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it just me,\" she asked, happy she kept her sunglasses on to avoid direct eye contact, \"or do we hit it off unsually well, like, you know, freakishly well?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex kept a straight face, but inside, he was getting excited, \"Yeah.\" he said, taking a drink of his beer, and then continuing, \"I would say we're close friends.\" After the rejection 6 years ago, he was going to make Madison explicitly ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is probably stupid of me....but I really think we need to explore this further,\" Madison said. \"We need to see if this is something that people don't normally have between each other.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you suggesting we go out?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Want to grab dinner tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Alex said, this time, not being able to contain his excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the time, they talked with much more affection, until they left the bar. As they exited the building, back onto the sidewalk downtown, as Madison was walking away, Alex pulled off something he never would have been able to in his old body with Madison, or otherwise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Madison,\" he said, causing her to turn around, now about 10 feet away from him. \"Why wait until tomorrow? My place is right down the street.\" With that Madison cracked a slightly guilty smile and walked towards him, \"I think that's a great idea,\" she said, touching his chest as she went to spend the night as his place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning, Alex heard a cell phone alarm go off at 6:30 am. He rolled over, and was greeted by a naked Madison, who was already out of bed, and turning off her phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,  I know we don't need to be in until 8, but I needed to run home and get a change of clothes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You live like 3 buildings away from me.\" Alex said, still groggy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know, but can't be too careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I at least make you breakfast or something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but can I use your shower while you're making it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go for it!\" Alex said, pleased that this was going as planned. \"Hey, would a smoothie be good? Then you could take it with you while you walk back to your apartment\" He said, hoping for an affirmative answer. From the bathroom, Madison replied, \"Sounds yummy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex proceeded to go to his kitchen, and dug through the back of his pantry to the protein powder. <i>Let's hope this doesn't overpower everything else</i> he thought to himself as he put multiple scoops equaling nearly 1,500 calories into his blender. To try to compensate he put loads of fruit and juice in as well, hoping to drown out the flavor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n15 minutes later, Madison emerged, ready to walk back to her place, where Alex was waiting, handing her a travel mug with the smoothie in it. \"That's so nice of you!\" She said, taking a sip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, is it good?\" Alex asked, genuinely curious about the answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent\" Madison said, leaving out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she left, Alex thought about how much time they would have to spend together for any kind of adjustment in her diet to have an impact. He honestly had no idea, it really all depended on how much time she exercised, which he could vaguely control, and how fast her metabolism was, which he assumed he couldn't....however, he walked to his computer to research that, just in case. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As they reached late summer, Alex and Madison had a beach day. He felt somewhat frustrated that his tan girlfriend still had a model body that everyone could envy. Seeing her prance around in her bikini with confidence, he realized that he was not doing enough. Yes, they had been indulging some, but Madison still worked it all off. Living separately didn't make it any easier for Alex to make Madison larger, either. She also seemed somewhat resilient to his efforts to expand her waistline, with her steadfast self control. If they went out for dinner more than one in a week, he found Madison ordering a salad for her entree, if they were grabbing drinks after work for a second night, she would order a vodka water and slowly nurse. \"If only this girl drank more beer,\" he thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for their relationship, Alex had to admit that this had never been better for them. They had never gotten around to actually notifying HR about their relationship, but Alex's friends who knew about it could not stop commenting to him about the fox that he had snagged. Madison's friends, especially Cassi were happy for Madison agreed that Alex was great. They still had a flame, with Madison seemingly leading the charge. Still, Alex was not satisfied, he wanted to make Madison pay for the pain she had inflicted on him in undergrad, he just needed to figure out how, now that normal indulgence didn't seem to be working. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked into the morning team meeting the following Monday, he was greeted with a bit of hope. As the meeting progressed, his boss Dale informed them of the new lunch policy, \"Everyone, this month is going to be rough. Many long hours for everyone, and were going to have to work lunch. That being said, the company will be paying for your meals while we are going through this stretch.\" This immediately gave Alex some hope. Madison usually just brought a salad into lunch and snacked on that. <i>If I could somehow influence the lunch orders to make them fattening...</i> Alex thought to himself, while the meeting went on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the meeting, he went to his boss' administrative assistant, Stacy. Stacy was an unremarkable middle aged woman in her 50s who everyone was fine with, but no one really went out of their way to talk to. Being friendly, Alex had struck up a somewhat good rapport with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Stacy,\" he said, striking up a conversation, \"I hear the company is picking up lunch for the next few weeks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Dale told me before the team meeting this morning, quite the expense,\" she said while filing out some routine paperwork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any idea what we will be getting?\" Alex inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. But Dale said I have to figure it out, and make sure everyone likes it, seems like kind of a lot of work.\" she said, giving Alex an opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you know what? I'll just do it.\" Alex said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I really should, it's my assignment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can still look like you're doing the work, but I'll take a tally of people before lunch and send you the results.\" Alex said, trying to sound helpful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be great! Thanks Alex.\" Stacy replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex smirked as he walked away. Maybe if he could limit Madison's lunch options to fattening foods, that could open her up to some future pounds. On the first day he sent Stacy the 'group consensus' Italian food from a take out chain. Of course, he was sure there was a salad option, but he knew the dressing at these places sent the salads into almost a worse place than the entrees. As Madison dug in, drenching her leafs in the dressing, Alex saw hope. Perhaps this plus weekend indulgences could finally break Madison's stellar ability to burn off food. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two weeks had passed, and it was another morning after Madison had spent the night at Alex's. As they got out of the shower, Madison mentioned something to him, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I just weighed myself, and I've gained 5 pounds over the last few weeks,\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" He asked, trying to contain any excitement over the first dent in her armor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, can you tell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe honestly could not. Maybe her stomach looked a bit softer, but it certainly was not obvious. Madison continued, \"yeah, I'm going to need to work out more if we are going to be eating lunch at work every day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex thought to himself, \"Yes! This is working,\" as he mentally went through the fattening meals that he instructed Stacy, the secretary, to order for their work team while they were productive over lunch. He was hoping this would keep up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt work that day, Alex got called in to his boss Dale's office. Not knowing what it was in regards to, he was naturally a bit nervous. He thought that their productivity on his team had been satisfactory, and he was hoping that rumors of layoffs were not coming his way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDale started, \"Alex, we've been reviewing your team's work, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex got very nervous, he assumed everything was going well, but why would he be in here if that was the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and we have decided that you're in line for more responsibility. We're promoting you to Senior Analyst, on track for corporate leadership. You'll get a healthy raise in salary to match the increase in responsibility, and you're going to manage the team of workers you are currently on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was shocked. He knew that both him and Madison had caught the eye of their older coworkers, but he had no idea a promotion was already in the works. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what to say,\" Alex said, still a bit shocked, \"Thank you! You will not be disappointed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't expect to be,\" Dale responded, \"now, let me show you your new office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way over to his office, he walked past the cubicle that Madison was in, she turned around with a \"What's going on?\" type expression, and Alex shot her a positive head nod. Once they got into the office, Dale shook Alex's hand. \"I think you're going to like being out of cubicle land,\" he said, before walking out, and leaving Alex to look around his office. It was big enough for his wrap around desk, and two chair in front. As the IT person set up his new computer, he looked over some duties that now fell under his purview. He now had, among other things, control over the schedules and expenditures for his sub-department, which included Madison. \"I'm Madison's boss...\" he thought to himself, wondering how this could play into his plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Madison walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking at a new senior analyst for our accounts!\" Alex said, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congrats!\" Madison said, coming up and hugging him. Secretly, she was disappointed that it was not her. She had assumed that she was in line for the next promotion, and was crushed that her rapid assent up the corporate ladder was being slowed by her boyfriend. Madison felt a level of jealousy she was not used to, but she didn't want to display that juvenile emotion to Alex, who she now knew was in the awkward position of being her boyfriend and her boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get dinner to celebrate after work,\" Alex responded, knowing full well that they could not display any kind of PDA at the work place, lest HR find out he was now dating a subordinate. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alex's secretary plopped yet another pile of papers on Madison's cluttered desk. Since Alex had taken the reigns of the department, he had diverted a large amount of extra paperwork to his significant other. Madison, a dutiful employee attempting to climb the corporate ladder, received the extra work with open arms. She consistently stayed at the office past dark, sometimes not leaving until nine or ten o'clock. Most days she was forced to eat all three meals (plus a few snacks) at the office's new buffet. Tonight was no different. The new pile of paperwork on her desk meant at least a few more hours of work, forcing to once again eat dinner at the office. It was already 6:30, so she decided to take a break for dinner. She tossed the two empty Twinkie wrappers that were sitting on her desk in the trash and she hoisted herself out of her office chair. She quickly adjusted her panties then headed out the door to the buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Alex first started assigning Madison more work, she made a point to take the stairs to make up for her lost workout time. This habit slowly disappeared after a few weeks, and for the last three months she had been taking the elevator. Madison jammed the down button as she waited impatiently for the sleek metal doors to open. The doors finally opened, revealing a full elevator of employees, most of whom were heading home. She stepped on, slipping between two men carrying briefcases. She pressed the button for the cafeteria floor and watched the doors closed. She looked at herself in the mirror that wrapped around the perimeter of the elevator. When she started taking the elevator a two months ago, the mirror would reveal the lustful eyes of the men behind her staring at her tight, round derriere. Now, the men paid no attention to the beautiful young lady's rear, transfixed on their phones instead of the fleshy behind that filled her size ten dress slacks. The doors opened and Madison stepped off into the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison grabbed a tray and headed over to the buffet, skipping over the salad bar that stood in front of it. She stuck to salads for the first few weeks, but as her workload grew and grew, she decided that the measly salads weren't providing her with enough energy. Madison loaded her tray with a heaping serving of chicken alfredo. She made her way down the table, adding more and more of her favorite foods. She accompanied the chicken alfredo with sides of pizza and bread sticks, along with a slice of apple pie with two scoops of vanilla ice cream. She then filled her cup with Mountain Dew and made her way to one of the ten or so tables that filled the cafeteria. Today was a Friday, so most people had left work already, leaving the cafeteria completely empty. She placed her tray at an open table and took a seat. She picked up her fork and went to town on her feast. Within fifteen minutes she had cleared her plates of any trace of food. She took the last swig of her soda and headed back to the buffet for seconds. As she was reloading up her tray, she felt a tightness at her waist. Her bloated belly pressed against the button of her slacks, forcing her zipper to creep open. The fabric around her rear and thighs seemed as though it was stretched to the limit, causing her to walk a little funny. She ignored these signs and made her way back to the table. She she sat down the inevitable happened. \"POP!\" The tightness around her waist suddenly disappeared, as did the button on her pants. She cursed to herself as she lifted up her shirt, revealing her chubby belly peeking over her panties between the new opening in her pants. This was the second time in the past month that she had ruined a pair of slacks. As the stress and workload of her job mounted up, so did her weight, skyrocketing up almost 40 pounds.Whenever she would try to exercise and suppress her growing appetite, her job would get in the way, foiling any plans of losing weight. She never expected that Alex had anything to do with her weight gain, even though he didn't seem to mind the extra pounds. Popping the button on her pants briefly renewed her thoughts of losing weight, causing her to lose her appetite for the moment. She discarded the food in the trash and made her way to the car while she attempted to hide her bulging waistline by pulling down her shirt. She sat down the driver's seat and started her commute back to Alex's place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison tore off her work clothes and replaced them with a tank top and running shorts. The tank top, a size small, would have been flattering a few months ago, but since she had packed on the pounds, barely covered her belly button. The running shorts, formerly a loose fit, were now filled by Madison's growing thighs. Madison headed to the freezer, grabbed a fresh pint of Ben and Jerry's, and headed to the TV room. The ass that was once tight and admired, now jiggled with each step. She plopped onto the touch and flipped on the TV. Madison, once a fit, active young woman, was now a symbol of gluttony. As she greedily devoured scoop after scoop of ice cream, her tank top rose farther up her chubby belly. By the time her spoon reached the bottom of the carton, her top had risen all the way to her ample breasts, which bulged out the edges of her top. Madison looked down at her pudgy body. Her breasts were now approaching double D's, sinking farther and farther down her chest. Traces of stretch marks were beginning to appear on her love handles, which bulged over the waist of her shorts. Her belly was now soft, squishy, and big. She slapped it, watching the the thick layer of fat jiggle uncontrollably. The bottom of her belly sagged over the top of her shorts and onto her thighs, which now resembled two massive bags of pancake mix, pressing into each other forming a table of fat. Her examination of her growing body was suddenly interrupted by the sound of someone at the door.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alex walked in, not expecting anyone to be in his apartment, before he saw Madison's car on the way over. He wondered if her compact was becoming less comfortable as she put on a bit of weight. Since he last saw her, she was stressed and eating, and had already witnessed the bulk of her gain. However, he was curious, since she had again made claims of trying to start a diet, and saying this had never happened to her. Alex pretended to be supportive of it, but in reality, he was thrilled to see the weight pile back on the former hottie who had shammed him when he was at the bottom  of the social ladder. Given these feelings, he loved what he saw when he walked into the den of his apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was your trip??!!\" Madison said, running up to hug him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wearing the clothes she used to lounge around in, except now, they did not look all that comfortable. Her legs, which were now tight in the loose running shorts; the belly, which was peaking out of the tank top. It was clear that she had not done all that much exercising while he had been on on the trip. Alex, on the other hand, had been working out the whole time, and had retained his ripped figure. As she dragged him to the bedroom, he could not help but notice that Madison was now the soft one, the one who seemed insecure about her body, and he wanted this to continue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning, Alex was almost in awe of what he was doing to her former model like body. The now 170 pound office worker was struggling to put on a high waisted skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Commmeee onnnnn,\" Madison said, trying to get the clasp to close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need some help with that,\" Alex asked, rising out of bed in only his underware, making his pudgy girlfriend a bit red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm just getting fat. I need to start exercising more, and go on a diet. It's just all the work we are doing,\" she replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, it sucks,\" Alex said, \"But the work should slow down soon, we're just in a rough patch, plus the higher ups have been really loving all your work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Madison asked, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I bet they'll promote you soon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was lying to Madison. He had been taking credit for most of her work. Maybe if she had not been dating Alex, she would have noticed the lack of recognition, but all her extra hours at the office were doing little to advance her career. On top of that, Alex had gone out of his way to mention the contributions of some of the other team members, lest Madison get a promotion which would reduce his influence over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the past few months as summer moved into fall, they had kept their relationship a secret from the rest of the office, much to Madison and Alex's surprise. Because  of that, coworkers had no reservations in gossiping about the fallen hottie around Alex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, while Alex was getting coffee on their floor's kitchenette, a fellow coworker Mike was waiting next to him and struck up a conversation. Eventually, it got to some of the other women in the office, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a shame what happened to Madison,\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Alex asked, trying to play dumb so as not to have any kind of weird HR issues arise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is really porking up. She used to be the hottest talent in this office--now, I don't know, she may still be cute, but a few more pounds, and goodbye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex tried to steer the conversation away from that, but the notice of others was making him more and more excited. Another day, he heard two other subordinates, Jenn and Alice talking outside his office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you seen her ass? She really needs to lay off the sweets.\" Jenn said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For real,\" Alice replied, \"does she even care about what others think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Alex, these exchanges were keeping him motivated in his ultimate goal of getting Madison to the place where they would be a reverse image of their freshman year. </span></div></div>",

Madison's last ten pounds had started to alter her face. She already had begun to look more jolly as her sharp features had been receding, but now, a double chin was starting to come in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Madison looked at skirts that she could wear for work, Alex noticed how large her butt looked. Any traces of the hot ass she once had were now gone, but it was still hard for him to believe the former hottie now had such a large rear, and accompanying love handles that rose above it. He assumed further weight would begin to roll and give her back fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Madison had finished getting her work clothes, they walked through a high end department store on their way back to the car. Madison looked off towards the women's clothing section. Even in her transition to a softer body, she still loved shopping, and now she had found herself an amazing dress. Madison looked at it, knowing it was a tad small. It was a navy cocktail dress than was classy, as well as far from frumpy. The kind of dress that would show off things in the right places, and minimize the bad. She went to check the tag...size 8. Madison thought about it, and decided to get it. Walking back to Alex, she announced, \"I'm getting this dress.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice! You should try it on for me when you get home,\" Alex said suggestively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" Madison replied with determination, \"I can't fit in it right now....this dress is aspirational, today starts my diet plan. You know the annual company Christmas party? I'm going to lose 25 pounds by then, so I can start looking good again and wow people at work.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex knew that Madison had made other proclamations before, but this seemed to be one that she was actually determined to pull off. Their annual Christmas party was a formal affair, attended by everyone in the company, at the top of their building. Given Madison's wounded ego and ever present sense of vanity, he knew that she may actually pull it off and lose a few pounds. </span></div></div>",

Yeah let's go!\" <br>\r\nMadison smiled as she followed Cassi to their room. First week and she was already invited to a party. Maybe college wouldn't be so different from high school after all. Looking through her closet she found her favorite \"make an impression\" party outfit. It was a little black and gold dress, that perfectly showed off her perky breasts, firm bottom, and toned legs without looking too slutty. It was what had cemented her status as the hottest girl in school back in Florida. She kept smiling as she pulled it over her head and down over her body. She then reached back and quickly zipped it up with no problems. <br>\r\nShe then went to the bathroom and after a half hour of makeup and hair, she was ready for her first college party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Madison to fit in at the party. While many college freshman might have been intimidated by the task of being thrust into the world of college boys and alcohol, Madison took it completely in stride. College parties weren't that much different than high school ones, she figured, and it never hurt to be smoking hot either. The boys were lining up to talk to her, get her drinks, and pretty much anything else she wanted. By the time she finally stumbled home with her friends, Madison was in a state of pure bliss, she was going to enjoy the college life...</span></div></div>",

After all of her classes and homework she found that she just didn't have the energy anymore. She would start to feel tired after only a couple miles on the treadmill and her usual workout took longer than usual. More and more she was starting to dread it, and more and more her workout was shortened. Some days she would just put it off. <i>I'll just have to do twice as much tomorrow</i> she'd think. But then the next day would roll around and she would still not feel up to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was pondering how much she would have to run today, she had skipped the day before but she had ran five miles the day before, no she only ran one mile the day before she had had that really long lab... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was walking down the hall to Ginger's room, they were in the same chemistry class, so they often walked together.

Her face was red and she seemed out of breath. \"Ready?\" Madison nodded and Ginger headed off down the hall. Was it Madison's imagination, or was Ginger's behind filling out her shorts a little more than usual? Madison shook her head. She definitely couldn't skip the gym today... \"Oh by the way,\" Ginger called back, \"remember those guys that had the party the first week, well they invited us to another one!\"</span></div></div>",

She hadn't seen anyone at the first party since but she was confident they would remember her in the dress. Plus she just wanted to show off for a little after the grind of all the homework. She pulled the dress over her head, and down over her body, where it bunched up around her hips and rear. She frowned, it had never done that before, must have put it on wrong or something. She grabbed the hem and yanked down, shimmying her hips a little. It didn't take much and she had it over her hips. She then reached back to zip it, only for it to get stuck halfway. \"Oh you've got to be kidding me!\" She marched over to Cassi, who was also getting ready for the party. \"Hey Cassi, can you zip me up, the zipper's caught or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do you if you do me.\" She replied. As she tugged on the zipper to her own dress. Madison agreed and turned around. Cassi zipped it up without much difficulty, but Madison noticed a new tightness around her chest. <i>Like my boobs are bigger.</i> she thought and then brushed it off. Instead focusing on Cassi's dress. She pulled up but only managed to get it up a few inches before it stopped again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, suck it in a little Cassi, I can't quite get it.\" She did and Madison managed to get it up the rest of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi tried to adjust it to make it more comfortable but it was clearly too tight, \"I guess I'm a little bloated.\" She said nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison nodded. <i>Or you're gaining weight</i> she thought to herself as they left for the party.</span></div></div>",

At least that was the theory she was running with.Most days would consist of Madison waking up, going to class, eating lunch, doing work at the library. Then going to her labs, eating dinner, and finally going back to her room to work on homework.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day after classes Cassie came into their room to find Madison sitting at her computer, typing some sort of paper, munching on a bag of potato chips. \"Right where I left you.\" she commented jokingly hitting Madison on the shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey this paper is due tomorrow. I still have another page to write. I lost track of time studying for that stupid chem test.\" Madison turned around in her desk chair and was a little surprised at what she saw. Cassi had unbuttoned her jeans and was now laying down on her bed, rubbing what could only be described as a belly. Angry red marks showed where the waistband had cut into the soft flab. Cassi had definitely gained weight, probably close to the dreaded freshman fifteen. Madison was so engrossed in the sight that she nearly missed what Cassi was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So yeah I figured we could all go party this weekend, since we'll all be done with our midterms. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sounds good I guess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I guess? Since when has Madison Kraft not wanted to party?</i> Cassi looked at her roommate. Something was definitely different about her. She had been very docile lately, more engrossed in her books and laptop than boys and the gym. Upon closer examination Cassi thought she saw maybe the tiniest bulge over the waistband of Madison's jeans. Her mood wasn't the only thing that was changing...</span></div></div>",

She needed to be with other people and not have to worry about all the stresses her classes were causing her. She smiled as she pulled out her impression dress, she wanted to be her absolute best tonight, the guys wouldn't know what hit them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled it over her head and let it fall down her body, at least until it bunched up around her hips again. She sighed and started tugging down, only for it to get hung up around the widest part of her ass. She frowned and pulled down hard, which forced ti the rest of the way over. <i>There we go, now just the zip,</i> she reached back and pulled up on the zipper, only for it to remain stuck at the bottom. \"With this again? I'm going to have to get a new zipper for this.\" She went over to the bathroom where Cassi was putting her makeup on. She had decided to do with a larger more flowing red dress, no doubt to hide her ballooning belly. \"Cassi, can you zip me up it's stuck again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, turn around.\" Madison did and Cassi pulled up on the zip, getting it about halfway before it stopped again. \"Ok suck it in a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Suck it in? Madison had never had to suck in to fit in this dress. But she obliged and Cassi got it up a little more. Madison could feel the material squeezing her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi pulled until her fingers hurt but the dress wouldn't zip the rest of the way. \"Ouch! I'm sorry Madison, but I can't get it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it has to fit-hmph! This is my-Ug! favorite-nrgh! dress!\" She groaned as she yanked at the zip, but it didn't budge. In fact as Madison huffed and puffed her body actually forced the zipper down a little. \"Ok, one more time. I'll really suck it in, you pull as hard as possible, ok?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi nodded, noting the rising panic in Madison's voice. Madison sucked in for all she was worth and Cassi pulled as hard as she could and slowly but surly the dress closed. Cassi signaled she got it and Madison gave a sigh of relief. Which is when they both heard the: <i>RIPPP</i>.Madison's face went red as she looked at the side of her dress where the seem was now split wide open. Cassi didn't know what to say as Madison stomped off in disgust, ending up in her closet again. \"What are you doing?\" she asked.</span></div></div>",

From the close confines of their freshman dorm room, Cassi could see just how much her roommate had grown. It wasn't huge, and more wouldn't even call Madison chubby, but it was striking to see her so much fuller, and the Freshman 15 had clearly happened. Some love handles now hung over her panties, and Cassi noted that Madison had declined to wear a thong, something she probably would have done before, especially with the possibility of hooking up ever present. There was good reason for that too, Madison's butt looked fuller, and far less firm than it had before. Her legs were by no means thunder thighs, but also were no longer the lean polls they were when she got to campus, looking at it now, it was obvious that her rommate was not going to fit into much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison walked back out with a stylish skirt and a trendy, designer button up oxford. \"These were a bit big for me at the start of the year, they'll probably work,\" Madison said, increasingly nervous that she was to going to find anything to wear. </span></div></div>",

Her shirt went on pretty well, her small stomach wasn\u2019t big enough to cause any problems but her bust was giving her trouble. Madison had to exhale and then pull frantically to get one button done. Then she had to do it again and again. Eventually she had enough done up that she thought she wouldn\u2019t look too slutty. She still showed off a lot of cleavage and she looked ready to burst out of it, but she figured it was a party, and guys would like that kind of thing. Then she started on the skirt. Cassi had been right in her earlier assessment. Madison\u2019s thighs had started to fill out and they were the first problem Madison encountered. She couldn\u2019t believe how soft her thighs had become as she slowly worked her skirt up. Her ass was another problem. This time the skirt bit into her hips and her rear spilled over the top and jiggled much more than Madison would have thought possible. But with a lot of jumping up and down and pulling she got them on. The button was a struggle but her after a few moments that too proved manageable. <br>\r\nNow completely in a bad mood Madison looked at her roommate, \u201cOk, let\u2019s go to this stupid party\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Eventually she found herself over at the food table with Cassi, who noticed Madison living it up in more ways than one. Not only was that her fourth of fifth beer it was also her fourth or fifth plate from the food table. But Madison didn\u2019t care or notice. Nor did she notice that her stomach was starting to strain against the button on her shirt, or that her bust had popped open one of the buttons on top and the others didn\u2019t look far behind. <i>What has happened to Madison?</i>  Cassi wondered.</span></div></div>",

She had woken up in her room unable to remember how she had gotten there. She groggily looked up and saw Cassi getting ready to go out on some errands. \u201cWhat happened last night.\u201d Madison asked. Cassi quickly filled her in on all the partying, the guys, the beers, and how Cassi had eventually dragged Madison back to her room after she was doing less walking and talking and more stumbling and slurring. \u201cWell thanks for getting me home, I owe you one.\u201d Madison sighed gratefully.<br>\r\nCassi shrugged, \u201cNo problem, it\u2019s what roommates do.\u201d<br>\r\nAfter Cassi left Madison sat up instantly noticing a few things: one she had a pounding headache, two she was still in her clothes from last night and three those clothes felt like they were biting into her. She undid her shirt noticing that one of her buttons was missing; not thinking much of is she pulled it off. She stood and undid her skirt, which sprung open with the slightest touch to the clasp. She then pulled that off too, or at least tried to. For some reason they wouldn\u2019t slide back over her hips and rear. It was like they were glued onto her.  \u201cCome on you stupid thing.\u201d Madison groaned as she struggled to pull it down.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Feeling completely at ease with the world Madison barley noticed the world go by as she lay there floating on her back completely at the will of the small waves that where formed by her fellow pool goers. Madison didn't even notice that some of the guys around thee pool where checking her out, mind you even if she did notice she wouldn't care, she loved the attention, the validation that her beauty was something to behold and admired filled her with joy. Barley conscious of the fact it was getting late and slowly but surely  people where starting to leave and the fact that the gym would be closing until tomorrow Madison was still enjoying the cool of the water until a sudden and uncomfortable feeling rocked through her body causing her jolt up, the sudden movement made Madison lose her concentration and as a result her body fell through the water. Madison was only down there for a second before she burst up out from under the water tossing her hair back it almost looked like a scene from some dumb 90's movie where they introduce the hot girl to the audience. Madison looked around surprised at what just happened wiping the water and stuck bits of hair from her face unsure of what to make of what happened until the same uncomfortable feeling struck her again. Clutching her stomach Madison's cheeks reddened as she realized what the feeling in her stomach was, she was hungry she had been so rapt up in her  relaxation she forgot that she hadn't eaten since breakfast. Checking the clock on the wall she saw just how late it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"shit its 8:30pm, god the cafeteria shuts at nine, if i hurry i might make it there in time to get a sandwich\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Madison quickly swam over to the side of the pool and easily pulled her self out of the water, quickly rushing over to the chair where her towel was ,but still being mindful of the fact that she was covered in water so was the floor she slipped on a pair of black flip flops that coincidentally matched her toe nail polish, Madison power walked as fast as she could to the changing rooms to retrieve her stuff and get out of her bikini. Once in the changing rooms and in front of her locker she pulled off her rubber wrist band that had the key attached to it and opened the locker ready to put her regular clothes back on and fill her belly with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Madison was out of her swim wear and back in her regular clothes she checked her watch to see how much time she had left \" crap 15 minutes\" Madison was starting to panic the thought of going to bed as hungry as she was, was unimaginable. What Madison didn't realize was that the college had vending machines dotted all round the campus and it that wasn't enough she could always leave the campus grounds and go to a local fast food place. Stuffing the last of her stuff in her gym bag she began to run towards the cafeteria, which was hard to do as she was still wearing her flip flops, \" I can do this not fa...\" she ran round the corner Madison was cut off as she ran in something soft yet sturdy knocking her flat on her back.<br>\r\nMadison pushed her self up of the ground  slowly rubbing her forehead, a little shaken from the sudden fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" what the hell just happened\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD I'M SOOOOO SORRY SOMEONE MY SIZE REALLY SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL ITS JUST IT BE  KIND OF HARD\"  a female voice spoke sporadically <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are talking abo...\" once again Madison was cut of but this time it was out of shock at the sight that stood before her.  standing in front of with a concerned look and and nervous smile on her face was with out a doubt the largest person she had ever seen, this girl wasn't fat but she was on the large side of chubby but that wasn't what was shocking about her, what made Madison take a step back was the fact that this girl was a giant, she was easily the tallest person Madison had ever seen i mean she didn't even come up to this girls breasts. Madison stared wide eyed at the young giant, she looked about the same age as Madison her face was round and looked like it had the beginnings of a double chin, her skin was pale with a few freckles, light grey eyes and raven black hair, she was quite the looker.<br>\r\nTrying to break the awkward silence the Giant girl spoke her voice soft and small a total contrast to her physical form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" i know what your thinking, where did i find pink converse in my size?\" she said with a smile <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly over her shock Madison smiled at the random statement and decided to play along<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Actually i was wondering where your goose was\" she smiled up to her <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"my goose?\" a confused look appeared on the young colossus's face only to be replaced moments later with a smile \" ha that's a good one, my names Haley i'm new here\" she said extending her hand. <br>\r\nMadison smiled and shook Haley's over sized hand \"i'm Madison its my first year as well\"<br>\r\nJust then Madison belly let out a loud groan reminding her that she was hungry, looking at her watch she saw that she only had five minutes, there was no way she was going to make it in time. <br>\r\n\"hungry?\" Haley said with a smile. Madison's cheeks turned red as she blushed slightly embarrassed by this whole situation. \"y.yeah i haven't had anything since breakfast\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" hmm, Hey! why don't you follow me to my dorm and join me for dinner, oh! we can watch old 90's movies where the hot girl is introduced by bursting out of the pool in slow motion\"                <br>\r\n <br>\r\nMadison wasn't sure if it was a good idea she did just meet her after all, but before she could dwell on it further her stomach let out another moan and her mind was made. \"sure why not\" throwing caution to the wind.<br>\r\n\"great follow me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short walk they arrived at Haley's dorm room as Madison stood there waiting for Haley to open the door she noticed two things, the first being that Haley even made the doors look small as she had to bend considerably to reach the key hole, the second being that their rooms where on the same floor, <i>That can't be right i would deferentially remember seeing a girl as big as her  </i> Madison thought to her self as she watched Haley squat down and pull herself through the door, flowing close behind and closing the door she had to know why she had yet to lay eyes on her, once Haley put there diner in the microwave the two of them where on sat down watching T.V . \" so what gives we live on the same floor, doors apart and i haven't seen you i mean no offence but your hard to miss\"  she said gesturing towards Haley who had a mixed look of sadness and amusement on her face, seeing this Madison felt like she said something wrong \"oh my god i didn't mean to offend you\"<br>\r\nHaley just waved it off \"no no it's fine, your right i am hard to miss, and that's why i tend to keep to my self people tend to act.....differently when around me\"<br>\r\nsensing a sore subject Madison decided to change it and try and get to know her new friend <br>\r\n\"so Haley tell me about your self\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i from a small village in Texas where i was the town tallest resident, as you can imagine its not all its cracked up to be\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wow, that's something, Kelly's got nothing on you\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Kelly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh right Kelly's one of my friends she played basket ball high school\" Madison cleared up  \"and used to be tall until you showed up i'l introduce you to her, hey i bet you played a bit of b-ball to\"             <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nHaley smiled \"yeah when i was smaller around 6'8\" then during practice i tripped and broke my ankle and just never got back in to it, as you can probably tell\" she said with a sheepish smile patting her belly sending waves of jiggles through it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison didn't know what to make of that last comment and decided to try and blow past it \"wow you call that small how tall are you\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well to me it is, hmm, last i checked i was 7'6\" and a half\" she said flatly her voice had a hint of resentment to it. Madison didn't have a chance to respond as the timer on the microwave went of signaling there food was ready.            <br>\r\n                                                       </span></div></div>",

Of course something that paid decently was going to have a good lead, but then she also had to consider things like hours required and whether she could fit it into her class schedule.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison decided to sign up to be a tutor. She had always been rather smart, and was blessed with the ability to transfer knowledge well to others. Others had told her that she would have made a good teacher, but she thought that she may be a bit short tempered for that kind of work. She got an email back a few days later from student job placement that told her she needed to take a quick exam in a few days to certify that she had a high level understanding of courses that she could teach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later Madison took the test and found out that she could tutor people in a wide variety of subjects, so she was good to go. Madison wasn't that shocked, since she had gone to a private school back in Coral Gabels, which was pretty rigorous. After the test results came back, Madison met with the head of the Powers University city wide tutoring program, a friendly looking woman in her 50s, Ms. Green. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So who pays for my salary if I get hired by a school.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''It's split by the university and the school that you instruct, on a sliding scale. Richer schools will pay for more of the percentage, and transportation costs than poorer schools, where the university chips in more. We get a lot of our funding for this program from grant money, it's a really great program. It gives our students, like yourself, some good job experience for their resume, and it helps kids get a little extra boost at a lower cost to the schools.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wow, that's really cool, well I'm excited to hear about what I can do.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Great, we matched up the hours that you were available and your subjects you scored highly in with schools that needed assistance on this printout.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison read over the two options, one was for Kelly High School, which was located in the inner city. From what Madison had read about the area before she came to Powers, the school wasn't the best academically, and struggled for a while. An advantage of going there was that it was somewhat close to campus, and she would be helping kids who needed it the most. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second option was Joyce High School, located in a suburb. Madison looked over the profile and it had great average score for the students, and a very high average household income. She figured she could probably relate better to these students, as she also grew up in a rich area. The only downside was that she would have to take the train out to the school, but Ms. Green had already said that was paid for, and she could just do homework during the 15 minute ride it took out there on the express route. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hmm, well this both look very interesting.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Green had been looking at Madison while she was reading the options and noticed that Madison looked rather fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey Madison, please don't take this in an inappropriate manner, but did you work out a lot in high school?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, my family belongs to a gym in Florida.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ah, well you scored very, very high on your physical education portion of the test, so there is a fitness trainer position also available, right here on campus. It is for teens who are trying to lose weight, and you could be one of the counselors who teaches them new exercises, and healthy dietary habits.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I don't know if I'm really qualified for that kind of thing.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You certainly are, and it's a free program, so they won't expect you to know a ton.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ah, well...''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You would still get paid by the University.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth her and Ms. Green laughed when Ms. Green cleared that up for Madison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll let them know.  You'll start Tuesday afternoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she left Ms. Green's office, Madison rationalized her decision. Standing around demonstrating simple exercises to those who had fallen prey to the Freshman 15 didn't sound very exciting to her.  Madison was competitive in the gym, and selective in who she hung out with...she didn't want to be seen with a bunch of sweathogs.  She felt a bit more guilty for turning down the inner city job, as those students might need her help more.  However, she figured she might be able to earn extra money at Joyce if a wealthy family decided to hire her for additional private tutoring.  The possibility meant more time working, of course, but Mom had made it clear that Madison should not expect them to fund an extravagant lifestyle in addition to her college tuition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison returned to her dorm and was about to open the door when Cassi came bouncing out.  \"Hey girl!  I was just going to meet Kelly and Megan for dinner, wanna come?  It's burrito night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good!  But, uh, you know they have those burritos every night, right?  In fact, I'm pretty sure you had one the night before last...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, but I think it should be burrito night for all of us!  I don't want to be the only one eating them.  They're SO good, don't you deny it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison grinned.  Over the past couple of weeks she had discovered Cassi had quite the appetite.  Cassi had a slim, if somewhat untoned figure on her 5'5 frame.  Her backside was a bit large compared to the rest of her, but led to a fantastic pair of legs for her somewhat limited height.  Madison wondered how Cassi stayed skinny if she ate like this all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'm game.  Those burritos are good.  Let's find something to do afterwards, though.  Classes are just getting started and I've been busy all week, we need to get our party on!\"  Cassi grinned and nodded, and off they went to the food hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kelly was already there and had grabbed a table, with a salad placed in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, come on!\" Cassi frowned.  \"I thought we were doing burrito night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!  I don't know how you got your body, but I know I didn't get mine eating burritos three times a week.  Especially the burritos here, they're like the size of my head.  Not that there are a lot of healthy options here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that again,\" a voice behind Kelly said.  \"I heard some girl in our dorm gained like 40 pounds her freshman year.  Can't imagine the rest of Delta Pi was too pleased with that!\" It was Megan, carrying a tray holding a turkey sandwich, large sweet potato and rice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison's eyes bulged.  \"Whoa, what's with all that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm carb loading!  Tryouts for the rugby team are next week and I'm in full training mode.  Gotta have the endurance to keep up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi looked surprised.  \"I didn't know you played rugby.  Heck, I didn't know there was a women's team at Powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly snorted.  \"For real, right?  Seems gross to me.  Isn't it just a bunch of lesbos running around groping each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison gasped.  Kelly certainly wasn't one to mince words in the short time they'd known each other but that seemed too harsh.  However, Megan just laughed, set her tray down and cupped one of Kelly's breasts. \"You just remember who wears the strap on in this relationship, baby.\"  The girls dissolved into laughed as Kelly shrieked and nearly fell out of her chair moving away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs everyone composed themselves, a gurgle was heard from Cassi's direction.  More specifically, from Cassi's stomach.  \"Alright, it's burrito time!  Let's go, Madison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly rolled her eyes.  \"Two good looking, awesome ladies like yourselves can get just about any man on campus and be popular to boot.  You could have the run of this place and you would risk that for burritos?  I know Cassi won't listen, but Madison, you seem sensible.  Don't let your waist go to waste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Kelly get at the dining hall?</span></div></div>",

Cassi had a disappointed look on her face, but walked over to the mexican booth by herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison hadn't exactly told the truth.  She was hungry, and it hadn't taken much for Cassi to talk her into a burrito.  However, Kelly made a good point.  Madison's parents ate healthy and did not often buy junk food to keep around the house.  Madison realized that her habits had already changed a bit in just a couple of weeks away from home.  Not enough to gain any weight, at least she didn't think so.  Still, better to be careful, especially since she hoped to get drunk later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood intentions do not always overcome an empty stomach.  As Madison moved down the line, she found a lot of things that looked good.  Cheese was a must, maybe a few croutons too...ooh, they have bacon bits!  They even had some pasta salad, so she added a little bit on the side.  Of course, she'd need to add ranch dressing too, and it ended up being a generous amount, as Madison did not normally pour dressing on with a ladle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rejoined the girls at their table.  Cassi stuck out her tongue playfully, then took a bite out of her burrito, which was covered in sauce.  Madison felt a little regret but dutifully dug into her salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made the right choice, Madison.  Your body will thank you for it later,\" Kelly said, giving Cassi a brief glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi sat her burrito down and glared at them. \"I'll have you know that I have always eaten what I want, and never struggle with my weight.  In fact, I won a pie eating contest last year.  I just have a fast metabolism that burns all this off, so don't be jealous.  Besides, that ranch dressing isn't exactly good for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly grinned.  \"That's why we got the LOW FAT ranch, right Madison?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I didn't see any low fat ranch dressing over there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhh!  You're supposed to have my back on this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi and Megan laughed, and after a moment Madison and Kelly joined them.  Despite the girls' differences, they had quickly grown to like each other.  Ginger didn't seem to be a part of their group anymore, but that's how it goes in the early days at university.  They quickly moved onto other topics, talking about classes they had, people they'd met, things they'd discovered on campus.  It was a very exciting time for all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, Megan knew of a party going on at a nearby apartment complex her friend lived at, and the girls agreed to go over there.  The beer was plentiful and the girls began mingling, solo cups in hand.  Madison, with her good looks and wit, attracted plenty of attention, and she soon found herself sitting on a couch with a sophomore named Matt.  Matt was studying biochemistry, and had a good sense of humor.  He was cute, though Madison didn't usually fall for the geeks, and she felt a little repulsed when one of Matt's friends stopped by briefly to tell him about the new videogame he'd bought.  Still, she was enjoying their conversation, there wasn't anyone else especially hot to talk to, and most importantly, he was fetching beers and keeping the creepier guys away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard Cassi call out to her, and turned just in time to see Cassi stumble and fall on the carpet.  Kelly dashed over to pick her up, as Cassi slurred that she was fine.  \"You've gotta be kidding me...she couldn't have had more than two, maybe three drinks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison shook her head.  \"Must be a lightweight.  I'll take her home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, you stay.  I'll take her back,\" Kelly said, quickly glancing at Matt and then back to her.  Madison smiled.  She was lucky to have good friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Madison do now?</span></div></div>",

It had become hard to keep track, as Matt was doing a good job of keeping that cup full.  He seemed like a nice boy, but she was having a little trouble keeping up with what he was saying.  Something about how nice a full moon looks this time of year?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and maybe come in for coffee, if you want something to sober you up before you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, are you trying to get me to sleep with you?  We just met!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, it's just that, well, you've had a bit to drink, and I wanted to help out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh lord.  She might be a freshman but this was not Madison's first rodeo.  She moved to get up, but something was wrong.  Her stomach was rather full, and the waistband of her jeans was digging into her a bit, making it hard to sit up straight.  Madison moved to roll off the couch and get away from this creep.  However, the motion jostled her stomach, and she felt some bile coming up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp...*swallow* Hey, I'm not that kind of girl.  Don't take it the wrong way, I'm just not...ugh.\"  Madison clutched at her bloated, sore stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really didn't mean it that way.  Come on, let me help you.  We'll go straight back to your place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Madison glanced up and saw Kelly there, looking concerned.  \"Madison, are you ok?  You don't look well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, Kelly?  You're like the mother hen tonight.  Ca-caw, ca-CAW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe hens cluck, dear.  Why don't we go back to your place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison returned to her dorm, with the assistance of Matt and Kelly.  They said goodnight, and before he turned to go Matt pressed something into Madison's hand.  She walked inside, a little unsteady on her feet but not too bad.  The slip of paper fell out of her hand as she sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, his phone number.  Ehhh.\"  Despite her misgivings about what had happened, the bloated beauty took a minute to focus and put the number in her phone.  Just then she heard laughter coming from Cassi's bed.  She peeked her head and saw her drunk roommate, half naked in bed and leaning over a carton of ice cream, about to put a spoon of ice cream in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi looked up at her.  \"HEY ROOMIE!  Who loves Rocky Roooooad?\"  Madison grinned and got a spoon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison woke up on her bed late in the morning, where she had passed out after helping Cassi finish off the half gallon of Rocky Road.  \"Ooof, these jeans hurt...can't believe I passed out in my clothes.\"  She stripped down to her pink pinstriped underwear and groggily walked to the living space.  Cassi's room was empty, so Madison had plenty of time to shower and start her day.  Sharing a bathroom was a new thing for Madison, and she liked to take her time during her morning routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gorgeous young woman paused in front of the large mirror, which conveniently showed most of her body.  She saw a familiar sight: her beautiful heart-shaped face, marred with just a single little pimple on her cheek that she would easily hide with concealer after showering.  The regular tanning she did at home, combined with her half-latina heritage, gave her an attractive light brown skin tone that was a shade darker than Selena Gomez, but not much.  Her high cheekbones, full lips and feminine but not weak jawline completed the picture.  Madison had truly come out a winner in the genetic lottery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't just hit the jackpot with her facial features, however.  As she looked down, she saw a perfect hourglass figure.  Those perky C-cup breasts had been the two most popular girls in high school, and Madison took full advantage, making sure to keep her cleavage on display.  They tapered down to a well defined waist, a flat belly, and then the gentle flare of her hips.  Madison frowned a bit as she looked at her midsection.  There was a red line near her belly button where the jeans had been digging into her last night.  The bloating from last night had mostly subsided, but was it her imagination or was her ab definition less visible?  While Madison worked out regularly in high school, she preferred to tone and shed fat rather than build a lot of mass, so she didn't have bulging muscles that made women look mannish, in her opinion.  Still, she normally had a defined midsection, and right now she could barely see the ab line running down her tan middle unless she turned a certain way in the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison grabbed her hand mirror and turned around so she could check out her backside.  At least that looked the same, though checking out one's own ass is a little difficult.  Small but round, devoid of cellulite or dimples, Madison had an ass that definitely got plenty of attention, when her boobs weren't stealing all the glory.  Cassi might have a butt as nice as this, Madison thought, but I've got the whole package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison entered the shower and began to soap up.  She wondered if her imagination was playing tricks on her, as her body felt a tad softer overall to her fingers.  \"Surely it's just from the beer last night...and from only working out once since I've been here.\"  She sighed.  The first two weeks at Powers had been so busy, there just wasn't much time to hit the gym.  Today was Saturday, though, and she vowed to go workout before getting on with the rest of her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Madison had a scale, she might have discovered that she had actually added four pounds to her frame in the first two weeks of school, going up to 129 on her 5'7 body.  Cassi's eating habits and the social rituals of university were having a bit of an effect.  The new weight wasn't much, mind you.  In fact, she often reached that size during her time of the month, though that wasn't due for another two weeks.  It was also 7 pounds shy of her all time high of 136 pounds, reached during a summer's stay with her grandparents over three years ago.  Granny loved to bake and cook, and Madison had found herself enjoying every bite.  She was restricted to skirts and dresses for a few weeks, as most of her size 6 jeans became uncomfortably snug, and the size fours wouldn't button over her newly rounded form at all.  Upon returning home, she quickly developed the gym habits that served her well through high school, and managed to trim down before anyone became the wiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette finished her shower, did her hair and some basic makeup, then went to workout...</span></div></div>",

Her eyes widened a bit as she watched the dark skinned girl do parallel squats, with some sizable weights on the bar.  Madison did not do squats regularly, and never with more than 60 pounds on the bar...Megan appeared to be doing at least twice that with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the powerful girl's form straightening as she went into the next rep, and was surprised to feel a little envy.  Megan had thick, strong legs and notable muscles on her arms, but her limbs were still attractive and sensual.  Her butt was large but firm, and it was clear that her lower body was stronger than Madison's.  The cutoff tee she had on showed off her well-defined four pack as she lifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan finished her set and the girls greeted each other.  \"Wow, how much do you have on there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"150 pounds.  I can do a little more than this for a single lift, but for my regular sets this is it so far.\"<br>\r\nMadison laughed.  \"I am a weakling compared to that!  You must be serious about this rugby thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I like being strong, and I'm excited about rugby.  I played basketball and was on track in high school, but last year I started hitting the weights more and found that I enjoy being powerful.  I don't want to look like one of those weightlifting models, but I do plan on being the baddest, toughest woman on the pitch.\"  Madison had a confused look on her face.  \"The pitch is the field, honey.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!  Well, I think you're well on your way, Megan!  It's good that you don't want to look like a bodybuilder, because you've got a great look now.\"<br>\r\nMegan gave a shy smile, clearly pleased with the compliment.  \"Ok, enough chatting, let's workout!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started with ab exercises, which Megan blew through with ease.  Madison wasn't having trouble with her regular routine, but saw that Megan was clearly going to do more.  \"Hey girl, I'm gonna do some work with the dumbbells.  Meet you on the treadmill?\"  Megan nodded.<br>\r\nAs Madison went through her curls and flys, she thought to herself.  Could she keep up with Megan on the treadmill?  Madison's competitive streak was coming out, and while she knew she couldn't lift like Megan, she had always been a good runner.  Of course, Megan said she ran track, but she wasn't doing it anymore, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon both girls made their way to the treadmill, and started chatting about yesterday as they got going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Madison, how did it go with that guy last night?  Matt, right?  You two seemed to be hitting it off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison hadn't given much thought to it since waking up.  \"I don't know, he's alright I guess.  Not sure he's my type,\" she said, as she increased the speed a bit.  Megan quickly adjusted to match her speed.  \"Well, give him a chance, right?  He seemed to like you, he's good looking, sounds like it would be worth a date to me.  At least you'll get a nice free meal away from the Calorie Cafe here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're right.  Still, I don't want to get tied down or anything right now, this is university!  So many people to meet and so many things to do.\"  Madison also didn't like how last night ended, and thought Matt might be a little too nerdy for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 15 minutes into their jog, Madison realized she'd made a serious error.  Pushing herself after a night of drinking and ice cream, and eating nothing this morning, had her stomach in a state of distress.  She was feeling increasingly queasy, but didn't want to give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How're you doing, girl?\" Madison hoped Megan might be getting bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm just fine.  How long do you want to go on this?  I was thinking another thirty minutes or so.\"  Thirty minutes!  Madison didn't know that she could do it, but she didn't want to give up either.  She gave a grim nod and continued on.  Another ten minutes, though, and Madison was clearly flagging.  Megan gave her a concerned look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, Madison?  You're looking green around the gills.  We can stop and take a break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" *pant* *pant*  \"...I'm good.  I can go for another...oh god.\"  Madison slowed the machine to a walk.  \"Sorry, Megan.  I think I overdid it last night.\"  She stepped off the machine and let out a little unladylike belch as her stomach continued to gurgle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok!  You just need to hydrate and get some food into you.  Why don't we...ACK!\" Megan jumped back in surprise as the sweaty Madison proceeded to vomit all over herself.<br>\r\n\"Ewwww!  That's gonna leave a stain, sweetie.\"</span></div></div>",

Madison was thankful for that, but mortified about what happened.  She had ended up staying in the rest of the day once she cleaned up, ordering a pizza, doing some studying and watching a movie on Netflix with Cassi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been her intent to get back in the gym and redouble her efforts, but she was still too embarrassed to call up Megan and ask her to work out again.  Cassi had no interest in going to the gym, and Kelly spent the weekend with her parents, who lived just an hour away.  Madison was a social butterfly, and always encouraged others to accompany her to the gym, both for the company and to compare her flawless figure to that of friends.  Without anyone to go with, it was easy to go to the party on Sunday instead, or the concert on Tuesday.  Yesterday she was on her way to her dorm to get her gym clothes when she came across some guys flying handmade kites, and spent a couple of hours with them, receiving plenty of appreciative glances and words, not to mention a couple of phone numbers.  The workout was forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Thursday after morning classes, and she was about to go tutor at Joyce High for the first time.  However, that was about to hit a snag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, that route is not currently being serviced?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry ma'am, we have several trains out of operation in the system, and under our current budget we had to make some cuts.  The leg of the Orange Route that went to Joyce High is currently out of operation, and we do not know when or if that service will be restored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great, what am I supposed to do now?  Do you know another way to reach the high school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The municipal bus system does have a stop near Joyce High.  It departs from the other side of this station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, the bus route to Joyce would be about an hour each way.  Shit!  Going three times a week, this job was going to take up more time than she'd anticipated.  Madison thought about calling Ms. Green to get one of the other jobs instead, but she doubted those positions would still be available, or that Ms. Green would slide her into another job after flaking out on this one.  Sullenly, she waited for her bus to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting off the bus, Madison discovered that the stop was actually several blocks away from the school, in front of the nearby library.  Between the delay at the station and the added walk, Madison was half an hour late.  Fortunately she had the foresight to call the contact at the high school and let him know.  She entered the tutoring room, where she saw close to a dozen students, two other high school students that appeared to be tutors, and the man she'd called from the bus station, Mr. Jackson.  Mr. Jackson got her started and set her up with two students: Manny, who was learning english as a second language, and Jessica, a plump high school sophomore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison enjoyed working with Manny, as he was a friendly boy, and she had taken two years of Spanish back home and had plenty of opportunities to use it during her frequent trips into Miami.  Jessica was a bit more difficult, as she proved to be a space cadet.  At one point Madison actually got angry and gave her a little lecture about needing to focus on her goals and show some discipline if she wanted to get anything accomplished.  Just looking at Jessica frustrated her...who wears a Hello Kitty shirt that's a size too small when you've got a gut like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time tutoring finished, it was 6 PM.  She was tired, she was hungry, and the bus wasn't even set to arrive for another 25 minutes.  Fortunately, there was a McDonalds right across the street...</span></div></div>",

With a Diet Coke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting a few minutes and grabbing a handful of ketchup packets, Madison sat down for her meal.  She wasn't sure what had gotten into her.  She hadn't had a Big Mac in ages, and never added the fries to an order.  Still, it sounded so good, and surely the walking to and from the bus stop, as well as on campus, would work a lot of it off.  Thus rationalized, Madison grabbed a handful of fries and began munching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison would be a little surprised had she bothered to examine the menu, which showed that she was eating a meal in excess of 900 calories.  What would <i>really</i> surprise our busty brunette is that such meals were becoming rather common since she began attending Powers.  She had eaten four slices of the large pepperoni she'd ordered after the disaster at the gym.  There was the breakfast the next morning, where she'd had two eggs, three slices of bacon and a large serving of hash browns...then took two more slices of bacon at Cassi's insistence when the ever gluttonous roommate had gone back for seconds and hit the wall for once.  A couple evenings ago Cassi had bought a dozen mini cupcakes as a treat while they watched Arrested Development on Netflix and studied...of course, Madison was sure Cassi had eaten most of them, but it had actually been six for each.  Last night was burrito night again, and without Kelly around Madison had eagerly joined in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had finished off the fries and was halfway done with the burger when she received a text message.  Madison pulled out her phone and was shocked at...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was just a few blocks away, maybe she could catch it...she didn't want to wait another 45 minutes for the next bus.  The burger bag was slowing her down a bit, but fortunately she had worn sneakers today rather than her usual heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout halfway there, she slowed for a moment to hitch her pants up, as her full tummy had risen over the belt line.  In her hurry she did this subconsciously, and continued sprinting towards the bus stop.  A moment later the bus passed her and slowed to a halt down the street, in front of her stop.  A lone elderly couple was waiting there, and slowly got up to board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Madison, you can do this!\"  The well-tanned girl was getting rather flushed, a few beats of sweat running down her face and messing her makeup slightly.  \"Wait for me!\" she shouted, and picked up the pace even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the elderly couple took their seats on the bus...</span></div></div>",

Most of the time Madison turned heads for her beauty, but this time she was receiving attention for being a mess, as she panted in her seat, mascara running, wiping the sweat from her brow.  She wiggled in her seat to adjust her jeans again.  As the bus departed, a few people still looking saw the young brunette remove her half-finished burger and take a rather undignified bite out of it, ketchup squirting onto her hands...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few weeks later, Madison had settled into a busy, but happy routine.  When she wasn't going to the high school, Madison would get lunch, usually with Cassi, then study or wander around campus looking for things to do and people to talk with.  That was followed by dinner with the group of friends she'd made, and then whatever social gathering they could find, or back to her dorm to watch movies with Cassi.  Rush week wasn't until January, so as to not waste time with first semester dropouts, but even without the benefit of a sorority the girls were making the rounds and getting to be known on campus, particularly from the male population.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne morning Madison showed up early to her constitutional law class in an expensive blue-gray skirt dress, cut low on the top to show plenty of cleavage.  As the classroom filled, she heard a couple of guys talking nearby.<br>\r\n\"Wow, did you see Madison Kraft?  She's looking hot today, even for her.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's really got the goods on display, huh?  What I'd give to motorboat those babies!\"<br>\r\n\"Hahaha, wow dude.  Gotta admit, though, they're even bigger than I thought.  Either that or bra technology has improved yet again.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure, but you know, bitch is just teasing with those awesome tits.  Hasn't dated or hooked up since she got here, as far as I know.  She's got some hot friends though, maybe they put out?\"<br>\r\n\"No doubt, Kelly and the black girl are stunners, and even little Cassi looks good, but Madison is in her own league as far as I'm concerned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison felt like pummeling them.  What a couple of chauvinistic jerks!  She walked over to where they were sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, awesome tits here!  Just wanted to let you know that they're attached to a person with thoughts, and feelings.  And EARS.  The black girl has a name, by the way, it's Megan, and don't bother because she and the rest of us are way out of your league.  Think about that while you motorboat each others' balls tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bunch of ooohs broke out from the students nearby.  One of the guys rolled his eyes and marched away to his desk, while the other stammered an apology before following.  A few people even applauded.  Madison smiled to herself...she might be vain, but she wouldn't let herself be treated like a piece of meat for the sake of a compliment.  Even if it was nice to know she was in a league of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Kelly, who shared this class with Madison, came up to her.  \"Wow, you sure showed them!  Gloria Steinem, eat your heart out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wouldn't go that far.  I can't control what goes through their dirty little minds, but sometimes I can make them think twice about what comes out of their dirty little mouths.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm proud of you, girl.  Though I can see why they were drooling.  You look gorgeous in that dress.  Got your eye on someone here, or is it trendy to dress up for 9 am classes now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I just...felt like getting all dressed up for a change, you know!  Wow, your nails look amazing!  Did you do them yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison got back to her dorm a little after noon and sat down heavily on the bed.  At least she didn't have to tutor today.  She had a lot on her mind, midterms were coming up, the editor of the student paper wanted her to start a fashion column, she had a lab to finish, she and Kelly needed to make plans for Megan's birthday celebration...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the other issue, too, the one that had been on her mind all morning.  She turned her head to the pairs of jeans that were laying on her bed, the ones she tried on this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jeans that didn't fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that wasn't entirely true.  Granted, the pair of size 4 jeans that used to be a bit snug on her over the summer were barely getting over her ass now.  Those weren't going to fit.  The first pair of size 6s required her to lay down on the bed to button, barely allowing her to sit up afterwards.  The other two buttoned and zipped with a little jiggling and sucking in, but pinched her sides and middle, causing little rolls of flesh to muffin out over the top.  Truth be told, no one would notice with most of the tops she wore.  However, the red marks she'd gotten on her night of drunkenness had become a regular thing during the past week, and she could no longer ignore the feel of her pants pressing into her flab.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison thought about what happened while staying with her grandmother years ago, and was determined not to pile on the pounds like that again.  She would not be the poster girl for the Freshman Fifteen!  It was time to...</span></div></div>",

Madison was used to the lifestyle and diet of her parents, who if they snacked, usually did so on vegetables or fruit, not the chips or cookies that Cassi would bring in. She wondered how her roommate was not putting on any weight. Then, Madison sat there for a second and wondered, \"well...has she gained any weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison went over to her laptop and logged onto Cassi's profile. There were some recently added photos of Cassi from a party that they went to a few days ago. \"Man...drunk eyes, Cassi,\" Madison briefly thought as she was cycling through. Madison didn't think that Cassi looked much different. She also went back to the blonde's high school photos from a year ago. Maybe Cassi butt looked a tad bigger now, but it wasn't growing at an alarming weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Cassi walked in the room and Madison clicked out of the screen. \"Hey Cassi, there was something I wanted to talk to you about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, shoot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I've noticed that I'm losing some definition in my stomach, would it be possible to limit the junk food that you bring in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi was somewhat caught off-guard by this. She thought it was kind of weird for Madison to ask her to limit an action, when Madison could just show more self control. It wasn't her fault if her roommate had gained a bit of weight. Plus, it was well known by this point among their friends, that Madison was pretty vain about her appearance. In Cassi's opinion, Madison was freaking out about a little bloat after a meal. But, she didn't really want this to become a huge issue, so she just cooperated for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...sure, Madison, I guess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I just don't want to be that token girl who comes to school hot and then leaves a blimp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi looked at Madison, and wondered how this girl would think that about herself, Cassi would bet all her possessions that someone like Madison, whose appearance was such an integral part of her personality and aurora, would never let herself go.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison, I highly doubt that will ever happen to you. You have good genes, look at your parents, they are both thin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was true, but Madison also knew how hard they worked to keep their healthy lifestyle going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well if you could just help me out with this one thing, I would really appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few days it worked, but somewhat quickly Cassi just disregarded it, because she liked these foods, and it didn't seem like her problem. Madison for her part wasn't doing another thing that could have helped--she hadn't been to the gym in a while. It just came down to her having no time at the moment between school, the job, her social life, but she was a driven person, and had a knack for keeping herself busy. <br>\r\n--<br>\r\nOne afternoon, Madison went into Joyce and noticed that</span></div></div>",

Her soft flesh had begun to push out on the fabric, stretching it to the point where it almost hurt to wear them. She had recently bought these size 8's, but maybe it was time to size up again. She figured that she must have shrunken them in the wash, but she had never had that problem before. She also noticed that the waist was very tight. The had barely buttoned them and she could only zip up the fly half the way. This was very uncomfortable, especially when she sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore her second shift of tutoring sessions, Madison opened up the snack she had packed. Over the past few weeks she had been packing snacks from the food Cassie had in her cupboards. Despite her efforts to make cassies food selection healthier, Cassie continued to stock up on junk food. Today she unpacked a small can of Pringles, yo plait, a package of pop tarts, and a Twinkie. She greedily stuffed herself with the food, ignoring the amount of calories and trans fat she was consuming. Recently she had noticed that her appetite had increased, causing her to eat more food to feel full and to eat more often. However, she trusted her metabolism to take care of it and ignored any worries. Right before her session started, Madison got a coke from the vending machine. She usually got diet coke, but today they were out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she finished tutoring, she left Joyce and went directly to the mcdonalds. McDonald's had become a habit for Madison, eating there everyday after school. Today she ordered a Big Mac, a ten piece nugget, a large fry, and a large coke. This meal was usually the best part of her day. She walked down to the bus stop, munching on fries on her way. She got on the bus and started her meal. She breezed through her meal, washing it down with a big gulp of her coke. When she finished, eat pants felt really tight, so she unbuttoned her top button on her pants to relieve the pain. She then noticed that her seat seemed a little small. Her butt sagged over the edge a little bit on each side. \"That's weird\" she thought as she adjusted her panties, which had scrunched up a little. She then got off at her stop and walked to her dorm, stopping at the store for a Milky Way bar for dessert.</span></div></div>",

Over the past few weeks this had become her routine, which was taking a toll on her body. She had easily gained 25 pounds, which had spread out over her now plump body. She had developed a soft belly, with love handles poking out on the sides. She could now stick her finger in her belly button, which was now a small crater on her plump belly. Her belly poked out from her tank top, struggling for extra room. She now had full d cups, which were threatening to pop out from her strained shirt. Her arms had collected some fat as well, losing their tone completely. Her lower half received a good chunk of her extra mass aswell. Her thighs had grown significantly, rubbing at the tops when she walked. Her legs now jiggled when she walked, and had some cellulite on the back of her thighs. Her butt had grown a lot. It poked out a few inches more, and had lost all of its definition. It jiggled a lot when she walked, bouncing up and down. Her pantie constantly got stuck in her crack, always giving her wedgies. When she sat down, her belly cut over her waistband, sitting on top of her thighs, which now looked looked like bags of pancake mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Cassie came home she saw her plump friend passed out on the couch. She saw her belly riding out and reminded herself to keep on her diet. She noticed a little bit of a double chin forming on we formerly ripped friend.

I would recommend starting to exercise and having a healthier diet. Try to avoid eating fast food.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay I'll do my best\" said Madison. The doctor left and Madison put her clothes on.

Cassie was surprised about how chubby her roommate had become. Madison seemed to care less about her appearance now. Her hair looked unkempt and she almost always wore sweatpants.

She wanted to see if her actions could push Madison further into the depths of gluttony. And so she hatched a plan. All she needed was some more spending money from her family, and it'd be no sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison lumbered out of bed and opened the fridge, blearily rubbing her eyes as light poured from the opening. Her eyes widened in shock. It was filled with various deserts, sodas, beer, junk food, and some leftover pizzas. If Madison had been paying attention, she might have been suspicious of the fact that 8 uneaten pizzas were sitting in her fridge, but she payed no mind as she started gorging herself on the various confections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie watched in awe from the couch. She had fallen asleep a while ago, thinking Madison's midnight feast must have been a one time thing, but Madison's ferocious eating quickly woke her. She watched in awe as Madison alternately chugged soda and beer or stuffed pizza and snack cakes into her maw. She looked nothing like the girl who had arrived on campus a few months earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of watching, Cassie got tired of watching and snuck back into her bedroom. When she made her way out her room, she was shocked to see Madison passed out on the floor, fridge open with fragments of food everywhere. \"She's so gluttonous that she eats until she passes out,\" murmured Cassie in shock, before she proceeded to dedicate her morning to cleaning the kitchen and restocking the fridge.</span></div></div>",

While Madison was eating more and more food, Cassi was also enjoying a slice of pizza for a snack, or having three or four non-diet sodas throughout the day. Since Madison was eating so much of the food, Cassi could not visualize the dent she was making in the food, either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a week, Cassi noticed that she had a bit of a stomach bulge, nothing too alarming, but a stomach that was softer than what she was used to. ''Hmm,'' the blonde thought, ''maybe it's just from last night. My jeans are not much tighter, so I'll just have to watch myself, I don't want to turn into a cow like Madison.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Madison, she had to be up to 180 pounds, and her weight continued to go into her stomach, a problem area for her, butt and the start of a double chin. Cassi could not believe that this was the same hot girl from the start of the year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison also seemed to be slipping socially, guys never asked Cassi about Madison anymore, and Madison seemed to be talking about less attractive guys when conversation went that direction between her and Cassi. Cassi even wondered if Madison would get into a sorority if she kept gaining weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, while grabbing some food for Madison, Cassi looked down in her bag, and realized that she didn't have anything healthy, just junk that she was going to 'leave' for Madison. ''Hmm, maybe I should get some healthy stuff more myself,'' Cassi thought. She then reconsidered, ''Madison may eat it instead, I'll just stick to this.'' Little did Cassi know how much of it she would end up consuming. </span></div></div>",

Madison was eating, and she'd eat too.  In a few weeks, she found that her fat jeans weren't fitting anymore, but she blamed her period, water weight, salty food, so on and so forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went by, she became less concerned about Madison's weight and simply bought things that she liked.  As a result, she ate more.  She justified it by saying that it was for Madison, but she had begun eating a greater and greater share of the food she was keeping around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs winter arrived on campus, the two roommates had become a pair of sweater stuffers.  Madison  was up to 185 with bloated DD boobs, a round belly., and fat ass   Cassi had piled up her own freshman 15, bringing her to 145 pounds, but at 5'5\", her weight was starting to become as noticeable as her roommate's, as she sported her own chubby cheeks and DDs now.  As it was winter, no one knew how much belly she was hiding beneath her bulky clothes, and she caughtt a lot of attention as her bust  strained her Powers sweatshirt.</span></div></div>",

She always faced them when she did it, knowing that after a touch from her bosom, their slack-jawed faces would follow her to her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was frequently flirtatious, making sure to provide an eyeful of cleavage whenever she could during a conversation, and taking on a somewhat ditzy persona in the presence of boys she thought were cute.  She was the center of attention, and her star seemed to be rising every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi was reveling in the situation.  She realized that she was putting on weight, but it was like she had calorie magnets on her chest.  So she had the best of all worlds.  She was hot, she could eat anything she wanted, and doing so only made her hotter.  So she stopped pretending that her snack food was for Madison, she chose whatever she wanted in the cafeteria line, and never thought twice about getting late night food after a party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver winter break, her parents couldn't help but notice the change in Cassi, both physically and in her behavior.  Their little girl was both literally and figuratively growing up.  She used some of her newfound knowledge of cooking to bring new dishes to the holiday table, all the while enjoying her old favorites like mashed potatoes and Christmas cookies.  She added another five pounds over the break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison, on the other hand, had started to drop weight almost as soon as Cassi had consciously started to gain.  She forced herself to get back to the gym, control her cravings, and had managed to get back into the 170s before heading home to Miami for a month.  Her parents were surprised but supportive of her efforts to get back into shape.  In the end, they only wanted their daughter to be happy, but they recognized that she was embarrassed by what had transpired during her first semester and were glad to help her.  Between a return to her more usual diet and an improving tolerance for exercise, she melted another ten pounds away during the break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 5'7\" and 160, Madison was hardly thin, but she was proud of her progress when she returned to campus.  She had lost 4 inches off of her waist, and 2 inches off her hips dropping her down to a size 10.  While she was still a 36DD, she was no longer bulging around the straps and cups.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 5'5\" and 150, Cassi was no longer thin either, but she was equally as proud of her progress.  She had outgrown the local Victoria's Secret, who only carried sizes up to a DD.  She had special ordered a few 34FF cup brassieres, but had no doubt that these wouldn't last long.  She had gone up to a size 6 in jeans, but this was just the price of doing business, she thought.  Besides, she was happy with the way her butt looked in them, and Marilyn Monroe was a size 6, right?  Either way, you couldn't make an omelette without breaking some eggs, and Cassi was trying to make the biggest omelets around.  She complemented her look with trips to the tanning bed and had a summer tan in the midst of a Midwest winter, and this gave her plump face a glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Cassi wasn't being honest about was how poorly those size 6's were starting to fit.  While her butt looked shapely wedged into them, her belly and muffin top were slowly creeping outward, and without the benefit of a sweater were on full display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\"  Cassi said when she reunited with Madison in their room. \"Look at you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was dressed in a grey sweater dress with black leggings and boots, and the ensemble gave her a svelte appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, look at you!\"  Madison replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi was dressed in a fuzzy pink sweater with a deep V-neck that showed the browned domes of her breasts and extensive cleavage.  Her sweater hit just below the waist, and her skin-tight jeans were visible below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look great!\"  They said simultaneously before giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get caught up over some lunch.\"  Cassi suggested.  \"I'm starving!\"</span></div></div>",

They went from there to lunch at McDonald's, where Cassi got a large Big Mac meal, and Madison suggested a shake at the end, which Cassi gladly sucked down.  A trip to the grocery store was next, where the girls loaded up a cart with snack cakes, ice cream, candy, chips, and soda.

When they got back to the dorm, Madison ordered and paid for a large pizza before \"passing out\".  With one eye open, she watched as Cassi snacked on chips before eating half of the pizza.

Her body also showed for it. Madison guessed that Cassi had gained another 10 pounds to get up to 168, and she looked it. Cassi's belly was no giving her huge breasts a run for their money, and her butt was growing constantly larger. A few weeks ago Madison thought there was no way that Cassi could continue to fit into the bras she was wearing, yet, two weeks later it was still possible, although she flowed even further out of them. Cassi also had a back fat problem that she seemed oblivious to, even though her bras were tight enough that they were leaving marks on her fleshy back when Madison saw Cassi take them off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison on the other hand, had worked out hard, and was now down to 138 pounds, within eight of where she started. She wondered if she had eaten less with Cassi, if she would have already been there, however, after putting up with Cassi for so long it seemed worth it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey each began packing for their spring break trip, and Madison starred at a bikini from her senior year of high school, before she gained all the weight of the previous year. \"I think I am going to try to wear this,\" she said to Cassi, \"as a treat for working so hard this spring.\" Madison thought that it was fitting that while she talked to Cassi, Cassi's stomach peeked out from under her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think that you can still fit into that?\" Cassi asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...yes, I do, it may be a bit tight, but it fit when I started to gain a bit of weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Cassi responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll try it on then.\" Madison said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison went into the bedroom and stripped down to try it on. She first put the bikini bottoms on her rear, and to her surprise, they fit decently well. Sure, her but looked a bit larger than she wanted it to, and she had some love handles, one of the remnants of her previous gain, but she was pleased. Then, she put her top on, which fit even better. Madison looked at herself in the mirror, despite a lack of body tone, she thought this would still work pretty well on guys at the beach. She confidently walked into the room where Cassi was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I guess I was wrong,\" Cassi said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison suddenly wondered if Cassi had bought a bikini in the past two weeks, of if she thought she could still fit into her special order one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, now let's see if your bikini fits, Cassi\" Madison dared. </span></div></div>",

Heck, Madison suspected some of the men LIKED the blonde's blubbery figure, judging by the way the bought her sweet treats and were more than happy to take her out for dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi, meanwhile, was enjoying herself thoroughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe played her part, giving her many suitors just enough visual stimulation and physical contact to keep them wanting more. She had mastered the art of the tease - the subtle lean forward that emphasized her cleavage, the casual press of her chest against his arm, the nonchalant stretch that heaved her bosom forth even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazingly, the bodacious blonde's boob-greed was turning into outright gluttony, and she found sneakily sexy ways to coax her suitors into feeding her growing breasts even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had enough, Cassi?\" asked Cory, one of Cassi's faceless admirers who was on a third date with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi was living the good life, and was tipping the scales at 198 pounds and sporting gargantuan LL-cup breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCory looked over at his overflowing date, polishing the melted ice cream sitting in the bottom of her large bowl that once held a super-sundae deluxe. As she scooped up the last bits desperately, her gigantic chest wobbled, testing the straps of her too-small J-cup bra as her cleavage heaved out of her top's struggling neckline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so. Well, I could really go for another, but you already bought me like three of these\" she said innocently, pushing the emptied bowl aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCory was relieved. Those things weren't cheap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and besides, I really shouldn't. I mean, if I keep going at this rate, I'll be an N-cup by the time summer starts\" she said, casually stretching her chubby arms up and making her top's neckline groan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCory's eyes went wide.

At 220 pounds, she was certainly thick all over, especially up front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it just wasn't worth it anymore. He hadn't gotten any action since he began going out with Cassi a couple of months ago. How up-tight was this girl? He was spending crazy amounts on their dates regularly, what did a guy have to do to gain access to those tits?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday he was going to call it off. He steeled himself, his expression changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassi, I--\" he began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Cassi was quick. She knew this moment was coming, and she nipped it in the bud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmygosh Cory, did I tell you?\" she interrupted, licking her fingers clean of the pastry she had just consumed, purposefully straightening her back so her gargantuan chest thrust out and strained her buttons further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCory saw the gaps between the buttons widen, bare boob-flesh bulging through. Whatever bra she had on underneath was too small, as he saw the massive cups overflowing with even more massive tittage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got this new bikini at Curvy Kat and...\" she said, a cheeky smile beginning to cross her face. \"...they said it was an N-cup, but I swear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Cory's surprise, she began to undo the buttons of her top. It didn't take much more than a prod for each of those buttons to bust off in relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCory had seen Cassi's boobs in tight tops and low necklines before, but never like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi's now truly colossal P-cup boobs, crammed into 'too-small' N-cups, tumbled out before him, nearly smacking heavily onto the table itself if she didn't have her back arched like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...do these look like N-cups to you? They're tiny!\" she pouted in false disappointment, inwardly grinning at the expression on Cory's face. He wasn't going to be leaving her anytime soon.</span></div></div>",

She also figured that if she pushed her harder, she could get Cassi to be so fat that not only would her bikini no longer fit but that none of her clothes would fit anymore.  She thought that this would be a better comeuppance for her breast-obsessed roommate.  While she had some reservations about this plan, she decided that the best way to do this was to eat with her, that way she never had to make an excuse for why she had ordered more food at a restaurant or bought extra junk at the store.  She could ensure that Cassi wasn't just full, but was completely and totally stuffed at all times.  Madison further reasoned that she had already proven that she could lose the weight once, and had no doubt that she could do it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor two weeks, Madison pushed Cassi to the upper limits of her gluttony and boobie-greed.  Madison was astonished at how much Cassi could put away, day after day.  Madison invited her to eat from the time she got up until the time that she went to sleep, and Cassi accepted it every time.  Madison had even started waking up in the middle of the night and making enough noise to wake Cassi up, at which point she'd offer a snack or to order delivery.  Cassi never declined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi only became more insufferable during this time, advising Madison that she might want to slow down a bit, because her body didn't distribute weight the same way that hers did, and that she had done so well that it would be a shame to get fat again.  Madison always smiled sweetly and thanked Cassi for the advice.  Cassi's self-absorption quickly led her to forget that Madison was continuing to eat in spite of her warnings.</span></div></div>",

Cassi had added more than a pound per day in the past two weeks, and now tipped the scales at 184 pounds.  Madison had no idea how much Cassi weighed, but she could almost see her getting fatter every day.  Her boobs were still getting bigger, sure, and there was no way her bikini would fit, but the girl was positively bloated now.  She wore sweats at all times now, and Madison surmised that it was because she had gotten too tubby to wear any of her other pants.  Unlike the rest of the world, Madison was able to see her transformation in underwear, and it was striking.  She was wearing 34J cup bras, but she didn't ever unclasp them, choosing instead to slide them on and off.  Once on, the straps embedded themselves into her soft torso while her precious tits bulged around the cups in all directions.  Her belly button was just a black hole of unknown depth, surrounded by a thick layer of soft pudge that overhung the waist of her panties.  Her lower body wasn't all that big, but her butt was still too big for her existing undies, giving her butt cleavage as well as an underhang that led down to her thick, smooth thighs and calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison had packed eight pounds back onto her own belly and butt, but compared to Cassi, she felt thin.</span></div></div>",

Great idea.\"  Cassi replied.  \"Let's do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n36 sliders and six orders of fries were eaten, mostly by Cassi as Madison's belly had no extra room at this point.  She thought that she might throw up with another chip or fry or donut or anything, no matter how small.  She could hardly move at this point and when they made it back to the dorm, she immediately removed her jeans and lay on her side to relieve some of the pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do need to try on that bikini.\"  Cassi remarked.  \"Come on Maddy, let's put 'em on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to move right now.\"  Madison groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not surprised.\"  Cassi said.  \"I've never seen you eat so much, even when you were a big fat heifer a couple of months ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As opposed to you now?\" Addison thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm worried.\"  Cassi said as she started to strip down.  \"My boobs have just kept on growing, and I think it's a long shot that I'll be able to stuff myself into that bikini.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison watched as Cassi undressed.  She had looked fat for a while, but after gorging for six or seven consecutive hours, Madison thought that she looked pregnant, as her belly was rounder and more taut than she had ever seen it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bikini bottoms fit as poorly as Cassi's underwear had and the top didn't have a chance.  Cassi was probably underestimating her chest size by at least two inches, and she needed perhaps three more cup sizes.  Madison lay awestruck as Cassi struggled in vain to secure herself in the overwhelmed garment. She realized that she had never taken such a long look at Cassi's boobs outside of the confines of clothing.  Each one was the size of a basketball and, from what she could tell by watching Cassi's efforts, possessed a remarkably firm texture.  It was no wonder Cassi was obsessed with them - they were hypnotic they were so big, round, and perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Cassi called it quits.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well.\"  She said.  \"This sucks, but I'll never be the girl who complains about clothes not fitting because her boobs are too big.\"</span></div></div>",

So what if her hips and belly were expanding as well \u2013 if she didn\u2019t care, why should he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day he again offered to treat her to her choice. This time she selected burgers \u2013 but specifically a mushroom and Swiss burger, to which John offered to add fries and shake as an addition. She accepted and began to feels spoiled.  They chatted amiably and both realized they were forming a bond. Before they went their separate ways Cassi invited John over later in the week for a dinner of her personally prepared burrito supremes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about you roommate, Madison \u2013 er what\u2019s her name?\u201d was his initial answer, \u201cWon\u2019t she feel left out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, its Madison Kraft,\u201d  Cassi replied, suddenly realizing that three could be a crowd. \u201cYou\u2019re right. She\u2019s not going with anyone special right now. Maybe you could bring someone along?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm \u2013 yeah, Hey, I know a guy named Ed who mentioned he wished he knew her. Maybe that would work,\u201d John answered.  What Ed had really remarked was about the size of Madison\u2019s growing butt being comparable to Cassi\u2019s boobs, but John figured that was close enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd of course grabbed at the opportunity to have a free supper and get to know Madison at the same time. She was flattered by word from Cassi that he had wanted to get to know her, even though it was a tad inaccurate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls had been sharing burritos weekly for several months. Cassi had learned from Madison\u2019s culinary training that real beef burritos didn\u2019t use ground beef like the fast food joints. Instead they used bavette, or flank steak, cuts especially designed for such purposes. After grilling the bavettes they needed to be rolled into a tortilla with other ingredients. In this case she chose salsa, jalepeno and lime marinade, salsa and pinto beans. Bavette burritos are 700 plus calorie bombs but she wasn't counting - the point was that they would taste delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi made eight bavette style burritos, two for each of the guests. Both John and Ed were surprised at the ease with which the two roommates demolished their two \u2013 the guys struggled a bit with theirs. But they were impressed by the quality and readily accepted Madison\u2019s offer to have them over for one of her dishes a week later. After an evening hour of board games Madison broke out the chocolate chip ice cream for dessert. Total calorie consumption for the night exceeded 2000 per person, but no one was counting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the evening John and Ed compared notes about the ballooning beauties.  To each other\u2019s surprise neither minded the girl\u2019s growing girth.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

John had firmly cemented his status as a 'breast man' when they were in bed together, he was unable to keep his hands off of Cassi's humongous tits, squeezing and burying his face in them whenever he could. He had never been with such a big girl before, but he loved every inch of Cassi's growing body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi threw back the bed covers, exposing her chubby, naked body, and ran a hand over her bulging belly. \"Mmmm...I wish I could stay naked all the time,\" she moaned, smiling at an obviously aroused John. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish you could too,\" John grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it was legal, I totally would,\" Cassi giggled. \"I'm outgrowing clothes so quickly lately, it would save me a fortune in bras.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I love seeing you outgrow those bras,\" John smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you do, and I love it,\" Cassi smiled and ran a hand through her long blonde hair, then turned and rose from the bed. \"Just going to the bathroom, don't go anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn smiled as he watched her go, her huge booty jiggling as she went, her tits swaying majestically. The thought of a constantly naked, ever growing girlfriend turned John on more than anything, and he couldn't wait for her to come back to bed so he could squeeze that huge, sexy belly. Cassi's weight had shot up since they started dating, but she wasn't the only one gaining; John was starting to pick up her eating habits, and had actually managed to pack on ten pounds himself. It wasn't too noticeable, but when the year started he had possessed a firm set of washboard abs from hours and hours in the gym. As he had eased off his routine to spend more time with Cassi, he had found his stomach started to grow along with hers. His abs had disappeared, replaced by a layer of flab that had grown into a miniature beer belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't mind it, truth be told, it wasn't that noticeable, though he had gone up a pants size. Cassi didn't seem to even notice it. He was only five pounds away from the freshman fifteen though, and was hoping he wouldn't surpass it. He pushed his stomach out and ran his hands over it's bulging, smooth surface, just as Cassi walked back into the room and climbed back into bed. He wrapped his arms around her, and buried his head in her breasts once again. As he did, he felt Cassi's hands running over his soft belly...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although she had not said anything, Cassi had, in fact, noticed John's growing stomach, and she really liked it. Her own growing body always turned her on, and now she was finding that she enjoyed watching her boyfriend grow too. It was easy to see how it happened; he had been enjoying Cassi's jumbo sized portions whenever they ate, and spending more and more time just lying in bed with her. Since she started going out with John, Cassi had found herself eating more as well, and her weight had pushed past the two hundred pound mark just last week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night, Cassi had John round for their usual evening dinner. He showed up wearing a pair of tight jeans and a button up shirt that drew attention to his recent weight gains, and she saw him suck his belly in as he entered the room. Cassi had prepared a huge feast that totally covered the table, and was pushing most of it towards John as they ate, hoping he would out-eat her for a change. John didn't need much encouragement, and ate everything Cassi was secretly pushing towards him. Cassi had eaten quite a bit too, but had been so focused on trying to get John all cute and bloated that it was a relatively light meal by her standards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRRRRRP!\" John belched as he reclined in his chair, completely stuffed from his huge meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made their way to the couch and sat down, John's bloated belly pushing up against the strained buttons of his shirt. Cassi leaned over and ran her hands over his bulging stomach and smiled to herself. \"You look stuffed...\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...really overdid it...\" John grunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi pulled John's shirt up, leaving him looking rather surprised. She poked his bloated, food filled belly and giggled. \"You look so full...those pants are really tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're fine,\" John lied, blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi reached down and unbuttoned his pants, and he let out a sigh of relief as his stomach bulged free. \"Better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...much...\" John admitted. \"I weighed myself yesterday and it looks like I gained the freshman fifteen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he spoke, Cassi was gradually undoing the buttons of his shirt. \"I think it looks good on you,\" she said, undoing the last button and pulling his shirt apart to expose his flabbier chest and ball shaped belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" John asked, surprised. \"I don't know. I was thinking of hitting the gym...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi massaged his full belly, ignoring his talk of the gym. John seemed to be enjoying the feeling, because he fell silent and let her carry on. \"Hey, the freshman fifteen worked out okay for me, didn't it?\" She grinned, pulling up her top and revealing her own bulging gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely,\" John nodded, gently stroking her huge, fleshy middle. He lifted her top up over her head, revealing her magnificent boobs, which were actually sitting perfectly in her latest bra, which she had purchased only last week. She often ended up overflowing them or simply busting out of them after a big meal, but the large, red cups she was wearing now contained her massive tits perfectly, pushing them together into an incredibly display of cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think I'm getting too big?\" Cassi asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, you're absolutely perfect,\" John said, groping the underside of her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi smiled at the compliment and slowly settled onto John's lap, pushing her huge stomach up against his little belly and filling his face with her mighty cleavage. She was happy to hear John use the word 'perfect' as she had been thinking about trying to stop gaining lately and stay at this weight. Two hundred pounds was her ideal weight, and she felt happy with her size as it was. </span></div></div>",

He groaned as she put the bite in his mouth while rubbing his very dissented stomach. She had bought a tray of lasagna for them to split (but with most of it going to John), and he had officially finished the last of it. He made his way over to the couch and laid on his back, his ball of a stomach sticking straight in the air,  taut with the lasagna. And it wasn't the first time in the past month he had been in this state. When Cassie decided to take a break from her weight gain, she redirected all that food she normally would have eaten to John, and it showed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie had maintained her weight because all of the excess calories sent John's weight up a lot in a short period of time. He had already put on 15 pounds before Cassie started this brigade, and in the one month since she had brought him up another 25 pounds. His stomach had taken the brunt of the weight, once looking like a small beer belly and now looked like an over inflated basketball. His butt had also inflated some (from spending so much of his time now sitting on it), and his overall physique had gotten softer. John's breathing was labored now from consuming so much food, so Cassie made her way to the couch and started rubbing his stomach more to release the tension. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ate wayyy too much this time,\" John told Cassie, looking up at her with a look of slight pain but also arousal. She laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say that every time, and every time we manage to get more in you,\" she replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but I'm new at this! I didn't think I would gain weight this quickly, I have to go shopping again this weekend because I've already outgrown my new shirts.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you look great! I don't see the problem with it,\" Cassie told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's that I feel like you're trying to make me more like you...\" John cut himself off before saying something that might offend Cassie, but it was a bit too late for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean, 'make me more like you?' I thought you liked this?!\" Cassie exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not saying I don't like this, all the food and whatnot, but I feel like you're trying to fatten me up so I look more like you, I guess... I don't really know anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe I want a man with a little more meat, maybe it would be nice for you to be more physically on par with me, but we're doing this because you said you were okay with it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I am, but maybe we could balance our system a little bit. Maybe instead of stuffing me like a turkey we can ease into the gain more, slow it down some. And, I don't know, maybe you can start eating a little more again? If there's going to be more of me for you to grab, then there should be more of you for me to grab too.\"</span></div></div>",

She stocked the room with as much junk food as possible, making sure Madison was always munching on something. Madison spent most of her days lazing around in her sweatpants, eating snacks and doing homework. This sedentary lifestyle caused Madison quickly gain weight. Over time her appetite increased to the point where she was almost always hungry. At the beginning of the year, Madison hated the food in the cafeteria. Now, she couldn't get enough of it. Every meal she filled her tray, habitually going up for seconds and thirds. Monday was burger day. Wednesday was burrito night. The cafeteria had become Madison's favorite place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, all of this eating was causing Madison to really pack on the pounds. At 183 pounds, Madison was officially fat. Her belly formed multiple jelly rolls when she say down, which were clearly visible through her shrinking shirts. She could barely button her size 12 pants, giving her an obvious muffin top. Madison's double chin had finally come in, an obvious sign of her growing weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie walked on the door late one night after coming back from a party. This night she found Madison passed out on the couch with an empty box of Oreos by her side, along with a can of whipped cream and an empty carton of ice cream. Melted ice cream covered her chest, along with Oreo crumbs. Only in her bra and panties, Madison looked fatter than ever. Her boobs spilled out of her bra, and her panties struggled to contain her massive ass. The whipped cream can sat on her globular belly, empty from a night of gorging. Cassie smirked at her plump friend. To think that she was once thin. Madison then subconsciously scratched her belly then continued to roll over and scratch her butt.

She could barely breathe. Her whole body was sore, not used to exercising with the extra weight she had attained over the months. As soon as she got to her room, she went directly to bed to recover. After napping for about an hour, Madison's hunger awoke her. \"Maybe I deserve a little something to eat in reward for working out\" Madison thought to herself. She picked up the phone and ordered a large pepperoni pizza, bread sticks, and a 2-liter of Coca-Cola. When the pizza came, Madison immediately tore into the pizza, eating it straight out the box. Before she knew it, she had eaten the entire pizza, along with the bread sticks. She took a swig out of the 2-liter and laid down on her bed. She slipped off her sweatpants and t-shirt, allowing her belly to relax. Her \"reward meal\" was in excess of 3,000 calories. These massive binges were fairly regular for Madison. She now ate whenever she was stressed. Madison now was on the cusp of being considered obese. Her belly was a real problem, forming three big rolls whenever she sat down. Her chunky thunder thighs touched completely, jiggling whenever she walked. Her boobs had lost their perkiness, although they were now massive. Guys that would be scared to talk to Madison in the beginning of the year now didn't have much interest in her at all. Madison never wore jeans anymore, exclusively wearing sweatpants. Her sweatpants from the beginning of the year barely fit, and even her biggest t-shirts were too small, barely covering her belly. Madison was a lost cause.  </span></div></div>",

She continued to lay waste to the cafeteria food and indulge in late night snacks which put a toll on her wardrobe. Madison hadn't realized until now, but all the money she got from tutoring was being sunk into new clothes and the occasional food binge. And while she was able to ignore her gain for the most part, she was now broke and in need of new clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what to do Cassie!\" fretted Madison. \"This tutoring job doesn't pay anything and these damn pants don't fit me anymore!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, Cassie stood in awe as her 196 pound roommate was literally pouring out of her clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we'll have to find you a new job!\"  said Cassie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easier said than done.

Meanwhile Madison took it upon herself to stuff herself silly as the stress of classes and no money were building fast. By her sixth set, she had gained 10 pounds putting her at 205 pounds. She was posing in the only sweats that still fit her. She looked like a stuffed sausage as the sweatpants strained to contain her hips, thighs, and ass. Her tiny belly rolls rested on top of her thighs. She was looking especially fat in her clothes that day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the weekend, Madison had found a surprise in her email. Her followers more than tripled and she had made a whole 50 dollars overnight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy moley!\" said Madison. \"It really works! But what changed?

She was afraid to check her weight on a scale, but all her messages pointed to yes. She had to investigate the fetish sites provided by an anonymous poster. There was a huge network of people who were into weight gain. It didn't take much searching to find a topic on her. At first, she was disgusted, but as she looked at her clothes and the money in her account, she began to embrace what could be a good opportunity to get that money that she so desperately needed. </span></div></div>",

When she started school she was 75 pounds lighter. Madison never really paid attention to how much food she had consumed over the course of the school year. But what is 5 or 10 pounds more if it means she can make enough money to pay off her debts and get some more clothes that fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie meanwhile was as smitten as can be. Madison by far the fatter of the two and this modeling plan should take care of that. She helped Madison with her advertising efforts by communicating with fans via pro-fat forums. Cassie never mentioned how much Madison planned to gain, but that she was indeed gaining. Each set after that began to see more new users. And each new set saw Madison putting on more weight. It wasn't hard for Madison since she was passively putting on weight. The 10 pounds she promised to herself came quickly. So did a new set of size 16 clothing. She had to skip 14 since all her new weight was accumulating on her lower half. At 215, she had a prominent booty and thick thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly got the interest of the boys at school, however, it was not the right kind of interest. Chuckles, laughs, and talking behind her back. Madison was a sight alright. She wish she could be that smoking 130 pound girl from the beginning of the school year, but here she was. Hips touching the ends of chairs, ass that knocked objects off tables and desks, thighs that touch down to the knees. And yet, through all of this...she was still short on money. Madison may be in dire need for money, but she is not good at balancing her budget and she overspent on a new wardrobe with a credit card bill due soon. With the promise of ever increasing money from followers to pay her increasing debts, Madison was forced to keep modeling. </span></div></div>",

Plus she really needed the cash. Why stop now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't hard to convince Madison to put on weight as she was clearly enjoying herself in the moment. While she certainly didn't like to see the scale go up, she was really getting into it in the moment. Who can blame her? She went for seconds and even thirds for meals. She's pig out on ice cream and cookies. She drank soda and ate candy bars as she pleased. She was indulging in gluttonous behavior. It didn't help that Cassie was encouraging the whole thing. Not only was Cassie happy to see just a few more pounds on her chubby roommate, but it meant more money for her. Cassie had cut a deal with Madison to receive part of the proceeds since she helped with the photography and web stuff. The bigger Madison got, the more followers bought her photo sets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison heeded less restraint over the course of many weeks as she began to take a liking to her new formed habits. While 225 pounds was her max, she didn't check the scale. It wasn't until she ripped her pants getting out of the booth at the cafeteria that she even considered that she had put on that much weight. Embarrassed, Madison scurried away back to her dorm room as her thighs rubbed and ass jiggled. Even there she found solace in food. But Madison knew she overdid it. She had made enough money to be somewhat happy with what she had and end her modeling career right there, but it had been very clear in that moment that she had outgrown her size 16 clothing. That was not a part of the plan as she had just paid off her \"new\" clothes. She tried on her jeans, bras, and shirts. Everything was way too small. Only the elastic clothing had held resistant until today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woops!\" was the only thing that came out of Madison's mouth as Cassie weighed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"232 pounds! I'd say you went a bit over there.\" said Cassie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison went a bit dizzy. She was well over her max. She was still unconsciously eating a milky way as reality was smacking her in the face. Her panties exposed to the world. Cassie took an opportune time to photograph this beauty in a candid moment. It was the best selling set of all. The forums lit up with excitement and compliments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just enjoying myself...you know thinking I'd turn a blind eye to it and stop when I wanted.\" Madison said to Cassie. \"I took it too far and now look at me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Madison, look what happened! You've...we've made more money on that last set than ever.\" replied Cassie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the point. I'm the ridicule of the school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No your not. You're adored by so many people. Just look at what people say about you on these forums.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison tried to avoid those forums as her initial visit was not a positive one. But upon a second glance, she found a very welcoming and positive community. She even began posting herself. Responding to and absorbing all the compliments she had received by her fans. By nights end, she felt a bit more comfortable with her body. She was easily swayed by the attention of so many men and women that she was very conflicted. Here she was rejected by her peers at school, but she had found so many more people who liked her for who she was and not just her body (she assumed). Plus she really enjoyed herself during the last few weeks. While she admitted her gain stopped here, her fans encouraged her to go further. What was Madison to do?</span></div></div>",

She couldn't climb past 245 pounds. While she wowed her audience over the last few weeks, the constant disappointment from fans thinking that Madison had decided to lose weight or not live up to her promises were starting to drag on sales of her latest sets. While most people would be happy to see their weight stop climbing, Madison was in a situation most people don't ever face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure of what to do, Madison asked Cassie for help. Cassie wasn't about to give pointers and further fatten Madison. She suggested Madison not push it just to satisfy some anonymous fanbase. That answer of course didn't satisfy Madison. She made a promise and she was going to follow through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchool was coming to an end as students wrapped up their finals. Students at Powers were very fortunate to have 6 weeks off, which is quite the break compared to some schools. Fresh off her last final, Madison was thinking about her time off when she froze with fear. At over 240 pounds, how could she go home in front of her parents and friends? Staying at school over winter would cost an extra fee that Madison could not afford. As she rushed back to the dorm (which really resembled more of a power walk), a winded Madison found Cassie packing up to go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*pant* *pant* \"Let me...\" *huff* \"Let me go home with you.\" begged Madison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?

It less resembled a cake and more so resembled a mountain of confections. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry Mrs. Mitchel I didn't mean to...\" replied Madison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing to be sorry about, it was my fault. Why I'm just relieved that it was just you down here getting food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah..uhh...I was a little hungry\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you poor thing! I'm a little ashamed that what I made for you was enough. Sit down sit down. Let's get that cake back on the plate. Here here, take this fork.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Madison could speak up, she was sat down in front of the whole cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Mrs. Mitchel, I'd really only need one slic..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat! Eat!\" interrupted Mrs. Mitchel \"I'm fixing you some chocolate milk\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison dug in chunk by chuck and she downed it with some chocolate milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had I known, I would have made you more food. Welp! Now I know. You won't go to sleep hungry again Madison. What kind of host would I be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison couldn't speak up with the large amounts of cake in her mouth. She wasn't all that opposed to a little more food, but she didn't want to make it seem like she was a pig. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly to Madison, she was able to finish the cake and down the milk. It wasn't without it's consequences. She's never eaten a whole cake in one sitting. Madison had a hard time getting up and back to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...you have such a great appetite! Why don't you take these cookie back with you to bed in case you get hungry later\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison stumbled back to bed and quickly fell asleep...along side some cookie crumbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Plus, it was becoming increasingly challenging to show her face in classes, where despite her continued popularity online, she was becoming a social outcast in class. Girls wondered how anyone could pile on weight that fast. Guys snickered and were happy they never pursued anything with her when she was hot. Even professors arched a confused eyebrow if they ever walked behind her newly fat frame on the way to a class. Madison knew people were talking, and although she got a rush from the videos and response online, she figured she needed to turn things around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, old habits died hard for Madison. Especially after the day of tutoring that she had after deciding that she was giving up the sets online. As Madison got to class, she saw that Jessica was increasingly wearing trendier clothes, that to her amazement, seemed to fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not Madison imagining anything, Jessica had begun to drop even more weight, an additional 10 pounds, bringing her down to just being curvy, as opposed to plump. She had also the confidence proportional to what Madison had lost in public. Madison had shown up wearing a tight sweatsuit, her gain clearly evident below the layers. In addition to her softer face, he butt looked absolutely huge in her sweatpants. As Madison wrote something on the board for both Jessica and Manny, her shirt rode up, exposing love handles that hung over the tight elastic of the last remaining pair of size 16 sweatpants that she owned. Although Madison knew it was time for 18s, as part of making a line in the sand over her weight, she vowed not to grow out of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class, Jessica tried to extract another measure of meanness onto Madison. As she handed her some written homework, she pretended to be sympathetic, when in reality, she knew she was twisting a knife to Madison's phyisue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison, I'm so sorry about the weight? Have you tried any kind of gluten free things?\" Jessica asked, faux-politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica, there is no correlation between weight and gluten,\" Madison said, somewhat annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, I hope you can find something that works well for you, whatever it is.\" Jessica said, continuing, \"you were just so pretty when you got here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison wanted to tear up a bit, but kept her composure. She thought to herself that she sure could use the confidence boosting responses that had come on the message boards. Worst still, at the end of the week she weighed herself, and she was up to 240 pounds.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tutoring comfortably was no longer an option for Madison. She much wider than the standard student and that meant she was wider than the standard school chair. This led to a lot of shifting around to get comfortable. Madison always felt like she was on the edge of her seat. Turns out she was just pouring out the sides of the seat. To make matters worse, her size 16 sweatpants were digging into her skin to the point where there were visible red lines around her hips. Watching over Jessica's work was a real test of Madison's pants. A test that it failed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was watching Jessica complete her work when she noticed an error. Leaning into correct her mistake was actually Madison's mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>SNAP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a silencing whip of elastic, Madison had snapped the last of her size 16 clothing...right in front of Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Haha..what was that?\" Jessica began to giggle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...it was nothing!\" Madison quickly retorted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you just rip your pants? Oh...my...God...my friends are going to love this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica!\" Madison's mind went completely blank. She couldn't think of anything to say to her. \"I...I need to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison gripped her sweatpants as she walked out of the classroom. She could hear Jessica laughing from down the hallway, but the focus was on herself. She ducked into one of the bathrooms to try and fix the situation. Luckily Madison had a miniature sewing kit with her. She needed it lately as most of her ill fitted clothing had worn out holes in the thigh area. Even these sweatpants went threw a sew or six. The elastic was the only think keeping these pants up, but Madison was desperate. Her only solution was to sew her sweatpants to her shirt creating a sort of makeshift onesie. Besides she had a small coat to cover up the more obvious stitching.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time her work was done, she opted to leave the school and head back to her dorm, in case her patchwork didn't hold up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so done with this job\" Madison said to herself. She had officially quit her tutoring despite the paychecks she so desperately needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison arrived at the bus stop at a rather unusual time. She would normally be here an hour later when she could quickly take a bus home. But that's an hour from now. Madison was stuck at the bus stop for a good hour. She wondered how she could kill the time. And it wasn't long until she found her answer. The smell of french fries were in the air. The golden arches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no I really shouldn't\" Madison muttered to herself. But willpower was not one of Madison's strengths. She admitted some french fries might help her calm down. By the time she sat down, it was 2 big macs, an extra large fry, a 20 piece chicken mcnugget, a milkshake, and a few apple pies for the road. She dug in, unable to help herself to the feast in front of her. She was certainly a sight. Such a pretty woman destroying a tray of food. It certainly drew some eyes and stretched some threads. It didn't take that much food for Madison's clothes to feel tight again. Old patches began to untangle as she unwrapped her second big mac. It was all so good. She couldn't stop herself even if she wanted. With her stomach and ass fighting for room in her clothes, it was no surprise that things started to unravel quickly. Madison's ass, which took the prize by a large margin over her belly, had started to tear through the middle of her sweatpants. Her thighs started reopening old holes and making them bigger as she fidgeted in her booth. She was freaking out, but couldn't take her hands off the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison's mind slipped, and through all of this, she realized the bus was going to come any minute! She jumped out her booth, but as she did, her expansive hips tore her pants down the side. As she quickly turned to check out the damage, her ass knocked over someone else's tray of food at the next table which drew a lot of attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry\" said a panicked Madison to the upset man who was sitting down for lunch. \"I'll pay you back or something...\" Madison couldn't finish her sentence as she had to run out the door to catch her bus. Everyone caught a good glimpse of Madison on her way out. Madison forgot how much of a big girl that she was and running to the bus stop was not as easy as when she was 130 pounds and in shape. Madison managed a slight jog and wheeze followed by deep breathing as she made it to the bus. Madison's lack of athletic ability was the icing on the cake. She was so shocked by all the events, she didn't know what to do. So she shared her story on the forums over a bowl of ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She knew that right now Jessica was telling her snobby friends the same story and they were all having a laugh at Madison's expense, where as the people online wish they could have been there to see it. There was only one thing for Madison to do, she took out the camera and snapped a shot of her ripped clothes and posted them to the forum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess in my eating frenzy, I got a little sauce on my top. I didn't notice it until now.\" *Enter*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I can't wait to see more of you Maddy.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>When is the next vid coming? You must be even hotter than before.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I'd pay money for those clothes!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Madison had given up her tutoring job there was no way she could quite the modeling business. She still didn't want to gain, even though it was happening anyway due to her constant cravings. But she needed the money and it looked like a new revenue source had just opened up. All of her old clothes could be put up for sale, they didn't fit anyways. Madison had held on to them with the wishful thinking that she would one day fit back into them, and she still held that hope, but money now was more important. She would just need to buy new clothes when she slimmed down, at that point it would be more of a victory than a defeat like it was now when she was out growing everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outfit from the night sold pretty quickly but no once seemed to want her other clothes. She was quite baffled until she realized that none of her other clothes had a story behind them. She decided to kill two birds with one stone. She did a new video and set of her trying on her old clothes which where obviously way to small. As the seams popped she scarfed down some McDonald's in hopes of recreating the events from before which got the last outfit sold. Her plan worked and she made a nice check off the set and the clothing sale. Madison had found a nice new way to supplement the money left from tutoring. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison wasn't exactly the sharpest tool in the shed. She happened to see dollar signs in her recent string of sets and auctions. What she didn't really focus on was how much more weight she was piling on through all of this. The more sets she did, the more weight she put on, the faster she put on weight, the greater cost to her for new clothes and food. Even at this pace, Madison would be back to broke in no time. Not that she noticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was getting a little too into the forums. Chatting with folks, receiving compliments, taking suggestions, Madison was starting to get into her role a bit more. While she still despised the weight, she enjoyed the eating and positive feedback that came with it. Because of this Madison was up to a whopping 255 pounds. While Madison was always very pear shaped, the last 25 pounds found their way to her hips thighs and ass. And because of this, she was finding it hard to keep clothes for long...well at least pants anyway. Her hips became so round that they easily surpassed the edges of chairs. Her ass had become so thick, you could see it from the front. If you got a back view, you'd see an ass with a shelf that stuck out farther then her breasts. Her thighs, began to fight for space as they started to touch almost all the way down to the knees. Madison was a sight to see. Thin face, generous breasts, slightly bulbous belly rolls, then a whole different girl all together below that. Students stared at her as she passed. Madison Kraft was certainly a fat chick now. That's what happens when you're wearing size 18 pants that look like they were painted on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of these things concerned Madison, until that is she was eating. Then her worries disappeared. Food had become her freedom. Freedom from reality. Her followers encouraged Madison to do something special for 260 pounds. Once again seeing dollar signs in her eyes, Madison saw this as an opportunity to score some more dough. She offered to do whatever the highest bidder wanted. She didn't realize how bad of a decision that was....</span></div></div>",

On one side, she would be doing an embarrassing act in front of her peers, on the other was $200 waiting for her to help pay her overdue credit card. Now tipping the scales at 262 pounds, Madison's clothes were really at the tipping point. It was hard to turn down the money considering that she would need more for a new wardrobe. If Madison were a bit smarter she would realize that she trapped herself in a loop of eating more to pay for bigger clothes. But all she could see was dollars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison plopped down at a table ready to get this over with. Her strained gray sweatpants had lost the tie strings long ago. Her clothes left little to the imagination of the students around her. She loaded her tray with stacked pizza slices, creamy pasta, and a treasure trove of treats including cake slices, eclairs, and donuts. Everything just laid stacked on top of one another, to help make room for the maximum amount of food. Cassie was on camera duty and was ready to film Madison through the whole thing, though she tried to keep it concealed so as not to bring about suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison dove in first with a pizza slice in each hand. Her hunger consumed her thoughts as she was more concerned with getting food in her stomach than it was about taking time to chew the food. Her pace only picked up as her body begged for more. Before she knew it, her plate was empty, but she still had an urge to eat. Getting up for round 2, Cassie filmed Madison getting up. To her surprise, Cassie found Madison's sweatpants had ripped down her butt. It must of happened as she rolled out of the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were snickers from students who caught Madison with split pants piling up food for round 2. Madison was completely unaware of it all. Instead she came back to her seat with a big smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Madison\" whispered Cassie from behind the camera. \"You can um...you can stop now.\" Cassie pointed to Madison's rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was too busy stuffing her face. She was eating two cupcakes at a time, barely taking the time to breathe. MORE! her belly rumbled. She pushed the food down with a calorie laden milkshake. MORE! her belly moaned. Her sweatpants begged for mercy. Why can't I stop? Madison's willpower was thrown out the window. The snickers of students grew, but so did Madison's eating. The stitching of her clothes stretched to the max. The elastic around her waist was long gone. If she had any food left on her plate Madison would have lost her sweatpants. Luckily there was no more food left on the tray and an embarrassed Madison made a move for the exit to save whatever face she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until she got back to the dorm room that Madison realized what kind of damage she did to her school reputation. Everyone in the cafeteria watched as Madison ate beyond her pants. She'd never live it down. She grabbed a carton of ice cream and a spoon and went onto the forums to talk about her experience. The members on the forum not only comforted Madison, they encouraged her. As a treat, she turned on her webcam and ate through the carton of ice cream...and a box of cookies until she completely ripped her pants. That was the only relief Madison felt all day. </span></div></div>",

Embarrassed beyond belief, Madison had no recourse other than to hide herself in her dorm room for a week and hope that the story would go away. She even skipped classes stating that she was \"sick\" that week. A week in the dorms wasn't exactly the best thing for Madison's waistline. What little calories she burned going to and from class were no longer impeding her. Instead she remained in her dorm, mostly sitting in her chair...and eating. And did she ever order in. Dozen doughnuts for breakfast. 2 large pizzas for lunch. Chinese food for dinner for 4. Madison insisted that ordering more made more sense so she didn't have to order so often. But deep down she knew that each meal would not make it the night. The meals were larger than average even for Madison. She blamed her forum followers for encouraging her on. Madison went on to make quite a few eating sets for her adoring fans. She definitely got into the forums a bit more as she remained at her dorm. But by week's end, all she had was a lighter wallet and tighter pants. Madison had spent much of her money on food and new (and already tight ) clothes. Even with the added money of her most recent video, Madison's not so thrifty spending was weighing on her day-to-day life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison needed to find a solution. She couldn't go back to the cafeteria again. After the last incident, she was too afraid to step back in. She pleaded to the forums users about her problems and she was surprised to find that the community was happy to support her. They told her how to set up a wishlist on a popular ecommerce site. From there she could add different foods to the list that her followers could purchase for her. Madison was overwhelmed by their generosity and was more than happy to fill out her wishlist, although she didn't expect many people would follow through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The remainder of her time was spent binging on food, live chatting with her forums fans, and doing new sets to generate some income. But Madison didn't realize what kind of toll her body had taken from weeks of inactivity and gorging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"289 pounds!\" exclaimed Madison as she was filming her weigh-in video. The look of shock on her face was real. Before her famous video at the cafeteria, Madison was around 262 pounds. Almost all the newly added weight went to her ass, hips, thighs and belly. Madison was a serious pear. New bras were rarely a concern, though Madison was approaching D cups at the time. Her face still as thin as she was at 130 pounds. Just looking at her face, you could see the thin Madison stuck inside a very curvy girl. But it was at the start of her hips where Madison was showing off her massiveness. Her hips were so wide that her ass was overflowing the sides of chairs. Madison was almost as much off the chair as she was on. Battling her wide hips was her expansive ass. It seems Madison's hips only accentuated her rear which continued to grow outward as much as it did wide. She didn't realize how much of a shelf she had until she did a requested set where she was easily able to rest a soda cans on her ass. Despite being her biggest feature, Madison's ass wasn't riddled with cellulite. She had her half hispanic genes to thank for that one. Instead it was bulbous and jiggled when not restrained by jeans. Her thighs now battled for real estate. Madison constantly found her upper thighs to be rubbing together and upon inspection in her last set, Madison realized her thigh fat was causing dimples on her knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Madison was shocked by her recent weight gain, it was not followed by fear or concern. Instead a very convincing smile. Instead she teased her audience that there might be more weight gain to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Cassie finished filming the latest video, she had to inquire with Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...you were acting a bit weird on the video. You seemed rather interested about what's to come.\" asked Cassie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess you'll just have to wait and see with the rest of my fans\" replied Madison. Truth be told, Madison was starting to get turned on to her weight gain....rather she was getting turned on by the attention she was getting. At 130 pounds, Madison received a modest amount of attention from boys at school, now she had a whole legion of men online paying her compliments and stepping over each other to win her affections. As much as Madison was getting addicted to food, she was already addicted to attention. She craved to be the center of attention her whole life. Growing up shy and with siblings, it was hard to Madison to stand out at any point in life. Now she had been hooked to the attention she was getting online. And the bigger Madison has grown, the bigger her audience became. And so she was starting to get into her weight gain journey rather than it being a side effect of making money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison wasn't the smartest person in school, but she passed classes without too much of a struggle. But even the smartest students would struggle with grades when they skipped out on the last 4 weeks worth of classes. On top of enjoying herself the last few weeks, Madison was petrified of leaving the dorm and exposing herself to the real world. But reality sunk in for Madison. It was finals week, and she would need to cram and complete these tests if it killed her. Even if it meant showing off all the weight she added since the last time she was at the school cafeteria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk to her first class seemed to take forever. Madison hadn't realized how much the added weight slowed her and made her walk all that more tiring. Instead her walk felt long because she felt everyone in school staring at her. She could hear some whispers and giggles. Madison was rather unknown to the school population before the cafeteria incident, but now most people recognized her. And the sight of her transformation as astounding to everyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie arrived back at the dorm as she completed her final test early and began to get her things packed. The absence of Madison in the room was a little unsettling considering how the last few weeks have panned out. Cassie's original plan to fatten Madison was well beyond what she imagined. Madison was considerably bigger and while there was no reason to continue to encourage, Cassie was more than happy to keep Madison well fed. There was a side of Cassie who was starting to worry about Madison's weight gain. Had she taken it too far? Cassie brushed it off. How much fatter could she get anyways?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Madison arrived back home. Slightly winded, Madison was actually in better spirits then Cassie would have thought. While Madison admitted that despite showing up for the final in one class, that the teacher had already failed her and she would need to retake the course over the winter break. That was the bad news. The good news she didn't share with Cassie was how much better she felt about herself in public. It took her awhile to accept it, but Madison's weight had propelled her to the top of the school. She was the center of attention when she walked to and from class. While Madison was a bit delusional, she took the looks and stares as a good thing. Finally, she was the talk of town and the internet. Gone were the fears of leaving the dorm room. Fear of being ridiculed were gone. Madison was free to roam the campus without embarrassment...or at least in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison still fretted a bit to Cassie about the winter course. Though she took it as a blessing. If her parents saw how big Madison got, her mom and dad would have a fit. Still she would be the talk of the family. Another time she thought. Madison was still worried about paying for the class though. All the money she saved up recently disappeared to pay for her dorm stay and class. When she talked to her parents, she lied and said she wanted to get a jump on her education. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll have to model some more!\" said Madison with a very obvious wink to Cassie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie would be gone for winter break. She wasn't too sure if she should leave Madison behind, but she didn't have any choice in the matter. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>School was out for most of the students at Powers. Madison and a small band of students were left over to roam the campus with little traffic or noise. Some were off campus students looking to complete their schooling earlier. Some had to work on campus or continue with their internships. The drastic difference in attendance was striking. But this only empowered Madison to return back to the cafeteria. It had been awhile since Madison had real food not directly from a box. It was all so delicious to her in the moment. She loaded up on fries and burgers, went back for pasta, and indulged in fresh cake. Madison intended on putting on weight, so she was really enjoying her eating more now than ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison loved the attention she received as she went up for seconds and thirds and dessert. She made sure to stuff herself to the point of fullness before heading over to class. There was always the emergency box of snickers in her bag in case she got hungry to and at class. This was raided daily. Madison made sure to visit the dining hall for all her meals and she would feast upon the free food provided to her by her supporting fans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison made sure to keep up this pace into the first week of winter break and by the start of the second week Madison's clothes were already getting tight. In the past, this would have stirred up all sorts of emotions. Today Madison was thrilled. That meant she was putting on weight. And how. She started to enjoy how her clothes grew tighter and tighter. Her waist cutting into her size 26 jeans, her ass filling out every inch of space and putting strain on every thread. Her thighs testing the seams all the way down to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the beginning of a new week and Madison was in her typical spot at the cafeteria eating before going to class. Her pants on the verge of giving up. While Madison was enjoying the attention she was drawing that day, she didn't want to burst through her clothes before going to class. That actually might be embarrassing Madison though to herself. Madison tried to restrain herself by eating a little less, but she couldn't help but polish off her meal with half tray of brownies. Cautious, Madison sucked in her gut all the way to class and moved stiffly to avoid any unnecessary tears in her clothes. Madison arrived in class and safely in her seat. It was when she pulled out her pen to work on a quiz when she was reminded by the snickers bars in her bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a brief internal struggle, but Madison pulled the bars out of her bag and began to eat them slowly. She could feel eat bite slowly extending her stomach out further. It wasn't until the stress of the quiz made Madison a bit less conscious of her pace of eating. By the time the quiz was done, Madison was through 5 Snickers bars. Excited that she felt good about her performance on the quiz, Madison sprang up from her chair to drop off her answer sheet to the teacher. In doing so the fast action and added food caused Madison's jeans to rip right across her ass. Her underwear visible for all to see as she dropped off her quiz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome students gasped, others chuckled. Madison...wasn't embarrassed. She enjoyed it far more than someone should. But she loved the idea that a moment like this will be stuck in everyone's minds. They will be thinking of her for a long time. So she tried to play it cool and sat back down. The rush in her head though was unlike anything else she'd experienced. All she could think about was when she could do it again. And how she'd do it. As she leaned forward she felt the rip get bigger. She enjoyed making the tear worse over the remainder of the class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she made it back to her room, she couldn't wait to inform the forums. Of course it required the backstory and pictures to prove it. Madison was loving all the attention this moment had created. And she couldn't wait to top that high. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ever since Madison tore her pants in class, she made it her goal to repeat the incident before the class finished up. She wanted to make sure that these students had a lot to talk about when their friends came back to campus. She didn't have much time to achieve this, so Madison made sure to spend most of her winter break at the cafeteria or eating snacks back at her dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's well known by now that Madison wasn't the smartest or observant person in the world. Madison had put so much focus on her weight gain, she failed to notice that the newly added pounds were making it increasingly difficult to fit into the restrictive desks. The desks had no give to them since they were the type of desks that's attached to the chair. Madison's hips barely rested comfortably when class started, but as winter break went on, the more she had to squeeze in and out of her desk. Her ass pressed against the back of the seat and poured out the sides and around the metal frame. While Madison only had a modest sized belly in comparison to her lower half, it began to rest on the desk top. Madison subconsciously sucked her gut as she sat down. Her hips had grown almost too wide for the chair. She couldn't fit her entire girth into the chair. One giant thigh was almost always hanging out in the middle of the aisle. Madison had failed to notice any of these signs and it<br>\r\nall came to a head on the last day of class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDedication had paid off for Madison. Not only was she passing her class, she was filling out her clothes. Her brand new size 28 clothes were almost feeling like a second skin. Madison was weirdly proud of her accomplishment and was feeling a nervous excitement. On her last day in class Madison decided to bring a large soda and as many candy bars as she could fit in her bag. She knew she needed the extra push if she was going to pull this off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison attempted to squeeze herself into her chair. She really had to suck her gut in to fit. Madison was in a tight seat with tight clothing. She kind of felt like a sausage encased in another sausage. The rest of the class had certainly taken notice of Madison. Within just a few weeks her weight exploded and she looked absolutely massive when trying to fit into her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison fresh off breakfast, opened up her bag to grab a half dozen candy bars and soda. She began to devour her snacks. Chew. Gulp. Chew. Chew. Gulp. She polished off her candy bars with a fizzy cola. Her stomach swelled as she ate. Her stomach protested. \"No more!\" it screamed. Madison's jeans were cutting into her. They needed relief. And Madison was more than happy to provide that relief. Madison attempted to wiggle around in her chair hoping that the wrong move would cause her pants to split. She found herself struggling to move. Madison wasn't sure why her pants weren't ripping on cue. Thankfully she had some more candy to fill her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA defiant Madison pulled out more candy bars. She was going to make this happen even if it meant going against her stomachs wishes. Madison forced bar after bar down her through as her stomach protested every bite. She couldn't stop even if she wanted to. The wrappers were overtaking the desk and it was certainly garnering attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSNAP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whip-like noise came from Madison's chair. Madison could still her jeans pressing tightly against her hips. A few of the students hear the noise, but nobody knew what happened. Madison had to question herself. Did she just rip through her panties? Indeed Madison's panties could no long take the strain. How they ripped before her pants was something of a miracle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Madison's stomach, she had run out of candy bars. Madison was extremely disappointed that she couldn't put on a show for her class. She packed way more than a days worth of calories for nothing. Madison tried to mightiest to put more pressure on her jeans when she realized that she couldn't move from her desk. At first Madison panicked. She was stuck! Her bloated stomach and pressing ass and hips locked her into her chair. Madison had grown too fat for the school desk! Once Madison understood her predicament, she began to relish in it. She actually enjoyed the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass had ended and Madison attempted to suck her gut into get loose from her chair, but whatever stomach muscles she had in the past were long gone. Some students began to notice Madison struggle. Madison noticed and opted to use this time to make more of a struggle to get loose. Students laughed and chuckled as they watched a helpless Madison try to even budge out of her desk. But in the end most of the students and even the teacher left Madison in the classroom on her own. Except for one person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you need a little help there\" said another student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison looked over her shoulder to see a thin blond girl with a big smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...yeah, I think I'm stuck! This desk is a bit small.\" replied Madison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let me try and help you out.\"</span></div></div>",

She was a fairly frail looking girl, so Madison was quite unsure how much help she would really be. Plus sucking it in was not a possibility at the moment. After downing so many candy bars, her stomach was not going to budge any time soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok try turning a little bit sideways.\" she said \"I think we got this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison tried to turn in anyway she could, but the more she twisted the more her tight clothes cut into her.

If she wasn't stuck in a classroom she never would have wanted this to end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>RIIIIIIIP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seams down Madison's thighs couldn't take the pressure of Madison's attempts to get out of the chair. Her thighs continued to budge through her stretch pants But with the pressure off, she was able to move just a bit more and just enough for her to get lifted from out of the desk. Madison was free! There was a sigh of relief from both of them, though for Madison, it was because she was tried from all that effort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God we did it!\" said the girl \"High five!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much I appreciate the help.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a week after the desk incident and Madison was enjoying the last few days of freedom before school was back in session for the spring. It was a particularly lazy week for Madison as she chose to mostly stay inside her dorm room and indulge in the snacks she had received over break. As the days passed, Madison was forced to retire pant after pant as she continued to outgrow what was left of her size 28 clothes. Most of the time, she'd find herself in just her underwear since all the other clothes were uncomfortable to wear. And so she caved and decided she needed to buy up a size. She was about to order another size up online, when the thought of going out was all too alluring for Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I have been cooped up in here for too long.</i> thought Madison Maybe it would be good for me to get out and go to the mall for a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Madison put on her biggest pair of stretch pants, which were certainly stretching every last thread. It was a struggle for Madison to even get them past her giant thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Has it been this long since I've worn pants?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was able to get her pants up and around her hips, but it wasn't exactly able to get them completely over her ass. Madison decided it would be smart to put her big loose sweater on to cover herself up, but found that even her reliable tops had become too small. She couldn't get full coverage even if she tugged at the sweater. And as she tried to take the sweater off, she ripped the seams around the arms. It seems that recently Madison's weight was finally taking a toll on her upper half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Since when did I have such fat arms?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true. While Madison still retained a thin facial complexion, everything else was coated in a thick layer of fat. She had rounded out all over. Even her boobs grew, which Madison was happy with since it helped balance the extreme pear shape. Madison was forced to wear a tight t-shirt that didn't leave much to the imagination, but covered up most of what she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison rode on the local bus out to the mall. This route was something familiar to Madison as this was the same bus she used to take to do her tutoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh how things have changed Madison</i> reminisced to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Madison got off the bus she was met with another throwback. McDonalds! The golden arches. They called to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh perfect! I haven't had lunch yet, this is going to be a good day!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison walked up to the counter and recognized the same pimply kid that had taken her order in the past. He was a bit shocked at the sight of Madison having remembered her incident last time she was at the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take 2 20 piece chicken nuggets, a milkshake...super size that, and 2 big macs...oh and a large coke\" Madison said to the kid<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like old times for Madison. It was rather refreshing to eat some real fast food. Except it was a much tighter fit than last time. Her ass pushed out so far, it was hard to even get a good fit into the booth without getting dangerously close to the table. She dug into the food as if she hadn't eaten in days. Her already tight pants begging for restraint. Madison knew this but didn't slow down. She wasn't looking to make a display of herself today since she couldn't walk around the mall with ripped pants. And by the end of the meal, Madison was certain any fast moves might be the end of these pants. Madison was satiated and was ready to go to the mall, but the smell of french fries called her back to the counter.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nOk. One thing of fries and I'm out of here</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get two large fries and a refill on this milkshake?\" asked Madison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What am I saying? I think I overdid it</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison returned to her booth and devoured her second course. She tried to suck in her bloated stomach as she ate so as to put as minimal a strain on her clothes as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh God I don't think I can hold it. But I can't stop eating!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turns out, Madison doesn't have the muscles she did when she was a fit 130 pounds. She couldn't hold her stomach in. It surged forward like a flash flood and put an end to the elastic band of her stretch pants. With stomach free, Madison ate with gusto. Her stomach no longer burdened by the tight confines left her with more room in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she polished off her second meal, Madison was ready to go for real this time. But as she sat up, she felt a rip right down the seam of her ass. She casually checked with her hand to confirm as the patrons of the store were watching her. Madison found this to be pretty hot, but she knew if she didn't hurry to the mall soon, she'd be arrested for indecent exposure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk over to the mall was a lot longer than Madison remembered. It was apparent to anyone else that Madison's thighs were the reason for this. They were too large for each other. Each thigh battling for space with each step. The amount of fighting left holes in the inner thigh of her stretch pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked into the mall , she realized she entered through the food court entrance. Madison was immediately tempted with smells and lights. She managed to avoid most of the vendors until she hit the cookie shop at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Free sample? Have one of our delicious chocolate chip cookies!\" said a man wearing a red apron and carrying a tray of cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...oh..ummm..\" Madison was compelled to grab the cookie. \"Sure why not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison bit in. It was unlike any cookie she had at school. So sweet and flavorful. It put all other cookies to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're doing a sale today! Buy a baker's dozen, get a baker's dozen free. Share with your friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I really shouldn't I really need to get to the store Madison said to herself.</i> \"Then I'll take a baker's dozen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Great! I'm so happy you liked them. This is my grandmother's secret recipe. Well the real secret is lots of butter hah hah, so be sure to give them out to friends. We could use the business! Also they're not the healthiest cookies hah hah, but what cookie is? Am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha! Yeah I'm..uh going to a party tonight so this will be a perfect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison grabbed a brochure to check out just how many calories were in these cookies.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n250 Calories per cookie?!</i> Madison screamed to herself. This must be just all fat! Madison was quite surprised that the man didn't seem to notice or care about a girl who walked over to his shop stuffed in a tight t-shirt and wearing ripped pants, but she quickly scooted out of his vision after she got the cookies. She promised herself that she'd save them for the dorm and that she'd have just a few after she got some new pants, but once she was out of view from the shopkeeper, Madison ripped open the first box. The were hot and gooey as if they were just made. Madison couldn't resist. She pulled over to a bench and sat down pulling out two cookies at a time. At first she ate them slowly so as to savor the taste, but it the bites got bigger and the chewing hastened. Before she knew it, she was cramming the last cookie whole into her mouth. She looked over at the other box. She tried to deny herself the other half of her cookie stash, but her stomach got the best of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time spent eating cookies was not helping her situation at all. The tears in her clothes were expanding with each shift and bend she made as she ate. Her underwear was cutting into her hips and she was sure to have marks tonight. But she was less concerned with that and more concerned with stuffing her face. Madison ate through the second box faster then the first and despite being full, her stomach asked for more. She spotted a pretzel stand and her eyes lit up. But as she scurried to the stand, her underwear could no longer hold up its end of the bargain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>RIIIIIP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No no!\" Madison said surprisingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to divert her thoughts of food and rush over to the Target to get a pair of replacement clothes. It was very clear to anyone that Madison was exploding out her clothes as she ran into the Target. Madison darted right over to the plus size and grabbed the first pair of size 30 jeans and xxl underwear she could find. There was no time to try them on, she needed new clothes fast! So she paid for the clothes and then hopped into the bathroom to get changed. Much to Madison's surprise, her new clothes were already beyond tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be kidding me!\" said Madison. \"There's no way!\" But it was for real. Madison did not bother to replace her clothes over a week ago and her recent binges have not been slimming on her hips. What was she to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ping!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe button Madison's jeans burst open. Her brand new jeans were not going to hold on for long. Madison, unsure of what to do, needed to get her head straight. But first she needed a snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison left the Target in search of a convenience store inside the mall. She found a newstand shop that would certainly have some candy bars she could eat and help her mind focus. She was presented with more candy then she's ever seen. What seemed like a casual purchase was taken a little overboard and it surprised both Madison and the shopkeeper. There must of been about twenty candy bars on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm uhh having a party tonight\" Madison said to the shopkeeper<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison grabbed the bag of candy and rushed out the store. She tore into her bag of candy with such desperation. She shoved a Milky Way into her mouth as she was opening up a 3 Musketeers. A sense of pleasure overtook Madison as she was able to get her chocolate fix. But Madison's impulse to buy so much candy was really her downfall. She couldn't stop herself from plowing through the whole bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went back to the newstand to grab some more candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't grab enough for the party\" Madison said to the shopkeeper. The shopkeeper noticed that Madison didn't have her original bag of candy on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why can't I stop? </i>Madison said to herself <i>I better get a new pair of pants and try them on BEFORE I buy them. And I better hurry or I'm going to eat my way through this pair now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison made her way back to Target, still munching away at her candy bars. She searched the aisles for clothes more in her size. She was shocked to find out that size 30 was the biggest they carried in the plus size section, but she was able to find an XXL pair of linen stretch pants that would give her a bit more room than the jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison found the fitting room but encountered a real problem. She could barely fit in the fitting room. The fitting room was not meant for large people at all. The walls were narrow and Madison found that her hips pressed up against them as she walked in. Between eating her candy bars and disrobing to try on her pants, Madison was finding this to be a real tight squeeze. She was able to get her pants off and she pulled the linen pants up. Unbeknownst to Madison, the linen pants left little to the imagination. The jeans and yoga pants kept her somewhat contained, but the linen pants gave no support. And because of the narrow changing room, it was impossible for Madison to check herself out in the changing room mirror. The whole ordeal was a struggle and Madison needed a break. She parked herself on the changing room bench as her hips pressed tightly against the changing room walls. As she sat, Madison's ass pressed the limits of her linen pants. In fact, it was a bit too much for this frail fabric and Madison had immediately ripped the pants down the seam of her butt. Madison was unaware, busy chewing on the last of her candy bars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh my God, so much better</i> thought Madison. The draw strings instantly retreated into her pants never to be seen again. The ripped pants provided the feeling of more room for Madison. Alas she can escape the mall alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison pushed hard up against the walls of the changing room. With a bit of effort, she was able to pop herself out of the changing room and over to the register.  She handed the tag to the person behind the register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm uh, going to wear this out of the store. I just love it so much.\" said Madison<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk behind the register just gave her a funny look as Madison swiped her credit card. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Madison left, she could hear the sound of snickering, but she didn't understand why. Must of been something she missed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison confidently strolled out of the store and began her journey home. She realized that there were no clothes at the mall that were big enough for her. She was actually a bit shocked by the notion, but was immediately distracted again by the smells of the mall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm full</i> Madison repeated to herself <i>I don't need anymore.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am! Ummm Miss!\" said a familiar voice. It was the man who worked at the cookie shop. The man looked frantic and a bit worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm so glad I found you\" he said. \"I was taking my break when I noticed the two boxes of cookies that you purchased were emptied and sitting on a bench.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison blushed as the man continue to tell his story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that you were saving those for a party. So I assumed some kids must of nabbed them from you. I'm so sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...yeah....some kids swiped them and they ran out of sight. It's alright though. Really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no! I can't let you go home empty handed. I mean that would be disappointing to the party and for me. I mean I want to make sure your friends know about us here at the mall. So please. Take another two boxes for free. They're on the house. And they just came out of the oven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I really....did you say right out of the oven?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, and it's our double chocolate chip cookie. Double the chocolate chips, double the size. I hope everyone will love them. Anyways here you go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man handed Madison two boxes of cookies and ran back to his shop before she could say anything. Madison's stomach protested. There's no more room in there. But even so, her willpower was so thin in the moment she couldn't help but dive into the box for one cookie. She wasn't hungry, but she continued to shove food into her face and she couldn't stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the struggle at the mall, Madison had to take a seat at the mall food court. She was quite tired and was a little out of breathe. That was probably the most exercise she's had in weeks. However, sitting down did not reduce the distraction that was the rip in her pants. Instead as she sat, the threads of the pants continued to unwind. The time spent sitting down was terrible for her decision making. She was far too tempted to take another cookie out. She tried to reason with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I mean it's something to do while I rest.</i> she thought. But one cookie became two cookies and two cookies became three. <i>Ugh...I can't stop. I want MORE!</i>. Madison lost all control. She was eating so fast, she wasn't even properly chewing. It was as if she was possessed. Madison was creating a scene in the food court. Many people watching a woman waste an entire box of cookies with her underwear fully exposed out of a tear in her linen pants. Yellow polka dotted underwear for all to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne box was down and Madison began to feel ill. Her body was working overtime to try and digest all this food and Madison was only adding to the problem. Many people would have stopped a long while ago, but Madison couldn't control her urges. She began to dig into the box despite all warning in her stomach and mind albeit she toned down her pace quite a bit. In the whole fiasco, Madison hadn't even realized that her pants were only that in name. In reality, they were more tattered cloth than anything. The waistband was long gone, string lying on the food court floor. Thighs popping out of the holes. Madison was caught off guard. She shot up out of her seat. What was left of her pants were now on the floor. She was in the mall with just her panties on. Madison's face went flush. People were catching the whole incident on camera. Madison scurried out of the mall with box of cookies in tow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was caught up in the situation. She was quite concerned by how she acted back at the mall. She always prided herself in being in control. Back at the mall was something else. But she loved the outcome. The attention she received was unparalleled to what she did in class. Thoughts of videos of herself from the mall appearing on the internet was enough to keep her distracted from the real issue. Madison was losing control. She was becoming a glutton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a quiet 7 weeks for Cassie. She spent most of her vacation at home with her parents or catching up with a few friends. Nothing too out of the ordinary. She did notice that some of her friends had put on the freshman 15 (or worse), though seeing that just made her think about Madison and how she left her before break. Cassie was curious. There was no updates to Madison's website since before winter break. Maybe Madison had given up modeling and putting on weight. She certainly didn't seem to indicate that before she left, but maybe there was a change of heart. Cassie would like that to be the case. Cassie was started to get concerned about Madison. Shes put on some much weight due to Cassie's influence and things were starting to get out of control by winter. Feeling guilty, Cassie admitted that it was a bad idea and that she had taken things too far. Madison put on weight like nobody she knew. Madison was already a big girl, hopefully, she took it easy over break. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie unlocked the door to her dorm room. With a sigh, Cassie is reminded of the many months of classes ahead. But before she can complete her thoughts, she is presented with a pair of linen pants torn to shreds at the doorway. From there Cassie notices the armrests from Madison's chair lying on the ground. As she turned to Madison's desk she was greeted by the women herself, or what look liked Madison. Cassie nearly had a heart attack. There was Madison engulfing her chair. Madison looked huge. Her thighs...were....massive. They had grown so thick that the chair seat itself was completely invisible. Each thigh had expanded in every direction. Even creating large knee dimples, which only showed the tiny person that used to sit in that seat. Her ankles were no longer that. They were full fledged cankles. When Cassie left for the winter, Madison had some fat rolls around her stomach, but now Madison was supporting a much fuller belly. Her lower roll rested on her thighs, concealing her underwear. Madison's breasts had taken on some pounds, but were the least of her troubles. That is if Madison had actually bought fitting bra. Her bra showing the thick layer of fat that now covered almost every inch of Madison's body. The bra straps cutting into her fat around her shoulders and chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison spotted Cassie and with much delight, she hopped off her chair to come in for a hug. All Cassie could notice was the fluffiness of Madison's arms as she lifted herself out of her seat. Everything wobbled. Belly, thighs, and arms all going at their own pace as Madison walked in for a hug. Cassie was just barely able to get her hands wrapped around Madison. She peered over Madison's shoulder to assess the damage to her behind. Madison had been gifted (or cursed based on how you see it) with not only having wide hips, but also an ass that shot far out. And while Cassie caught that chairs are a real problem for Madison's hips, she now knew that her ass wasn't going to fit into a lot of chairs. Her ass had collected a lot of the weight over break. Cassie could rest her arms on her bulbous butt and still have room for activities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Cass, it's so great to see you! How was break? How was the family?\" said Madison<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie looked at Madison again. Despite all the added weight, Madison still had the same thin face she had when she first got to school. It was the thing that really helped her maintain her beauty despite this ridiculous gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...it was fine. Looks like you had a busy break.\" said Cassie motioning to Madison's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it great?! I got stuck in a chair in class and split my pants in front of my classmates and in the mall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait you did what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I didn't want to say anything until you got back. But check this out. Turns out when I was at the mall, someone video taped me at the food court. They noticed I had split my pants and they filmed me gorging until I split my pants right off. This thing went viral! I'm like a minor internet celebrity!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie wasn't able to take it all in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why would you be proud to be caught with ripped pants?\" said Cassie<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rush. The attention. I just love the attention. The more weight I've put on during the break, the more attention I've received. It's hot Cass. I can just feel all the eyes on me and I know they want it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison, I don't think that's the case..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah ok Cass. I mean you don't have to be passive aggressive here. You can just say you're jealous\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not saying I'm jealous, I'm saying look at you! What do you even weigh now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I'm not quite sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I broke the last scale, so, I ordered a new one. But I think I'm over 300. That last scale went to 295.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison this has to stop! Don't you think you've gone too far with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gone too far? Cass, I still got some ways to go here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ways to go? How big do you plan on getting\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not quite sure. I'm just enjoying myself as I gain\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well by the looks of it you're going to be bigger than a house in just a few weeks if you keep this up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to calm down. Now I can stop whenever I want. And I'm not done yet. And when I am, I'll stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison spoke with a less confident tone as she remembered the mall incident. </span></div></div>",

Now it seemed like Madison didn't even need Cassie's prodding to pack on the pounds. She didn't want to feel responsible for turning Madison into a fat blob. The only course of action in Cassie's mind was to cut Madison off from the free food. So she went to the school's mail room and routed her packages to a random address a few states away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison didn't quite notice the slowing trickle of food to her mailbox, but eventually things began to dry up. She didn't seem to understand. Was she not considered hot anymore? Was her fandom declining? And why was Cassie up her butt about her weight all of a sudden? With the lack of food coming and along with a nagging Cassie, Madison was finding herself arguing with Cassie often. Cassie, filled with guilt, didn't want to argue with Madison, but didn't know what else do to but fight her on her weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fighting and arguing had gotten so bad that the two roommates often avoided each other. Emotions ran especially high when the roommates were forced to share the same space during a mandatory floor meeting. Bitter words were shared between the two girls resulted in a tearful Madison running (as best she could) out of the dorms. She found herself crying in front of a stoop of one of the school's apartment buildings. Passers by ignored the distraught freshman.

It was a challenge. Madison wanted to show Cassie she wans't going to retreat, to surrender. She was determined to keep her routine, her lifestyle. She was determined to keep gaining more and more. She wanted to keep recording videos, getting praise, getting fucking fat. And if Cassie didnt like that... she always could move to another apartment, because she wasnt going anywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison started eating like crazy, not holding back anything. Cassie thought about leaving her alone and return to her room, but she understood what Madison was doing and she didnt want to lose. So she stayed, watching TV and peeping at Madison gluttony festival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUuurpp!\" Madison belched quite loudly after drinking her shake. \"Sorry, haha\" and laugh while took another hamburger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls could feel the tension on the room.

Every waking moment was spent either stuffing her face or looking for food to feed herself, a fact her fans were only too happy to help her with. One fan had sent her an entire crate of weight gain powder, in particular the cheap variety that used sugar for a whole heaping pile of calories per scoop. Madison had taken to mixing them in milkshakes she was making with the blender the same fan had sent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick bit of math showed that each shake had a little over 3,000 calories each, and she was drinking five or six a day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer food deliveries had hit an all time high, and Maddie found she was having to push herself more and more to finish off the day's pile to avoid everything building up or risking spoilage. Her fears about the cafeteria from the first semester dealt with, she spent a large portion of each day in the building. Her meals had become multi-course affairs, loaded high with sugar laden desserts and the greasiest entrees she could find. Any stares or snickers she got didn't slow her down in the slightest; if anything, it was only encouraging her to go back for yet another tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie watched her room mate eating and growing at a record pace with morbid fascination. She was really starting to worry about how much her friend was eating. Maddie was getting so fat and growing so fast! Cassie was really starting to struggle to remember a time when Madison wasn't chewing, or when she didn't always have huge quantities of treats within arms' reach of her seat. It seemed there was a constant stream of deliveries arriving at their doorstep, and it was always more food, whether from a fan or Maddie had ordered take-out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, despite her worries, there were some benefits to having Gaining Maddie (to use her stage name) as a friend. Namely, no matter how much Cassie ate or how unhealthy it was, no one took any notice of her when they had Madison to watch. Kelly, who'd somehow managed to avoid gaining a single ounce of weight since the start of college, was aghast at how much Maddie had gained and how much she was eating, and was very vocal about it every meal. This never had the desired effect, as it just made Madison go and grab even more to fill her bottomless maw out of spite. Cassie enjoyed not having her ear nagged off every time she wanted a jumbo burrito or two, or if she felt the urge for a second helping of pizza or burgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Cassie not been room mates with a true gaining titan, she might have paid more attention to her own diet and how tight her own clothes were starting to get. As it was, she couldn't help but feel incredibly skinny and appetite-restrained next to her gluttonous friend. And she couldn't complain about the extra income off the sets, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison, meanwhile, was feeling very conflicted. On the one hand, the mall incident weighed heavily on her mind. She had been completely out of control, stuffing herself well past the point of painfully full. Even when she tore out of her clothes, in public no less, she'd kept right on eating until there was nothing left. While she hadn't had a public incident like that in awhile, even she couldn't fail to notice that, as long as there was food in front of her, she wouldn't stop eating until it was gone, regardless of the consequences. While she tried to convince herself that she could stop when she wanted to, deep down she was really beginning to doubt her ability to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Maddie couldn't be happier. She'd never received so much attention in her life. Her fans adored her and showered her with praise (and money and food). Every time she outgrew another article of clothing or grew a bit larger, she felt so sexy. And, despite her misgivings about her appetite, she had to admit that having her tummy packed to the brim with fatty foods just felt better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe end result, as you might expect, was Madison pushed herself everyday to eat just a bit more then the previous, and her weight kept going up and up and up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was near the end of the first week in February, and Madison was doing her usual thing - sitting in front of her computer, stuffing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd just set up a food ordering bot for her fans, and one had used it to send her 4 large pizzas, loaded with extra cheese. For dessert, he'd sent her an entire McCain Deep'n'delicious chocolate cake, with a promised payday of $200 if she ate it all on camera in her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile that might have seemed like a lot, Madison was not one to back down from a challenge. And since she'd upgraded from the Chinese Dinner for 4 to the Dinner for 6, she felt it was one she could easily manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she happily chewed on another slice of her pizza, it was quite clear that she'd grown again in the first month back from winter break. Her largest bra was no longer adequate, and her fat-engorged mammaries were ballooning out from top and sides of the cups. The straps cut deep, deep grooves into her shoulder fat and back fat, and Maddie knew this bra's lifespan could only be a few more days at most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer triple rolled belly reached halfway down her thighs, and seemed to be doing its utmost to lay claim to her lap. Her love handles had also gotten quite large, and seemed to be trying the same with her posterior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry being the operative word, mind you. Most of the new fat had gone to her hips, thighs, and ass. Her thighs were titanic things. Though the her from September would scarcely believe it, Maddie was now as big around the thighs as many girls were around the waist. Her knees had all but disappeared under the fat her legs were now carrying, evidenced only by the appearance of dimples between her thighs and calves. Her calves themselves had grown large and flabby, and shook gelatinously with each step she took while walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer booty, however, remained the champion of her lardy body. By now, her shelf-booty stuck out almost two full feet behind her, and with her hips, she felt nearly four feet wide. Taking the arms off her chair had proven to be a very good idea, as she massively overhung the sides of her seat. The back of the chair was supported by a single post, and her ass was bisected by it, shoving her nearly invisible underwear deep into her butt crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact is that she'd swollen into a massive ball of fat, and her chair had nearly disappeared under her gargantuan body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie's upper arm fat jiggled merrily as she stuffed another slice of pizza into her hungering maw. Despite how much weight she'd packed away onto the rest of her frame, her face remained thin and pretty, with only the barest hint of a double chin. For that, she was actually rather grateful, as it meant she could tilt her camera back when she skyped her family back home, hiding her colossal gain from her sister and parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dab of sauce fell from the pizza onto her large left breast. Mindful of her future audience, she lifted her left tit towards her face and slowly, sensually licked the sauce from her engorged mammary. She let out a coo that wasn't entirely faked for the camera. God, she felt so good right now. Maybe she was worried about her lack of self-control some of the time, but right now, she could think of nothing better then eating more and getting even fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow big was she going to get? Maddie neither knew or cared, and frankly, at this moment, gaining indefinitely seemed like a very attractive prospect. She was so big, so sexy, eating more everyday, and just getting fatter and fatter and fatter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer train of thought was interrupted by a loud, strained creak coming from her precarious throne. Maddie managed a \"What th-\" before her poor, suffering seat at long last gave way under her greatly increased bulk. The two wheels at the back snapped first, sending her falling towards the floor. As she hit, her overfed back rolls pushed against the chair's frail spine until it too gave way. She tumbled towards the floor, amply cushioned by her large rolls, but careful to make sure her head didn't strike the ground. Cassie heard the commotion from her side of the room even through her headphones, and came running to Madison's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maddie! Are you okay!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine.\" Madison flailed her limbs a little uselessly. Lying on the floor in the ruins of her chair, it was clear just how huge she'd gotten. The top of her belly and boobs stuck several inches above her face, and her cascade of flesh covered an unbelievable amount of the floor. Stretchmarks, softened by her caramel skin tone, were evidenced everywhere, as she'd gained so much so quickly. The sheer quantity of fat on Madison's legs made it hard for her to get up on her own. Grunting, Cassie helped her friend to her feet and helped her sit on the edge of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get you anything?\" Cassie had been expecting her to say an ice pack or some pain pills, and her eyes nearly bugged out of her head at Maddie's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you pass me the rest of my pizza and cake? And re-aim the camera towards me. We can head for supper after that.\" Madison's stomach let out a loud growl that brought a blush to Cassie's cheeks. \"Also, we should have a movie night tonight. Ming's has a dinner for 8 on special this week...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what's next for Madison?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh God, I'm so full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi just shook her head. \"I've told you to quit ordering so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison could only groan as she rubbed her overfull gut. \"Seriously, I can't eat another bite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, put it in the fridge, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't! It's completely full!\" Madison forced another forkful of food down her throat with a grimace of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi hoped Maddie couldn't see the blush forming on her face. It was her fault the fridge had been perpetually packed in the fall semester, as she'd attempted to fatten her vain, weak-willed friend. The plan had worked too well, but now that she was cutting back on what she was putting in the fridge in an effort to curb Madison's gain, Maddie's fans and the girl herself had taken over the job in excess, leaving it more full then ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie sighed. Her belly was fairly full, but she still had some room. \"Just give it here, then. I'll finish it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison passed it with a grunt, giving her a nod of thanks. \"Thanks. We've got to clean that thing out one of these days. Actually, if you don't have class tomorrow, we could have a movie day and eat it down a little...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie sat at her laptop, trying and failing to wrap her mind around a particularly difficult problem. She was getting very frustrated. The assignment was due tomorrow, as well. Letting out a soft growl of annoyance, she reached into the bag of cookies on her desk, finding it empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Already? Well, whatever.\"</i> She rolled her chair to the table that Maddie and her had set up between their desks. The table was practically groaning under the weight of treats on it. They were a mix of those purchased by Maddie and ones sent to her by her fans. Even for her considerable appetite, there was simply too much, and she'd told Cassie to help herself whenever she wanted some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie looked over the pile, and grabbed another box of chips ahoy cookies, a family sized bag of chips, and a four-pack of Twinkies. She thought to herself, <i>\"I'm going to get this problem if it kills me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie had always been a big snacker, but she was hitting the treats more and more frequently. Since she was no longer the one buying them, she was in the dark about how much she was actually eating daily. The stress of classes was only making things worse, as she'd developed quite a habit of stress eating as a coping mechanism. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie looked over at Madison before going back to her work. Maddie had her back to her, headphones on, concentrating on her own work. She was dressed for once, wearing a t-shirt and some grey yoga pants. She had the clothes stretched to capacity, leaving none of her gargantuan form to the imagination, and she was clearly not wearing a bra. The garbage can next to her desk was overflowing with empty wrappers, and as Cassie watched, Maddie opened another package of snack cakes and added another empty to the pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maddie's jaws worked through the next treat, Cassie looked at her chair-engulfing ass and titanic thighs. Though she was no longer as disgusted as she had been with Maddie's soft, jiggly body, she was still worried at the scale of her friend's gain, quite convinced she could see her growing each day. However, with all the class work both girls had to do, she really didn't want to have another argument right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She's got to start cutting back before she winds up as big as a house,\"</i> Cassie thought as she ate another cookie...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie looked at her empty plate. As if sensing her disappointment, Maddie said, \"You can go back for another burrito if you want, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know. I just really shouldn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? You've already paid for it, so why go hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie rubbed her belly under the table. \"I've already had two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing her mouthful, Madison responded, \"So? I'm on number six.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You eat yourself into a stupor every meal. You're not really a good benchmark for moderation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Maddie was offended at all, she made no sign. \"That's fair, but that's a point in my favor as well. Whose going to notice if you have a third next to me? And I was still planning to have dessert after this. Trust me, no one's going to notice if you have another. Besides, it's not like you do this all the time. Once in awhile isn't going to hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie's willpower regarding her appetite had been pretty low to begin with, and it took very little pushing from Maddie to tilt her over the edge. \"You know what, maybe I will have another. I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Atta girl!\" Maddie said through a mouthful of food. Had Maddie or Cassie been paying more attention, they would have noticed just how much Cassie's ass was filling out her jeans, and how much more it appeared to jiggle as she walked away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\" Hold up *gasp, gasp* I *gasp* just need *gasp* a minute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie stopped and watched as Maddie sank heavily onto a nearby bench. Her expansive ass spread out as she sat down, easily covering half the little bench, and protruding far out the back. Her massive thighs refused to let her poor, suffering knees anywhere near each other, forcing her legs to be splayed out. Her belly was unquestionably bigger, spreading further onto her lap, and her three belly rolls had thickened considerably. Her tits had taken a large share of her newfound girth as well. Truly massive, they'd bulged gelatinously into E cup territory. At least, Cassie thought they had. She'd know for certain in the near future, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie tapped her foot impatiently. \"That's the third break today, Maddie! At this rate, we'll never get anything done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie panted softly, slightly red in the face. \"Sorry! I just need a minute, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie sighed internally. Their progress on this shopping trip had been terrible. Madison's huge thighs slowed her walking speed to a glacial pace as she heavily waddled along. On top of that, she was gaining terrifyingly quickly, and had done zero exercise since her last aborted attempt in November. Cassie had also found out that she'd changed the bulk of her classes to online lessons, so she wasn't even really walking anywhere that wasn't the dining hall or the few classes she couldn't change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this meant that Maddie was woefully ill-equipped to deal with her newfound poundage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on. You're the one who wanted to go clothes shopping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison blushed, feeling a curious mix of elation and despair at the signs of her further gain. \"Hey, you said you needed to go shopping, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Cassie's turn to blush. \"I told you, I was tired of wearing the same old things everyday. Besides, mine wasn't the fat ass that crushed her chair. And the furniture store closes in three hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison grunted as she lifted her heavy body off the bench with noticeable difficulty. \"Alright, alright, fair point. Let's get this over with. Then let's grab some lunch in the food court afterwards; I'm starving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie just rolled her eyes. \"When are you not?\" she muttered under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Madison began to walk towards the clothing shop, Cassie ran her hand along her belt line behind her flabby friend's back. She'd been wearing primarily yoga pants and sweats since the start of the semester, so she'd been somewhat horrified when she'd tried on her jeans and found she'd outgrown them all. This was her largest pair, and she couldn't button or zip them up. She was totally reliant on her belt to keep them on, and she had it on the last loop. If Cassie had had any doubts that she'd gained weight, this was certainly a wake-up call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Still,\"</i> Cassie thought as she watched Madison buy six chili-cheese dogs and a double side of poutine from a nearby stand, <i>\"at least I'll always be skinny next to her.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie felt a little guilty as she thought that, though it did give her enough emotional comfort as she ordered two dogs and a side of poutine of her own...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, I'm so full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't say,\" Cassie said as she rolled her eyes sarcastically. \"What'd you think would happen when you ordered a Dinner for 8 to feed two people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison rubbed her large, swollen belly. \"Says the girl who baked an entire cheesecake for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie blushed a little. \"What can I say, your fans eat this stuff up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie wasn't exaggerating either. Maddie's sales had never been better, and her chair crushing binge was by far her biggest seller. So many treats were rolling in that both girls had to step up their game in order to keep up with the supply. Unfortunately for Madison, her need for new clothes and more food was still outstripping her profits, leaving her trapped in a loop of needing to do more videos to earn more money which she promptly spent on getting fatter, which left her needing more money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison looked sidelong at Cassie as she said that. Though Cassie was primarily the camera girl and editor, Maddie dealt with the fans a lot more through the forums. They'd noticed Cassie's gain, and she was beginning to develop quite the following of her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That's not all she's developing,\"</i> Madison thought as she looked at her friend. Cassie gain was impossible to hide at this point. She'd gained predominantly in her boobs, belly, and butt. Her belly was heart shaped, giving her a double rolled muffin top that was beginning to spread over her lap, hiding the draw string of her sweatpants. Her large breasts were still quite perky, stretching beyond her growing tummy and trying desperately to escape her spaghetti top. As she stood up to go to the fridge, Madison couldn't help but stare at her ass. Her large cheeks overfilled the back of her pants, and as they jiggled as she walked, the tops of each cheek protruding from the top of her sweats. Her love handles were beginning to droop over her belt line now, and Madison suspected that it wouldn't be too much longer before Cassie was properly fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie was still in denial about how bad her gain was, and ignorant of the fact that she had the build of an overfed chicken. \"Well, you'd better make some room. Half this cake is yours, after all...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was Spring Break at Powers University, and the bulk of the student body had left for the week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison had originally planned to head down to Cancun for the week. Her parent's had even purchased her trip as a reward for maintaining an average above 3.5. Of course, that was about 170+ pounds ago. And with so much of her weight going to her ass, hips, and thighs, Maddie wasn't certain she could even fit in a plane seat anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't quite certain she wanted to go to a beach right now, anyway. While she loved the positive attention she got online, and even reveled in the negative attention on campus, she was still not really looking forward to going to a beach where everyone and their dog would be heaping abuse at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNor was she exactly enamored with the idea of going with some of her so-called friends. All the girls had been shocked at the scale of Madison's weight gain. Megan, like Cassie, had been concerned predominantly for health reasons. Unlike Cassie, Megan was a total athlete, and was an endless repository of diet advice and exercise routines. She may have meant well, but Maddie found her exhausting to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was far, far worse. The catty comments and underhanded insults regarding Madison's weight and appearance were endless. Madison would often commit actions to spite Kelly after she'd opened her mouth, like eating a fourth plate at supper, but though she would deny it, she had cried in the privacy of her room a couple times after dealing with the knife-tongued woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst had been when Kelly had out and out stated that Madison was a bad influence on Cassie, since she was now starting to pack on the pounds. Cassie had thankfully not been present. Megan had promptly ripped into Kelly, stating how that was totally an unfair statement. Madison knew Megan was being truthful. Cassie never worked out, ate terribly, and was frankly a bit of a glutton. Associating with Maddie might have sped up the process, but it's very, very likely she would have gained weight as her metabolism slowed without any outside influence. Still, Madison couldn't help with how hard that comment hit her, and she felt very low for the following few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, she was happier staying at campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe travel agency had a pretty good refund policy, giving a full refund on the ticket price and hotel with at least three days notice. Madison, however, had really wanted to go on this trip and her parents knew it. Maddie was going to need a pretty good reason why she didn't go on the trip, and just cashed the ticket. And while it wasn't ideal, Cassie gave Madison the perfect excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie was taken down by a potent strain of the flu only a couple days before the start of break. It had started with only a sore throat, but quickly traveled to her lungs and head, leaving her with a terrible cough, a wicked fever, and a nearly endless headache. She had originally been planning to spend the week off at her parent's farm, but hardly felt up to flying to Kansas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie's need for a nurse was a God-send to Madison. She'd called her parents up and told them what had happened. She put on a decent show of being disappointed, but was honestly trying not to break out smiling. Her folks told her they understood, and were so proud of her for putting a friend's needs over her own wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey might have been less impressed had they known Madison now weighed over 300 pounds, and was fully intending to eat the money she received from the cancelled tickets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie coughed and spoke as Madison hung up the phone. \"I'm sorry you had to cancel your trip over me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison rolled over her new chair over beside the bed. It was an armless and heavily reinforced model, and Maddie took a seat as she answered her friend. \"Don't be. I really wasn't looking forward to going anyway. Could you imagine this ass on a plane?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls laughed, though Cassie's devolved into a coughing fit. Once she cleared her throat, she said, \"Hopefully whoever you sat next to has a thing for asses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd have to be one hell of a fetish, since they'd be under it the whole trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't question any stains on your pants you might encounter afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Ew! Cassie!\" Both girls laughed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they'd settled down, Cassie asked, \"Aren't you worried about getting sick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison shook her head. \"I got a flu shot in October, so I should be good for awhile yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you were a lot smarter then me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that now, Cass. You focus on getting better. I'll get us some supper, though I should warn you, I'm not much of a cook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I can't taste anything. I'm not really that hungry, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not good, Cass. You need to keep your strength up so you can fight this off. You rest for now. I'll grab some food and medicine, then I'll be back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K,\" Cassie answered as Madison heaved her bulk up and headed out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie probably shouldn't have been all that surprised to find out Madison had no cooking skills whatsoever, so she could only attribute her shock at the larger girl coming in with an armload of Styrofoam containers to her illness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you bought enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully,\" Madison said, either ignoring or not catching on the sarcasm. \"I want to make sure I don't need to leave too often, in case you need something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure I'm up for take-out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison grimaced a bit. \"Sorry. I did warn you I wasn't much of a cook. Here, start with the meds, then try to get something down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie nodded weakly, and sat herself up in bed to take a spoonful of the proffered medication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie's flu left her nearly bedridden for two weeks, overlapping into the first week back to classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison did an admirable job as her nurse. She talked with each of Cassie's profs, explaining her absence and getting her homework, and taking them a sick note if they required it. She kept the room stocked with food for the brief moments Cassie was awake and eating, and always made sure she was showering daily and staying hydrated and medicated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was during this time that Maddie was at last truly confronted with just how out of shape she was. Hoofing it around campus was a horribly tiring affair, requiring several breaks and leaving her panting and sweating profusely in short order. There were a couple times that she really, really didn't want to have to stand up after a long day, and only did so through sheer force of will. In the aftermath, her dread regarding her weight gain returned in full force, both because of how hard walking for any length of time had become, and because of how hot she found it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Seriously, what is wrong with me!?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie, meanwhile, under the influence of some fairly strong medication, spent most of her time asleep. During her brief moments of wakefulness, she was generally eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, always eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether it was the medicine acting as an appetite stimulant, her sickness making her delusional over how much she was eating over the day, or a combination of the two, Cassie spent most of her time awake eating awe-inspiring amounts of food. Inevitably, she'd go to sleep with her belly positively packed with food, sleep for a few hours, then awaken to do it all again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt should come as no surprise that Madison, with her eating habits, didn't notice anything wrong with this. Truthfully, she was just grateful that Cassie was eating, though she did have to up the food orders a couple times to keep up with both their appetites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan had come to visit Cassie after she'd gotten back from Mexico. She had to work hard to hide her shock at just how much food was in the room, and the sheer number of empty containers, though she was certainly glad to see her friend was on the mend. Kelly didn't come visit, stating fears of catching Cassie's illness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie was feeling better on Wednesday, but at Madison's insistence, stayed home for the last two days of the week to make sure. Besides, she needed to start getting caught up on her work, and she could do that as well from the comfort of their room as anywhere. As she eased off the medicine, Cassie was a little shocked at how much hungrier she seemed to be. Chalking it up to her recent bout of illness leaving her drained, she did little to curb her newfound appetite, save eat more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, if all one does is eat and sleep for two weeks, you probably shouldn't be surprised when the inevitable happens...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat both girls gained over Spring Break and the first week back in class shouldn't be a surprise. How does Cassie find out?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There had been quite a build up to this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison's new scale had arrived during Cassie's illness, and though she was excited to know for a fact what her progress was, she decided to wait until Cassie was ready to resume her role as camera girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, she'd spent much of the last two weeks online, drumming up excitement among her fan base. Maddie, encouraged somewhat by her fans but mostly of her own initiative, kept herself perpetually stuffed during those two weeks, pushing herself to eat more then ever. She posted a couple selfies and videos to much acclaim, her fans commenting on everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow good she looked (especially her ass).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow fast she was gaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow much better she looked now, and how much better she'd look even fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the brave front she put on, Madison still doubted herself a fair bit. As much as she liked to think she ate herself into a near-coma every meal of her own accord, she felt in her more panic stricken moments that this was definitely not the case. Even during her most recent campus binge, she kept eating long after her mind began begging her to stop, and the feast only ended because the dining hall was closing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd promptly (re: slowly waddled) back to her dorm room to continue the feast there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer midnight snacks had progressed into full meals of their own. If she only ate a couple leftover pizzas and a plate of brownies, it was nothing short of a miracle. She'd also recently purchased a cart, which she loaded with choice morsels before bed. The idea behind it was to allow her to have a midnight snack without leaving her bed. Unfortunately for Maddie, the treats inevitably disappeared before she even closed her eyes, meaning all she'd succeeded in doing was considerably upping her pre-bedtime snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, any chance of Madison being forced to consciously recognize how out of control she is was thoroughly thwarted by her fans' grandiose reactions and positive comments. Maddie, despite her positive qualities, had always been a vain girl and always wanted to be the center of attention. As such, she lapped up every positive word and vibe they said, and her fears of her uncontrollable appetite and meteoric expansion were buried under a new wall of delusions, at least for a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie, in her illness, was mostly in the dark about Madison's new diet. She was almost always asleep when Maddie went to the dining hall or the occasional class, and inevitably joined her for a mutual gorging when they were both awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie was also very much in the dark about her own weight gain. She'd worn nothing but her pajamas for the last two weeks, both pairs of which had been very baggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad being the operative word, mind you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie looked at herself in the mirror, at a total loss for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost people look sick when they're, you know, sick. Thin, pale, sweaty, like they haven't been eating well. Because they haven't. Cassie managed two of the three, but she definitely wasn't thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she was feeling generous, she might have said she looked like she was pregnant, but there was far too much jiggle in that belly for twins to be on the way. No, she was simply, unarguably, fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly had grown too large to be described as a basketball. Perhaps a basketball and a half? It had divided itself from one mass into two large, full rolls. The lower roll was heart shaped and beginning to droop down under its own mass, hinting at the apron belly to come. The top roll was, if anything, larger and heavier, which was not helping matters as it pressed down onto its lower sibling. They stretched right around her torso, leaving her with large love handles and a healthy amount of back fat. Her belly button felt ridiculously deep, and with the help of her new rolls, could easily hide half a pencil in its depths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that she'd gained that knowledge first hand or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie turned around in the mirror, eyeing her enlarged posterior. While she didn't have a shelf booty like Madison, she'd developed quite the bubble butt of her own, and it had taken far more effort then she thought to stuff her cheeks into her stretchy pajama pants. Turning to the front, she saw a far less flattering feature she'd developed. Namely, her pelvic region had grown larger and flabbier as well, giving her what was impolitely referred to as a \"gunt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer largest feature, though, was her breasts. Her bust had borne the brunt of the fatty assault on her body, surging forward like a pair of overfilled water balloons. They easily outclassed every bra she owned, jiggling and wobbling uncontrollably as she walked, much to her private enjoyment. While she loved their size, it was unfortunately all lard, and without a belly like Madison's to help support them, they were already beginning to droop under their sheer girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"How,\"</i> she thought, <i>\"did I get so fat?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer, of course, was staring her in the face. She knew she'd always made terrible choices regarding her diet and total lack of exercise, relying completely on her metabolism to keep her thin and pretty. Then, when issues with Madison started coming to a head, she decided to stuff her like a turkey at Thanksgiving, then upped the ante by making her model her newfound girth to the world. Unfortunately, the plan backfired terribly. Maddie gained weight beyond what she thought was even humanly possible, and by the time Cassie tried to throttle this way back, she was already doing it to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of that, now it was Madison keeping the room permanently supplied with goodies, which Cassie the Compulsive Snacker had happily overindulged in. She had also joined Madison for many of her binges. Honestly, it had proven far too easy to justify. <i>\"Maddie just ate seven burritos, so why would I worry about three?\" \"Those muffins are so good, and if I don't have some more now, I won't have another chance.\" \"Madison says she's too full to keep eating, but if I don't eat it, she'll force herself to and wind up even fatter.\" \"You know what would make this better? Cheesecake.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when signs of her gain were staring her in the face after she outgrew a sizable chunk of her wardrobe, she'd managed to shunt it aside with a \"yeah, I've put on a pound or two, but Madison just burst another pair of pants this week. She's the one with the problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie was really regretting ignoring all the warning signs now. Also, unknown to her, as her consumption was hitting an all-time high, her vaunted metabolism was starting to massively slow down, leaving her far more inclined to gain weight then she had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, there was no more time for such thoughts now. Madison needed Cassie for this, and she was already regretting agreeing to take part in this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie couldn't help but feel better about her own weight, as well as guilty about her role in Maddie's, when she saw her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison looked simply huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hips had again widened, doing everything in their power to make sure doors were Madison's greatest foe. Her shelf booty was even larger, managing to support a large bottle of pop without difficulty for a recent set. While she had still somehow managed to avoid forming a lot of cellulite, her bulbous, jiggly ass had taken on a decidedly rectangular shape as it continued to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thighs, however, still held the top spot for sheer size. Even with her gain, Cassie figured she was still smaller around the waist then Maddie was around her thighs. Their overwhelming girth kept her knees from getting anywhere close to each other, and the oversized appendages made bending her legs very difficult, cementing stairs as her eternal enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison's belly was not to be outdone, however. Her triple rolled gut had expanded in all directions, her rolls most notably growing considerably thicker and wider, and at long last expanding just a hair beyond her boobs. Her breasts had put on some poundage as well, and all this conspired to make bending at the waist very difficult for the poor girl, as there was simply so much of her in the way. Her arms had also fattened considerably, jiggling mightily, though they were not yet large enough to impede any movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, Madison was still very much a bottom-heavy girl, looking like she weighed 250 pounds from the waist up, and far, far larger below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie started filming, and noticed that Maddie was wearing one of the outfits the two had bought together before Spring Break. Her pants looked painted on, and were left undone, as the button and zipper couldn't even come close to each other. The buttons on her shirt were pulled tight, exposing a great deal of caramel skin, and she was again not wearing a bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Jesus Christ! And that's one we intentionally bought too big!\"</i> Cassie thought as Maddie stepped on the scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe UltraStar 440, so named for its maximum weight, calculated for a moment before saying, \"389.2 pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison whooped and Cassie almost dropped the phone in shock. Madison was a far, FAR cry from the 130 pound bombshell she was at the start of college, even stating as much for the camera, with promises of a weight gain progression series to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, it was Cassie's turn. Maddie took the camera, and filmed the glorious moment for all to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scale finally intoned, \"237.2 pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe color drained from Cassie's face. She'd last weighed herself in mid December, and she'd been 148 pounds. She'd gained 89.2 pounds in only a couple months, putting her gain on par with Madison's. Cassie was left speechless, though Maddie managed to fill the silence with the proper verb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy Shit.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>\"Oh, to hell with this!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought, Cassie flopped down on the couch with an audible groan. Her diet and exercise plan had not been going well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, if she was being honest, it was going downright terribly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie's attempts to cut down on her consumption had managed only to make her miserable. Her belly tormented her with awful hunger pains day and night, making sleep near impossible. Her meals felt almost laughably inadequate, and that combined with a total absence of any snacking meant she found concentrating on anything other then her hunger extremely difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, her attempts at exercise had been outright laughable. Cassie hadn't worked out meaningfully since the 10th grade, and years of laziness with her newfound girth meant she'd been a sweaty, incompetent mess after only a few minutes of activity. Worst of all was that she hadn't even been working out that hard, only walking on a treadmill. Today had been only been her third workout attempt, and if anything, she was doing worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grades had also taken a hit. Though she tried to keep it hidden from her friends and family, she was struggling with a couple of her courses. While she'd managed to maintain her minimum GPA up to this point, her workout routine had eaten into her already strained schedule. Less time combined with the aforementioned lack of concentration had seen her outright fail a recent test, and she didn't have high hopes for a recent essay. Without access to her previous means of stress relief, snacking, this only succeeded in making Cassie even more stressed and even less likely to find her way out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps the biggest insult after all of this? Cassie had weighed herself after today's aborted workout, and her weight came back at 241.9 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"All that work, failing my classes, starving all the time, and for what!? To gain five pounds!?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought that it might be gained muscle had crossed Cassie's mind, but was promptly discarded. She hadn't been working out hard enough to gain any muscle, and the extra jiggle from her pelvis, combined with a greater degree of tightness in the front of her pants, left no doubt in her mind what had actually happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Cassie was unaware of it, her consumption of calorific foods and drinks was far higher then she'd thought it was. Even though she had greatly decreased how much she was consuming, it was still well in excess of her daily caloric requirement. Her workout program had simply been a waste of time, only burning a couple hundred calories at most, which she'd then promptly regained in excess with her exercise day rewards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all that, Cassie was done with this. <i>\"What's the point of trying to lose weight and failing out of college if I can't lose the weight anyway?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie's mental rant was interrupted by the arrival of Madison. Her slow, heavy, plodding footsteps announced her presence as surely as her heavy breathing. She flopped down on the other couch in a tidal wave of fat. The other couch groaned under such a degree of abuse, but for now held up the gigantic girl. The rapid surge of lard had hit her suffering pants with more force then they could sustain, and the button on her pants popped off and shot across the room, hitting the wall with a loud crack. Cassie jumped as Maddie rubbed her newly freed gut. An angry, red line ran around her lowest roll, clearly showing how tight her pants had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! *gasp, gasp* My bigger *gasp* pants are in *gasp, gasp* the wash.\" The fate of these pants had been sealed earlier in the day. Alongside her campus meals, Maddie had eaten McDonald's five times that day, and the same meal each time - a double quarter pounder with cheese, a large fries, a large chocolate milkshake, and three triple berry pies, at 3400 calories and 150 grams of fat per meal, or 17,000 calories and 750 grams of fat total.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison wiped her brow, and her skin glistened with a sheen of sweat. \"Three stair cases is ridiculous. They've got to fix that elevator.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie watched as Madison ate a chocolate bar she produced from somewhere. Her stomach growled loud enough to echo in the small room, causing Maddie to look her way and giggle slightly. Cassie looked down at her oversized boobs and the flabby gut beyond it. Rubbing her stomach, she reached a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Maddie, do you want to order something to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison swallowed the last bite of her bar, and looked over at Cassie. \"Sure! But what about your diet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw the diet! I'm starving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie smiled as pulled her phone out of her bra. \"Good enough for me! So, what do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree days later, Cassie landed heavily in bed, her jiggly belly packed solid with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last three days had been a non-stop gorging session. Even working on class work had seen Cassie swallowing treats as fast as she could open them, and she'd been joining Madison for her evening binge, leaving her totally stuffed each night. The fact that Maddie continued eating even after Cassie called it a night was nearly mind boggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight had been no exception. Madison had ordered six extra large pizzas for the two young women. Cassie had eaten a ton but felt like she'd barely made a dent in the mountain of food before she was too stuffed to continue, leaving the remainder to Maddie who refused to stop until it was done or she passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie tried to rub her rock-hard belly, failing to ease its stiffness more then a little. She knew eating like this wasn't a great idea on her part, but she finally felt halfway normal and more confident in her ability to handle classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed her clothes off the bed. Already, she'd burst a bra and overstretched her spaghetti-strapped top. She thought, <i>\"Yeah, there's no way I won't gain weight from this. Still, it's just til I get my grades back under control, and I'll always be so skinny next to Maddie. The site's doing better then ever since I joined in, too. Besides, it's not like I'm going to get that fat...\"</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To Madison's surprise, the gifts kept coming in; each day she would open the door and find a new box of treats waiting for her. Still locked in isolation, she found herself constantly snacking on the sugary treats her admirers lavished upon her as she lounged around the apartment. She constantly had something in her mouth, and as soon as she confessed that the krispy kreme doughnuts were her favorites, the packages increased tenfold. As a thankyou to the gift givers on the forums, Madison began to post more revealing pictures; showing off her belly, unbuttoning her pants and eventually just lying in her underwear. She filmed herself eating whenever she could, and was now raking in even more money as she showed more flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe compliments kept coming; \"you look more beautiful with each set!\", \"love that big belly!\" and \"OMG YOU'RE GORGEOUS!\" were just a few of the messages she received. Madison was so happy with the recent feedback that she decide to do something she had never done before...a fully nude set. It was a little daunting at first, but as soon as her clothes were off, it was easy enough; she lay on her back, covered her boobs with her arm, struck some sexy poses and filmed herself eating and rubbing her stuffed belly. When she uploaded the new set, the forums went crazy. She had set the price a little higher for her nude pics, but it seemed as though everyone was more than happy to pay the increased price. She checked her funds at the end of the day and her jaw dropped - she had earned 2000 dollars! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison couldn't believe it. She had never earned this much before. And in just one day! She was thinking about posting another video when she heard the door open. She quickly pulled her sweats back on and went to greet Cassie, who was standing in the kitchen snacking on a doughnut Madison had left out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...Mads...you really need to stop all these deliveries,\" Cassie said, her mouth full. \"We're running out of room.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison watched curiously as Cassie finished off her doughnut and immediately grabbed another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...I love krispy kreme,\" Cassie said absent mindedly as she poured herself a glass of milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry...I'll tell them to ease off...\" Madison replied. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite her promise to Cassie, Madison ended up not telling her followers to knock off the treats. Sure, they slowed down, but every few days another few packages of doughnuts arrived. A week had passed since the cafeteria incident, and Madison had started going to classes again. With the extra money she had earned, she had been able to order a whole new wardrobe and was actually wearing clothes that fit for a change - to her relief, nobody really seemed to remember her embarrassment last week, and if they did, they had been pretty sympathetic and blamed it on the college lifestyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing back to class had also forced her to cut down on the constant eating and snacking that came with being a shut-in. She was still taking pictures for the site, but her stuffing shoots had stopped for the moment. She didn't want to outgrow any more clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had the unintentional effect of causing all the gift packages to pile up, and when Madison wasn't around, Cassie had started helping herself. Whenever she was studying, she would have a box of doughnuts open. Late at night, she would be eating from a pack of pop tarts. When she came out of the shower, she would be snacking from a bag of M and M's. With all the work she had missed, Madison was finding herself studying more and eating less, which left more for Cassie, who didn't seem to realize quite how much she was consuming on a daily basis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison continued taking her raunchy photo sets when Cassie was out - her newest video, a striptease that ended with her jiggling her fat belly at the camera, had earned her another few hundred dollars, and her naked pics were selling for five dollars a piece. She was enjoying the attention and the compliments more than ever. They had also started asking her for home made videos, which usually consisted of a fantasy they wanted her to act out; Madison was happy to oblige, and in the past week she had made a video in which she complained about being too fat, talked about wanting to be the fattest girl in the world and dressed up in a golden bikini that was two sizes too small. It just brought more and more money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEager to check on what Madison was up to, Cassie checked the forums late at night, sitting at the kitchen table eating leftover Pizza in the dark, with only her laptop providing a glow. She saw a few of Madison's latest pictures and was amazed by how big her room mate had become. Then she saw the prices of the clips...and a naked photo...her jaw dropped. Madison must have been making a fortune here! Cassi grabbed a doughnut and stuffed it into her mouth whole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They really need to stop it with the food packages...\" Cassie thought to herself, before looking down and noticing her rather bloated looking belly. \"<i>I </i>might need to stop too.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next two weeks went by as normal for Madison, who had actually managed to hold back her weight gain, although she hadn't lose a single pound either. That was to be expected though; she wasn't exactly exercising, and she didn't feel confident enough to return to the gym looking as big as she did now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the money she had been making, she had been thinking about ordering an exercise bike or something so she wouldn't have to leave the dorm, but had ended up spending most of her money on new outfits. She was grateful not to be outgrowing anything anymore, because she had a wardrobe full of old clothes that were now completely useless, but she was determined to fit into again at some point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie, meanwhile, was actually beginning to gain a little weight. The constant snacking and influx of treats into the dorm had started having an impact on her waistline, and her flat stomach had started softening and growing. Madison had caught her the other day struggling to button up her skinny jeans, and the day before that, she had walked in on Cassie rubbing a very bloated looking stomach while an empty box of Krispy Kreme doughnuts lay on the table in front of her. Cassie had looked very embarrassed and hurried back to her room, but not before grabbing an extra doughnut to munch on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison pulled on her clothes, did her make up and got ready to go to class. She might have been fat now, but with her new clothes she looked fashionable and stylish. She walked into the kitchen to find Cassie eating one of three pop tarts she had prepared. Cassie's shirt was a little tight across the chest, and Madisons caught sight of a roll of flab as she turned in her seat to saw good morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pop tart?\" Cassie offered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah I'm good,\" Madison replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That new set you uploaded to the site last night has already made us over two hundred dollars,\" Cassie said, finishing off her first pop tart before starting on the second. \"Nice work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Madison replied. Truth be told, she was kind of regretting giving Cassie a cut of her profits; other than setting up the website, she had barely contributed, and it was Madison's body that brought in the cash. \"You coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be along in a sec,\" Cassie said, still eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison shrugged and went on to class.

She had been studying in the library for most of the night for an exam she had in a few days time, and unfortunately the vending machines there were all out of order. As a result she had missed dinner and tried to put her hunger out of her mind through cramming, but eventually it had caught up to her and now she was absolutely starving. She really regretted not just stuffing a box of doughnuts or a bag of skittles into her bag before she left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe practically burst into the apartment, absolutely ravenous, but as soon as she closed the door behind her, the smell of Italian food hit her. She walked into the kitchen and saw three empty pizza boxes and a stray french fry on a greasy plate. Maybe Cassie had had some friends round? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRRP!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was startled by a loud belch to her left. She walked over to the couch and found Cassie lying there on her back. \"Cass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh uh...hey Maddie...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie went red with embarrassment as she stared up at her roommate. Her shirt was pulled up to just beneath her breasts, exposing a very round, very bloated belly. Another pizza box lay on the floor beside her, with a single slice of pizza remaining. Her jeans were unbuttoned, giving Madison a look at her pink panties. She had never seen Cassie in this state before; she had always been slender and rarely overate. To see her looking so stuffed and gluttonous was quite a shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ordered Pizza huh?\" Madison asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What gave me away?\" Cassie blushed. \"I forgot you were studying and well...I ended up eating the extras. Sorry I didn't save you any.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's cool,\" Madison said, although her stomach rumbled noisily at that very moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie sat up slowly and swung her legs over the side of the couch, her belly resting in her lap. She groaned and pulled her shirt down, but it did very little to disguise her bulging belly. \"I don't know whats wrong with me lately, my appetite has gone crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I'm in no position to judge,\" Madison smiled. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, Madison and Cassi checked to see the feedback to Cassi's first photoshoot on the website; Cassi was feeling nervous, and in truth, was starting to regret the whole thing. It had seemed like a good idea last night, but she was beginning to feel like she should have slept on it, because now she felt a little foolish. Madison was the one who was supposed to be getting fat, not her, but she could not deny her recent weight gain - that kind of denial had lead to Madison becoming the chubby girl she was today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison scrolled down to Cassi's set, and Cassi winced as she saw the pictures. They weren't exactly pornographic, but it was more skin than she would usually show. Madison had cropped her face out to grant her some privacy, at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...here we go...have a read,\" Madison turned the laptop around and left Cassi to read the comments while she finished her breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi's eyes scanned the page; there was over one hundred posts! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wow, she has a great body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love that cute little belly!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be rubbing off on your sexy roommate ;)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"can't wait to see more of her bloated belly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"she is gorgeous, wish we could see her face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She looks ready to pop. Sexy belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PREGNANT. Calling it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as hot as Madison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too skinny for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison's belly is way sexier. This girl needs to get bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So hot. Look at her little pot belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More please!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi read the comments with increasing eagerness; there were a few naysayers who claimed she wasn't as hot as Madison and needed to get bigger, but most of the feedback was extremely positive. She looked up at Madison, who was eating a bacon sandwich opposite her. \"Wow, they seem to like them!\" She smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did many people buy the set?\" Madison asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi checked their funds and her eyes lit up. \"Oh my God, three hundred dollars already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Madison said. \"You must have made quite an impression!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Cassi didn't feel so anxious. Three hundred dollars just for eating more than normal? That was a pretty sweet deal. Cassi had no intention of gaining weight for these people as Madison had done, but a big dinner here and there and a quick snap of her bloated stomach was more than worth the money it would bring in. Perhaps she could even make a little more if she showed her face? She might even be able to fill a gap in the market, now that Madison had slowed down her gaining she could be the smaller, less flabby alternative. Cassi grabbed a doughnut while she pondered her options, absent mindedly rubbing her soft belly...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It came down to the money. All other things were even for her. Cassi was pretty confident that she was not going to gain much weight, especially if she kept the photo sets few and far between, but she liked the excitement of putting the photos up, and loved the attention. At the same time, she still wondered if these photos would ever come back to haunt her? What if her digital life ever intersected with her physical reality. They certainly had in Madison's case, she thought, looking at her roommate and the job she had done on her own body. However, the money was good, and she was sure it would stay under control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the decision had been made to go ahead and do the photos, the following evening, Cassi ordered in a huge amount of food, and consumed an entire large pizza for herself. She had always enjoyed pizza, and wanted more, but for obvious reasons stopped after a few pieces. This time, she had no such limitation. After the greasy pizza was finished, Cassi walked over to her closet and flipped through dresses, settling on one she thought was pretty sexy from the summer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pink, strapless, and short. It previously hugged her somewhat non-existent curves, but now, it showed how much softer her butt and belly had become. Pulling it on, Cassi realized she would never actually wear it out in public like this. It was far too tight now, with the growth in her stomach painfully obvious, and from the side, nearly comical. <i>Perfect!</i> she thought to herself. She then walked back into the living space, and let Madison know, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mad, ready for the shoot!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison rose from her nap, somewhat groggy, but then alert when she was greeted with the show of Cassi in a far too tight dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, that's....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this better make us some money. The theme is going to be 'I went overboard at date night' and make it look like I'm just coming back from a resturant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so,\" Madison said, grabbing the camera and getting the shoot ready. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite her confidence that she could control her weight, Cassi steadily began to pile on the pounds. Every night she and Madison would do a photo shoot each, uploading their pictures onto the website to their eager groups of fans. Cassi had attracted a slightly different crowd, who preferred her more slender appearance to Madison's plumpness - and they loved to see her after a big meal, exposing her belly, sticking it out, rubbing it seductively...as long as they got belly, they were happy to keep paying. Madison was still making the most money, but Cassi was raking in enough now that she had decided not to take any cuts from her room mate's profits, as per the original agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mounting adoration she received online was enough to keep Cassi addicted to picture taking; she would use her phone to snap a quick shot of her belly if she was out partying, or at a restaurant, or even sometimes in class. When she got home to the dorm, she would do another, more professional set of pictures, usually after a huge meal. Her stuffing food of choice was Pizza, both because she loved Italian food and because the double crust tended to make her stomach look bigger. Cassi was convinced that these eating sessions were not effecting her weight, and that the constant tightness of her pants and shirts were simply because she was bloated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison, on the other hand, had stopped her own food stuffing sessions; her belly was already big enough, and her fans didn't really seem to be encouraging her to gain any more. Most just loved seeing her curves, and the excessive gifts had stopped about a week ago. This had caused Madison to drastically cut down on the amount of food she was eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne morning, Madison's sleep was disturbed by Cassi barging into her room. She groaned and stretched out in her bed, rubbing her eyes and staring at the alarm clock before realizing she didn't even have a class this morning. \"Cassi? Hmm...what is it? I don't have to be up for another few hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi was dressed in a white tank top that was pulled up above her softer belly, and a pair of bright pink panties. She walked over to Madison and poked a finger into her stomach. \"Mads, this is bad...I've gained the freshman fifteen!\" She exclaimed, prodding her belly as though she didn't believe it was real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison had to struggle to look surprised. She had seen the signs over the past two or three weeks; Cassi had been eating almost non stop, bloating herself larger and larger for her fanbase and going to bed on a full stomach. Madison had noticed her pants getting tighter and her shirts getting a little snug, but Cassi had spent so much time with a full, bloated stomach that she hadn't really realized that her room mate was actually gaining weight. It had started the same way for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow, are you sure?\" Madison feigned surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just weighed myself!\" Cassi said, holding her pudgy belly in her hands. It wasn't a pot belly yet, but it had a definite bulge that hadn't been there before, and was clearly flabbier than normal. \"I didn't realize I was packing so much on. Ugh...it's all gone straight to my belly and butt.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your butt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi turned around for emphasis and gave Madison a good look at her behind, which was straining her panties and seemed twice as big as usual. She turned back around and sighed. \"I think I might have to cut down on all these photoshoots.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" Madison said. \"The same thing happened to me. I didn't realize how much I was gaining when I started out. I did warn you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi nodded. \"You did,\" she said. \"I just didn't realize until this morning. I was trying to squeeze into a pair of jeans and my ass wouldn't fit! When I finally wriggled into them I couldn't even button them past my belly.\" She gave her stomach a jiggle for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least you realized early,\" Madison said. \"I didn't wake up until I got this big pot belly.\" She pulled back the bed covers and revealed her big gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I should stop uploading pics for a while...\" Cassi said, almost sadly. </span></div></div>",

She knew Madison had stopped the gain, but that didn't mean she wasn't still huge. Cassi suspected that Madison was in the upper 260s, and from her shirt labels, saw that Madison wore a 1XL shirt, somewhat tightly. On top of that, she knew that Madison was wearing size 24 pants, far past what any of the stores she used to love shopping at went to. It almost seemed like with her growing size, Madison did not even care about fashion anymore, or had at least momentarily stopped trying. Cassi looked to her own pants, which had gotten too tight, did she really want to go down this path as well? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right. Want to start working out?\" she asked Madison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" Madison asked, somewhat wondering how she would be able to do that without huge amounts of ridicule from the crowd of gym people. \"I don't even know where I would begin to start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, we're in this together,\" Cassi said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison thought about it some more, Cassi at this point was pretty much the only person who she was truly friends with anymore on campus. Sure, others were polite to her, or talked to her in class after her return, but never because they actually wanted to be friends with her, but rather just to fill pleasantries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Madison replied. \"Do they even sell athletic clothes in my size?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo that, Cassi could only shrugged and pulled out her laptop. After they got online, they realized there were an abundance of options, making Madison feel a little less insecure about her current state. However, neither of them wanted to fork out the money for expedited shipping, meaning a delay of around 1 week at the least, and maybe longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they got the conformation email, Cassi brought something up, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...maybe I can do photo sets until your clothes come?\" She asked Madison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassi!\" Madison said back, incredioulus that they had made this decision and now Cassi seemed willing to go backwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no, we can still do the workout plan,\" she said, \"but I just really like the money! I'll do a few last sets over the next few weeks, and then that can hold me over while we work out to lose the weight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison didn't think Cassi's plan was smart, however, another issue arose. Cassi could probably lose the weight over a semester, hers would take years, if it was even possible, Madison thought to herself. While she was completing this thought, she realized Cassi was ordering a 4 portions of Chinese food. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"URRRRRRRRRRP!\" Cassi's huge belch seemed to echo through the dorm room as she sat back on the couch cradling her overstuffed belly in her hands. Madison stood opposite her with a video camera, filming the latest of her videos for the website. Cassi was in only her underwear, looking extremely bloated. She had been shooting for the site for a whole two weeks now, and the money kept flowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison had tried to advise her against this after the first week, but Cassi hadn't listened. The larger workout clothes they had ordered for Madison hadn't arrived yet, and the company had sent an email informing them that it would be at least another week. The delay had meant that Cassi kept doing her photo sets and videos. Like Madison, she had grown more adventurous the more feedback she received; and had started doing underwear shots some time last week. When these proved to be a big success, she had started making her videos more sexy; rubbing her belly and moaning as she stripped out of her clothes. Madison had been filming most of it for her, and was actually starting to get a little uncomfortable with the whole thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We done?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi nodded and patted her full stomach in satisfaction. \"Ugh...I think I'm going to burst...\" she moaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you can stop this now,\" Madison said. \"If you keep eating like you did tonight you'll end up buying your own set of workout clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm good,\" Cassi replied, groaning as she rose from the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi kept saying that, but Madison had started to notice her roommate was gradually starting to soften up. Her stomach's permanent bulge had grown bigger, and while she didn't eat as much as Madison used to, the amount of food she put away during her shoots had grown larger and larger. With the amount of money she was making, she could afford bigger portions now, and her belly seemed to grow bigger every night. Cassi walked to the kitchen and grabbed a can of coke from the fridge, standing there in her skimpy red underwear and rubbing her distended belly with her one free hand. The underwear was looking a little snug as well, Madison thought; Cassi was no longer the skinny girl she had been at the start of the year. Her body had grown more curvy and womanly over the last few weeks, and Madison could have sworn her butt had grown wider lately. Her breasts were definitely bigger than they used to be too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison, meanwhile, was still stuck at 265 pounds. She had been trying to diet the past two weeks, and it was a painful experience, but she had done pretty well overall and managed to lose two pounds, at least. It barely made a difference to her appearance, but it made her feel better. Avoiding the website had proved to be a good thing too, as she no longer felt tempted to stuff herself for her followers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, when Madison had gone to bed, Cassi lay alone on the couch, the camera set up opposite her. She had wanted some privacy to do a very special video shoot, and once Madison was asleep, it was impossible to wake her, so she figured now was a good time. Dimming the lights slightly, she sat directly opposite the camera, on the edge of the seat wearing a silk bathrobe. She switched the camera on and smiled into the lens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys...\" she said in a sultry tone. \"I was so full after my feast earlier that I just had to sit here for a while and let it go down...but then I got hungry again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Madison had gone to bed, Cassi had eaten a whole tub of ice cream and a tube of cookie dough, and washed it down with a litre of coke. This had resulted in her already bloated belly expanding even more. Slowly, she undid the sash of her robe and pulled it open, revealing her huge, stuffed stomach and red underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sooooooo full...this underwear is going to pop off in a minute...\" Cassi moaned, feigning a look of concern. She then reached up and unclasped her bra, letting her breasts fall out before she tossed it to the ground. \"Much better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the first time she had gone topless, and it felt good. Exciting, even. She then stood up and yanked her panties down in one swift motion, before sitting back down, stark naked, grinning at her own fullness and nudity. \"Mmm...that feels good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi went on for another five minutes, exposing her butt, rubbing her breasts, massaging her stomach and even doing a little dance. She uploaded the video and put her robe back on before heading to bed. She was really loving all the attention she was getting, not to mention the money. </span></div></div>",

She paused for a second, realizing that Cassi must have uploaded the uploaded another video, and apparently, a very good one. She proceeded to check the email account they set up for the videos and could not believe some of the comments they were getting. People writing their arousal by the videos, begging her to do more like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, I have to see this.</i> Madison thought, logging on to the backend of the website and using their log in. Madison watched, shocked to see Cassi showing this kind of erotic nature, and then even more shocked when she saw Cassi in the nude. They had even gone to some extent to cover up around each other in the room out of courtesy, and now she was doing this for complete strangers. <i>What if someone they knew found this video? </i> Madison thought to herself. Did Cassi not think of the repercussions of taking these videos to the next level? However, Madison could not deny some kind of pull this video in particular had, seeing Cassi's bloated body in this state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she went to put clothes on, Madison hoped that this was the end of these videos for Cassi. The clothes still had a few days until they shifted, and the last thing that she wanted was her roommate being in the current state she was in. She looked at her size 24 underpants, just the amount of fabric in them still surprised her, but she knew they were necessary to contain her fleshy thighs and butt. <i>How could Cassi risk turning into me?</i> she thought. However, at the same time, part of her wanted to see Cassi blowup, just so she had someone to work off of the weight with, or at least know what she was going through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, Cassi woke up, and saw her massive haul online. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison! I made a ton of money from a video I uploaded last night!\" She nearly screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I saw it.\" Madison said, somewhat monotone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you would be more excited about this.\" Cassi said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm happy for you, I just want to make sure you don't let this get out of hand.\" Madison said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still watching it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you?\" Madison said. Cassi knew what Madison was implying. She just assumed that Madison had become jealous and walked into the bathroom to shower, thinking about what to spend her newly acquired money on. As she lathered, she noticed that she indeed felt softer, and wondered if Madison had a point. Her stomach, even when she tried to suck in, seemed to just stick out a bit, and she didn't remember her legs rubbing together this much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she got out of the shower, she stepped on the scale, and saw she had gained another 10 pounds. Hardly shocking with her current food intake, but still bad news. \"Crap,\" Cassi quietly said out-loud, \"if I don't watch out, I'm going to look like Madison soon.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One week later, the workout clothes were finally delivered. During that time, Cassi had done little to alter her nightly routine of eating, posing and videoing herself, but Madison had been very careful about what she ate. In preparation for her new fitness regime, she had been eating salads all week, and going for night time walks around the campus. Madison excitedly unwrapped the parcel and brought it into the kitchen in the morning, hastily unwrapping the box and picking out her workout gear; it was sleek and fashionable, a form fitting jumpsuit that fit her body size exactly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassi! Wake up! The workout gear is here!\" She called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the bedroom came Cassi in her pyjamas; a pair of shorts and a t-shirt that looked a size too small for her. She had been packing on the pounds over the last month or so, but had not really admitted it to herself. Her freshman fifteen was definitely showing today though. \"Finally,\" she sighed, walking over and pulling her own jumpsuit out of the box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's try them on, I want to get going,\" Madison grinned as she darted back into her room. She quickly undressed, for once not really that bothered by her flabby figure, and pulled on the workout clothes. They fit perfectly, though when she looked in the mirror, she saw that they left little to the imagination...but what did that matter? If they were loose they wouldn't really have the same effect. Feeling happy with her purchase, she stepped back into the kitchen, where Cassi was standing with her back to her. \"Well? What do you think?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi turned around, red faced. The zipper of her top was stuck just beneath her breasts, creating an impressive display of cleavage, and the gear was so tight on her that it looked ready to burst. \"Ermm...I think I may have ordered a size too small...\" Cassi said sheepishly. </span></div></div>",

I'll just order another size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison frowned. \"But that could take another two weeks to get here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...sorry Mads,\" Cassi said. \"But I obviously ordered the wrong size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison shook her head, wondering how Cassi could be so oblivious. \"Okay, fine, but order your new gear quick. I'm going for that jog on my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck!\" Cassi called, as Madison began to jog out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was alone, Cassi slumped down onto the couch with a groan. The jumpsuit creaked audibly around her heavier body, stretching so tight that she could barely move. She didn't want to admit anything to Madison, but she knew she had packed on a few pounds and outgrown the old size - she would order a new one later, but at the moment she wasn't quite ready to officially select two sizes up from her normal clothes. Besides, she might even have slimmed down by the time it arrived. Maybe it wasn't worth wasting money on a new jumpsuit when she could just diet? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi sighed and reached for the jumbo bag of Doritos she had left by the couch. As she did, she caught sight of her reflection in the TV and saw how tight that suit looked...which gave her an idea. Quickly, she grabbed her camera and started recording another video. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooo...my new jumpsuit arrived today...but I'm sooooooooo big it doesn't quite fit me...\" she rubbed her hands over her bulging belly and slowly lowered the zip down over her breasts until they bulged free. \"Mmmm...that's better.\" She didn't stop with the tease until the suit was on the floor and she was reclining naked on the couch rubbing her chubby little belly. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat running down her face, Madison was embarrassed to be audibly groaning as she ran across campus, but she was trying to push herself further than she ever had before. Well, before she had gained weight anyway. She didn't want to look at her running app on her phone to see how far she had gone until she was done with her workout, but it had to be longer than 2 miles right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs sweat dripped down her forehead, Madison also felt how wet her double chin had become, and how uncomfortable even her new meshy workout suit felt with her rolls sticking to the fabric. The old Madison Kraft made workout look easy, even graceful, the new one made looked like an uncommitted fat girl, deciding she would work out for the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison decided to walk for a bit, and then get try to jog again, making it past only 3 more buildings on campus before having to walk again. As she started walking, she saw two fit students who looked older, possibly grad students, run by. Their sleek bodies in their loose workout closing caused her deep envy. <i>How did I throw that all away?</i> she thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she started her walk back to the dorm room, Madison took her phone out of her pocked to see how far she had gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<i>.9 MI</i>--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gapsed. Not even a mile? She previously was doing nearly 4 per day before she came to college. Huffing up the stairs to the dorm, Madison promptly walked past Cassi to the bathroom to get on the scale. She had been trying to workout and watch what she ate, and hoped there would be some effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<i>263.9 lbs</i>--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ugh.</i>, she thought to herself. Two weeks, for only two pounds. It was finally setting in on Madison. She had radically changed her body with her gluttony, and it would take an incredible amount of hard work to ever shed her obesity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Madison didn't stop to talk, she didn't see what Cassi was doing on her laptop. However, she would not have been surprised if she did, since Cassi was uploading yet another video. This time, she wore an old soccer jersey, nearly bursting out of it, and slowly stripped to a far too tight sports bra, and panties that had nearly been turned into a thong by her growing heft. While still nearly one hundred pounds less than Madison, Cassi had spent her last two weeks without any of the concerns Madison had. She was only fixated on the dollar amount that seemed to grow in her account every time she posted a new video. For a girl who never seemed to have tons of money growing up, the thrill of this easy money was far too much for Cassi to resist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose watching the videos were seeing a transformation that would have alarmed nearly any other college girl. Her belly was becoming huge, filling out any shirt, and now spilling on to her thighs when she sat down. Speaking of her thighs, those were now starting to plump up with the rest of her, filling out to support a butt that was starting to become dimpled. Above her belly, her boobs seemed to only get bigger, but proportionally didn't look much larger due to her plumping arms. Cassi may not have been 'Madison fat' a term that had quickly entered the Powers University vernacular, but she was certainly cruising down that road.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Madison waited impatiently in line, still pouting from the comments Jessica made. Suddenly, her belly rumbled, causing her to receive looks from the other people in line. \"Someone's hungry\" cracked the lady behind her. In Miami, Madison would never go to McDonald's, often making fun of the people who went there. Earlier in the year Madison looked out of place at a McDonald's, with her perfectly fit body and designer clothes. But now Madison was a regular, eating there at least a few times a week. When she finally made it to the front of the line, Madison got her usual order, a large Big Mac meal, but also added a ten-piece nugget and a large milkshake. She then found a table in the back and scarfed down her meal. Comfort eating was a regular habit for Madison. Whenever she received a bad grade, or was just having a bad day, Madison would eat her sadness, causing her to pack on the pounds. While polishing of her nuggets, she spied a fit girl staring disapprovingly at her belly. She looked down to see her shirt had ridden up, revealing her soft, round belly, sagging over the waistband of her sweatpants. She quickly pulled her shirt down, which now struggled to cover her belly-button. Thoroughly embarrassed, she threw away her trash and left for the bus stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was walking to the stop, she looked at her phone and realized that the bus was coming in one minute. She then started to run as fast as she could for the stop. In seconds she was breathing heavy, as her fat body jiggled with each step she took. Her fleshy belly once again popped out from under her shirt, and her boobs bounced. She made it to the stop just in time, and walked on to the bus and took her seat. Her face was beat red and she was breathing really heavily. Her thighs pushed against the fabric on her sweatpants, struggling for space, spilling over the sides of her seat. She pulled out a candy bar from her bag to recover from her run. She tore open the wrapper and ate the bar in only two bites. She then stood up and walked to the trash can to throw away the wrapper. She then heard someone say, \"Damn, you got a fat ass\" behind her. \"What did you say?\" Madison asked as she turned around. The guy replied, \"You're chunky, but you got a nice ass\". \"Thanks creep\" she said as she sat back down in her seat. No one had ever called her fat before. She then wondered if her ass was really that big. Over the weeks, a lot of fat had collected on her butt, making her have to buy new panties. In reality her butt was huge, although it had collected a lot of cellulite. When she finally got back to her dorm, she snacked on some ice cream that Cassie had bought while studying before falling asleep. Cassie then got out of bed and...</span></div></div>",

Over the past few months, Cassi felt like more and more people were talking to her, and they were, but many wanted to still talk about her roommate. For a college the size of Powers, a girl like Madison's weight gain was sure to go talked about amongst the people who went out and partied with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor girls, Madison was a favorite conversation topic. Many of them had been jealous of her at the beginning of the year, and they now delighted in her struggle. For some of the more shallow ones, they would often pretend to feel bad for her in conversation, but even the nicest girls treated it with in difference. Many just joked about her and saw it as a cautionary tale about college food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor guys, Madison had undergone something of a complete transformation. When she got there, she was a major hottie, and many guys thought she was out of their leagues. Some of the ones with self esteem issues were initially happy when she gained a bit of weight, since it would knock her into their league, but now, she was a punchline. Guys would always wonder how a girl could let that happen to herself. It almost would have been better if Madison had come to Powers in her current size, because then so many people would not have gone out of their way to talk to her and she could have avoided the current role that she played in the university's social hierarchy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, Cassi wanted this to continue, so during the day, she had gone to the store, and gotten some special protein powder that she had read about online. It was like normal powder, except it was nearly tasteless, for this she paid more, but she told herself that it was worth it, since Madison would notice if her water suddenly tasted like the usually nasty powder. That night, after Madison went to bed, Cassi dumped in two scopes into the hard plastic bottle that Madison drank out of during the day. Little did Madison know, Cassi would continue this routine each night, and as she drank her water throughout the day, she was adding an extra thousand, or more, calories to her diet. </span></div></div>",

The effects of the powder had an immediate impact on Madison's weight. She struggled to fit into even her largest stretch pants. It just wouldn't get over her expansive hips and thighs. Try as she might, the extra 10 pounds she's accumulated over the last few weeks was just too much. Cassie watched with a chuckle as she witnesses Madison wiggling on her bed desperately trying to pull her pants past her ass. Now pushing 195 pounds, Madison was officially exiting the chubby phase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith enough wiggling Madison managed to barely pull her pants up high enough to be deemed decent looking. She worked up a sweat and took a swig of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie, I think I need some new clothes\" said Madison<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie figured it would be a hoot to go clothes shopping with Madison, so off they went to the mall to get Madison a new wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what's going on Cassie.\" said Madison \"I started exercising more, I tried to eat less, but here I am still looking to yet again go up another size. I don't know what's wrong with me...ooh this place has a McDonalds! Ohh..no I should be looking for some new clothes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie played along and enticed Madison to order some food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come'on it's not like the mall is closing anytime soon. We can make a stop.\" said Cassie<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls ordered food at the McDonalds. Madison had 2 big macs and a large fry, while Cassie went with a somewhat sweet salad. Madison inhaled her burgers and fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what came over me\" said Madison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We I don't know about you, but I think I need to get some froyo.\" said Cassie<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I probably shouldn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When do you get the chance to get froyo by the pound? This stuff is great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...ok...maybe just a little\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison of course got in a little over her head and bought far too much froyo that was dipped in chocolate sauce and caramel. The two girls returned to their seats to eat. Madison's pace of eating was slowing down as she started to reach her limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I can finish this\" said Madison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense!\" Cassie retorted \"You have to live it up. How often are we going to get this froyo!? Listen finish up here. I'm going to grab some cinnibuns for the dorm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison finished up her froyo much to the dismay of her stomach. She was already past the point of full when Cassie showed up with a dozen cinnibuns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They had a great deal for a bakers dozen. I couldn't resist! Want one?\" said Cassie. The aroma of sweet pastries lingered over Madison. She couldn't resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one and that's it!\" replied Madison. Only it was just one. As the girls shopped, one became two, which became 4. Madison couldn't stop. Well past the point of satisfaction, she was eating out of pure gluttony. Cassie had one just to play along, but the rest were for Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez all that cinnamon and sugar sure does make one thirsty. Let's stop and get a shake.\" While Madison thought it was a bad idea, the buns were making her a bit parched. And so Madison sat back down and proceeded to down a large chocolate shake and cinnibuns despite the protest of her stomach. Cassi encouraged and watched on as Madison pushed her limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ughh what is wrong with me?</i> Madison thought to herself <i>I can't stop!</i> And she didn't. Her stomach expanded beyond the confines of her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRIIIIIIIIIIPPPPP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elastic on her pants gave way setting Madison's stomach free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God!\" Madison said as she shot up. The quick movement didn't do her any justice. The sheer force of her jello like ass caused her panties to tear. Madison was a sight. She was holding her pants up with one hand still grasping the milkshake. Cassi knew Madison lacked self control, but what she witnessed was something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to get to a clothing store...right!...now!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was her guess that Madison may have been able to resist the temptation had she lived alone, but with her already week willed demeanor, shattered confidence from the weight gain, and a roommate willing to take advantage of these things, Madison's attempts to curtail her expansive dietary habits did not stand much of a chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi could not help but snicker when Madison would put on her workout gear, now in a size L, and went down to the gym. <i>If only she knew how futile these efforts are</i> Cassi thought to herself, as she would put powder into the very bottle that Madison was taking to the gym with her. To make matters worse for her physique, Madison would get back exhausted, shower, and then usually dive back into another treat that Cassi had brought back into the room, or another greasy meal of take-out food. Cassi suspected that the weight would come even if Madison was eating right, due to the powder, but with that and her eating, it was going faster than she expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few weeks, Madison's clothes were looking a bit tight again. As she got back from another tutoring session, Cassi could not help but notice that her belly looked larger, and her arms were collecting more fat as well, looking soft, and her butt seemed like it had continued to grow. Cassi knew that Madison weighered herself every few days, and she could not be pleased with the verdict that came across her scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison, you seem really stressed out lately,\" Cassi inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, it's my weight, nothing I can do seems to stop it from going up,\" Madison said in a half whiny, half desperate voice. Madison knew that her weight had shot to 206, but Cassi had no firm number to rely on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you are getting too stressed about it. Clearly, standing on the scale isn't working. Maybe you need to just exercise really hard for 2 weeks, and then see where you weight stands after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think, I don't know if I can live with not knowing for that long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll even hide the scale for 2 weeks.\" Cassi insisted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison did not really see how that helped any, but she was down to try anything to reverse this trend. </span></div></div>",

The last few days of binging over the weekend pushed her to 185 pounds and her clothes were on the brink of bursting. She had noticed her clothes digging into her stomach, but chose to brush it off and blissfully gorge on fatty foods. Eventually habits like this have a breaking point and Madison's happened at the worst time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison opted to put on one of her few pairs of jeans that still fit before heading out with her friends for an evening of fun. Madison's friends, while aware of her gain, never cared to point out Madison's weight gain. They, like Cassie, knew the benefit of having a fat friend. Though unlike Cassie, they were never purposely trying to make her gain weight. Besides it looked like Madison didn't need any help at the moment. The girls went to a party to try and meet some boys. Many of the girls found success in flirting with many boys at the party while Madison was stuck with wingman after wingman. Saddened by her lack of prospects, Madison opted to partake in the party snacks. The snacks were largely untouched since the party started since all the women were watching their weight and the guys were more concerned with drinking games and flirting with girls. It was Madison to help take care of the supplies. First a few cupcakes, then the bowl of chips, until she found herself emptying a tray of cookies someone had bought from the local grocery store. Madison pulled the last cookie from the tray and accidentally dropped the cookie. What happened next would be remembered for years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>RIIIIIPPPPPP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole party witnessed Madison Kraft tear her pants picking up a cookie. Her jeans could no longer contain her giant ass. Everyone laughed as Madison's face turned beat red. She left the party crying and embarrassed. Madison returned to Cassie stocking up dorm with snacks. Cassie consoled Madison in her time of need. But she also took this time to squeeze a few more calories in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie suggested a girls night in, which consisted of getting drunk and eating snacks. Cassie provided some beer from her stash and made sure Madison was plenty drunk. By night's end, Madison forgot all about the night's events and was having fun with Cassie. Meanwhile, Cassie was making sure to offer Madison some of the newly stocked food. Madison inhaled all sorts of unhealthy snacks, but the most impressive thing was watching Madison dive into a dozen chocolate frosted donuts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...*burp*. So full.\" said Madison after eating 2 donuts. \"I think I'm done\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be done. Madi, you opened my donuts. They're going to go stale by morning\" said Cassie. She didn't think it was so easy to convince Madison, but off Madison went to polish off another 10 donuts. Cassie made sure she downed a glass a milk on top of it all before Madison passed out from a food coma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What do you say? One last hurrah?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Madison acted serious, her willpower was very weak. She folded like a deck of cards in the wake of going on a food bender before she goes on a diet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...Ok! BUT! After this it's time to get serious\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie and Madison hung out the rest of the weekend. Madison would eat what she wanted, but never got too out of hand. That is until a few beers got involved and Madison's inhibitions got the best of her. It didn't help that Cassie was encouraging her to splurge. Why stop at a few cookies. Why not eat the whole tray? Why stop with a few slices of cake? Why not eat it all? Madison complied with all of it. Pushing her limits both nights. By the time Monday morning rolled around...</span></div></div>",

Tipping the scales at 198 pounds, Madison was approaching fat girl territory. She looked much softer in recent weeks and her new outfit really showed it. Her breasts, which kept at a generous D, were pushed together to create a cavernous cleavage. Her arms were doughy and round, lacking any sort of definition. Her stomach bulged out as it raced to keep up with her growing breasts. It rested lightly on her lap when she sat down. Her lower half continued to quickly outpace the rest of her. Her thighs were pressing hard against one another constantly seeming to be in battle for space. Her hips flared with a generous amount of fat. Enough so that her hips had surpassed her shoulders weeks ago. It was important that it did or else she couldn't carry her massive derierre. Her butt was massive enough to spill over and out of all the classroom chairs. Madison constantly struggled in those chairs to get comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all, Madison had gained quite a significant amount of weight. Cassi kind of wished it wouldn't end, but at some point it had to. Besides she was fat enough. The deed had been done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rejuvenated Madison confidently strolled out of the dorm and down campus to the gym when she was approached by THE Sophie Howard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're Madison Kraft, right?\" questioned Sophie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison couldn't believe that Sophie from Phi Eta Mu had approached her.

Madison quickly leapt 200 pounds in her short time there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi, couldn't help but notice how Madison was blowing up much fast. In fact much faster than she was when Cassi was pushing Madison to gain weight. Cassi was curious as to what was going on in that sorority house. Were they fattening her up? It just had to be a coincidence. Besides Madison was not allowed to talk about it. She vowed to keep the sorority a secret. But it was no secret that she was quickly growing out of her clothes. Her hips made it hard for her sweatpants to creep over her ass and when she did, everyone could get a peek at her panties. Her thighs tested the quality of the material as they rubbed each other vigorously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer growth didn't go unnoticed by Sophie and the other girls. Madison was a true gainer.

They made sure to pack the tables with food. Madison showed up in a pair of jeans and a dressy shirt. Madison had popped the button off her jeans before coming over, but she tried to hide it from the girls with a less than revealing shirt. Madison attempted to avoid the food available, but the girls insisted that she try all the foods. A few slices of pizza and a few snacks later, Madison was finishing off the freshly baked brownies when she was asked by Sophie to retrieve a beer for her in the fridge. Being a little intoxicated and a bit excited, Madison bent too much too fast when grabbing the beer and suddenly... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>RIIIIP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had done it again!

When she wasn't studying, she was at parties, going to concerts, checking out events on campus or hitting the bar with her fake ID.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, while Madison's newly added pounds were on the back of her mind, she wasn't doing much to get rid of them.  Several attempts had been made at \"eating healthier\", though she hadn't actually tried to start a diet.  The few times Madison had worked to lose weight in the past, she did by skipping meals, hitting the gym and sticking to the healthy foods her parents kept around the house.  However, Madison still hadn't made it back to the gym since her embarrassing incident, she didn't have access to a kitchen, and she was now surrounded by a lot of tempting, high-calorie foods, not to mention alcohol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result, even her roomiest jeans were giving her problems.  In fact, the ever fashionable Madison, who normally wouldn't be caught wearing the same outfit twice in a month, had stuffed herself into the same two pairs of size 6s all week, wearing roomy shirts to obscure the small bulges rippling over the waistband.  She was thankful that today had warmed up enough to wear a black pencil skirt and white top, an outfit she enjoyed for being sharp and professional while showing off her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was surprised to see her two students at a table with another group, paying close attention to a small, somewhat goth looking brunette girl demonstrating a math equation.  \"Hi Jessica, Manny.  Ready for our session?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there you are!\" the brunette exclaimed.  \"I was just including them with my group since you were late.  I'm Veronica, I'm a senior here and help with the tutoring as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison smiled and shook her hand, but inside she was annoyed at the mention of her being late.  \"Well thank you, I think I can take it from here.\"  As she turned her head, she realized Jessica was staring at her.  \"Jessica, are you paying attention? Please get your workbook out so we can begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the session went on, Madison felt like both of her wards were staring at her when she stood.  Manny's stares were the type Madison was used to, but she was bothered by Jessica's fascination.  \"Is she just daydreaming more than usual?\" Madison thought as she caught another glace.  \"Or...is she staring at my stomach?\"  Feeling uncomfortable, she adjusted her skirt before sitting back down, realizing the fitted skirt, while more forgiving than her jeans, might not be slimming.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nLike she's one to judge...look at what a slob she is!</i> Madison thought to herself as Jessica grabbed a mini-Snickers bar from her purse, arm fat jiggling slightly in the tight sleeves of her shirt, and began eating.  <i>Can't even get through a tutoring session without getting the munchies.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like a snack, Miss Kraft?  I've got more of these in my purse if you want one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not!\" Madison snapped, frustrated at how this long day was going. \"I can't instruct you with my mouth full, now can I?  Put that away, junk food is not conductive to a learning environment.\"  Blushing, the fat redhead stuck the treat back in her purse.  Madison felt a little guilty at the harsh rejection, as it was out of character for her, but something about that girl really got under her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth was, Madison had been feeling hungry since getting off the bus.  Facing another long ride home, she decided to stop at McDonalds again after the tutoring ended.  \"I'll just get a McChicken, or maybe one of those salads,\" she rationalized.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the time Madison walked inside the golden arches, she was not feeling so resolute.  The skirt, while snugger than it should be, was not nearly as restrictive as the jeans that had been cutting into her softened midriff for days.  There was no line inside, so she went straight to the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you like today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Madison wavered.  Then she saw a big banner ad for the new Bacon Clubhouse Burger.  \"Oh, I'll have that!  The burger, not the chicken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make it the meal, actually.  With a Diet Coke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get the drinks from the fountain.  Pick what you want, refills are free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right!  I always forget.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison moved aside to wait for her food, subconsciously fingering the side of her waistband to cover a love handle.  She had a weakness for bacon, and figured it wouldn't be too many calories for a dinner.  <i>After all, I don't want to be snacking late at night.</i>  Of course, with the french fries she was consuming a 1300 calorie bomb, precision targeted for her widening hips and growing belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bacon Clubhouse meal, ready to go,\" said a familiar voice.  Madison looked up and saw that the person with her order wasn't the clerk from before...it was Veronica, the tutor from earlier.  A bit embarrassed, Madison walked up and said, \"Yes, that's mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Madison, here you are!\"  Madison thought she should take the opportunity to smooth things over from earlier.  \"Thanks for helping out earlier while I was late.  I'm at the mercy of public transit, but I'll try not to leave you hanging like that again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime, girl.  Hey, what do you think of Powers?  It's on my short list of schools.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls made small chat for a minute, Madison feeling better about the situation.  As she turned to fill her drink, she gave Veronica a good shot of her lower abdomen protruding in profile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small smirk appeared on Veronica's face.  <i>Pretty sure Miss Hot Shit didn't have that roll when she started.</i>  Veronica was a pretty girl, but no beauty like Madison, or the popular girls at her high school.  Seeing a few flaws from the college hottie gave her a secret thrill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison dug into the burger with gusto, as her regular visits and growing appetite had caused her to shed the modesty and table manners she'd been raised with.  A dainty burp escaped her lips as got up to refill her drink, this time choosing a regular Dr. Pepper, a favorite treat from her grandmother's house as a child.  Despite the large meal, she had no problem finishing in time to catch the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also had no problem downing two bags of popcorn with Cassi later on as they watched Real Housewives.</span></div></div>",

But after another week of eating McDonald's every day had caught up with her. She laid on her bed desperately trying to get her pants to close. She had been working at it for a half hour but still couldn't manage. Eventually Madison conceded and put on a pair of yoga pants. They clung to her expanding rear and weren't very slimming. Definitely not ideal, but it would have to do. She also wore a loose fitting top to try to conceal her stomach. This was the heaviest Madison had ever been, and she vowed to make some changes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately she didn't have time today. After classes she headed straight to Joyce, getting there just a couple of minutes early. <br>\r\nAs she worked with Manny and Jessica, Madison heard some whispers. This wasn't uncommon, this was a school after all, but this time the conversation caught her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, did you notice Madison's been putting on weight lately?\" One boy asked his buddies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah her ass is getting huge! That's probably why she's wearing those yoga pants, she can't get that booty into jeans.\" Another boy snickered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She better watch it, or she's gonna get really fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison's face turned red. People were noticing, not only that they thought she was fat! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica whipped around and faced the boys, \"Hey! Watch it! We can hear you idiot! Now apologize!\" The guys looked at each other nervously, \"Apologize!\" Jessica yelled. The whole room went silent, everybody was looking at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" The boys muttered, their faces were red and they wouldn't meet her eye, but it was better than nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison stared at Jessica her mouth open. She had never heard anything remotely like that out of the girl. Jessica caught her staring, \"what? People souldnt talk about you behind your back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison closed her mouth, \"yeah ummm thanks.\"</span></div></div>",

When Madison checked her phone, she saw it was 6:04, and the next bus did not come until 6:25. Worse, her phone's battery display showed a blinking read icon, meaning her phone had no chance of making it until the bus came, leaving her little to do, except stare at the golden arches across from the stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why didn't I bring homework??</i> she thought to herself. As she sat at the bus stop, Madison looked at her legs, still confined in the yoga pants. Pushing back the fabric of the loose and billowy shirt above them, Madison felt the inside of her thigh, <i>Is this softer, or am I just imagining things?</i>, then she moved to casually check her stomach, issuing a quick brush of the inside of her hand against the outside of her shirt, against her belly, <i>can't get around this--it's softer here</i>, she thought, with regret. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison also knew it was time for new clothes. She wondered if Cassi could possibly drive her to the mall when she got back to practice, or if she could connect on a different bus and buy some more fitting pants until she got back in shape.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of going back to trying to think about things--school, homework, friends, she glanced at her phone again, 6:11. Before she could click it off, her phone died, leaving her without full knowledge of what time it was, as well as a sense of disappointment that it was not closer to 6:25. Her hunger was also kicking in. While her pride was wounded after the incident in class, Madison was still hungry, and could not wait to get home and have something. She told herself it would have to be healthy, but while she was trying to take a stand, all she could think about was the McDonalds across the street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Couldn't I just go get a side salad, or a cookie to hold me me over? </i></span></div></div>",

She barely had time for the gym. Between her classes, homework, and her job she could only manage about one trip a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDieting was another problem. Madison hated it. She loved so many foods that were bad for her. She missed when her metabolism would just burn off the calories, but with her current lack of exercise that wasn't the case anymore. Another problem was convince. She found herself still going to Mcdonalds just about every day, just because it was quick and easy. She also grabbed food from vending machines on campus when she was running low on time.

Her meaty thighs fought her, but her rear was the real problem. Madison jumped up and down, and wiggled her hips back and forth. Her butt refused at first but eventually was coaxed inside. With some difficulty Madison got them buttoned. She was getting worried, she couldn't let herself outgrow another set of pants. She couldn't let it get that far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring class Madison got an unwelcome text. It was from Kelly. Her and some of her friends from the gym were going to the pool and wanted her to come.

She first attempted with the bottoms, a string number that used to show off her firm hips, but now just highlighted the growing softness and widening that had been going on since she arrived at Powers. On top of that, her butt was threatening to eat up the back of bottoms, and she found herself having to pull the material out of her crack even before she left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Madison went to put the top on, it was a tight squeeze, but luckily for her in the moment, it her gain on top had not rivaled that at the bottom. That being said, it was clearly too small. Her boobs looked ready to fall out, <i>not the worst thing in the world</i>, Madison thought, but beyond that, she had some serious back boob issues to contend with. When she went up to the full length mirror she no longer had images of her sleek and athletic body that guys at the beginning of the year were lusting after, no, now she looked like the kind of girl who was bitterly jealous of those girls, with her love handles and thighs that shook when she moved her 170 pound body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her attempt to cover up, Madison wore shorts and a tank top, both which hid her chubbiness, but not by much. \"Do I really want to go out like this?\" Madison asked out loud in her empty room.

She did not think Madison was as hot as she thought she was, plus, she was angry that Madison had a bit of an outburst at Jessica, all for trying to be friendly to her tutor. Veronica had a bit of jealousy over girls like Madison, who she felt had it easy all of the time. Sure, Veronica thought, she was cute, but not the knockout like Madison, and her parents were solidly middle class, but they were not going to be getting her the designer handbags or amazing wardrobe that Madison had anytime soon. Veronica wanted to see if she could knock Madison down to her level, maybe even by the time she enrolled in Powers the following year, if that is what she decided to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter work, Veronica went home, and thought about ways it could happen. There was no way she could force Madison to eat more, or stop working out, but she could make it easier for her to do the former, she thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her next study session, Madison actually arrived early, deciding to forgo another chance to workout, in favor of making it into class on time. <i>I can't really keep being late</i> she thought to herself. She had decided not to go with the pencil skirt again, since she noticed that it seemed to have a distinct bulge in the middle, that would be a noticeable pot belly if she was not careful. <i>It's just temporary, I'll lose it</i> Madison thought while on the bus. This time, until she got a bit thinner, she decided to wear yoga pants and a long causal dress in an attempt to cover up her spillover. She seemed to get a long a bit better with Jessica today, who she still thought lacked motivation, however, she could not figure out why Manny seemed to be in space so much that day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving eaten an early lunch to get to the Joyce on time, Madison was starving by the time she reached the McDonalds, but figured she could eat health by ordering the fried chicken club, and she could not resist going for the meal and getting the fries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Madison had arrived at Joyce that day, Veronica immediately noticed from across the room what Madison was trying to do with her clothing, and thought that she could see the point where the leggings ended, somewhere near Madison's belly button, given the lines in her dress. She hurried over the McDonalds after the tutoring session, and was sure to be the one who served Madison her meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Madison!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Veronica...guess our work schedules line up pretty well?\" Madison said, not really thrilled to see Veronica, but not really that annoyed either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Hey, I can take 1 break day, can I join you for dinner?\" Veronica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll be in that booth over there,\" Madison said, before filling her meal sized up with a Dr. Pepper. <i>Wow, that's like 300 extra calories</i> Veronica thought. Before she joined Madison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what makes you choose McDonalds?\" Veronica inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really quick,\" Madison noted, \"plus, I think I can go a bit healthier, like chicken\" Veronica was shocked by that comment, didn't Madison know that she got something almost worse than a Big Mac? After a while Veronica pushed the conversation where she wanted it to go, \"You know, I can get free meals here, as a perk.\" Veronica said, lying of course, but she figured it was worth it to see if her plan could work, \"and I really look up to you, being successful in college and all, can I buy you dinner after the tutoring sessions, and pick you brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was a bit taken back, but also flattered, \"Well, yeah. I guess. What do you want to know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica had to hold back her excitement </span></div></div>",

Actually she had been over doing herself for the last month. Madison had grown to really enjoy her talks with Veronica. She would sit down with her after her tutoring sessions and they would just talk. Veronica would ask for Madison's advice and Madison was happy to give it. It felt good to have somebody look up to her like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica wasn't Madison's friend. Her plan was working better than expected. She met with Madison and pretended to be interested in what she was saying. She had quickly learned that the longer she could keep Madison talking, the more she would eat. So Veronica asked as many questions as she could think of during their meetings. Madison would get up several times to refill her large drink, every time Veronica smiled at the empty calories Madison kept pouring into her glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Madison's figure to really start to suffer. Madison had been growing before but Veronica's plan sped the gain up considerably. Madison's belly continued to grow. It was now visible in even Madison's loosest shirts. Her boobs had expanded going up at least a cup size. Her arms and legs had lost all definition and were now jiggling with her movements. Her ass had started growing at an exponential rate, ballooning out behind her. Thanks to the stretchy yoga pants, which Madison now wore every day, she didn't really notice. That is until this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was jumping up and down trying, and failing, to stretch her yoga pants over her gigantic booty. She could get them about halfway up before they refused to stretch anymore. She had been struggling for the last half hour. She was now on the verge of being late for class because she couldn't get her pants on. She stripped off the latest pair and threw them into a large pile at the foot of her bed. She desperately rifled through her closet looking for something that she could still squeeze into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe list was depressingly short. She was long past the days that any of her trendy jeans would fit her. Last time she checked she couldn't even get them over her meaty thighs. Her skirts were the same way. Her dresses failed to contain her growing boobs, and nothing could hide her stomach. She refused to go to the store and get new clothes though. That was a line she was desperate not to cross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eventually she had to settle for a disgusting pair of gray sweatpants Madison hated them but thanks to her new, chunky body, she had no choice.</span></div></div>",

Veronica had to hide her smile when Madison showed up in her gray sweatpants, and then again when she ordered the largest size possible for her meal. Did she really not realize? Veronica thought as she watched Madison down her meal and then get up for desert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the sessions continued on. After a couple of days Madison broke down and bought some larger clothes, since being seen in those sweatpants was worse for her than the weight gain. She was still convinced that she could work the weight off if she just watched what she ate. Her metabolism had always taken care of anything like this before and surely it would do the same now after her body got adjusted to her busy schedule. But her metabolism was no longer that of the small athletic girl that had come to Powers, no, it was that of a person that barely did more than walk to class and back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison started to doubt her na\u00efve view of her body as time progressed, however. It was getting harder for her to hide her rapidly growing pot belly or defend the fact that her butt stuck out like a shelf behind her.  It was getting harder for her to ignore how her body jiggled when she moved and how out of breath she got climbing the stairs\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison knew she had gained weight, but was in deep denial about just how much. However, between class, her social life, and tutoring, she knew that she had little time to actually work out to do anything about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same could not be said of her friends, however. For Cassi and Kelly, it was nearly a point of daily discussion. Their conversations often circled around Madison's increasingly rotund girth, and her apparent lack of awareness. One day at lunch, the girls were having a typical conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean....does she ever bring it up?\" Kelly asked Cassi, one day over lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really no. She knows it's there...but she just doesn't seem to want to work out any more. I don't know. I think she never really had to work to keep it before,\" Cassi replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Madison came to join them, it was noticed by both of them that the khaki colored skirt she was wearing looked as tight as ever-- both in front, where she had a pot belly there was no use trying to hide, and behind, where love handles were clearly showing through the back of the skirt, which wasn't doing a great job of hiding her growing rear. As Madison ate, Cassi could not help but see that her roommate's arms were now soft, like that of a girl who had never been the athlete that Madison had been. It all seemed odd to her. She looked down at the food that Madison was eating...a tuna sandwich and a small salad. It wasn't unlike what they were having and yet...Madison seemed to be growing by the day. <i>Where does all the weight come from?</i>, Cassi thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, Madison was back at Joyce High School, tutoring Manny and Jessica, while looking at the clock. All she could think about was her hunger. She had not come to class ravenous, but Manny and Jess seemed to be taking especially long to grab concepts that day, and the tedious nature of instruction caused her to start tracking the clock. As she started counting down the minutes until she could leave, she started thinking about her meal at McDonald's, and then, well, it was all she could think about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she been more attentive that day, Madison would have realized that Jessica, on the other hand, had been successful in losing weight. While still larger than Madison, her pupil could not help but notice the trend lines were pointed in different directions for each of them. Despite this, even Jess didn't expect what happened with 15 minutes left in class. As Madison was writing a flowchart a flowchart on the board to explain a certain story arc to them, she leaned over to grab another marker off a desk to the side and then /RPPPPPPPPPPPPPP. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison froze in horror. As she looked out the side of her eyes, she could tell that the side of her skirt had burst at the seams. \"Oh my gosh.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nManny didn't know what to say, so he just starred into his notepad as much as he could. Jessica stared silently as her instructor just kind of stammered. She could not believe that this former hottie was being humbled in quite this fashion, and although she was loving every second of it, she sympathized. Walking up to Madison, she mentioned, \"Umm, Madison, I have some extra clothes in my gym locker if you want something to cover your thigh with.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile a gesture of kindness, Jessica also knew that it would humliate her. Madison would have to accept that she was at least in the ballpark of her own weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison looked at the ground and replied, \"Umm...sure. Where is the locker room here?\" When they got there, Madison and Jessica went to her locker. \"I don't know if these will fit,\" Jessica said, grabbing a pair of jeans, \"But they are all that's in here that's not atheletic gear\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll work,\" Madison said, thinking that they would hang off her like a tent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her disappointment, while still very loose, they were tighter than she expected. </span></div></div>",

It was a structure from the 1970s, but had been recently updated and brought to the level that college students were used to. Madison was wearing some new (and expensive) training shoes, short shorts, and a t shit that fit somewhat tight. Her hair was in a pony tail, and in all, she looked like an in shape college girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked at the card with room information printed off, she walked down a hallway behind the main gym floors into the private workout rooms. About 5 doors down she saw G1E, her room number. The room looked about as big as a small class room and was windowless, it had sport floor, a projector and a clock in the corner, as well as a drinking fountain. Madison checked her phone for a bit, until someone else opened the door. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yes, he was the one who signed up for this workout group, and then opted into one on one training, but he did it more as a way to force himself to exercise. It was something that he felt he needed to do, but not something that he wanted to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of Jeff's life, he had been one of the larger kids in the class, and then in high school, he ballooned to near his current size. He was happy that he was a guy, because he felt that had he been a girl, he would have been picked on by his peers. His parents were a bit chubby, but not to his size. That being said, he was very insecure about his weight, and wanted to lose some. He knew that was what people thought about as a first impression when they saw him, something cause him to never really be outgoing in high school. He choose Powers because his Dad had went their, and his Grandpa had gone there was as well. Jeff sighed when he thought about it, he was happy to blend in at the school, but the administrators were thrilled to have another generation of the Wilson family at the school. Jeff's Grandpa had started the W.F. Group, a financial firm on the east coast that had made his family not just wealthy, but downright loaded. His Dad was currently taking over the company, which had become a model of stability in an uncertain economic time. Jeff was happy that not very many people knew about the wealth his parents possessed, sure there were signs, the nice clothes, the top of the line laptop, the new car he drove to campus, but for the most part, his peers did not know about Jeff's family dynasty that was coming together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor people to have known, Jeff would have had to been more open to the few people he was talking to that second weekend of the school year. He had some guys on his floor he was friendly with, and his roommate Rod, but he wasn't venturing to parties like many of the others in the freshman class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo here Jeff found himself as he walked into the gym, wearing a very oversized T-shirt to try to hide his girth and some athletic shorts. He looked at form he had been emailed, \"Madison Kraft, room G1E.\" He walked down the end of a hallway and found the fifth door down. As he opened the door he saw a hottie checking her phone.  </span></div></div>",

She didn't really know how to introduce herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Madison, I guess we will be working together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeffrey was embarrassed, he knew the program would put peers together, but he never guessed that it would be someone as hot as Madison, and he just kind of starred at the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Jeff. Want to get started?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison had studied the course material the previous evening, so she knew what to do. As they started warm-ups, Madison tried to talk with him a bit, and see where he was from. \"So, you're also a freshman?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" he answered. \"I'm thinking about majoring in international business\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds really interesting,\" Madison was a bit jealous, she hadn't chosen a major yet. She continued, \"So where are you from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff was starting to get a bit winded, \"I'm from Connecticut, near New York.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you ended up here?\" Asked Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's a family thing, my Dad and Grandpa both went here,\" he replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison got the routine into higher gear as they started moving faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm from out of state as well,\" she replied after showing him how to do a new move, \"I just felt like a change of pace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they started talking, Jeff started to come out of his shell a bit, and the class actually went by fast for him. Sure, he was in great physical pain, but he didn't mind, he usually did not get the female attention that she was giving him. For Madison, it was a bit of her friendly personality and bit of being sociable in a situation where the only alternative was silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 40 minutes, they completed the workout. Jeff looked like he was going to fall over, and Madison was a bit winded as well. Madison could see the huge amount of sweat that he was giving off, and his shirt stuck to every contour in his body. Madison, for her part looked looked pretty sweaty, but in more of a sporty/workout kind of way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jeff walked away, he got excited for the next workout in two days. Madison went back to her dorm to study. </span></div></div>",

Madison was curious and looked at some photos of him, <i>Hmm, guess he's always been larger</i> Madison thought to herself. She saw that it he didn't seem to have many girls in the photos, mainly just him and a few of his friends. Madison had scrolled back a few years now, just about to stop and log off for fear of feeling creepy, but she hit a patch of interesting photos, they were tagged by someone who she assumed to be Jeff's Dad under the album title, \"Dad's Retirement\" which Madison assumed to mean Jeff's Grandpa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison clicked on this figuring that it could be interesting, and the first photo shocked her, <i>Oh wow, that's lower Manhattan in the background, I wonder where he worked...and what he did?</i> She searched around more, and found another photo titled, \"The boss gives one last speech.\" <i>Holy crap, he ran the place</i> Madison continued to look through the photos, and it became clear that Jeff's family had some money. There were photos of his family on a private jet, in a luxury suite at a game, another at their summer home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison went off social media to search more in-depth. She saw on photos that the group seemed to be called W.F. Financial. She emailed her Dad a question about it, he was in business back home, so maybe he knew. \"Dad, Maddie here, do you know anything about a firm named W.F. Financial?\" She then went and searched it online. The results that she got back astounded her, tons of news hits about the success of the firm, Jeff's Grandpa's name mentioned as one of the leaders coming out of the recession, and the transfer of the company to Jeff's Dad. Madison was in shock, <i>This is...like robber-baron rich</i>. Just then, Madison got an email back from her Dad, \"Madison, W.F. Financial is a conglomerate that buys up companies it feels to be undervalued and has a good track record of raising market share in nearly everything they invest in, why do you ask?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Holy crap. His filthy rich</i><br>\r\n <br>\r\nMadison thought of only one thing she could type. \"W.F. Financial Wilson family personal net-worth.\" She saw an article and scanned it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>$950 million. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh my god. Jeff is insanely rich</i> Madison thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was never anything close to a jersey chaser, and she came from some money, but within reason, not tycoon, sports owner money. She thought about it...<i>someday, Jeff is going to be the benefactor of more money than anyone could ever spend. I would be stupid not to at least become very good friends with him, </i> she thought to herself. </span></div></div>",

Madison went about the rest of her day thinking about this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the two days, Madison came back for her workout with Jeff, and had another quick and fun session. Jeff knew that he was beginning to develop a bit of a crush on Madison, and for her part, Madison was putting on quite the charm offensive. She often touched his arm after an exercise, and laughed frequently if she found something to be funny. As the workout went on, more and more Madison thought that she should give this Jeff idea a go. \"Why not?\" She thought during another set of exercises. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the session, Madison asked Jim if she wanted to come up to her dorm room after they got done changing, to which Jim enthusiastically said yes. After Jim had finished showering, he headed to Madison's room, and wondered if this would lead anywhere. He could not believe his luck, he thought Madison was a knock-out, he loved her face, and her perfect body, and briefly fantasize about what it would be like to be with her. But then, he thought about it some more and self doubt crept in. <i>Guys like me can't be with girls like her</i> he thought to himself as he reflected on his figure. Heck, he thought about it and now didn't even want the attention of going out with a girl that hot, what would everyone say? It almost seemed like just another excuse for everyone to laugh at him. All these thoughts were swirling through his head as he walked up to Madison's dorm room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey watched a movie together, with no interruption due to the text Madison had sent Cassi, asking if she could have the room for a while, before Madison asked Jeff if they could maybe grab dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff thought about his previous conversation, \"You know Madison, I don't really think I am comfortable enough to do that right now, I mean, you are drop dead gorgeous, and I...well I've tried to work out before without results, and I just do not think it will happen this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was shocked</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nMadison took a deep breath and decided to take the offensive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, if you\u2019re not comfortable with our being seen out together I have to accept that for now as your viewpoint which you\u2019re entitled to. Everyone\u2019s head isn\u2019t the same and I know that \u2013 but you should consider where I\u2019m coming from as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d Jeff inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat others think about how either of us appears, alone or together, isn\u2019t relevant to our relationship in my opinion. Its what WE think because it is OUR relationship. In my view you\u2019re more intelligent and a better conversationalist than most guys I\u2019ve dated, I\u2019ve seen you sincerely striving to reach a goal I\u2019m supposed to be helping you attain, and I respect you for both those things. Plus we\u2019ve shared a movie together which shows we have the ability to share some common interests. From my view, as one who is supposed to be your coach, what you need right now more than anything is a friend in your corner who respects and believes in you \u2013 and if you can accept all that but still aren\u2019t comfortable going out I have a \u201cPlan B.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlan B?\u201d Jeff stammered, trying to assimilate the deluge he had just been given. \u201cI don\u2019t see how you could see me as anything exceptional. I\u2019m a freak \u2013 let\u2019s be honest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA freak? You mean like what I\u2019ve seen you do in class? Ask questions and give answers that are light years ahead of others? Its almost like you\u2019re a savant. I\u2019ve a pretty good record at getting good grades but you just seem to absorb data like a sponge. Anyone who would call you names I suggest is feeling threatened because they can\u2019t do what you do without even thinking about it!\u201d Madison asserted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Its called a photographic memory and its a family trait. It probably is why I\u2019ve lived such a sedentary and food focused life \u2013 not even the nerds want to be around me\u201d Jeff confided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStupid nerds. They should be giving you respect while picking your brain to help themselves,\u201d declared Madison. \u201cBut I digress. Do you want to try my Plan B or not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you haven\u2019t told me as yet what it is, \u201c observed Jeff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who gets no respect, Jeff. You like most others probably think of me as a fitness freak and typically narcissistic high school hottie.  The fact is that I have a brain and world view that most have no idea of. I see people\u2019s talents and potential, as well usually their inner fears, rather than just their public personas but I can\u2019t talk about it because it usually scares others. Does that make any sense to you?\u201d she related.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, actually it does,\u201c agreed Jeff. \u201cPersonas are usually developed to impress or protect \u2013 they\u2019re never the real person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d exclaimed Madison.  \u201cNow get this. I see the real Jeff, more clearly than maybe even you do. And its not his body, its his dreams and hopes \u2013 and also his loneliness.  If you won\u2019t discuss those things with me at a restaurant, there\u2019s another way.  That\u2019s my plan B.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich exactly is?\u201d  probed Jeff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me cook a dinner here for you \u2013 something simple for the moment, but I assure you I can do better,\u201d offered Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff knew his belly was ready for action, hardly novel for him, but he could scarcely believe the invitation. Was Madison really this accepting and eager to get to know him? He decided to take a chance.  \u201cOK, you win. But excuse me if I\u2019m having difficulty believing this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou go play on the Internet for an hour,\u201d Madison cajoled.  \u201cI\u2019ll try to come up with something you\u2019ll enjoy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison knew exactly what she was going to do \u2013 a quick tuna casserole with peas and mushroom soup filler accompanied by an argula corn salad and for dessert some butterscotch pudding. Within 15 minutes the casserole was in the oven followed by the pudding in the refrigerator, leaving her nearly 40 minutes to work on the salad.  She even found time to make a carafe of fruit flavored ice tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jeff was invited to the table he was surprised to see it set formally with a table cloth and folded napkins. The hot casserole was in a Pyrex glass with a pad underneath and the salad in a bowl.  Large glasses of tea were accompanied by a carafe for refills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cServe yourself, starting with the salad. \u201c Madison invited. \u201cThe casserole should cool another ten minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis looks great!  Jeff acknowledged. \u201cAnd it only took an hour?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you like it I\u2019ll devote more time another evening,\u201d Madison smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff got Madison talking about her family and she tried to get him to open up about his, but silently understood his reluctance. It was enough for now that he knew she wasn\u2019t a gold digger on the prowl but had access to resources of her own.  When they finished she served dessert, by this time cold and sweet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty nice spread for a fat guy,\u201d he commented. \u201cI\u2019ve never had anyone do something like this befre.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnless you have a really slow metabolism, eating like this will over time bring your weight down to 240 \u2013 although if I keep pace as I did this evening I might pick up some during the same space of time\u201d confided Madison, expressing a private concern of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, who was it that was saying outer appearances weren\u2019t anyone\u2019s concern but ours?\u201d recalled Jeff. \u201cI will stipulate that if you happen to add part of what I lose that\u2019s fine and f you don\u2019t that\u2019s fine too. I\u2019m already appreciating the inner Madison if you get my drift.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison smiled as he left. She knew she had him hooked. As for her gaining weight, well, she wondered if that would be so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night she finally replied to her Dad\u2019s question, telling him she was coaching a scion of the family. She acknowledged that he was really huge but also a very nice guy that she strangely found herself attracted to because of his nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve no idea where this is going to go, Dad,\u201c she confided, \u201cbut for now its all good and I feel right about it. I sincerely hope no one in the family, if you should meet him, will make him feel less than welcome as long as he\u2019s treating me well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Madison decided to retire \u2013 but not before sharing the last of the butterscotch pudding with Cassie.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few days went by before their next workout session, and Madison and Jeff had cordially chatted, but never met up. For this reason, Madison anxiously awaited their next workout. She put her workout gear on, and choose shorter shorts than normal, hoping that would turn Jeff on a bit.  On the way over to the session, Madison wondered if Jeff would eventually be comfortable with being with her. She knew that this would take time, however, as she walked, she thought about what that would mean for her. Throughout high school, Madison had only been with guys who were in great shape. She certainly was not an advocate for the high school social hierarchy, she thought it to be cruel, she still did benefit from it with her great looks and likable demeanor. It may have just come down to her never socializing one on one with someone like Jeff, but for some reason, she found him endearing...or at least that's what she was telling herself after learning about his vast family fortune. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff on the other hand, was also in deep thought. He was still risk adverse to anyone laughing at him about his weight, and he thought the greatest way to stop this was to drop some weight. \"Maybe...if this can just work out, Madison and I can go out together,\" he thought to himself as he was in the locker room, getting ready for the same workout. He really enjoyed dinner two nights ago, in fact, he constantly thought about it, but, he just had some personal issues of confidence he was not ready to conquer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jeff walked into the room, Madison was eating a candy bar. He thought it was an odd thing to bring into a workout room, and he was correct. Madison had indulged on the way to class. She had stopped at the school convenience store for a bottle of water, and then saw a chocolate bar. <i>What the heck, if I gain 5 pounds this year, no one will notice.</i> Perhaps this was still a bit of subtle superiority over Jeff. In her thin state, Madison assumed that Jeff would not freak out if she had gained 5 pounds like some other boyfriends, and she also was still believing in the speech she gave Jeff about personal acceptance, so Madison gave into her urges for the first time in a while and bought a candy bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chocolate in the workout room?\" Jeff asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilty!\" Madison replied, \"I don't know, it just seemed like a good idea...and you know what...I forgot how good these were.\" She said with a guilty smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they went though the exercises, Jeff noticed a shift in the way that Madison was instructing him. Before, Madison was just kind of going in tandem with him. Not really paying attention to his form, or really the results for him, but more so using them as her own personal workout time. Now, she was enthusiastic about helping him do them exactly right, coaching him, giving him little pointers in the most encouraging manner, taking a real interest in his progress. At the same time, this was at the expense of her body movement, and Jeff noticed that she had not broken a sweat, or moved much, by the end of the workout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the workout, Madison had only positive things to say to Jeff, but not in a patronizing way, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeff, I thought that was really good. I know it's hard, but you can see the foundation for your growth to continue, are you feeling more flexible than before you started?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I really am,\" He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, I think this will continue\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they each walked back to their separate dorm rooms and showered (although Madison's was questionably necessary) she got a text from Jeff, <i>Hey want to come to my room hang out?</i> Madison had been planning to go study on the green, but she could always do that later. <i>For sure, be over in 10!</i> she responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Madison got to the room, they talked for a while, and she noticed that it appeared that Jeff did not have a roommate, upon inquiring about it, Jeff said that they just paid extra to have a single, since it seemed small for two people. Madison also saw that he had a box full of packaged snack cakes in the corner. Jeff saw her starring and felt guilty, even though he did not have much to do with those being there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know, I should not have those here. My Mom sends them too me every so often, but I wish she would stop, because I think they are delicious and have the willpower not the buy them, but once they are here, I cannot really lay off them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how about this, just give them to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never tried them, but maybe my roommate and I will like them!\" she said, thinking this could help Jeff with his goal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had another great evening. Madison thought that little by little, Jeff could get to a physical and personal place that he wanted to be, even if it took a while.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison had received extensive culinary training at her private school. She knew very well what snack cakes were, especially the sweet vanilla filling, individual sized brand name types sold as Twinkies, Devil Dogs, Ho Hos and Ding Dongs. She thought of them as empty calorie junk food and knew how to make better pastries herself if she had to. But, outside  a few times in class, she never had.  But Jeff\u2019s cakes weren\u2019t store bought. Even though individually wrapped they weren\u2019t commercial brands, They were high end individual delicacies including butterscotch and chocolate creme, She knew they would taste divine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese were probably done by a caterer for the snack table at a family party,\u201d Madison surmised. \u201cBut why would Jeff\u2019s mom send them here \u2013 unless she wants to be sure he stays fat?  Why would she do that?  I think I\u2019m beginning to get a picture.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back of her mind the added thought nagged that in addition to keeping Jeff fat they could also make his girl friend fat as well. Madison ignored it, for she fully intended to share them with Cassie overtime, and neither of them had weight issues. A couple a night they could handle without effect. But first she had tonight\u2019s supper to think about, so she stopped enroute to the burger caf\u00e9 adjacent to the cafeteria, There she had a mushroom and avocado burger with fries and a soda, rather much more than she was accustomed to but she felt hungry for some reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got home she was surprised to find Cassi, Kelli, Ginger and Megan finishing off a couple of pizzas and about to have ice cream for dessert. Her snack cakes wound up rounding out the feast with Madison finally having a large bowl of ice cream as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the others left Cassi asked about Jeff, who she said reminded her of some of the farm boys back home in size, but obviously smarter.  She didn\u2019t sound critical, which Madison appreciated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, he\u2019s really quite intelligent, very kind but shy. He\u2019s majoring in International Business.  If I can get him down to 250 he\u2019ll go far I\u2019m sure, \u201cshe confided. \u201cYou know how weight-obsessed the world is and I\u2019m sure he feels it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie blinked. She thought her Coral Gables roommate would be a typical vain city brat, ready to criticize anyone not up to her view of perfection. But instead she was being positive and understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d Cassie replied. \u201cI\u2019ve dated some big guys and they can in their way be better gentlemen and friends than the self-absorbed studs. Having to endure crap for being different maybe makes you more patient and kind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe says he hasn\u2019t heard all that much but is still self-conscious about what he feels they\u2019re probably thinking. I had to assure him that he\u2019s not a freak. The good news is that he\u2019s working hard. If he keeps it up in about a year he will have a new image to be proud of, assuming I can keep those \u201csurvival kits\u201d from his Mom out of his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dSurvival kits?\u201d Cassie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoxes like the snack cakes we had tonight. Split up among five people is one thing \u2013 but for one?  He hates it, never buys them but his mom ships them!\u201d Madison exclaimed. \u201cHe gave them to me to get them beyond his reach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I commend him for trying! And you for helping, but for now I think we both need to get to bed,\u201d Cassi declared, rubbing her fully distended belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI agree,\u201d replied Madison as she headed for her room with a food baby of her own clearly showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in his fortress of solitude the rich young scion brooded on his feelings about his tutor. She\u2019d done her job professionally, accepted his hanging out invitation, urged him to go out publicly, even made a healthy meal for him and consented to get rid of his mom\u2019s surgery temptations. If he didn\u2019t know it was impossible he even thought he might have a chance with her, but he came from a world where everything seemed to revolve around money. What was wrong with him that he felt so insecure about having a normal relationship?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMoney can\u2019t avoid all risk of getting hurt,\u201d he answered himself. \u201cThere\u2019s some things money can\u2019t buy. But others risk getting hurt, money or not. Why can\u2019t I? Maybe its time to forget the Gucchi shoes and the family jet and take a chance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he popped a TV dinner into the microwave and decided to test Madison\u2019s resolve \u2013 even let her pick the restaurant.  He doubted it would be a fast food place or the college buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne thing for sure,\u201d he thought. \u201cI\u2019m not sharing this with Mom until it actually goes someplace. She\u2019s tried to keep me from a dating life because of her fear of gold-diggers all my life; I think she\u2019d prefer an arranged marriage with a debutante daughter from her friend\u2019s social circle. Those airheads couldn\u2019t compare to Madison in anything!  I hope I can stand up and declare that to both of them some day!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in Coral Gables Mrs. Kraft was venting to her husband, who had shared his exchange with Madison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like this one bit,\u201d she declared. \u201cMadison is too talented and beautiful a girl to get involved in trying to make over an obese rich kid. I\u2019m sure its not about his money, she\u2019s not like that. Its her Florence Nightingale problem solver side. But he can use his money to suck her in and we could wind up with an obese son-in-law and she might even get fat as well.  This has to stop \u2013 now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s over 18 and asserting her independence.\u201d her husband reminded her. \u201cWe have to let her make her own decisions in life \u2013 and I\u2019m not sure Florence Nightingale is the right analogy. She\u2019s more like a campaign manager or coach determined to win. Remember, she getting paid for his because she\u2019s wants independence from my checkbook \u2013 and that\u2019s commendable. If he doesn\u2019t shape up she\u2019ll tire after awhile. The alternative at the moment is to pull purse strings ourselves and try to control her life \u2013 which knowing Madison would likely produce a real explosion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I suppose your right. \u201c Mrs. Kraft grumbled, rolling her eyeballs. \u201cBut if fat boy ever comes here I\u2019m not serving dessert!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer husband smile and nodded. The storm was calmed. For now. But inwardly he felt sure Madison, not he or his wife, would call the shots if and when the time came.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jeff got ready for dinner that evening, not knowing where Madison would take him, this time, they had arranged for Madison to swing by his room. After a bit, he heard a knock on the door. Jeff opened it to see Madison, who was wearing trendy jeans and a nice, but casual top. Still not completely accepting that someone of Madison's caliber was interested in him, Jeff was taken aback by how sexy she looked even in everyday attire. He had seen her in her gym clothes, and when she was being ultra casual in the room together, but when she was going out, even just for a quick dinner date, it took her appearance to a new level. He quickly composed himself and started walking to the elevators with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where are we going?\" He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever had sushi before?\" Madison asked, hoping he would say no, to create a new experience together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't think I would like it that much.\" Jeff remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's not to like?\" Madison said, somewhat playfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raw fish I guess, it freaks me out a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like you're eating a whole raw cod or anything, give it a shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, they went to the restaurant in the downtown near campus. Madison took Jeff through the menu, and explained the things that she liked. Jeff ordered two rolls, per Madison's suggestion, and she did as well. When the food came, Jeff starred at the two rolls, six pieces each, somewhat disappointed, which Madison picked up on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look disappointed, what's the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just looks a bit...small, especially for what we paid.\" He remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What, now he's going to act like a cheapskate</i> Madison jokingly thought to herself. \"It fills you up more than you think, I know it doesn't look like much, but it caught on for a reason,\" she assured Jeff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff piked up one with his chopsticks, something he was proficient in from his times at the Chinese buffet, and put it in his mouth. It was different alright, but not bad, in fact as the second and third pieces went by, he decided the taste was acquired but something that he liked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the dinner, Madison was pleased that Jeff had tried something new and liked it, \"See,\" she noted, \"this is actually pretty decent for you, at least compared to dorm food, and it tastes really good!\" To which Jeff agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a great night for each of them. When Madison got back into her room, she decided to open up her textbooks, and knock out the reading for later in the week. After a bit, she got hungry again, and walked over to the fridge, where she saw some carrots that she had bought a week ago, and some soda and chips that Cassi had brought home and mentioned it was for each of them. Normally, Madison would have preferred the carrots, but she remembered how great the sweetness of that soda she had a few days ago taste, and the chips would provide a nice saltiness as well. While studying, Madison absentmindedly had 3 or 4 servings out of the family sized bags, ignoring the portion control that she was usually quite held to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That\u2019s what bothers me before dining in public \u2013 other\u2019s thinking that I\u2019m a hog feeding at the trough again, but no one tonight seemed to notice.\u201d </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to Wikipedia he didn\u2019t find such a word \u2013 the closest definition was that of Scopophobia \u2013 fear of being stared at or looked at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Well, that\u2019s close,</i> \u201che thought. <i>\u201cBut whatever it is I\u2019m going to have to lick it. Madison expects me to pick the next place and I\u2019m a basket case even contemplating it.  But the good thing is I\u2019m ready for bed without being distracted by addictive snack cakes. I can hardly believe she and her dorm mates demolished that box in one night!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff slept soundly that night, rising in the morning determined to keep his calories in check. He knew Madison had warned him to avoid going over 3000 per day. He cut a cantaloupe into four pieces and put three in storage bags, then scrambled two eggs and put two slices of whole grain bread in the toaster.  As he washed this repast down with a large glass of orange juice he visualized Madison at the Powers breakfast buffet having a similar breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Madison and Cassie were indeed at the buffet, but having a slightly different menu. Instead of two scrambled eggs they were each having an omelet that included cheese, tomato, and avocados. They also each had a fruit cup and an English muffin. But in addition there were also sausages and hash browns plus tall cups of calorie rich mocha latte. The calories count of Madison\u2019s breakfast exceeded Jeff\u2019s by at least 800.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA similar pattern followed during the rest of the day. At lunch Jeff went to his private room and had a tuna sandwich with cottage cheese and milk. Madison joined Cassie, Ginger and Megan for spaghetti and meatballs with green beans and a roll plus pie for dessert.  In the late afternoon Madison did her usual workout, and then reward herself with a couple of energy bars. That evening she enjoyed sharing meatloaf and peas with mashed potatoes prepared by Cassie, who also had a store bought lemon cakes for dessert. Jeff by contrast had microwave beef stroganoff and tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had now been four weeks into their relationship and Jeff wondered how much progress he had made.  He got on the scale and found that he had lost six pounds, a fact that he proudly reported to Madison at the outset of their next workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d she replied. \u201cKeep that up and within a yeas you\u2019ll be under 250!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen their session was over Jeff informed her that he\u2019d chosen a restaurant for them for Saturday night \u2013 the Olive Garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison\u2019s eyes lit up. She loved Italian food and she was happy to see Jeff taking the initiative. She accepted instantly, and then remembered a conversation she\u2019d had with Cassie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the way,\u201d she asked, \u201cwould you be free for a homemade upper Monday?  My roommate thinks I need to make dinner for you, her and a friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff started to freeze up and say no, but instead overcame his fear and agreed, wondering what Madison might do. That Monday he found out: an English menu featuring Cornish game hens with garlic and rosemary preceded by a Waldorf salad and accompanied by green beans and creamy whipped potatoes with cheese. The dessert was a surprise \u2013 Boston cr\u00e8me pie, a dish not normally associated with the English but rather the colonialists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat impressed Jeff, however, was the vigor of the conversation and seeming indifference to his size by all present. This pattern repeated itself for the next two months, at which time Madison reported to Mrs Green that Jeff was progressing nicely \u2013 having lost twenty pounds and becoming increasing sociable. She was rewarded with a $500 bonus, a fact she quickly communicated to her Father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Green was communicating as well, advising Jeff\u2019s father of the success of giving his son a personal trainer, whom she noted \u201cis possibly becoming attached at a personal level as well. They\u2019ve dated a few times and I think she may have added some of what Jeff has lost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact Madison had gained 12 pounds in as many weeks, but hadn\u2019t formally checked. She. could tell that her stomach was softer and her skirts tighter. She knew that she and Cassie had both gained weight but it didn\u2019t seem significant. She just bought larger size clothes and trusted her Dad to deal with her mom when she found out.  As for Jeff, he too could tell that she had thickened a little but didn\u2019t care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe date at the Olive Garden had gone well. Madison, knowing Jeff\u2019s background and international goals, had been checking out websites for news about geopolitics, multi-national corporations and economic trends.  She used this knowledge get Jeff to talk about these topics, which she found interesting. Jeff shared this news with his Father, also mentioning his weight loss and crediting his personal trainer. Mr Wilson was pleased to see his son share this with him \u2013 for much of his life Jeff had been somewhat of a mama\u2019s boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff\u2019s mother, however, was not so sanguine, Upon discovering Mrs Green\u2019s report she demanded that her husband find out about this Madison Kraft and break up her relationship with Jeff.  Mr Wilson did have Madison checked out but after assurances from Jeff that she had no idea of their family wealth and that the relationship was entirely platonic at this point he declined to jump in. He was, in fsct, proud to see his son pulling away from his mother and finding himself by developing what appeared to be a healthy relationship.  He also discovered that Madison\u2019s family was worth close to $20 million, so she wasn\u2019t likely looking for his son\u2019s money. In fact. Mrs Green assured him that the relationship began at her instigation \u2013 Madison initially had resisted even getting involved.. Both she and Jeff pledged that they had not told Madison anything about the family\u2019s business or the Wilson\u2019s relationship to Powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Wilson wasn\u2019t that easily placated. She had kept her son out of normal social circles for eighteen years by indulging his gastronomic tendencies and she was loathe to surrender control. Maybe Madison wasn\u2019t a fortune hunting floozy but she wasn\u2019t good enough for her son because Mrs, Wilson hadn\u2019t chosen her. She was determined to either buy or scare Madison off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff and Madison of course were oblivious to this developing drama. Jeff continued losing about a pound and a half per week and Madison kept gaining around a pound in the same time frame up to the holiday season. Cassie and the other dorm mates were gaining some as well.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After making her report to Mrs Green Madison called her Father and shred her feelings about Jeff and his progress.  The upbeat report was tempered by a concern of her own \u2013 it was hard to elude the dietary habits of the dorm and frankly she really hadn\u2019t tried or wanted to. It wasn\u2019t all that much, yet, but she knew if her mom was upset about her having a fat boyfriend she would likely be apoplectic about her becoming a plumper herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Kraft sighed. He knew his wife\u2019s attitude towards weight and kept himself trim to placate it. He personally didn\u2019t care and wished she could let up a bit. Thanks to her private school experience Madison knew more about conditioning and nutrition than most married women and he was willing to let her run her own life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, we both know your mother\u2019s feelings on this and I wish it weren\u2019t so.,\u201d he replied.\u201d But your education and happiness are the important things, not being tied to us because, truthfully, we won\u2019t always be around. I think you and I are just going to have to make it plain that family is more important than conforming on every little point. I\u2019ll do what I can to mollify things here \u2013 and if she hassles you just be kind. I don\u2019t want you taking off and waitressing incognito in Missoula, Montana.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison laughed.  Such an overreaction was the kind of things she knew some kids did, but she wasn\u2019t that stupid and she knew it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust be sure your report card is great and I think I can give some perspective here\u201d he answered on a more practical level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison chuckled. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Most of my tests and reports have been A\u2019s and nothing below a B. And you know I\u2019m not taking simple courses.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad to hear it,\u201d her Dad replied. \u201cNext time you guzzle a frappachino remember that I\u2019m rooting for you \u2013 and Jeff.!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison caught that last reference and smiled. Her Dad really was in her corner.  The next time she and Jeff went out she shared with him the situation with her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like we both have a similar problem\u201d he remarked. \u201cMy dad wishes us the best too, but my Mom is giving he and I a hard time.  We have a tidy amount of assets in our family and I think she doesn\u2019t believe a fat guy like me can attract a woman who doesn\u2019t have dollar signs in her eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the first time Jeff had referred to his family\u2019s assets and Madison knew she had to speak wisely without divulging all that she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell. My family\u2019s not exactly poor you know.\u201d Madison retorted with a touch of exasperation in her voice. \u201cYou may drive a BMW because your family can afford to buy it for you, just like they are paying for you to have a place of your own, so sure I know you are well off. But I figured that out after I was already assigned to work with you by Mrs Green. Does your mom know that? Your family is probably richer than mine but we pay our own way and that\u2019s no part of our relationship as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa there,\u201d Jeff backed p. \u201cI know all that. But like you and our moms  she\u2019s not me. No one is going to be good enough for her until she decides it is I\u2019m afraid \u2013 just like with you. Luckily my Dad is more like yours. He\u2019s glad I\u2019ve found a friend to share things with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy Dad\u2019s half-afraid that if my Mom pushes too hard I might just rebel and drop out of college and disappear, but that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Madison declared. \u201cI\u2019m here to get an education and I\u2019ll choose my associations for myself. And honestly I think we\u2019ve helped one another.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff paused, wondering how he could be helping Madison, but he well knew  what she had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, thanks,\u201d he stammered. \u201cbut how am I helping you\u201d You\u2019re the trainer who\u2019s helped inspire me to peel off the pounds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, which I\u2019m getting paid to do so chalk one up for Maddie, even if at the same time I\u2019ve been letting my dorm mates add a few to me I\u2019m afraid..\u201d Madison answered. \u201cBut do you think I\u2019d be reading Forbes, Inc, the Wall Steet Journal and the Economist if it weren\u2019t for having to keep pace with an information junkie with a photographic memory? Or did you think I just pick up the things we talk about from MTV? You are part of the force behind my good grades because you set your own bar so high. We are helping one another and I appreciate it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light bulb went on in Jeff\u2019s head. Madison was right \u2013 trivia he\u2019d shared that bored most others she was usually able to build on, either countering with more information or asking an intelligent question. They always seemed to be talking and sharing, mostly on semi-serious topics that were over most women\u2019s heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t do this before you met me?\u201d he inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve always read a lot, but not with the focus I have now, I can\u2019t say where our relationship goes after my assignment from Mrs Green runs out. That will be up to you. But its challenged me and I appreciate challenges,\u201d Madison answered. \u201cYou are kind, intelligent and whatever happens you\u2019re a person I\u2019ll always be glad to have known\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Jeff felt like telling Madison the truth \u2013 that he wanted their relationship to grow, not end after the contract period.  But although she\u2019d practically invited him to admit this he still lacked the confidence to believe that a hottie like her could care for someone as big as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a beautiful person, Madison,\u201d he murmured softly. \u201cYou could gain a hundred pounds and it wouldn\u2019t change who you re \u2013 and all I can say for now is \u2018thank you.\u2019  If I\u2019ve been half the help to you that you\u2019ve been to me all I can say is I appreciate it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison nodded softly.  Jeff managed to shift the conversation as their entrees arrived and the evening  ended pleasantly, but with both parties realizing that they needed the freedom within their families to chart their own futures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Jeff called his Father and told him point blank that he thought his mom and Madison needed a meet-up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know it will be rough, but you\u2019ve checked her out and know I\u2019m not nuts. She may or not be the one I marry some day but Mom needs to reconcile herself to the fact that I\u2019m growing up and can make my own decisions, \u201c he asserted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Wilson was surprised at his son\u2019s forcefulness but knew he was right. His wife was fighting Grecian chimeras based on fear,  Madison deserved to compete on a more level playing field. He agreed to come to Powers during the holiday break and let Madison meet his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Jeff told Madison what he\u2019d done. \u201cMy dad will protect me and your job, so don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve told him I\u2019m ready to go to the mat on this \u2013 not to Timbuktu like your mom fears, but she either accepts my hoice of friends or rejects me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadisdon inhaled.  She appreciated Jeff\u2019s zeal, which she knew meant he probably shared some of her feelings and hopes. But she also knew the fury of a woman thwarted and didn\u2019t want as an enemy. She didn\u2019t even know the lady after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, I guess I should say thanks, \u201c Madison said thoughtfully. \u201c But if there\u2019s going to be a meeting it should be on terms and a venue we control, not her. I\u2019m sure that she\u2019s used to manipulating and I want to be realistic. You know my culinary abilities, why don\u2019t I cook her a meal that even a professional chef would admit takes skill?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, like what?\u2019 Jeff asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about a decadent and delicious beef wellington?\u201d Madison mused. \u201cI\u2019ve done it three times before and it takes hours, but with a mustard crusted filet mignon, wild mushroom duxelles, homemade duck pate, puff pastry, chive mashed potato, and veggies with a salad I\u2019m sure she hasn\u2019t had anything more elegant!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cYou  can do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will be two weeks until they arrive. Should I do a practice run this Sunday just to convince you?\u201d she offered. \u201cI think you mentioned she is a BBW who enjoys good food, so it should go well, especially when she sees Cassie and I aren\u2019t exactly models right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI keep telling you to stop making remarks like that \u2013 you look fine,\u201d grumped Jeff, \u201cbut you\u2019re right about her appreciation of fancy dishes.  If you\u2019re confidant I say go for it! Oh, by the way, she has a thing about cr\u00e8me brulee for dessert. \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison skipped the Beef Wellington dry run but had to coax Cassie into serving as her assistant for the evening. She also had to come to terms with herself. It was mid-December and both roommates knew they\u2019d gained past the Freshman 15 at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison felt her body was the firmer of the two. She knew she had the conditioned abs of one who had taken karate classes beneath the soft layer of flesh that now covered her torso. She noticed Cassie\u2019s chin filling in and suspected she was doing the same. Another twenty pounds and both would both display full fledged facial tributes to their indulgent life style. That was an issue she might eventually have to address with her mother, but Mrs. Wilson was the immediate challenge and another matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Madison herself felt about her new physique was the question. She stood before the full length mirror in the workout room\u2019s changing area. She honestly didn\u2019t see that much difference \u2013 perhaps two pounds on each of her thighs, another four on her upper body, leaving maybe ten for her belly which she felt looked noticeably rounder but not bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew the cause. As a trainer she was limiting 6\u20194\u201d Jeff to 3000 calories a day. She knew her own maintenance limit should be around 1800 based on her weight age and activity level.  But she had been consuming around 2500, meaning that she was gaining around pound per weak. Extended to a balance point meant she was headed for a truly chunky 230+.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had been a case of conscious permission. She initially allowed herself to indulge while helping Jeff, not wanting her to be waving a restricted menu in her face. It was also a point of freedom from her mom\u2019s monitoring, which she had tolerated for years but not appreciated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie and the girls in the dorm certainly were trending up hemselves, which made Madison more comfortable with her current habits. Megan had found a source for French vanilla flavored coffee in half gallon containers which Cassie kept stocked. Thursday was pizza night. And then there were the weekly dozen snack cakes Madison herself kept bringing from Jeff\u2019s place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cI\u2019d be as round as Vikki Arnold at that point,\u201d </i>she remarked to herself  about her projection, thinking of one of the heaviest girls she\u2019d known at her private high school  Vikki carried her weight well and exercised, but she\u2019d never been into conditioning and karate like Madison. Yet no one seemed to think of Vikki as ugly or a pariah because she dressed well and had a positive disposition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Vikki and Madison shared was a love of food, preparing as well as eating it. Vikki was a self proclaimed gourmand but Madison held back from indulging for fear of her mom.  But now she considered her body as Jeff, who had said she could weigh a hundred pounds more if she wanted, might see it. Wouldn\u2019t someone big like him, even down to 250 as they were striving for, be balanced by a partner with some heft?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cThat would be eighty more pounds \u2013 probably 25 in my thighs and butt, 25 on my torso and arms plus thirty in my belly. Mom would have a cow!\u201d </i>Madison thought. <i>\u201cBut if I could do it with Vikki\u2019s attitude and keep my muscle structure it wouldn\u2019t be the end of the world to weigh that much. I think I can defer crossing that Rubicon for a few more months</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she donned her clothes and headed back for the dorm determined to do her best with Mrs. Wilson.  She understood her to be a somewhat militant BBW who apparently liked keeping her son big. Madison suspected this was so that he wouldn\u2019t be sucked in by some self-absorbed sylph. She suspected Mrs Wilson wanted an arranged marriage that would reflect the parties social standing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew the kind of empty headed cotillion types Jeff\u2019s mom probably had  in mind. They were shallow and quiescent, not what Madison felt Jeff either needed or wanted. She knew that the challenge was to prove herself as an individual and break down the fear-induced bubble Mrs Wilson had created for herself around Jeff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison over the short two weeks used her resources to prepare. She bought both Cassie and herself new clothes for the evening.  They accentuated their larger figures in a complimentary fashion as Madison presumed Mrs. Wilson did.  They had their hair done as well, then decorated the dining room in the theme of an elegant private room in a swank caf\u00e9. She was setting a stage without telling Jeff too much and spending the entire ay in the kitchen..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff picked his parents up at the airport around noon and took them to lunch enroute to their hotel. He was dressed nicely for his oversized frame and his father gave him credit for sprucing up. His mom, however, couldn\u2019t help but probe and dig, asking why Madison hadn\u2019t accompanied him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wanted to see you myself first,\u201d he half-lied. The truth was that the preparations for the fancy Beef Wellington dinner precluded Madison from coming and he knew this was her show.  But he also wanted to spend some quality time with his parents. After checking in and resting at the local Marriott they headed for the campus where Mr. Wilson had attended classes thirty years before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dorm where Madison and Cassie had their suite wasn\u2019t familiar to the senior Wilson, being only twelve years old, but the older buildings brought back fond memories. When they knocked on the girl\u2019s door a large-framed Cassie greeted them and for a moment Mrs. Wilson though this was Madison.  But then Cassie introduced herself and escorted the trio into a candlelit room with subdued lighting from candles that reminded him of a cabaret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMadison will be out in a moment,\u201c she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any liquor of course but there is a choice of tea, soda or water \u2013 and we do have appetizers.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Wilson took her seat, already thrown off her game by the unexpected atmosphere and display of hospitality. She was used to being in control in social matters and it was obvious someone else was calling the shots here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Madison made her entrance, with Jeff immediately rising to greet her.  They exchanged smiles and he presented her to his parents.  Madison reached out and grabbed Mrs Wilson\u2019s forearm with one hand and shook her palm with the other. Next she turned and gave Mr Wilson a more traditional handshake.  Jeff\u2019s mother observed Madison\u2019s thickening waist line and thought \u201c<i>fitness instructor? This girl could well be as big as me in time!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeated around the table Madison first tried alternating questions to each parent, but while Mr Wilson answered at length his wife was terse and, while not totally cold, obviously not that friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued as Cassie served the meal in four courses. Madison adroitly got Mr Wilson to talking about his business. She surprised him with questions about the American dollar losing its status as the world\u2019s reserve currency and its possible successors; she also drew him out on the practice of multi-nationals to use countries like Ireland as tax havens. Jeff chimed in and the three built a quick bond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch of this was completely over Mrs Wilson\u2019s head. Her forte was social benefit work in various charities, not business, which Madison knew. But even when she brought up the philanthropy of the Heinz and Gates families Mrs Wilson wouldn\u2019t open up. Her mind was swirling trying to regain control against someone who had obviously done her homework.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff was quietly amazed at Madison\u2019s skill in leading the conversation and for awhile played along with the interchange.  Finally, however, he brought the subject back to the meal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, I hope you enjoyed the Beef Wellington tonight. I think it must of surprised you to find food like is in a dormitory setting,\u201d he remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I must say it was outstanding. Madison, I must compliment you on your resourcefulness in finding such a good caterer to prepare this dinner,\u201d Mrs Wilson said, meaning to be complimentary<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this remark Cassie nearly gagged trying to stifle her laughter. Madison as well struggled to keep from grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErr, mom,\u201d Jeff corrected. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t done by a caterer. Madison probably took eight hours to prepare it herself. She learned culinary arts at a private high school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Mr Wilson\u2019s turn to suppress a grin at his wife\u2019s gaffe,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d stammered Mrs Wilson, \u201cI never dreamed \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this where I\u2019m supposed to suggest the men retire to the kitchen and help with the dishes?\u201d Cassie interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that might be a good idea,\u201d agreed Jeff, motioning to his Father. \u201cI think mom and Madison need to talk alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the kitchen Jeff offered his Father a seat saying, \u201cactually Cassie and I can handle the cleanup \u2013 there\u2019s really not room for three of us around the dishwasher.\u201d <br>\r\n,<br>\r\n\u201cWell, all right,\u201d said Mr. Wilson to his son, following orders. \u201cBut I\u2019m not too proud to pitch in and do a share.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mr. Wilson\u2019s ear was close to the door to the living room where his wife was alone with his son\u2019s girl friend \u2013 for that is what he felt Madison truly was, whether either of them were formally admitting it. There in the makeshift caf\u00e9 Madison reached out to Mrs Wilson, who had a full view of the Freshman co-ed\u2019s developing muffin top and the food baby from the evening meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cDoes this girl even realize what is happening to her</i>?\u201d the hefty social matron wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMrs Wilson,\u201d Madison began, \u201cI think you know that you\u2019re here tonight because Jeff and I share a common problem. We\u2019re busy getting an education and trying to find ourselves as adults. That\u2019s what teens entering college all do. But we\u2019re finding that our mothers, from two quite different perspectives, are fearful that our relationship is going to upset their elders dream's for their cherished little darlings. The message of this evening and display \u2013 the formal setting, the special menu, the level of conversation is simple: we\u2019re not crazy and we\u2019re not kids anymore. Why can\u2019t we be allowed our freedom and still have our families trust?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I entirely follow you,\u201d responded Mrs Wilson defensively..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, now, that Jeff comes from money and you rightfully fear gold diggers. But this is Powers University, where your husband and his father attended.  Their family I\u2019ve discovered helped build some of the buildings here.  But that information didn\u2019t come from Jeff, He and I got started as students without me having a clue \u2013 and frankly, although not as much as you probably, my family had to pay cash for me just like you did for Jeff. We\u2019re both too rich for scholarships and loans. Why do you think my parents  wanted me in a private college instead of Florida State? They have the same peer concerns as you and your husband.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess that makes some sense,\u201d Mrs Wilson conceded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe truth,\u201d Madison said drawing a deep breath, \u201cis that I wanted some freedom from their purse strings. That meant earning spending money of my own without it showing up on the family credit card. That\u2019s why I grabbed at the first work opportunity that showed up - and its not the first time I've had a job, by the way. I expected to be coaching a group like I\u2019ve done before, but instead got assigned to your son never having met him. And I had to have my arm twisted to do it \u2013 just ask Mrs Green. I know she sends reports to your husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry about that,\u201d Mrs Wilson replied, \u201cbut you have to understand our concern \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I understand, don\u2019t worry. She works for you and your husband just like I indirectly do. I know my salary and bonus aren\u2019t coming from the normal college budget. It was a special arrangement for a benefactor,  just like Jeff\u2019s special dorm room.  That, incidentally, was the first real tip-off to me as to where you\u2019re coming from. The thing is, we were already more than trainer and pupil by then. We\u2019d become friends \u2013 something I\u2019ve had a lot of, but Jeff not so much. But my mother, like you, worries when she shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d bristled Mrs Wilson, \u201cMy Jeff would never harm \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d exclaimed Madison, \u201cbut he\u2019s a big guy and my mom doesn\u2019t get that larger people are still human. I think she\u2019s afraid I\u2019ll follow his eating habits, turn into a cow and be miserable \u2013 which is ridiculous. Fat people can be just as happy and productive as anyone, as we both know, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Wilson had donated family funds to size acceptance groups, something Madison knew from her Dad. She was hoping to elicit confirmation on this as a basis for discussion, but there was no response.  Madison continued to deconstruct the biases in Mrs Wilson\u2019s mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeff will tell you, and it is true, that I\u2019ve never discussed your family\u2019s money with him or asked him for a dime. Nor has he inquired about mine or taken a penny. It wouldn\u2019t be polite and it is not what our relationship is based on. But I think you fear it could be. That tells me that you don\u2019t know me at all and came here with a very preconceived image. I hope that what you\u2019ve seen tonight changes that image \u2013 showing you a little of what Jeff and his Dad already know - I'm my own person with a brain, a number of skills and hopefully a good heart for the right man someday. But I'm not looking and you need to stop suspecting what's not there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeaning?\u201d queried Mrs Wilson, who wasn\u2019t used to being lectured to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat neither Jeff or I are stereotypical anythings and deserve to be judged for who we are, not against some imaginary standard. It may be scary for you, and my mom as well, but like it or not we\u2019re going to decide in due time where our future lies.\u201d Madison continued. \u201c And right now we\u2019re both a long way from that decision because we both have degrees to earn first. I think our report cards this semester will illustrate where our current priorities are. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Wilson had no response; instead she shifted to the issue that was wedged in her mind \u2013 Madison\u2019s girth, the thing Mrs Kraft had as a issue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are aware, my dear, that your weight right now is where I was some thirty plus years ago. Your mother\u2019s fears aren\u2019t entirely unfounded,\u201d countered Mrs. Wilson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been enjoying dorm life and my own decisions have added a few, tht's true,\u201d replied Madison. \u201cFrankly it doesn\u2019t bother me \u2013or Jeff. I don\u2019t think it will ever get to the point that it will, but if it does it will be my problem to deal with then. For right now I\u2019m helping Jeff lose to 250, not worrying about how much I exceed 150.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo then you do know you\u2019ve passed that point?\u201d Mrs Wilson answered with some surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c154 last week before I bought this outfit for tonight,\u201d Madison confessed. \u201cYou can imagine what my mom would be saying if she knew. Fortunately my Dad calls the shots and doesn\u2019t share her view.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish you well in regards to dealing with her, my dear,\u201d answered Mrs, Wilson, \u201cbut I can see there is nothing I can do to influence you regarding Jeff \u2013 and for now his father is backing him just like your\u2019s is you.  You have shown me that you at least aren\u2019t what I feared you might be.  Beyond that I guess there is nothing else to say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes there is,\u201d responded Madison with a grin, \u201cwe sent the men to the kitchen before dessert. I think its time for that now - do you like Cr\u00e8me Brule?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Wilson smiled.  \u201cAlways my dear, always. How did you know?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think so.\u201d Replied Madison as she began disrobing.  \u201cIn persuading her to let Jeff fly on his own without her protective wings, probably not completely. People usually don\u2019t do a 180 degree turn overnight,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you know her husband probably heard the entire conversation,\u201d asked Cassie. \u201cHe was positioned near the door while Jeff and I were working and it was slightly ajar. I think he heard every word.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK by me. I just didn\u2019t want him in the room where she could use him for back-up,\u201d answered Madison as she took in her roommate\u2019s corpulent physique, which she recognized likely mirrored her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder what he and Jeff will say when they compare notes?\u201d mused Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore important is when he and his wife compare I would think,\u201d answered Cassie as she took in Madison\u2019s expanding stomach..She couldn\u2019t help but wonder why Madison seemed either unaware or entirely disinterested in the weight both they and the rest of the dorm ad been accumulating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever, shrugged Madison. \u201cThanks for your efforts \u2013 I owe you a few favors.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at the Marriott, Mrs Wilson was retiring and Jeff was with his Dad alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me,\u201d Mr Wilson asked, \u201cis that girl as brainy as she seems? \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust about,\u201d Jeff chuckled. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have our photographic memory but has a great retention rate on whatever she focuses on. We\u2019re in a duel for top grade in two of our classes. But she\u2019s more of a social mixer than me \u2013 which is why I wonder why she\u2019s been so supportive of a shy recluse like me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause she\u2019s the type of person who\u2019s loathe to give up on a challenge, She expects success and that takes perseverance. You do know that she has a record of such things, right?\u201d asked Mr. Wilson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dUh, not really. What are you talking about?\u201d Answered Jeff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s at Powers partially because of her record in last year\u2019s Academic Decathlon - - ten subjects shared with a team working together, Mr Wilson informed Jeff. \u201c Hers was one of the top five in the country. That\u2019s why I wasn\u2019t that surprised at her showing off tonight \u2013 she does her research and can think o her feet. She played your Mother like the old vaudevillians did their crowds. Amazing!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me \u2013 she plays me like an instrument at times too, but never with malice. She just gently persuades,\u201d answered Jeff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s also coached three groups in high school \u2013one with disabilities. I suspect you didn\u2019t know that either,\u201d his dad continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but I can tell your investigation has been thorough.  What do you know about the Krafts overall?\u201d Jeff inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonest, respectable, financially independent, probably in the low seven figures. She is a chip off her Father\u2019s block it looks like.\u201d Mr Wilson commented. \u201cYou have a firecracker on your hands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t think I\u2019m not aware of it. Why she has devoted so much to me given my issues is strange, but I think I\u2019ve been emerging out of a cave.\u201d Jeff observed.  \u201cI just wonder whether she\u2019ll still care for me as a person once we\u2019ve reached our goals.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want that, don\u2019t you?\u201d probed his Dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I think I might. But she\u2019s got family issues just like I do, so who knows?\u201d Jeff groused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll work it out, son.  After what I heard tonight she\u2019s in your corner for the long haul.  I\u2019ll be the first to say you could choose worse \u2013 she\u2019s a gem!\u201d Mr Wilson stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day as the Wilson\u2019s boarded the family\u2019s jet to fly home Mrs Wilson was abnormally subdued. Her husband knew to let her be with her thoughts.  About a hour later she came to his lounge chair aboard the plane and sat down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have been rather overprotective, haven\u2019t  I?\u201d she stated rhetorically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEaglets must fly out of the nest sometime my dear. I\u2019ve abided by your wishes and left Jeff\u2019s upbringing to you but I think the time has come to let him fend for himself. I think you sense that as well,\u201d he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot willingly, but you\u2019re right. She stood up for them just like I once did for you and us,\u201d Mrs Wilson recalled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I noticed that,\u201d he replied with a gentle smile. \u201cActually I was able to hear most of what you both said. She tried to focus on the two of them rather than critiquing you. I think she wants you as an ally, not an adversary.\u201d Mr Wilson observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I believe that\u2019s accurate. Her interest is in him, not us or our money. That much was obvious,\u201d she admitted. \u201cand she even knows that interest is going to likely make her get larger as a result \u2013 which I know you won\u2019t mind. I wonder if Jeff shares your level of FA appreciation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith someone who can cook like that?  I don\u2019t think its an issue.  So we\u2019re going to keep hands off?\u201d he inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try to. Maybe you\u2019ll need to help by being more involved with me, \u201c she said, reaching over and pulling him towards her.  He responded with a fond hug.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The following week, Jeff texted Madison about going to breakfast, it was something they did semi-frequently, and after the week of good workouts, Jeff thought that he would show Madison his commitment to losing weight by getting oatmeal that she had introduced him to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison met Jeff in the dinning hall wearing sweatpants and a sweater. Her hair was up, and he assumed that she just got out of bed. This wasn't abnormal for college students grabbing a Saturday morning breakfast, so Jeff did not put much thought into it. When Madison sat down, he noticed that their plates looked much different. On his, a bowl of oatmeal with some strawberries that he cut up, on her's bacon and pancakes. It struck him as odd that she deviated this much from it. When he asked about it, he was somewhat surprised by Madison's almost defensive answer,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I figure that I can just eat really light for the rest of the day,\" she said, as she went for the second out of 6 greasy pieces of bacon. For Madison, this was something that she actually intended to do. The rest of breakfast was uneventful, but with the workout in the afternoon, they both knew they would see each other again that day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Madison had gotten some new clothes, she neglected to purchase new workout clothes. She figured they were stretchy, and had a lot of give, so she would have had to gain a significant amount of weight for them to get too tight.  However, given what she gained while eating all those meals with Jeff's family and the indulging since then, she was at 165 pounds, a gain of 35 pounds, and it showed in her workout gear.  She had shorts in her high school colors that she loved, but it was clearly time to graduate from the small that gave her a bad set of love handles and a muffin top, not to mention how much larger her thighs looked in the short athletic shorts.  Additionally, she now had to constantly pull her t-shirt down when workout out with Jeff.  Her belly, now lacked any of the former firmness that it once had. Luckily, her shirt was sleeveless, but at the same time, that also showed that her arms looked just a bit bigger as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jeff came to workout, now down to 310 pounds, he noticed that his instructor looked like she was falling out of her clothes. Of course, he would not be able to tell if she was actually out of shape, because she had long since stopped working out, instead almost preforming as a spotter for him while he went through exercises. However, it was working, and Jeff was losing weight, although he wondered at this pace, if Madison would be in a class like this next year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their joint workout session, Madison retired to the women's locker room, <i>Jeff really seems to be making progress</i> she thought as she sat down to take off her shoes, which caused her belly to show out the bottom of her too tight shirt. Just then she got a tap on the shoulder, she turned around to see a random girl there, who was wearing only a sports bra and yoga pants, showing off her six pack and ripped body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's great to see you're trying to get into better shape!\" The girl said to Madison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're here working out, it's the first step. I just wanted to come by and give you a card for my classes!\" Before Madison could cut her off, the girl continued. \"Whether you've gained your freshman 15, or just looking to finally start working out, I can help you craft a plan that fits your goals!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was shocked. This girl saw her and assumed that she was one of those girls who needed that kind of help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I actually teach one of these myself.\" Madison said to the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really??\" She asked, genuinely shocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm. Yes.\" The situation had become terminally awkward for each of them. This random girl then finished with a \"well...good luck with your class, I'm going to go hit the track,\" and quickly tried to leave the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison sat there dumbfounded. It was not like she was huge! Heck, other people had gained 35 pounds before. However, this was a moment for Madison that left self doubt with her. She could no longer be considered skinny by any stretch or generous application of the word, she was actually looking a bit chubby and currently was getting no favors from her clothes, which now felt even more tight in her current state of peer-caused comfortableness. Madison quickly left the locker room, failing to even shower, so she could leave the gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole experience made Madison suddenly realize what was happening to her body, and second guess herself. She thought about all the awesome clothes she had that had in high school that she had no shot of fitting in right now.  Then she realized that going to the beach in Miami was going to be a whole other issue.  <i>What is Lindsey going to think?</i> Madison thought, wondering about her hot, 5'7 110 pound, blonde, rail of a best friend from high school. She could be a bit more vain then Madison, and Madison assumed that her judgement would be harsh as well. She also realized that any thoughts of her Mom laying off her about her figure would also be wishful thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that moment, Madison decided that she needed to place an emphasis on keeping her weight in check that she never had to before. However, her new lifestyle had also taught her some bad habits. </span></div></div>",

Madison initially went to a running store, since she figured that they would have a wider range of sizes, something she never had to consider. When Madison got to the store, she was a bit sad to see that as she moved away from the smaller sizes, the clothes seemed to have a bit less selection, or seemed to be for a slightly more middle aged crowd. Regardless, she picked up some size 12 athletic shorts, medium shirts, and larger sports bras, something that was becoming as equally necessary as her new shorts. <i>Ok, these are only temporary</i> Madison thought to herself, still hoping to get back down to 135 pounds.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Madison checked out and turned around, she noticed that she was the largest girl in the store. Of course, it was a running store, so everyone there happened to workout frequently, but it still made Madison insecure about her growing figure.  These feels of slight stress were alleviated when she walked past a cinnamon role stand. She had never frequented one before, but in her moment of weakness, she decided to try it. After waiting in line, with people larger than herself-- she noted, Madison ordered a classic roll. She was amazed with how simultaneously sweet and rich it was, and almost had to watch herself so as not to be too noticeably freaking out over how good her treat was.  As Madison was walking back to campus, she thought again, <i>That was delicious, maybe there would be upsides to just thinking, 'screw it' and giving up on my figure</i> something she did not seriously consider, but nonetheless, a thought that would have been unthinkable before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff, on the other hand, had been working out hard, and watching what he ate, and lost another 5 pounds, bringing him down to 305. He was beginning to see differences, and was excited to pass the psychological  barrier of getting below 300 pounds, a place he had not been for a while. Whereas Madison was finding herself indulging frequently, Jeff was doing the opposite. He was continuing to give the sweets that his mom gave him to Madison and Cassi, who happily (if not regretfully, later) ate them. Unlike Madison, he felt his clothes getting looser, and was looking forward to having to buy new, smaller clothes, ones that he also hoped were necessary, but for the reason that we wanted to lose more weight.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the encounter with a would-be training coach in the gym, the same job she was doing for Jeff, Madison was understandably conflicted. She began a process of going back and forth on accepting her gain. Her immediate response had been to text Jeff, whom she was feeling closer to all the time.  Jeff for his own part was getting past his own weight issues and beginning to think of he and Madison as friends with possible long-term options of more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff looked at the text and sensed Madison\u2019s need to talk, but knew its shouldn\u2019t be on campus. He invited her to join him at at an Indian cuisine restaurant known both for its exotic flavors and a moderately priced all you can eat  buffet. There aromas from the medley of tandoori chicken, lamb shahi korma,  flavored lentils, basmati rice prepared pileau style and delicately spiced curries quickly counteracted the emotional impact of the gym encounter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Madison needed reassurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you don\u2019t care, Jeff, and that\u2019s a good thing for my ego,\u201d she said, wrestling for the right words,  \u201cbut when I\u2019m mistaken for a fitness candidate it means others can tell I\u2019m becoming a fat girl.  There, now I\u2019ve said it \u2013 fat girl, even as I enjoy this luscious curry with yogurt, garlic, ginger and who knows what spices. The girls in my dorm are all getting chubbier by the week with stuff and I\u2019m liking it more than I should. Now its being noticed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff smiled. \u201cAnd you say this to someone who outweighs you by well over a hundred pounds?  Pardon me for suppressing a grine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison had to blink herself, the contrast was indeed so stark.  Jeff truly was a heavyweight, so why was she the she so upset?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThe truth Maddie, if I can call you that, is that you\u2019re right. I\u2019ve always seen you as beautiful. Whatever amount you\u2019ve added has only enhanced that view.  If you feel comfortable with yourself what should the opinion of some stranger even matter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Madison admitted. \u201cLogically I know that.  Cassie only cares about how her weight gain is inflating her breasts. She\u2019s from a frmtown where big people rule. The rest of the dorm doesn\u2019t seem to care. But I know that eventually I have to go back to Coral Gables.  There new fat girl me must face Mama, Lindsey and others who knew me before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour mom we\u2019ve discussed [- she\u2019ll come around with your Dad\u2019s involvement.  But who is this Lindsey?\u201d Jeff inquired,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne of the skinniest people you\u2019ll ever meet.  Nice to others but so appearance conscious! She\u2019s emailed me about going to the beach this summer. It scares me to think of her reaction to me in a bathing suit,\u201d Madison responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you should prepare her- if she\u2019s a true friend she shouldn\u2019t care if you don\u2019t. And if she\u2019s not a true friend, then shouldn\u2019t you know it?\u201d Jeff suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison took a bite of the luscious shahi korma lamb, drenched in cream sauce with nuts.  Her tastebuds exploded in a fit of ecstasy and she sighed, \u201cyou\u2019re probably right.I \u2018m definitely not wanting to dine on watercress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaddie, I\u2019m the one who\u2019s hired a trainer to lose weight, let\u2019s not forget that, You may have gained some but you\u2019re not really that big.  Be yourself and enjoy life,\u201d Jeff cajoled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d replied Madison. \u201cLet\u2019s have some mango kulfi for dessert and I\u2019ll check out Lindsey instead of beating up anymore on myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling better as Jeff took her home Madison determined to call Lindsey as soon as possible \u2013 but when she arrived Cassie was just cleaning up and they got to talking.  Cassie concurred with Jeff\u2019s view \u2013 after all, she outweighed Madison by thirty pounds so if Madison was fat that would sake Cassie a whale \u2013 something Cassie wasn\u2019t about to concede even as she edged towards 200.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the next evening when Madison texted Lindsey and asked if she could call.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure \u2013 only 9:30 here,\u201d came the quick reply from two time zones east.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison took a deep breath before punching in the numbers to call. She knew she\u2019d porked out again that day. She\u2019d had French toast for breakfast and a Thai pasta salad at lunch only to find Cassie preparing lasagna for supper.  That always meant ice cream for dessert.  Madison knew where her pounds were coming from; she just didn\u2019t have the motivation to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Lindsey,\u201d she began cheerily enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi yourself,\u201d came the reply.l \u201cYou sound good \u2013 I was worried something had happened.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, actually it has. OK i guess i need to just come out and say it. I\u2019ve been obsessing over coming home because there\u2019s so much more of me now than when I left and you\u2019ve been talking about going to the beach.  Lindsey, I don\u2019t want to be harpooned!\u201d gushed Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause, then Lindsey said softly \u201cand I\u2019m supposed to react to this how?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re so disciplined with your eating and I\u2019m just not right now. I don\u2019t want to be blasted,\u201d  Madison confessed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother pause, then Lindsey said, \u201cOh girl, you never did figure it out did you?  Well, maybe I should be happy for that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Madison.  This wasn\u2019t the conversation sher\u2019d anticipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMadison, you\u2019ve always outweighed me by over thirty pounds and it never mattered. If its more than that now what makes you think I\u2019ll care? I know I put up a fa\u00e7ade about eating so little so people will think I want to be a stick, but that\u2019s an act. I\u2019m not skinny because I\u2019m disciplined and want to be. I\u2019m sick but cover it up as much as I can.  I fool a lot of people, including apparently you,\u201d related Lindsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhaaa\u2026 what d you mean sick?\u201d stammered Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a chronic endocrinal thing. If I eat more than about a thousand calories in a day my body heats up, I get sweaty and after a couple of hours may even shake \u2013 then come the chills and sleepiness until things return to normal. That\u2019s why I eat so little and rely on supplements,\u201d explained Lindsey. \u201cI wish I could eat like you and others, but I probably can\u2019t even have kids.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Lindsey,\u201d exclaimed Madison. \u201cHow long as this been going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost all my life - I cover it up, but now you know because I will always be your friend at any size so you deserved to hear it now,\u201d Lindsey declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talked on that night and Madison had to acknowledge that a lot of her fears over rejection because of weight were just in her head.  But she knew her mom could be a different story.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After she finished talking with Lindsey Madison felt relieved. She meandered back to the living room. She knew she\u2019d missed out on the lasagna Cassie had probably shared with the others, but was personally stuffed from her Indian meal with Jeff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found Cassie was stretched out laconically on the couch, playing a video game on the TV with a partial bowl of popcorn on the table. Her belly and fleshy thighs were plainly visible but she seemed to be not at all bothered. She and Madison exchanged a few remarks before Madison retired. As she did she could help but think about how comfortable her roommate seemed to be with her own size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison dozed off and slept soundly until half-waking very early the next morning. She realized that her hand had been stroking and kneading her own flesh and that she was enjoying the sensation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>What is this</i>,\u201d she thought to herself. \u201c<i>Am I getting turned on by my own blubber?  This doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer forearm kept kneading the side of her belly, then her inner thigh. She  realized that in fact she truly was enjoying the sensation.  Gradually she relaxed and fell back to sleep.  The next morning she shared what had happened with Cassie,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d replied Cassie, \u201cI\u2019ve done that \u2013 even given myself a climax. Being bigger does have its erotic side. Of course for me the biggest thing is what gaining some weight has done to my boobs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison knew that was Cassie\u2019s focus and shrugged, then went off to the Power\u2019s cafeteria, She was resolved to try at least slowing her gain so just had some quiche and a fruit bowl with toast.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunch was a salad, albeit with plenty of dressing. She then tried to do a serious workout which she found quite tiring. Then she went back to her room and lay down for an hour, knowing that this was the evening of the girl\u2019s (Kelly, Ginger and Megan along with Madison and Cassie) weekly pizza and chicken wing fest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving been good all day and having exercised so much she allowed herself five slices of pizza and two of chicken plus a large bowl of chocolate chip ice cream \u2013 effectively wiping out any calories deficit from earlier in the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her lack of personal self discipline Madison had a positive report for Mrs Green at the end of January \u2013 Jeff had lost another seven pounds. She didn\u2019t mention that she\u2019d picked up another three pounds herself. Mrs. Green was discreet enough not to remark on Madison\u2019s growing size, which surprised Madison. Instead Mrs Green informed her that she was aware of Jeff\u2019s progress and that Madison had earned another $1000 bonus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison also called her Dad, telling him that she was still getting larger and wasn\u2019t really wanting to change or hear about it. She confided to him that she could be approaching 200 by the end of the school year and wondered if her mom could handle that. He promised to prepare his wife and told Madison not to worry. She would still be welcomed when she came home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus reassured Madison began relaxing, a fact Jeff picked up on but said nothing. Instead he informed her that he needed to go shopping for smaller clothes and invited her along. $2000 later he had a new wardrobe and suggested they stow the clothes and enjoy a Mexican grill. It was here that he sprung a surprise on Madison \u2013 a $3000 certificate at a plus size store called Catherine\u2019s.  It was, he said, from his mom who thought she might appreciate a new spring wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison knew Jeff\u2019s mom was spot on. The clothes which had been snug in December were getting even tighter seven weeks later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you saying you want to help me spend this?\u201d she inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff nodded in the affirmative \u2013 and by the end of the afternoon Madison had a comfortable size 18 wardrobe.  She took it home and was in the process of replacing her increasingly snug size 14\u2019s in her bedroom when Cassie came in with Kelly.  Kelly had gained along with the other four, but not as much.  Ginger and Cassie were both bigger than Madison with Megan about the same size as Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you going to do with these,\u201d Kelly asked, glancing at the growing stack of discards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was planning to find a thrift store but if you want to take some go ahead \u2013 it doesn\u2019t look lke I\u2019ll e wearing them again anytime soon,\u201d Madison declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly smiled and remarked \u201cthank you \u2013 I\u2019ve picked up a few more pounds over the holidays and frankly I have too much of a study load to worry about it. I\u2019m a comfort eater when I\u2019m on the computer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison simply nodded. Kelly might snack while studying, but between Jeff\u2019s gifted snack cakes, weekly pizza and chicken plus the Power\u2019s cafeteria she knew more was involved.  The fact was that she wasn\u2019t caring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin an hour she had everything sorted out and Kelly had gone off. Then Ginger arrived. Her booty had always been the largest of the five girls and Madison knew why. She enjoyed baked goods, which she was always sharing with the others \u2013 although finishing off the largest portion for herself.  It was almost a weekly trademark and tonight was no exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys,\u201d she greeted Cassie and Madison.  \u201cLook what I have - an Entenmann's Lemon Coconut Cake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison began to salivate at the thought, which she knew would be a 300 plus calories serving, and with ice cream closer to 700.  But it had been over four hours since she and Jeff had had lunch, so she dismissed that information from her mind as Cassie headed for the kitchen to get plates and ice cream.  As anticipasted they each had two pieces, ginger had a third and Cssie and Madison split the eighth.  All three girls knew it would be a few hours before any of them wanted supper.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jeff was pleased with his progress, during the week he lost another 5 pounds, bringing him down to 286. This brought him to around a 35 pound loss since he started working out. He felt far more comfortable already, plus, he thought that he no longer looked massive in comparison to other students, just a bit larger, making him finally feel like he could fit in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that he had Madison to thank for this, although he knew that her body had been dinged this semester.  Madison had gotten very chubby, some would say plump while she was instructing Jeff, however, in a way this was a good thing for their relationship. At 286, he still would have felt a bit odd dating a very athletic looking girl like Madison, and having people wonder how they ended up together, now, with Madison now past 175 pounds, he was merely dating a girl who would be closer to his 'league.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis fact had not gone past Madison either, for all the comfort she was growing into with her weight, she still had lingering anxiety about the social implications of this gain. This often happened to Madison  when she saw the size 18 tags on her clothing, a forced visualization of her current gain.  When she came to Powers, she was certain that she could get almost any guy that she set her sights on, she just happened to develop a crush on Jeff. Madison snickered as she put on her larger shirt, <i>I was so in shape that it caused the guy of my affection to be stressed if we were seen in public, well that's probably over</i> Madison snickered to herself, while being slightly sad about it. She knew now that if things with Jeff for some reason fell apart, she would probably not be randomly approached by the hottest guys at parties anymore, unless, that is, she lost the weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, Madison's wonders about Jeff were confirmed. She had gone over to Jeff's dorm room, where they had ordered in Chinese food, with Madison making sure that 5 or 6 extra crab rangoon were available for her. Jeff skipped it, knowing that the deep fried cream cheese was a total calorie bomb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, would you like to go public with this?\" He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean,\" Madison said while taking a bite out of her chicken, \"all my friends already know about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but make it official, boyfriend and girlfriend, public status update. Go exclusive.\" Jeff responded, somewhat nervelessly. For some reason for him, it was a needed step. He was feeling more comfortable in his size, and Madison's growth had made him less nervous about the attention he would receive from others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison thought it was funny that he wanted it defined as exclusive. Neither of them had been fooling around on the side or playing the field. However, she realized that she never had really called him her boyfriend to her friends, just kind of hinting at it with her Dad. She leaned over to kiss Jeff, wrapping her hand around the back of his head, \"of course I would.\" While she was on top of him, Jeff could not help but notice that her belly hung much further than he had previously remembered. <i>It Madison bloated, or does she had a pot belly that large?</i> he wondered. It was a bit of both. </span></div></div>",

Jeff\u2019s mind too was swirling \u2013 not just at her unexpectedly enthusiastic response but at the erection he\u2019d felt with her rotund belly pressed agaist his torso. He looked again at her stomach, distended from their Chinese meal.  Yes, it indeed was larger than he had remembered, but he wasn\u2019t turned off by it. A smile spread cross his face,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, thanks for the kiss! I was hoping you\u2019d say yes but not expecting thst!\u201d he exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy pleasure big guy!  Of course you know that after what I just did I\u2019m going to have to report myself to Mrs, Green  I\u2019m sure there must be rules about tutors and pupils getting involved,\u201d Madison noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if she tries to reassign you to someone else I may have to have a talk with her myself.\u201d declared Jeff. \u201cI think I could weild some clout!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure \u2013 but that\u2019s tomorrow.  Don\u2019t we have something for dessert?\u201d inquired Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOh yeah,\u201d replied Jeff. \u201cThere\u2019s a pint of cherry vanilla ice cream in the freezer \u2013 but its for you, not me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff went and got the ice cream while Madison slipped a movie into the DVD. By the time it was over the pint of fice cream was history and Jeff had confirmed his new girlfriend\u2019s growing girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning after breakfast, her belly fortified by a hearty turkey avocado wrap from the dining hall, Madison went to Mrs. Green\u2019s office.  It was still early and she found her nominal boss free doing paperwork.  Mrs, Green welcomed her, taking note of the thickness of Madision\u2019s thighs and thinking \u201cthis girl has added some serious weight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMrs Green,\u201d Madison began, \u201cI am sorry to have to report this, but something has come up beween Jeff and I.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Green\u2019s gut clenched. Jeff\u2019s father had her uder orders to keephis son happy while getting into better condition. A rift between Jeff and his trainer was not on her genda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat seems be the problem my dear,\u201d she inquired. \u201cI thought the two of you were getting long famously. From your reports it has sounded like you have been succeeding nicely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, Jeff\u2019s doing fine. I fully expect he\u2019ll make 250 by the end of the summer But we\u2019ve become friends and now he wants us to become an item.  Frankly its a mutual feeling but I\u2019m not sure of the rules on such things,\u201d Madison blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Green let out a sigh of relief. This was a development she could deal with. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised. I understand you had a tete a tete with his mom. Her husband says you wwere quite the firecracker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeff\u2019s family is very wealthy, even more than mine, and I had to prove I wasn\u2019t a fawning gold digger,\u201d replied  Madison. \u201cFor the record when she noticed how much weight I\u2019ve picked up she financed a new wadobe for me.  I think we understand each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Madison spoke Mrs Green noticed the fullness of Madison\u2019s fce. Her round cheeks had slight dimples and she was developing a second chin. Her upper arms as well were round and full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would agree,\u201d replied Mrs Green, relieved to hear the nature of the problem. \u201cYou\u2019re both over 18 and legally entitled to do what you choose. I would hope that comporting yourselves in a way not to discredit the school would be a concern of both of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d answered Madison, relieved to see that her job wasn\u2019t at stake. . \u201cI just wanted you to hear it from me first and not the rumor mill.  OK, I have to get to class,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Madison twirled bout and headed down the hall, her thickening backside plainly evident to Mrs. Green.  The coordinator picked up her phone and called Mr. Wilson. \u201cWell, you were right about your son\u2019s intentions \u2013 and Madison seems quite pleased to know of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo periods later Madison and Jeff met up in the dining hall. He had a chicken salad while she demolished a carne asada plate with macaroni, green beans and some French rolls. On a whim he offered to get Madison a piece of coconut cream pie, which she gladly accepted.  After all, this wasn\u2019t a workout day and she wanted to celebrate with her guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo of Madison\u2019s dorm mates took due notice of what was going on and smled. They suspected it was going to happen and as plumpers themselves ddn\u2019t mind seeing her enjoy a good lunch.  However, during afternoon class some snide remarks were heard from other students more concerned with calories. This would have hurt Madison and angered Jeff had hey known, but for the moment they were oblivious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening Madison called her Dad, who like Mrs Green had seen it comig. Then she called L:indsey, who seemed genuinely congratulatory.  Jeff for his part had a simpe supper of chicken with asparagus while Madison and two of the other girls were feted to a casserole by Cassie.  Ginger was among them and as usual supplied dessert \u2013 a German chocolate cake.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the first few weeks after they began going out, Madison was very happy. She was with a guy who cared about her and that she cared back. Because of the initial glee with the relationship, Madison was not even paying that close of attention to her weight. Usually a point of concern, Madison didn't weigh herself for half a month, and her weight was out of her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff was now willing to take Madison out on far more dates than he had before, and while he always stuck to the healthier items on menus, more often than not choosing a fattening burger instead and disregarding her own figure advice to her boyfriend. Jeff did not mind, he was just happy to be in a relationship. Given that he was tremendously shy in high school, he had never dated anyone, so this was his first time ever being with a girl, and he loved it. For his part, despite the indulgence of his girlfriend, he still wanted to make progress towards his original goal and kept to his rigid self discipline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Madison did not know, but suspected, was that her gain did not go unnoticed. Her transformation from one of the hottest girls on campus, to her current chubby size drew comments from a wide range of people. From shallow guys who previously wanted to ask her out, but now would never, to vain girls who could not believe that she let herself get to her current level. Most did not get the connection that had formed between Madison and Jeff, and would just assume that Madison had gotten insecure from her gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, after another session with Jeff in the gym, Madison went to the locker room to cool off. <i>Are these bigger than they were a few weeks ago?</i> Madison wondered as she looked at her increasingly large thighs. She was also happy that she had gotten a larger sports bra, but even that seemed a bit more snug than she remembered it. In her post workout-sweaty state, the slightly tight and moist nature of her clothes were annoying her, but she would quickly forget that after what she encountered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the beginning of the semester, Madison had rented a locker in the back row, which provided her a bit of privacy, but at the same time, others could not see if she was in there. In the past Madison usually made a point of not ease dropping, since she did not want to snoop on anyone, but two girls who just walked in were particularity loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Let's get this over with, I hate that we are working out this much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need it more than I do! You've gained 5 pounds since the year started!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up! It's not like I'm pulling a Madison Kraft!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was stunned, was she synonymous with gaining weight on the campus? While she listened, she started stroking her belly without noticing while they continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh my god, she has gotten huge. It''s probably because she dated that huge guy Jeff\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, how could anyone let themselves get that large? No discipline.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison wanted to cry, but she knew that she had to get herself out of that locker room, to avoid the embarrassment of the girls knowing she had been there the whole time. She quickly stopped whipping herself off, and threw her towel into her gym bag. Next, she slipped her sweatpants over her butt, \"Ugh, maybe my behind is getting bigger\" she thought. Then, she threw her Powers U, sweatshirt over her tank top she had worn to the gym and made a sprint down the back wall of the locker bay. Just as she was about to make it to the door, she tripped and made a loud umpf as she hit the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, who is that, are you okay?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison quickly got up, and sprinted out of the rec center, while at the same time feeling somewhat out of shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got back to her room, she checked her email to more bad news, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Madison, what time is your flight coming back home after your finals? We need to talk.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized her Mom probably knew the extent of her gain. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison was conflicted. Part of her was mortified by the cruelty of the remarks she\u2019d overheard, making her name synonymous with someone lacking in self-control. Another part was angry at the obvious bias \u2013 those judging her didn\u2019t know her. They had no idea of the freedom that she was feeling, one shared with her dorm mates. Nor did they grasp the relationship with Jeff her change of view had made possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some hesitation but having to know she made sure her roommate Cassie wasn\u2019t around, then got out the scale. The number, 183, didn\u2019t surprise her but the implications did. To carry that much weight her butt indeed did need to be big, bigger than she was used to envisioning. . She was already getting aroused playing with her soft belly and thighs.  But there was no denying that she was getting genuinely fat.  But if she was happy with it, and Jeff was cool with it, why should she be judged by others?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrestling with her feelings she lay down and fell asleep. She was awakened by a cell phone call from Professor Crawford.  For months she and Jeff had been stimulating his class with Jeff\u2019s questions developed from his photographic memory and Madison\u2019s intuitive research abilities. The social affairs study teams she had headed had consistently been number one.  Both her grades and Jeff\u2019s reflected their prowess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Dr Crawford had some news. Madison\u2019s team, of which Jeff was part, would had the chance to be part of a State competition.  Was she interested?  To the former academic decathlon contender longing to teach some critics a thing or two the offer was fresh meat.  She accepted the offer to head the team and promised to encourage the other proposed members..  Within an hour it was unanimous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowers was an academic school. Its athletic teams were confined to soccer, gymnastics and tennis - no football or basketball. But the Kansas Academic Excellence Challenge at the community college level had led to the four year school\u2019s  \u201cNew Venture Competition\u201d and now to a new Academic Bowl for Freshmen and Sophomores.  Its College Bowl lie formast might even be on educational tv. Madison quickly boned up on these factors from the Internet, gleaning a glimpse of what was involved.  Then, not waiting for Cassie to to arrive and fix supper, instead left her a note after arranging to go over to Jeff\u2019s place,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff had never been in a competition before, but given his family\u2019s background he was up for the challenge and eagar to hear Madison\u2019s strategy.  Nine team members were allowed to form sub-teams of up to five in each of event subjects. Madison planned for Jeff or herself to be on each of the sub-teams along with others.  For an hour they mapped out who might be best suited for each sub-team until Jeff heard Madison\u2019s stomach growl and realized neither of them had had dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we need to adjourn to a restaurant,\u201d he noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little embarrassed Madison asked, \u201clike where?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hear there\u2019s a new Greek place that has some great Mediterranean dishes\u201d suggested Jeff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was instantly attracted, even thinking that the food would likely be healthier than whatever Cassie might be doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, why not,\u201d she casually agreed. As they went out to Jeff\u2019s car he took note of her ample belly and its developing love handles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy 8:00 they were at a nicely themed eatery with mouthwatering items on the menu such as Mousaka and Pastitsio. Madison\u2019s culinary training told her that the former would likely include layered potatoes, eggplant, Greek spiced ground beef and ground lamb topped with traditional bechamel sauce, tomato herb sauce and parmesan cheese. The other would be based on layered macaroni rather than potatoes. It would include spiced ground beef and ground lamb covered with traditional bechamel sauce and most likely  topped with tomato herb sauce and parmesan cheese<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff quickly ordered a plate of kefte kabobs, consisting of ground beef mixed with red onions, fresh parsley, and Greek spices to which were added multi-colored peppers and red onions on a layer of rice. Madison dithered as to whether to follow his example or order the pastitsio. Finally she went with her tastebuds, but not after remarking, \u201cYou know that I have to stop this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Jeff. \u201cit may be a bit high calories but even with a few extra pounds you\u2019re in better condition than most. Franly I think the traditional figure is too thin. \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d she replied, \u201cbut you don\u2019t know what happened n the locker room today. I overheard myself being used as a euphemism for a hot girl gone fat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo doubt by envious bigots without guts to follow their own desires,\u201d responded Jeff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d replied Madison, surprised at his response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mom is larger and works with size acceptance,\u201d Jeff explained, knowing that Madison had had a discussion with Mrs Wilson who had since  underwritten Madison's larger wardrobe. \u201cShe says people can be larger for a number of reasons, but resolving to be so by choice and forsake diets takes more courage than most people have. So they instead resort to ridicule over something that shouldn\u2019t be their concern.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dSo you\u2019re saying I should blow off what I heard and just keep on stuffing myself?\u201d asked Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a two part statement,\u201d Jeff noted. \u201cYes, you should blow them off, but as to whether you are really stuffing yourself, that\u2019s a personal thing. You are esating at a certain level and will eventually reach a set point, as you\u2019ve noted before \u2013 is that what you (not me or anyone else ) is happy with?  If so, and you\u2019re healthy as well, who cares. You know that I appreciate the fact that you\u2019re not a wisp.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo if you believe this from your mom, what made you decide to lose weight?\u201d queried Madison who realized that Jeff's phtpgraphic memory had just synthesized elements from three different conversations..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had, and still do, weigh a lot more than you,\u201d replied Jeff \u201cThe simple answer is pragmatism from my Dad. He likes my Mom nice and large, but in some roles we can be so big that its a hindrance. I have a role ahead of me where 300+ would make me a focus rather than what I could do.  It was a practical change. As long as it was my decision even mom approved.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison considered her position. Here she was caring about a guy still over 100 pounds heavier than her and who wasn\u2019t judging her. The critics, whom she hadn\u2019t even seen and didn\u2019t know, meant nothing. She had chosen to let herself gain so that she and Jeff would hopefuly complement each other as a couple, so what was the problem?  After a few moments contemplation she decided, again, to not worry about her waistline. She and Jeff went back to discussing the team. And when the meal was over both she and Jeff shared a dessert of  Pistachio Birdsnest Baklava.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving home that evening she shared everything with Cassie, who was happy for the academic team and Madison\u2019s relationship with Jeff but philosophical about the cruel comments,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeff\u2019s right you know. I\u2019ve tried telling Kelly and Megan the same kind of thing \u2013 Ginger already knows it. How larger people feel about themselves is much more important than opinions from those who just parrot the current fashion party line. I know scads of larger men and women who love and live quite happy and healthily, thank you,\u201d Cassie declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess,\u201d Madison concurred. \u201cStill, its not what I grew up with \u2013 and my mom is going to go ballistic when she finds out I\u2019ve gained fifty pounds in nine months.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy even give her a number? Just say you\u2019re larger and like it \u2013 so live with it,\u201d answered Cassie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026,\u201d that might just be an idea,\u201d replied Madison.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Madison's Mom answered and they talked for a while about things, while Madison guarded things about her relationship and her body. Her Mom mainly asked things about classes, the campus, and how she liked her roommate. Eventually they got to the dinning hall, and Madison's Mom went on a bit of a tangent,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't enjoy the dinning hall too much, Madison, you would not want to gain the freshman 15...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison paused for a second. Did her Mom not know at all? Or was this just some way for her Mom to get in her head about gaining the current weight that she already had. Madison could not decide, sure she had told her Dad, and she guessed that it made sense that he would not say anything, but it also dawned on Madison that her Mom assumed that on the other side of the line, she was still talking to the thin, 130 pound girl that she had raised and sent off to college a few months ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll these thoughts had only transpired for a second, but the break in the fast paced conversation caused Madison's Mom to need clarification.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Madison, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah.\" Madison replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, anything you want to say about your weight? You seem quiet all of the sudden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...I gained a bit of weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, Madison's Mom grabbed on to the 'bit of weight' part and assumed that it must have been a relatively small amount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not good you have gained a few pounds, you will have to work those pounds off before all the guys see you on the beach!\" She said, somewhat playfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison did not know how to tell her that she had gained a ton of weight, so she didn't, and just moved on, \"Mom, I've decided to joint the academic team at Powers, it's kind of like a collegiate quiz bowl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation then went back into more comfortable territory for Madison, and away from the weight issue, but she knew that she was only prolonging the inevitable shock that her Mom would have when her perfect child came home like that. It actually caused Madison quite a bit of anxiety, the idea that her Mom, who had never been anything but skinny, and raised two skinny daughters, would have a chubby college aged daughter who plumped up...Madison already knew how her Mom would frame it. While Madison thinking about it, she did not realized how she was casually stroking the lower part of her belly, something she was doing more often without realizing it. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison hung up from her tete a tete with her Mom feeling a bit sad. She knew her Mom wasn\u2019t happy \u2013 and would be even less happy if she knew the full truth. Madison wrestled with herself the rest of the night. She recalled the course of her Freshman year, which had started out with her trying to be a little independent from her family by earning some side money. It had led her into a relationship and changes in her body she wouldn\u2019t have dreamed of a year before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had only been a bit over 150 pounds when she had confronted Jeff Wilson\u2019s  Mom. Now she was over 180 and feeling different as a woman. When she had first seen her new physique in a mirror the transition had been shocking. Her once toned hips had grown wider, her belly and thighs fuller and her breasts more prominent.  She wasn\u2019t an athlete or tomboy anymore, but looked like a plus size woman. But after the initial surprise she had begun to explore and embrace the new her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time passed she had found that feeling full and massaging her belly could be erotic. She didn\u2019t mind that her thighs were now rubbing, her underwear growing constantly more snug, her cheeks fuller and her chin line sporting a nascent double chin. The only downside was she had outgrown her clothes and pretty much forsaken her exercise regimen. But it didn\u2019t seem to matter. Her grades were great, Jeff had assured her the added weight was fine with him and she liked the freedom to eat. Her father as well as one of most slender high school friends didn\u2019t care either. Why did her Mom have to be such a problem?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, weighing over 180 pounds with a more comfortable wardrobe, she was about to go into a State competition as the captain of a team. She thought her parents should be thrilled, Her dad was supportive but all her mom seemed interested in was having her be skinny.  That, she noted, was a concept that seemed strangely foreign to her dorm mates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were four of them, all getting increasingly porky, just like Madison. Despite this, or seemingly because of it possibly, they all had boyfriends, not just Madison. Cassie still was the biggest and Ginger the admitted cake addict. Kelly and Megan had probably picked up thirty pounds apiece on a campus where being heavier didn\u2019t seem to matter. At first Madison had written this phenomena off to Midwestern culture \u2013 corn fed farm girls would tend to be bigger, but then she began wondering. Few of her classmates were actually from farms,  including herself, but there was a definite break at Powers with the conventional image of figures. Why was it so easy to become a larger girl here and still attract boyfriends \u2013 she knew in the back of her mind that things didn\u2019t work that way in Coral Gables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning in the Powers dining hall she took her eyes off the usual array of enticing entrees, placing special note on what others were having.  She opted for a breakfast burrito with a side of fruit, Ginger for two cinnamon buns with eggs and corned beef hash, Megan went with French toast and melons, Kelly with corned beef hash and eggs plus toast, while Cassie had an omelet with apples, a banana and a blueberry muffin.  Students from other dorm suites followed a similar pattern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe variety, as always, was tempting. All across the tables they were scarfing down meals that Madison knew had to be over 1000 calories \u2013 and it showed. Most of her classmates seemed a bit chunky. Few freshman were as large as she and Cassie, and of course Jeff, but thick midriffs and muffin tops were common, more so than Madison had bothered to take note of before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day she commented on this to Megan, who was contentedly devouring a mid-afternoon energy bar between class periods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey ought to call this Chubs College, the way we\u2019ve all picked up a few,\u201d she remarked thumping her own belly softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Megan answered. \u201cI guess you saw the little op ed in the <i>Powers Proclaimer</i>? I thought it was a little snotty \u2013 and I totally disagree with the slap at you and Jeff in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d Madison exclaimed. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t read it. What slap are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome of the vocal non-chub minority seem to think you and Jeff are too big to be heading up the Academic Decathlon team. Tough titty to them \u2013 you guys earned it, you deserve it. They are the type dopes who think the world is defined by their idea of the best body type. Thanks to your boyfriend\u2019s family that\u2019s fortunately a minority view here at Powers!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d replied Madison, by now totally confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan stepped back, perplexed and replied .\u201dYou really don\u2019t know, apparently. OK, what about us picking this up after last period over some gliders at Wingstop?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh \u2013 OK. 4:00?\u201d stammered Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you there,\u201d Megan said as she sauntered off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison had to get to class as well, but made point of looking at the Proclaimer as soon as possible where she found the letter Megan was alluding to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was authored by Erica Mays, a lithe cheerleader who was part of a clique of more slender coeds than most on campus. <i>\u201cAt a time when the nation\u2019s first lady is trying to stop this country\u2019s obesity epidemic, especially noticeable on the Powers campus this year, our faculty seems to have blinders on.  We would never permit a fat cheerleader team for soccer, so why pick two obese students to head up the Academic Decathlon team. Powers needs to reconsider this choice \u2013 taking into account image along with scholarship in making decisions.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was hurt \u2013 but didn\u2019t know whether to feel more angry or guilty. This girl obviously shared the view of her mom and those Madison had overheard in the gym, but what did Jeff\u2019s family have to do with anything as Megan had asserted? She couldn\u2019t wait to get to Wingstop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the class day she called ahead to be sure Megan was actually there. She was, and said she was in line placing an order for them. When Madison arrived  at the table (Megan had elected not to use a tight booth) Megan already had a set of four gliders (sauced chicken white meat sandwiched between two freshly baked yeast rolls \u2013 sold at two for $5.49) and a large serving of cheese fries with two Dr. Peppers of the table. Despite her focus on Megan\u2019s earlier remarks Madison found herself salivating at the sight of the tasty afternoon snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter seating herself and having a satisfying bite Madison came to the point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen Erica\u2019s rant. She\u2019s stupid for calling me obese,  but what does that have to do with Jeff?\u201d she demandedl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink about it. How were you recruited to come here?\u201d countered Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn alumnus from Powers came to our college recruiting fair. She liked what I did in Coral Gables. She offered me a scholarship that covered half my costs,\u201d answered Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd part of what she liked was what?\u201d continued Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe way I led the Academic Decathelon competition \u2013 which I guess you\u2019re implying means that they knew it fit in with what they were going to need about now, like scouting local talent for a football team?\u201d answered Madison, getting the implication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but what about the rest of us. Why did we get scholarships? And who funds them to begin with?\u201d asked Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Cassie was a student service leader. . . \u201d Madison started to analyze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, as was Kelly and even Ginger as well as yourself. Me too. The alumni scouts want leaders or they don\u2019t get scholarships. But none of us were especially skinny, were we? You seem to be the exception and were selected with a slightly different agenda in mind  \u2013 which is why you haven\u2019t apparently been told,\u201d Megan said analytically. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying that Powers recruits girls who are likely to be bigger or become heavier?\u201d replied Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd when it comes to guys, also those who appreciate them. Its not the only ones they recruit \u2013 you obviously weren\u2019t like most of us because they had a special reason for you, But you weren\u2019t a fatophobe, were you?\u201d Megan bore down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. But what does this have to do with Jeff\u2019s family?\u201d demanded Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c80% of this student body is on scholarships financed by the Wilsons \u2013 and size acceptance is a mandatory factor. I know because my Mom is one of the alumni who scouts at the job fairs.  Ask Jeff \u2013 it was his grandmother who started it decades ago. I\u2019m sure he knows,\u201d revealed Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison for the moment was speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it turns out you are indeed more than just an academic team captain recruited to fill a role \u2013 at heart you are making choices in life that are leading you into becoming one of us,\u201d Megan smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was nonplussed. As she savored a bite of her second glider she thought back to remarks from Jeff, Mrs Green and others \u2013 as well as to her own erotic fascination with her expanding body.  She was indeed being given choices at Powers and she was making ones which were just what Megan implied.  As she finished her fries and drink she pumped Megan for as much as she knew \u2013 and, as she refilled her soda cup before leaving, realized  she had to talk with Jeff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cIts basically true,\u201d Jeff confirmed that evening.  \u201cThe dorm rooms here at Powers are a little roomier, the doors a little wider, the food arrangements conducive to eating generously. It all fits in with both my grandmothers and mom\u2019s views on size acceptance. The Alumni recruiters are selected based on agreement with their philosophy \u2013 the entitling of heavier peopleto an equal role in society. Powers is a good college in its own right but there is also an underlying philosophy that articles have been written about. Its no secret.  And no, not everyone agrees \u2013 as that op ed piece today illustrates. The college doesn\u2019t exclude those with more traditional views.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff paused, then continued  \u201cI\u2019m a bit of a rebel for deciding to lose weight against my mom\u2019s wishes because Dad convinced me I should.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I can get that, bur what is Erica so upset about?\u201d Megan asked. \u201cI don\u2019t even know her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing personal, really. She just doesn\u2019t think we deserve to be running the team because it represents an image that doesn\u2019t correlate with the views of people like our first lady. In other words, they feel fat folk need to be seen as little as possible and heard from less.\u201d Jeff groused. \u201cYou may have noticed that she never eats in the dining hall \u2013 because she lives with her parents in town.  They can afford the tuition and its local \u2013 she\u2019s not your typical Powers student.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Megan is right about 80% of the student body being screened, recruited and funded by your family?\u201d Madison exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, not exactly. My grandmother set  up an Alumni fund which the family later supplemented. But there have been other contributors over the years. The alumni run it, we don\u2019t.  But there is a theme, just like Tuskegee for blacks or Gallaudet for the deaf,\u201d explained  Jeff, who paused and began to smile. \u201cBut Erica\u2019s entitled to express her views \u2013 and don\u2019t be too upset by them. Its happened before. Watch the next issue of the <i>Proclaimer</i>\u2013 there will be rebuttals. Remember who gets the paper!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re not bothered by it?\u201d queried Madison. \u201cAs for me I know that with your photographic memory and my analytical mind plus the skills of the others on the team we\u2019re capable of winning this tournament at any weight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not. It just a biased op-ed piece by a blind sycophant who\u2019s spouting the traditional stuff,\u201d commented Jeff, \u201cbut I know its crap. But its why Chris Christie had to have weight loss surgery and fat jokes are still tolerated on TV whereas ethnic ones aren\u2019t anymore. Its why I\u2019m trying to lose eighty pounds rather than being Mama\u2019s poster boy for a ballooning and successful business man.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff inhaled and continued. \u201cBy rights you and everyone else should be able to decide their own weight for themselves. The problem is sticking to that position long enough to endure and finally drown out the static from the control freaks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff had of course been speaking of Erica, but suddenly Madison knew it also applied to her Mother. She knew what she had to do, Jeff was right. Her Mother needed to realize she could lose her relationship with daughter if she couldn\u2019t let Madison make her own decisions.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou, Cassie and Megan all seem to be telling me the same thing --- don\u2019t let my Mom control me, don\u2019t cut her out, but demand that she respect my boundaries and choices,\u201d whispered Madison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly.  And I think your Dad understands it. After the way you handled my mom I think you can do the same with yours,\u201d Jeff answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison the next day went and sought counsel from Mrs Green, who had a surprise for her- an opportunity to be a summer camp counselor after her detail to Jeff ended. She smiled when Madison told her of Megan\u2019s remarks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout 20% of the student body comes here apart from the ones who the Alumni help fund,\u201d she acknowledged. \u201cThey\u2019ve not felt the sting of bigotry and rejection due to their size, or been saddled with guilt because they don\u2019t blend in with the common view. For them people like me who agree with the Wilson\u2019s probably seem bit strange, but it sounds like Megan and Jeff seem to think you\u2019re one of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUs? But you don\u2019t weigh much more than me,\u201d Madison said, startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s because a few years ago I made the choice to lose eighty pounds,\u201d Mrs Green answered. \u201cAt fifty years of age it wasn\u2019t to impress anyone, but a precaution for health reasons. As you say, I\u2019m still much larger than you \u2013 probably fifty pounds. But yes, you may be in heart be one of us. But remember, its your choice \u2013 don\u2019t let Powers just be another type of peer group to conform to.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d acknowledged Madison, thinking of her enjoyment of her body and of food, \u201cyou could be right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening Madison wrote to her Mom:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cMom:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease know that I love you and always will \u2013 even if after reading this you reject me because you can\u2019t accept or agree with my choices in some areas of life. My message is simple and firm without anger as an adult: I must insist that you surrender the desire to control me, even for my own good as you see it, and give me freedom to make my own choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy grades are definitely in the top 5% at Powers and I\u2019m heading a team along with a man I\u2019m coming to increasingly care for. Along the way my body has grown to be larger, possibly not in the top 5% but certainly larger than either of us would have imagined a year ago. I won\u2019t tell you how much (I don\u2019t even know precisely myself) but its decidedly more than 15-20 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are those who feel that Jeff\u2019s and my size disqualify us from trying to win the competition. Hopefully you do not share this view. I feel the need to stop their mouths. Strange as it may seem I\u2019m comfortable with my new body and, at least for the present, have neither desire or intention of trying to reverse what has occurred and continues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore news: I have been offered a summer job so won\u2019t be able to come home for the entire 10 weeks. I can, however, be there for two and would like to do it. But I would also like to feel acceptance for myself and my by then 250 pound \u201cnew and improved\u201d boyfriend. I guarantee you that I\u2019ll not be that large, at least this year, but hope you\u2019ll agree that my added bulk complements him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease consider making me welcome and give me your reply after the upcoming competition. Jeff and I really need to be giving it our full attention. .  I do love both you and Dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter composing the letter Madison called her Dad and told him she was sending it to his attention to give to her Mom after making a silent prayer. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison did not really know what to expect from the academic decathlon team concerning this unexpected, and mainly unwanted attention. Heck, she was actually a bit shocked that Jeff took the attention in the article as well as he did. She thought back to the beginning of the year when they first met, and she was sure that Jeff would have been overcome by anxiety surrounding of someone singling him out for his weight like that. Now, if anything, he seemed to be the one who was re-assuring Madison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the epiphany from Megan, finally letting her Mom know that she had gained weight, her normal coursework and the preparations for the upcoming academic competition, Madison was feeling a bit overwhelmed, and seemed to be eating more to calm herself down. Now, outside of meals with Jeff, she found herself grazing on chips or chocolate, and the sudden satisfaction of food always made her feel a bit more able to tackle what laid ahead for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA positive that she never could have expected was the swift reaction against the article, starting with none other than Dr. Crawford. He called Madison a few days later while she was walking down campus, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison, sorry I could not call earlier, it's been a rather busy week.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, that's okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I imagine you read the article in the <i>Proclaimer</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just want to apologize for that, and let you know that I think it's garbage, and that it will have absolutely no effect on how the team is run. I was a bit confused even reading it, because body image and the goals of the team are not any more connected than any other activity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I talked with some other past members of the team, and we wrote a counter which will be in the paper next week, I hope you are okay with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine. Although part of me wishes that we could just move on from this and focus on the competition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear you.\" Dr. Crawford said, before mentioning that he had to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was a bit nervous about the response op-ed that was sent in. Would that just be another opportunity to highlight how large she currently was? Heck, she did not even consider herself to be obese, and now it would be mentioned in the paper for another week? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Madison continued throughout the week, she noticed that the mood on campus seemed to be decidedly against Erica's column, something like 70/30 oppose/support. Girls that she hardly, knew, even thinner ones, talked to her and told her how rude they thought it was. Madison could not figure out if people were just being polite, or if they actually thought that. However, one thing remained consistent throughout this, her weight was still creeping up. Madison thought that her clothes were getting a bit tighter, and they were. If she had time to weigh herself, she would see that the constant snacking had brought her up to 189 pounds. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mr. Crawford\u2019s encouragement was welcome, but so was the response from the team. None of the others were as large as Madison and Jeff but most were on the heavier side and none appreciated the slam from Erica, the disgruntled cheerleader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, I hear you,\u201d responded Madison after allowing an initial 15 minute discussion, \u201cbut let\u2019s remember to stay focused.  You all have your team assignments and we know what has to be done.  Professor Crawford and the Administration are behind us and we have all heard from the student body. Rehashing the obvious ad infinitum here is a distraction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tea got the point and began running thru their role playing drills. After an hour all signs indicated they were well prepared for the expected queries.  What they didn\u2019t know was that Madison had another matter on her mind. She had been asked to come to Mrs. Green\u2019s office that afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison showed up wearing a loose floral print jacket which cut off just below her waist atop a solid color one piece black dress that came down to her knees. The effect was to give her a professional rather than routine student persona, one that said \u201cI mean business.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe imaging was intentional, suggested by Jeff, and designed to illustrate Madison was unbowed, ready to play offense and not defense. She seated herself confidently in the waiting room outside Ms Green\u2019s office, tugging slightly on her hemline due to its snugness. After less than five minutes she was invited into the office precisely on time. She was surprised to find there a large, friendly appearing middle-aged woman who was introduced as Gwendolyn Porter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMrs. Porter is an Alumnus of Powers and Chairperson of the Alumni Association\u2019s UMILA outreach effort,\u201d stated Mrs. Green. \u201cShe wanted to meet you personally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, thank you,\u201d said Madison.  \u201cI hope you\u2019ll pardon me for not knowing much about UMILA \u2013 what is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Upward Mobility Initiative for Larger Alumni,\u201d Mrs Porter answered.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re preparing a firestorm to singe the feathers of this Erica twit who dared to attack you in the Proclaimer. Youi deserve an apology my dear and she needs to be taken down somewhat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s truly kind of you,\u201d answered Madison, \u201cbut the last time I looked the first amendment encompasses the right to say stupid things. Forcing her into a retraction against her will, as the saying goes, would leave her of the same opinion still. But I appreciate your thought and support.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Porter turned to Mrs Green. \u201cIs she saying she won\u2019t come to the rally we\u2019re staging later this week?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt if she has even heard about it,\u201d answered Mrs green \u201cMadison has classes and is coaching a team plus acting as a private coach under assignment from my office.  She didn\u2019t even know about the article till a dormitory mate called it to her attention.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d paused Mrs Porter. \u201cWell, about a dozen of us will be circulating petitions at the dining hall beginning in two days demanding an apology on your behalf or else suspension for this Erica. We would appreciate your presence and a few words as to how much this has hurt and angered you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison blinked her eyes and rolled her eyeballs at Mrs Porters assumptions and proposal.  It was totally opposite of the response she ad Jeff were encouraging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow hold on,\u201d Madision countered. \u201cWhat Erica did was totally boorish and obviously bigoted, but making demands like that will only focus attention on her remarks and possibly turn her into a martyr. I think a rally in support of our team without even mentioning the <i>Proclaimer </i>or her would be far more constructive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith all the fatophobic nonsense going on today you can be that sanguine?\u201d sputtered Mrs Porter. \u201cSurely you\u2019re not ignorant of the barriers people of our size face?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe not as much as you, but I want to be rewarded for my own efforts and talent, not made a poster child for victimization,\u201d fired back Madison. \u201cI was telling the team just today that we need to avoid being distracted and focus on what we need to be doing to win. It is important as Captain that I follow my own advice. I would personally appreciate your supporting us as a team rather than making a possible martyr out of Erica. And, no, neither Jeff or I will be a part of any protest rally. Is there anything else to discuss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so, Madison. Thanks for taking time to come by,\u201d interjected Mrs Green.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison smiled graciously and left. As she went down the hall she overheard Mrs Green saying to Mrs Porter \u201cI told you she wouldn\u2019t go for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she was out of the building Madison hurriedly called Jeff, asking him to have his mother use her influence to temper the alumni zealots. She wondered whether she should try contacting contact Erica personally, but decided against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back to the dorm she was hoping to talk with her friends, but none were home. Cassie apparently had been \u2013 a box from Dunkin Donuts was in the kitchen with two items gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cThis kind of comfort food grazing is what makes people like Erica go berserk,\u201d </i>Madison thought. She was tempted to grab a strawberry Danish for herself, but resisted, electing to go to her room and pull off her jacket and dress. With the jacket\u2019s padded shoulders and contrasting cutoff she felt she\u2019d looked good, but noted the dress was also a tad snug. With her dress off her burgeoning belly spread out as she sat down half-clad at her computer, tying to focus on work for the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half hour after she heard someone come in and hastily covered up.  She came the living room as Kelly was moving the pastry box onto the coffee table to share with Cassie, who was bringing in milk from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there,\" Kelly said, \u201dif isn\u2019t the talk of the campus! I think everyone is planning on attending the competition to see you squash the competition and belie Erica\u2019s accusations.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said it,\u201d concurred Cassie. \u201cI\u2019d not mind giving her a few comeuppences myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, you two,\u201d replied Madison.\u201dTell me, does she have a life besides her team? Any boyfriends, hobbies, etc?  From what I can tell she\u2019s a poor girl who lives at home with her parents and hasn\u2019t a clue. All she\u2019s doing is parroting talking points she\u2019s picked up from somewhere to get attention.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurprising statement, but I think you may be right. I never heard of her until two days ago,\u201d responded Kelli as she began devouring the strawberry Danish Madison had been contemplating earlier. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know her if I saw her, and I\u2019m fairly sociable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we share a class,\u201d Cassie commented, \u201cbut nothing notable there. She hasn\u2019t raised her hand once that I remember, nor have I seen her being friends with anyone. I can\u2019t help but wonder if someone put her up to writing that letter. She doesn\u2019t seem the contentious type.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe we should get to know her?\u201d suggested Kelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter what she did to Madison?\u201d responded Cassie<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually yes \u2013 especially because of that,\u201d Madison interjected. \u201cIf I thought she\u2019d accept it and I had the time I might do it myself. But don\u2019t take her any pastry boxes if you expect to succeed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth dorm mates laughed, unaware of the discussion Jeff at that moment was having long distance with his Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGwen Porter means well, I\u2019m sure, but Madison feels that what she wants to do is totally counter-productive. I agree. Why can\u2019t the alumni support the team instead of drawing attention to another fatophobe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI have to say you\u2019re probably right,\u201d Mrs Wilson agreed. :\u201dI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Erica herself was reeling from the blowback her article had generated. Some students agreed with her, but most did not. Some were getting downright mean \u2013 slipping pictures of an anorexia victim into one of her textbooks with the her name and the caption \u201cFuture Power\u2019s Team Captain Candidate?\u201d But what was really bothersome were the glares, glances and fingerpointing. She could only wonder why she\u2019d agreed to take the dare of writing the letter just to see if the college paper would publish it.  She never dreamed they would. Erica had come home shaking with the pressure she was feeling.  She was surprised to check her email later that night and find a message from Kelli with  the subject line \u201cIn defense of Madison Kraft,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cDear Erica:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI respect your right, and that of every Power\u2019s student, to make whatever decisions you choose for yourself as long as they affect principally you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when they affect the reputation of someone I know well and you\u2019ve never even talked to I must speak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison Kraft isn\u2019t Captain because of Jeff Wilson. She is Captain, and his girlfriend, because she has been a proactive person \u2013 both in class and in helping him as a personal trainer. She has been involved successfully with this type of team before and was recruited to come to Powers because of it \u2013 something you likely didn\u2019t know but the alumni association faculty did before she ever knew the Wilsons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs she a big person?  Yes, but in more ways than one. She at this moment is doing her best to head off a protest rally directed at you personally. Bet you didn\u2019t know that either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI doubt if you even know who I am, and I don\u2019t pretend to know what makes you so loathe your fatter classmates (yes, that includes me). But if you would like to talk at lunch tomorrow (I know you don\u2019t usually eat at the dining hall) I\u2019ll spring for the meal.  I think someone needs to throw you a life preserver \u2013 if you want one. Interestingly Madison would be willing to give me a hand if you decide to grab it. Rather than being angry she feels sorry for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelli (dorm mate and friend of Madison)\u201d</i><br>\r\nErica stared at the screen.  A life preserver?  Well, she did feel like she was drowning. But who was this Kelli and could she be trusted? How should she respond?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why would Kelli reach out to her like that? Plus, would she really want to accept? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica had been popular in high school, very popular, and part of that could be attributed to her perfect looks. Besides her great face, she had the same flawless body that she currently possessed and she was fine using it to her advantage. However, when she got to college, Erica did not have the instant friend surge that she expected, much to the contrast of Madison's experience. Erica wasn't having the same entourage of social contacts, or parade of guys who were interested in her like she was used to in high school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could not put her finger on why this happened. Had she come to college with expectations that were too high? Had her previous popularity and social clique erode her abilities to make new friends? Did going to a school in her hometown and live with her parents rob her of bonding experiences? Was she too intimidating for the slightly larger classmates? She assumed it was a combination of all these things, but one thing was certain, she was not pleased with the status quo for herself at Powers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe that's why she wrote the letter she now greatly resisted in the first place. Her initial thoughts were that this would be something that would get people talking. And they were, but not to her liking, if anything, she feared that she was making herself a social outcast with that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of these thoughts were riffling through her head as she tried to figure out what to do about the email. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Erica decided that she should take Kelli up on the invitation. Although in the email, Kelli had claimed that it was possible Erica never noticed her, that was not the case, as she had recognized her after seeing her talk with Cassie, the larger girl who she shared a class with. Although she was afriad this would be a chance for Kelli to subject her to biting criticism, she decided that it was worth attending. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Erica got to the cafeteria, she walking in an saw a taller girl sitting alone, clearly waiting for someone. <i>I think that's her...</i> Erica thought as she walked up to the girl who was wearing her high school basketball sweatpants, which seemed a bit snug. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kelli had spotted Erica looking around somewhat apprehensively. The Powers dining hall with its cornucopia of entrees and desserts was not the cheerleader\u2019s normal turf.  Living at home and bringing her sparse lunches to school each day insured that she wouldn't be a regular. As she looked around at the heavier patrons with their jovial smiles and full food trays it struck Erica that this was a different culture.  But she was looking for Kelli, who had promised via reply email to be on hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Erica tentatively approached the table where Kelli was waiting the 5\u2019 10 freshman rose, the 25 pounds she\u2019d gained since August thinly disguised by the exercise suit. Kelli had better items in her wardrobe but was dressing down deliberately to put Erica at ease. As Erica approached she smiled and greeted her with as much warmth as she could muster, \u201cHey, I\u2019m glad you made it!  Let\u2019s grab some trays and remember, I\u2019m buying so have what you want,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica swallowed. She was expecting hostility but was instead being offered hospitality. She turned towards the serving line, grabbed a tray and soon selected a tuna salad which included sliced hard boiled eggs, greens, olives and miniature tomatoes. Kelli followed her lead. When they reached the cashier Kelli used her card and paid cash for Erica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two students made their way to an empty table Erica braced for an interrogation and lecture, but Kelli ignored the article and simmering controversy. Instead she asked Erica about herself, then shared parallel areas in her own background. Finally Erica couldn\u2019t help but blurt out, \u201cwhy all this discussion about us \u2013 aren\u2019t we here to discuss what I did?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are, actually. But not I hope confrontationally,\u201c smiled Kelli. \u201cWe barely know one another. I\u2019m trying to understand what makes you tick and am sharing with you what I understand of myself for the same reason. Actions don\u2019t just happen in a vacuum \u2013 there\u2019s context for everything. I know what you wrote \u2013 I want to understand why you felt the need to do it,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy sister Ellie and I had a discussion. She thinks this is a school for stuck-up fatties who think they\u2019re special \u2013 she bet me that if I wrote something like that it would prove her point, then our parents would let me go somewhere else. She doesn\u2019t want to come here at all,\u201d related Erica, \u201cI know I probably shouldn\u2019t have singled Madison out, but you\u2019re right \u2013 I don\u2019t understand this place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm, I see,\u201d mused Kelli. \u201cSo in a sense she put you up to the letter.  That helps me understand the event, but what about you. Do you feel pressure from anyone here at Powers to be bigger? Because if you are, then someone is delivering a wrong message.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot pressure really, just a lack of inclusion. You are the first person to invite me to anything \u2013 and its only because I crossed a line,\u201d asserted Erica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelli closed her eyes and bowed her head, then murmured :\u201dat one level I know you\u2019re right. Those of us who live in dorms generally don\u2019t reach out to those living off campus.  Maybe we should. If we had a potluck for people like you how many do you think you could get to come?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2019 know \u2013 but its not just association. Its philosophy. We have an obesity epidemic and people here treat it like its another hoax like global warming or affordable health care. I don\u2019t enjoy depriving myself of food, but its essential for both health and acceptance.\u201d declared Erica,.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps for you that is reality, and like I wrote in my email, that's your right. I have to respect your right to live your life according to your beliefs. But its not the only reality out there. There are those who either enjoy being larger or can\u2019t maintain a low weight and feel right. Don\u2019t they have the right to come to another conclusion?\u201dcountered Kelli \u201cThat\u2019s where the blowback you\u2019re getting is coming from \u2013 no one saying you need to become heavier to be accepted. We just want acceptance of our choices as well.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think being heavier is bad? It should just be accepted like hair or skin color?\u201d Erica remarked in astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvery choice has pluses and minuses, but we should make them for ourselves. Being too lean carries risks just like being heavier \u2013 and being really too skinny or really too fat can create issues, but why do we judge others rather than just ourselves in either case? That\u2019s my question to you.\u201d replied Kelli, bringing the point home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I feel forced into my choice, so I guess I want to do the same to others perhaps?\u201d answered Erica a little tentatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably true,\u201d Kelli answered. \u201cI have four heavier dorm mates, each larger for a different reason. But I get along with all of them because I let them live their own lives. But society tries to shoehorn us from every side \u2013 just like it has you. Even elementary school kids are protesting the food in the school lunch programs and are posting picture on Facebook.  Its your life, Erica. You need to live it the way you choose and let others do likewise. Does that make sense?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, yes.\" Erica conceded \u201cWill you tell Madison I\u2019m sorry and will write a retraction to the <i>Proclaimer</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good and I will. But I think it would be more meaningful if you joined us for a meal and said that,\u201d suggested Kelli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019d do that?\u201d Erica said shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied Kelli, \u201cWe have one slated for Monday night. Don\u2019t feel that you need to eat anymore than you feel like just because others are digging in.\u201d . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand, and thank you,\u201d the humbled cheerleader replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunch Kelli called Madison on her cell and told her the outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat,\u201d exclaimed Madison. \u201cNow let\u2019s hope Jeff is as successful in heading off tomorrow\u2019s protest.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Erica arrived home Emily immediately inquired as to the discussion with Kelli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt went well, actually. Kelli was reaching out trying to understand my thinking and trying to share her views. I liked her. Madison told her to invite me to a dormitory dinner \u2013 they\u2019re trying to build bridges. I\u2019m going to apologize in the paper and maybe go to dinner with them on Monday. I\u2019m sorry, but I think you persuaded me to jump the gun,\u201d Erica replied to her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily fumed. \u201cYou\u2019re selling out to the establishment! Next thing you know these porkers will have you stuffing your face with candy and joining them. You know the agenda I\u2019ve embraced \u2013 meaningful change means exploiting ever opportunity for division to tear out the old order, not finding common ground. You need to read Alinsky\u2019s Rules for Radicals!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica stood her ground. \u201cYou\u2019re the social justice revolutionary not me! Just because Michelle wants to declare war on fat doesn\u2019t make all fat people my enemy or that I should hold them back. Did it ever occur to you that maybe they\u2019re fat for a reason \u2013 may even want to be in some cases? As long as they don\u2019t insist that I be like them to be accepted isn\u2019t that OK? Isn\u2019t this a free country?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily shook her head in disdain, \u201cso now you\u2019re alright with making fatties your friend just because one accepts you when you expected a fight. I tell you fatties are inferior and weak people who need to be receivers of  entitlement class, not the intelligentsia.  No wonder the occupy movement demonstrations go nowhere with your kind of thinking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually demonstrations can go both ways, answered Erica.\u201dMadison\u2019s boyfriend is trying to head off a pro-fat demonstration that my letter triggered. It was meant to change the decision, but instead most on campus are supporting Madison\u2019s team. I\u2019m not wanting to be on the losing side just to further a revolutionary agenda.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily shook her head, \u201cOk, go get stuffed on Monday. Gain a hundred pounds if you like. You\u2019ve probably just handed Powers the State championship and then fatties everywhere will think they are as good as anyone and don\u2019t need protection.  No wonder America is so backward.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Emily left the room, leaving Erica to her thoughts.  Meanwhile Jeff was making progress with UMILA and Gwendolyn Porter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur team is capable of winning the championship hands down,\u201d Jeff was arguing. \u201cBut having a distraction over this stupid bigoted letter could sidetrack us. I fully get your anger and frustration, I really do, but Madison is our captain and she sees something as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff inhaled. \u201cShe feels that since we have the support of Professor Crawford and the administration having a demonstration over size detracts from what we\u2019re going into this contest to prove that we are #1 in Kansas \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwendolyn was an angry fat woman, but she wasn\u2019t stupid. She sat thinking as Jeff paused to assess her reaction before continuing. \u201cWe\u2019ve all seen what this Sterling jerk\u2019s comments did to morale on the Clippers team \u2013 we frankly don\u2019t need it here. Jackie Robinson let his playing skills speak for him in the forties \u2013 please, give us a shot at doing this the same way. \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears welled up in the UNILA leader\u2019s eyes, her arm shook and her voice trembled. \u201cI want to put trollops like her their place so bad. Even though your family has supported us with money and you\u2019re big yourself you can\u2019t know the pain boiling inside those who\u2019ve lived with remarks and insults all our lives, but I know you have a point. You deserve the chance to win because you\u2019re simply the best \u2013 and that means focusing without us demonstrating. I understand,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff\u2019s cell phone vibrated. It was a text from Madison. \u201cK sez E to apologize in Proclaimer; has been invited Mon nite dinner. Hope she accepts\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff smiled and showed the message to Gwendolyn. \u201cI suggest you show up tomorrow with signs supporting the team \u2013 ignore the letter because its about to become history.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe UMILA President looked at Jeff. \u201cThat girl is something else \u2013 more charitable than I\u2019d be. But then, she didn\u2019t grow up fat did she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201c answered Jeff, \u201cbut she has a fatphobic mom to deal with. Neither of us knows how Mrs Kraft will react when she finds out about us and how big Maddie has become. Interestingly, Maddie has decided being bigger is erotic and is ready to tell her mom to take a hike if she gives her grief.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPluck and courage!  You hold on to that one, Jeff,\u201d Mrs Porter smiled and counseled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI intend to,\u201d replied Jeff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Kelli and Erica stood on the sidelines of the dining hall plaza  as local news media photographed a pep rally in support of the Powers team. UMILA members who had invited them to come had placards of support rather than protest as Professor Crawford outlined what the tournament was all about; Madison then introduced the event teams. They the conducted a mock competition for ten minutes, then encouraged all present to attend the official event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is no different than in regular sports,\u201d remarked Erica, \u201ca team representing the school and everyone spurring them on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d replied Kelli. \u201cMadison has confirmed the invitation for Monday and Jeff says he would like to meet you as well. Are we on?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d answered Erica. \u201cAnd last night I wrote the letter \u2013 although my sister thinks I\u2019m nuts. To her I\u2019ve sold out to the enemy and betrayed the President\u2019s wife. She doesn\u2019t get what I think you\u2019ve been trying to tell me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cElites always think that they know what\u2019s best for everyone else. Its that attitude, not their money or education or position, that makes them elitists. In some cases they may even be logically right in their opinions. But not everyone can embrace everyone else\u2019s concept of right and that\u2019s why we are different. We need to leave life choices in many areas up to those who must live with them,\u201d answered Kelli. \u201cIf were simply a matter of choosing a number when it comes to weight it would be one thing \u2013 but there are so many other factors involved.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two new friends parted, looking forward to Monday night. Erica pondered Kelli\u2019s words, wondering if Madison\u2019s emissary sensed her deeper thoughts. And how would Emily react if she even suspected? Erica couldn\u2019t see herself becoming fat but was aware her emotions on the issue as it applied to others shifting. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Monday night rolled around, Erica was nervous. She had never actually confronted Madison and Jeff, or even seen them, since the Proclaimer article. Sure, Kelli was acting as an emissary of sorts between the groups, but Erica still had no way to know if she was in for an awkward dinner, or if they actually were planning on on making nice with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was getting ready, Emily was still having none of the idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're putting on your trendy jeans? Better enjoy them while you still can!\" Emily said with a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" Erica asked, knowing full well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were the ones that showed me photos of Madison. You said it best yourself, once that group seems to take a hold of someone, they tend to gain weight.\" Emily said, acting as if she had a surefire theory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a while ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Half a week is not a while ago, Erica.\" Emily said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can be reserved and be friends with them,\" Erica protested, \"plus, who knows if I'll ever see these people again, I just need to clear the air with them so this thing, that you pushed me to do, by the way, goes away. This past week has been horrible, and they are being nice enough to try to stop it. The least I can do is join them for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of campus, Madison was equally nervous. Starring at her closet in her underwear, she wondered what to pick out. <i>These are the times I wish I were still thin.</i> Madison thought to herself, <i>Then I would have a world of clothes to choose from. My clothes. Not these stand ins.</i> Madison was almost borderline cranky with the idea of the dinner, in stark contrast to where she was when the idea was a bit further out. But now, the idea of meeting thin as a rail Erica, while she was huge, over weight issues was another step in the long journey of her weight acceptance. During the weekend, Madison snacked more, and her weight had climbed up to 194 pounds. Not only did that mean she was feeling temporarily uncomfortable about her current appearance, it also meant that she faced the more practical issue of an ill fitting wardrobe. As she tried on the last remaining pair of jeans, Madison sucked in her gut, and barley got the jeans fastened. It left a muffin top, that Madison tried to conceal with a loose fitting top. However, there was no escaping that her arms looked softer and her chin puffier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the dinner finally got underway, Kelli started off trying to bridge the conversation topics between them. It was a slow and hard task, given the mutual awkwardness between them, and Jeff's natural shyness. Not helping were their socio-economic differences. Madison was the formerly hot, still rich and urban girl from a huge city. Erica's background was decidedly more blue collar, and Madison was almost having feelings of superiority and insecurity at the same time, a very odd sensation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Kelli got to the topic of working out. \"Erica, I'm surprised that you have not seen Madison at the gym, her and Jeff work out together.\" Erica was shocked that Madison was a workout buddy to anyone, given her size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still working out?\" Erica asked, trying to be polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Madison said, \"Jeff and I met because we were in a class together and I was the instructor,\" trying not to embarrass Jeff, Madison side stepped the point of the class, \"It was about healthy lifestyle. As you can see,\" Madison said, patting her belly, \"perhaps I could pay better attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you've been a great teacher,\" Jeff pipped in. \"I've lost around 45 pounds since I started. Madison has been a great teacher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelli noticed that Jeff was eating a lot less than everyone at the table, heck, even than her. Maybe this group was more deep than she had assumed, and the weight issue multi-dimensional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Erica estimated that her four dinner companions collectively weighed over a thousand pounds, with Jeff being the largest followed by Cassie and then Madison. Kelli was obviously the smallest but still outweighing Erica by probably sixty pounds. Cassie had prepared salad, a casserole, and two vegetable sides \u2013 all served family style in a semi-formal setting with cloth napkins and silverware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found the meal, to be satisfying \u2013 certainly higher calorie fare than she was used to, but she wasn\u2019t about to make that the focus of the evening. She was intrigued by the fact that Cassie and Kelli both alluded to boyfriends on the Powers campus, but she bypassed that topic. She wanted to steer the conversation into why she knew she was there, so she addressed her remarks to Cassie, who seemed to be functioning as hostess<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCassie,\u201d Erica began, \u201cI\u2019m here at Powers for a different reason than maybe most \u2013 it was what my parents could afford that wasn\u2019t a state run school. But you seem to be here by choice. Can I ask how that happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, our family tends to be heavier, although its never been a source of major health issues, probably because we\u2019re physically active and don\u2019t eat a lot of process4ed foods. Ours is a corn-fed community with most folk on the chunky side, so its never been a peer group pressure issue. But when you get into mainstream America the \u201cthin is it\u201d mantra can affect you \u2013 which is why my aunt, who used to be a thin city girl, thought Powers would be a great place for me,\u201d explained Cassie. \u201cI was able to get a scholarship so I came.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou  Aunt came to Powers herself?\u201d Erica responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, she wasn\u2019t heavier until later in life. She went to the University of Illinois and weight issues I doubt crossed her mind, She gradually became bigger after getting married to my Uncle, who works in Kansas City. But after getting used to the idea and accepting it she found out about Powers and wished it had been her school. She\u2019s over 200 now, but was probably eighty pounds less when she and Uncle Phil got married. Its kind of cute what happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d Erica probed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhil was bigger than her,\u201d Cassie continued, \u201dA little husky, and he\u2019d picked up a few pounds when they went to a holiday dinner about six months after they were married. He got teased a little about his paunch and Betsy decided to help him by making sure there was less for him to eat at their house. That meant she had to eat deliberately what he instead might.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica paused. \u201cHow did that work?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf Phil brought home snack foods like mini-donuts for a snack he used to consume two thirds of them and give her a couple,\u201d Cassie explained. Now she\u2019d make sure to have at least half. If there were leftovers at supper she\u2019d have seconds so he couldn\u2019t raid the refrigerator. She figured hat by eating more herself so there would be less for him. She thought she could do that without gaining very much, if anything, because she never had a weight gain problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t work I\u2019m guessing.\u201d Erica remarked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it partially did,\u201d Cassie remarked. \u201cAs the months passed he lost the new chub but she picked up some. She got a little spare tire muffin top \u2013 which she regarded as minor. But her family picked up on it the next holiday get together. They needled her, saying it wasn\u2019t just 5-6 pounds like she was estimating, making odds on whether it was 10 pounds or more. Finally she got on a scale and was surprised to find out she\u2019d gained 17 pounds. She was shocked, but my Uncle protested that she looked better for it and that was that. A diet she\u2019d thought about never happened, but the next year brought ten more pounds. Two kids and five years later it was another fifty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd she and her husband are both OK with that?\u201d Erica marveled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErica, strange as it may seem to you, yes. Phil makes no secret of how much he likes it. After getting to know our family I think she adapted, because she\u2019s not shy about filling up her plate when we get together. I\u2019m way heavier than her, as you probably realize, but I think she\u2019s made the transition. Otherwise why would she steer me here or even know about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a key word \u2013 transition,\u201d observed Madison. \u201cWhen I first noticed my clothes getting tighter the first thing I focused on was what other people, my mom I particular, would notice \u2013 not about how I felt about it. Becoming larger happens \u2013 accepting it in today\u2019s environment has to be a conscious effort. And having your Uncle Phil in her corner had to have been a factor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefinitely,\u201d Cassie agreed. \u201cThere is a concept that all fat folk do is stuff their face with snack foods and sugary pastries, then lounge around. Maybe some do, but I know my weight is from good home style cooking and part of my culture.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPowers is reflective of a culture that\u2019s not that traditional by elitist standards,\u201d chimed in Kelli, \u201cbut is actually more reflective of how we as a society are.  I\u2019m glad to be here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd because I was forced to I\u2019m having a hard time getting it,\u201d Erica mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould be,\u201d Jeff interjected. \u201cI was practically fattened by my family because of my Mom\u2019s determination not to have a fat-hating son. I\u2019m a bit of a savant and nerd who was off in his own reality and let her do it. Finally, over time, I came to understand that I needed to assert my own independence. Thankfully my Dad, who personally likes larger women in principle, understands. He underwrote the hiring of Madison to help get me to a middle point that will make me effective in business. . What no one expected was that in helping free me she\u2019d find freedom as well. If I can be around 250 I should be fine with my size \u2013 and I\u2019m fine with Maddie as well. What we both agree on is that our size s our choice, not our parents or peers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo actually neither of you started out here to be the size you are now?\u201d Erica inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope,\u201d replied Madison. \u201cI was looking to make some side money to be independent, Jeff was trying to break loose from his mom\u2019s dominance and be his own person. But then we really got to know one another as persons. Meanwhile Jeff\u2019s gotten smaller and I\u2019ve gotten bigger. That\u2019s the story.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you have the same choice, Erica,\u201d Kelli said. \u201cThe point is, if others choose to be different, larger or smaller, its not easy. And it isn\u2019t right to make fun of anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you can forgive me,\u201d she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDone last week already,\u201c Madison answered with a smile. \u201cAnd by the way, thanks for the letter \u2013 it will be published this week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm, can I say the meal was great and the advice wise, but I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a dessert\u201d Erica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApple pie a la mode, and I\u2019ll get right on it\u201d Cassie answered. Erica marveled at the agility of her obviously 200+ body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica left the dorm stuffed but content. She was not planning to give up her own lifestyle, but she had acquired a decidedly different point of view regarding people of size \u2013 one she knew Emily wouldn't like.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately for Erica, Emily was home, having recently got back from a run. Emily was dressed in her tight workout clothes and her hair in a sporty ponytail. She had heard Erica come in, and started the barrage from the couch while watching TV, without looking back at Erica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how was the farm?\" Emily sarcastically asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It went well, they were really nice.\" Erica responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Emily had gotten up to talk with her, and saw the sight of her sister, still in extremely good shape, but with a bit of a bulge in her shirt, where he stomach was sticking out slightly, a sign that she was stuffed. \"Wow, I guess it went well,\" Emily said, giving Erica a slight tap on her stomach, causing the overly full Erica to groan slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't stop, you're going to end up like them too.\" Emily said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please stop it,\" Erica protested, \"they're less shallow than us, and they seem happier. If they are fine with  their bodies,  why should we care?\" Erica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well aren't you their cheerleader, you're going to end up just as fat as Madison soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caused Erica to nearly snap. She was tired of her sister being such a prick about this evening. \"You know what, at least they have come to terms with their bodies,\" Erica said, getting more pointed, \"And some even know how to control their acne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica knew that was an attack that would harm Emily more than most. Emily had always struggled with acne, having periodic breakouts that crushed her confidence, and made her normal swagger go away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go to hell Erica!\" she said, getting up to go towards her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it isn't so fun when someone starts making fun of your body, is it?\" Erica screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to love seeing you get huge, just like those pigs you ate with tonight.\" Emily snarked as she slammed her bedroom door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica wasn't as angry as Emily was. She just needed to decompress. Grab a quick snack, and watch TV, while she tried to assess what had happened that night. <i>Why does she think I'm going to get fat.</i> Erica thought, <i>That will never happen.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Erica, her belly, still full from the dinner, fell asleep easily despite the upset of the quarrel with her fat phobic sister. In her dreams the fight continued, but she saw herself as a rational human being arguing with a marionette. The marionette looked like her sister, with strings being pulled by the social justice crowd and chief fatophobe Michelle as the puppeteer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica tossed to and fro, arguing with the puppet. No rational discussion was possible it seemed and gradually she resigned herself to that reality. The dream ended and another one replaced it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, instead of being lectured to by her sister and friends she was at a party. All the girls were larger than her, but had attentive guys and were enjoying themselves. The atmosphere was like the dinner earlier that evening:  good food, good fellowship and a feeling of family. It was peaceful and seemed right \u2013 except that she was alone. Inwardly, despite that drawback, she relaxed, her nagging sister no longer a presence, and Erica slept soundly for the rest of the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy morning Erica\u2019s distended belly was back to normal size but her freshly stretched but now empty stomach was hungry.<br>\r\nCautiously she rose. Emily was nowhere to be seen. Erica knew she wanted more than her usual cold cereal and a banana for breakfast. She thought of her new friends, probably in the Power\u2019s cafeteria enjoying pancakes, omelets and sausages.  Frankly the thought appealed to her as well<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily\u2019s warning echoed in her ears \u2013 if she started eating more she would gain weight. But was that the end of the world? The fat girls at Powers like Cassie and Madison had boyfriends. What did she, Erica, have at the moment?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScrew it,\u201d Erica declared to herself. \u201cI have a few dollars \u2013 so what if I\u2019m not on a Power\u2019s meal plan? One large breakfast isn\u2019t going to make me a blimp \u2013 and who knows, I might meet someone if I were a little more available.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving at the dining hall the first thing that caught her eye was a poster proclaiming the Tuesday special of the day \u2013 a luscious spicy Mexican breakfast casserole. She could see from the blown up picture that it had eggs, potatoes, beans and black peppers \u2013 probably cheese and sour cream as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s definitely not low calorie \u2013 but it looks tempting,\u201d she thought. \u201cfor $3.50 served buffet style I wonder what\u2019s included?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I help you,\u201d inquired an attendant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied Erica, \u201cI don\u2019t usually buy breakfast here but I will be this morning.  I was looking at that casserole. What does it come with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo tortillas, plus guacamole and salsa if you want,\u201d replied the attendant. \u201cYou can get coffee with unlimited refills for $1.49.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica saw various other dishes, including corned beef hash, omelets, pancakes, and scrambled eggs, but opted for the casserole. The cafeteria seemed to be becoming quite crowded but she was able to get a small two seat table to herself. About half wayinto her meal another student she recognized from classes seemed at a loss to find a place, standing awkwardly with his tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to join me,\u201d she offered politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, ah, thanks,\u201d he replied, taking the opposite seat. \u201cMy name is Gary \u2026. and you are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErica. I think we have third period together. You seemed to need some help,\u201d she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, got here later than usual and it does fill up. I\u2019ve not seen you here before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I usually eat at home, but today I was in a hurry. This casserole certainly eats anything I have time to prepare. I see you chose corn beef hash and eggs \u2013 and is that a huge blueberry muffin?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep- it is pretty big - I could share it with you if you like. By the way, I notice your coffee cup is nearly empty. Could I fill I for you?\u201d he offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure \u2013 cream and sweet and low, please.\u201d Erica replied. \u201cLet me think about the muffin\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Gary returned Erica had cut the muffin in half and Gary smiled. She was anything but plump but obviously wasn't shy about indulging her appetite. He began wondering whether she\u2019d accept a date.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She still felt full as the noon hour approached and was fretting. She knew the <i>Proclaimer</i> would be coming out the next day and that Gary would likely read it. She wondered if he would make the connection and call off their date.  She hoped he didn\u2019t \u2013 he seemed like a nice guy and it was the first invitation she\u2019d had from anyone since school started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew how Emily would react. She hated Powers and had put her up to composing her protest piece.  Dating a guy who attended there was going to freak her out \u2013 especially if food was involved.  She wanted to talk to someone \u2013 perhaps her mom, but could she be trusted to understand?<br>\r\nErica arrived home early. None of the rest of the family was there. Shortly after five she heard her mom come home from work. Erica joined her in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom \u2013 we need to talk. I have good news and bad news,\u201d she blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d replied a startled Claudia Mays, not used to Erica taking her into her confidence. This had to be serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a date for Saturday night, but I don\u2019t know what Emily is going to say. Irs a guy from Powers and he\u2019s taking me to dinner,\u201d Erica explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSwell, that sounds wonderful. I\u2019ve been thinking that college has been so serious for you \u2013 you haven\u2019t been that social. But why should Emily care? She\u2019s a high school senior\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause its food mother \u2013 and Emily thinks enjoying it is wrong. You know how she is \u2013 or haven\u2019t you noticed?\u201d Erica said with exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re over 18 \u2013 if the young man treats you well and you enjoy his company, why should your sister\u2019s feelings about food control you?  Neither of us can control her!\u201d responded her mom. \u201cMaybe you need to be your own person more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? You\u2019re honestly not afraid I could gain a few pounds She thinks so. Personally I don\u2019t think I\u2019m anywhere near needing to worry about such things, but for the last three years she\u2019s been a nag.\u201d Erica answered. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m sorry for asking you going along with her. Grape-nuts, bananas and toast aren\u2019t really much of a breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmily does I guess overdo it, sweetheart. Maybe I should prepare dessert for a change tonight just to make a point,\u201d Mrs. Mays suggested. \u201cYour father has complained about the focus on rabbit food as well. But I thought it was what you and your sister both wanted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know. I\u2019ve gone along, but enough is enough. Can I help you with making that dessert,\u201d Erica volunteered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurely, and I can also make sure other things are available for breakfast meals if you\u2019ll use them. Pre-prepared crepes and pre-made won ton wrappers are great for a variety of things \u2013 I could put some in the freezer if you want to experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm, go ahead. *I can see the potential,\u201d replied Erica thoughtfully as she strapped on an apron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily\u2019s discomfiture was obvious that evening as Mrs. Mays served the family beef stroganoff with green beans pus Erica\u2019s apple crisp for dessert. Erica served herself generous portions and Mr. Mays commended his wife for the surprise change in menu. Emily glared at her sister but held her peace as Erica just smiled.<br>\r\nAfter supper Emily cornered Erica and demanded to know what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple, dear sister. I\u2019ve gone over to the other side \u2013 not to be a fatty but not be a fanatic either. And, oh yes, I have a dinner date on Saturday,\u201d she disclosed cheerily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd tomorrow morning you\u2019re having cheese blintzes for breakfast I suppose,\u201d her sister retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm, don\u2019t think we have the fixings. But Mom did talk about getting some pre-frozen crepes and wontons to put in the freezer so that I could experiment with menu variety,\u201d Erica said coolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou cooking?  When did this start?\u201d answered Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually with dessert tonight. But don\u2019t you remember that I got an A in Home Ec?  I can do it when I want \u2013but you\u2019ve made me feel guilty and that\u2019s stopping.\u201d Erica declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what Miss Stennis has warned about \u2026 start eating a little and it\u2019s a slippery slope. Next thing you know you\u2019re a butterball,\u201d Emily parried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s been preaching that line for years and probably believes it. But have you considered that its that attitude that\u2019s made her an old maid? She\u2019s even admitted she doesn\u2019t want a husband and family. I don\u2019t know why she is a teacher.\u201d.\u201d Erica declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just don\u2019t understand about inequality and social injustice \u2013 she\u2019s given up traditional values to try to change things,\u201d Emily asserted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s her right, although I\u2019m starting to wonder if it belongs in school. But others have right to a view different from hers.  Powers is making me see that \u2013 does it scare you?\u201d Erica challenged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and your belly is already twice as big as mine because you ate so much tonight,\u201d Emily pointed out.  Erica's belly was in fact a bit distended past her waistband but it wouldn't have normally been a cause for notice. Erica knew this and  just smiled contentedly as her sister rolled her eyeballs and marched off in a huff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Mr. and Mrs. Mays were recalling the time to which Erica was alluding about five years before.  Erica, already slender, had resolved to lose a few pounds while prepping for tryouts with the high school cheerleading team. Emily had teased her alleging that she was \u201cfat,\u201d which was hardly the truth, but she took it as such without consulting anyone. The remark made her aware of her \u201ceat whatever suits me\u201d behavior and she\u2019d stopped eating a lot of her favorite dishes because she felt they were dangerous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankly the change had bothered Claudia but she\u2019d gone along with the initial request. Erica did lose 12 pounds, made the team and Emily felt empowered over her older sister. Over the next several years Emily became increasingly fatophobic and Erica had gone along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow things appeared to be were changing and Erica\u2019s mom felt relieved at the direction. She\u2019d privately been concerned about her daughter\u2019s aversion to many foods and considered her to possibly be underweight. This an opinion shared by her husband who privately feared that Erica and Emily could become anorexic. He suggested that, in addition to the pre-prepared crepes and won ton shells Claudia perhaps should quietly add some ice cream quarts to the augmented freezer stash. <br>\r\n.<br>\r\nWhen the <i>Proclaimer</i> apology hit the next day Erica received a number of kind comments about her retraction. Even her fellow cheerleaders at Powers thought it good that she\u2019d chosen to back off.   As for Gary, he acted in class as though he hadn\u2019t read it, simply remarking that he was looking forward to their evening and would pick her up around six. .<br>\r\n <br>\r\nErica felt liberated and was looking forward to the remainder of the week. She had no intention or desire to eat much more than normal, but she did enjoy giving herself the freedom to have what she felt like. Her Mom asked for meal planning suggestions and was pleasantly surprised when Erica responded by saying \u201cOh maybe Mexican or Italian \u2013 or, even better, its been ages since we had one of your casseroles.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Darlene surprised Erica by giving herself a generous breakfast of crepes, eggs and coffee.  Erica cautiously followed her lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wanted to let you know how proud I was of you for apologizing and writing the retraction in the Proclaimer,\u201d Darlene began after they were seated. . \u201cAnd I think you\u2019re ready for me to share my story.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d asked Erica, totally confused. She had half-expected a lecture and was instead being treated as a confidant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI\u2019m probably the heaviest cheerleader captain you\u2019ve ever seen -  good 35 pounds more than when I came to Powers. That\u2019s why I put myself at the base of the pyramid this year; my thighs have filled out so much that they touch. You can\u2019t see between them.  Probably next year I won\u2019t even be on the squad. Have you <br>\r\nnoticed?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not really \u2013 I wasn\u2019t here last year and you don\u2019t look especially big on this campus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s be brutally honest,\u201d Darlene said, \u201cI\u2019m on the way to becoming a new Power\u2019s porker. If I wear my smaller clothes my belly already pooches slightly over the elastic of my waistband and my hips are starting to flare. Another twenty pounds and I\u2019ll be showing love handles when eating breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow,\u201d responded Erica.\u201d I really hadn\u2019t thought about it, but you act as though  none ofhis bothers you, its just a statement. Is that because your boyfriend Harold likes you bigger?\u201d\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that certainly helps,\u201d replied Darlene, \u201cbut its only half the story. Unlike you I am here at Powers by intent and not surprised about what has happened with me. Harold and me happened after I arrived. I think you might find the back story interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK,\u201d replied Erica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt began with the day of my sister\u2019s 18th birthday. I\u2019m three year\u2019s younger than her, which would mean I was fifteen. She wanted to wear a favorite dress which she loved from the day she got it. She walked to our room and started to don it by pulling it up from around her feet. Everything was fine until arriving at the belly, getting no further. It was barely four months since it had been given to her and then it had fit her perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u201dHave I gained weight?\u201d she wondered aloud to no one in particular. I knew better than to say anything, so held my tongue.  She looked in the mirror and shrugged. Apparently to her it seemed the same like always. She may have considered the possibility that she\u2019d been eating more food than normal. I don\u2019t know. She had acquired a new boyfriend about six months before who enjoyed treating her, but was it even possible to outgrow a dress in only 16 weeks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose so,\u201d said Erica, \u201cBut she would have had to really be pigging out I would think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are probably right,\u201d remarked Darlene, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t think she had been doing that. Still, as she stood there I considered the evidence of what had been going on for the previous few months. As the school year ended she had frequently studied with food at her side and for breakfast and supper generally had been eating bigger portions than me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom had noticed her clothes were getting snug, that\u2019s why she\u2019d bought sis a new wardrobe after graduation, including the dress. It was a size 10 \u2013 larger than what she\u2019d worn before. But sis hadn\u2019t really noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, it did not matter for the moment. The dress was not fitting, so she next grabbed her jeans, not wanting to waste time on her birthday. They too seemed tight and a bit uncomfortable \u2013 she\u2019d been wearing shorts for most of the past six week of summer. Finally she decided to wear some leggings and an elastic shirt and joined our family and her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe all went to eat at an Italian restaurant called Buca de Beppo and everything was buenisimo. The portions were huge and sis and her boyfriend plunged right in. Soon she was noting that her skirt was feeling snug.  Still, she went ahead and had dessert at my family and boyfriend\u2019s urging. This she later told me she regretted, because she realized that such enjoyment was the reason her clothes suddenly weren\u2019t fitting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen she got home the first thing she did was get on the scale. Her weight had increased 8 kilograms since the beginning of the year, but she just hadn\u2019t noticed it. She called her boyfriend, thinking he might have noticed and wondering why he hadn\u2019t said anything. He said yes, she might have gained some but mot to worry - he liked it a lot what had happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe initially wasn\u2019t sure what to make of all this. Neither frankly did I. She thought it a bit odd that her boyfriend would like her body with 8 more kilograms, which is like 17 pounds. Then he really surprised her, saying that he would not mind if she fattened up a little more. This she found really weird but he suggested she search the Internet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what happened?\u201d asked Erica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe did as he'd suggested,,\u201d continued Darlene as she ate the last of her crepe. \u201cand discovered a whole community of people who loved eating, or feeding. She decided her boyfriend was one of them, and realized that he had been encouraging her appetite even before she was given the dress. Since she loved the food she began considering whether gaining weight wasn\u2019t really that bad ....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey talked it over and decided they were both comfortable with both her appetite and the results.  After that she began to eat until she was full and left off sports altogether as she went on to college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaturally she got bigger every month, nearly sixty pounds over the next two years. She told me her boyfriend massaged her tummy, stroking, tapping gently and finally giving it a kiss.. She also got fed by him slowly in her mouth, which she savored with incredible pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe loved those moments, which she shared with me. She loved those moments, but she and her boyfriend eventually went their separate ways. She continued her journey alone, which led her into transferring to Powers for her final year. Her most recent birthday dress was a size 24 after graduation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you?\u201d asked Erica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy own attitude towards food and weight began to change from her example. I was fascinated by it but was locked into the regimen of high school. I shared and enjoyed some stuffings with her. It intrigued me but I held off until after my own graduation. Then during the summer I began to let myself relax, finally going along with a suggestion from my aunt that I try attending Powers and let my body seek its level.\u201c  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what happened?\u201d Erica probed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI began creeping up slowly my freshman year. It wasn't that great because I do work out but, as you can tell, my body isn\u2019t immune to a few pounds gained gradually. I\u2019m nearly 150 now and while I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be getting huge I feel better than I did at 125.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the point of telling me all this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust to let you know that I appreciate your change of view \u2013 because I had to make a transition as well. You\u2019ll decide, as I have, where you\u2019re most comfortable and realize that others make their own choices as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that both girls realized that first period was approaching and disposed of their trash before moving on. Erica noted that her friend\u2019s bellyassuredly wasn\u2019t flat, its outline stretching against the fabric of her pants. As she turned Erica took especial note of Darlene\u2019s derriere and nodded. The cheerleading captain definitely wasn\u2019t skinny. Her hips and thighs weren't huge but had obvious extra padding \u2013 and her waist was bordering on thick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica\u2019s head was spinning as she realized that the transition Darlene had related could potentially apply to her as well.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Darlene\u2019s discourse Erica wasn\u2019t focused on the subject matter in class. She was instead observing the impact of Powers cuisine and lifestyle on her classmates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan Peters was a good example. At the beginning of the year she had just been another face in the crowd, with a figure tending to plumpness but no larger than the average new Powers co-ed. However, since she habitually used a seat in first period caddy corner in front of Erica the calorie conscious observer had taken judgmental notice of Susan\u2019s fulsome torso and somewhat larger than average butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019d better watch it or that fanny will bloom,\u201d Erica had thought. And she had been right. About two months in she observed Susan having difficulties with her tank top and slacks, needing to adjust them whiner she rose from her chair, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day Susan noticed Erica looking at her and quipped dismissively \u201cyeah, they\u2019re snug \u2013 must be putting on some weight. It happens to everyone in college I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cEveryone who doesn\u2019t lay off the goodies,</i>\u2019 Erica had thought. But Susan didn\u2019t seem bothered. Two weeks later she had a different set of clothes that fit better \u2013 and now they too were filling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n All the student center food was definitely having an impact on Susan\u2019s body, especially her lower half, and she knew it. She was, Erica realized, choosing to either accept her expansion or be in denial over it, Erica didn\u2019t know which. Each morning Susan was finding it more difficult to stuff her rounding belly into her shorts. She would suck in her breath and pull, which worked for the moment. The problem was that it left a muffin top above the waistband and another roll beneath. While walking or standing this made no great difference, but in class her waistband would gradually work its way down behest the lower part of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica watched this unfolding struggle and held her peace, but it didn\u2019t surprise her when Susan suddenly started wearing erring skirts to class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarge Downing by contrast was fat by any standard before coming to Powers. Friendly and congenial her belly was large enough that she had to spread her thighs to give it room when sitting down. But, Erica noticed, she was apparently accustomed to this and didn\u2019t care. Her bras cut into the flesh of her backside and rolls that Erica leashed were called \u201clove handles\u201d by some adorned her sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica had seen Marge at a nearby table while she was taking with Darlene. She had a drink, large burrito, and some eggs. While chatting with two other Powers coeds in the 200+ range. Erica began to have the realization that, like Darlene and probably Susan and others Marge had embraced life in the fast lane, a path Erica\u2019s sister Emily feared and loathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica skipped lunch, taking refuge in the nearly vacant library at that hour so that she could think. Her new friends, her mom and perhaps Gary the next evening were seemingly encouraging her to let go of her homage to the fatophobes, but what if Emily was right and she became huge?  No answers came and she went hungry to her afternoon classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Erica arrived home her mom was there \u2013 of itself a bit unusual. But she was cooking supper and invited Erica to have something from the pantry. She looked and noticed a breadbox, inside of which were several pastries. Her belly growling she settled for a bear claw and a large glass of milk. Then she confronted her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, this pastry hits the spot and lasagna tonight? And I know you have ice cream in the freezer for dessert.  You know I\u2019m likely going to get stuffed by Gary tomorrow night because he\u2019s from Powers. Aren\u2019t you that concerned about upsetting Emily\u2019s world?\u201d she inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom sat down \u201cIt isn\u2019t about Emily and you \u2013 its about you finding and making your own way. A few good sized meals isn\u2019t going to add three pounds or three hundred, no matter what your sister says. But you need to be free to make your own choices. \u201cYes, there is ice cream in the freezer \u2013 but you can choose to skip it if you wish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been freely deciding these kind of things before?\u201d Erica replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMo,\u201d relied her mom. \u201cNone of us have, especially not Emily since she came under the influence of that fanatic teacher. We\u2019ve all been intimidated into going along with a nanny-nanny approach for the sake of peace \u2013but not because we really felt it was right and balanced. Powers in my view is at the other extreme, but where you decide to wind up should be your choice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I understand and thanks mom,\u201d said Erica as she finished her bear claw and headed to her room for a nap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night she had a single generous serving of lasagna to Emily\u2019s dismay \u2013 and polished it off with a triple scoop of spumoni.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Erica was deliberately late for breakfast Saturday morning, wanting to avoid confrontation with Emily. Her sister was gone as well as her Dad by the time she entered the vacant kitchen around 9:30. As she selected a banana to go with some cold grope nuts cereal her mom entered and offered to cook an omelet, but the slender freshman declined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what Gary has in mind for tonight but I need to be sure I have room in my belly,\u201d she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom smiled. \u201cHe likes girls with an appetite?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve no idea, but he is a guy at Powers so its possible.\u201d Erica replied pleasantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow well do you know him?\u201d Claudia May enquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBarely at all really, except across the room in class. The dining hall was crowded and I offered him a seat, that\u2019s how we met. But he seems nice and friendly enough. Emily of course thinks he\u2019s a typical Power\u2019s chubby chaser who is going to turn me into a prize hog overnight,\u201d Erica explained.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot on a single date, darling. I suggest you be fair and not prejudge him,\u201d her mom replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course \u2013 but I am learning that Powers does have a certain bias in their admissions policy. Some guys who like bigger girls do attend there deliberately. Some jerk from off-campus even got arrested for trying to \u201csave\u201d a new Freshman from being pulled into the vortex \u2013 I suppose you read about it,\u201d noted Erica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, Emily saw to that,\u201d Mrs. Mays acknowledged, rolling her eyeballs. \u201cBut as you know he was a nut case from off campus, not part of the student body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the way, there are two blueberry and cheese Danishes from breakfast left over in the breadbox if you feel like having one.\u201d<br>\r\nEric was startled at the abrupt change of subject. Was her Mom trying to get her to eat more?  She simply smiled and said thank you, deciding not to explore the topic further. But around noon, with her mom gone, she remembered the offer and had one for a snack. Then she texted Gary for guidance on what to wear \u2013 wondering where they were headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChoice of three, none of them super fancy \u2013 but you will do the deciding,\u201d he replied cryptically. See you at five.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm,\u201d thought Erica, \u201cI guess I can get away with wearing my mid-length dark blue cotton cargo shorts. With six pockets  I won\u2019t need to carry my bill fold. Yes, with a belt and white top it should be acceptable anywhere and it looks college rather than formal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat decided Erica lay down for a nap. When she awoke shortly after three she found herself thinking of the reaming blueberry Danish.  As she retrieved it from the kitchen she thought mischievously \u201cI can imagine what Emily would say if she saw me doing this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary showed up on schedule and as promised offered Erica her choice of three destinations: \u201cCracker Barrel southern style, Jose Pepper\u2019s Tex Mex or Town and Country American family \u2013 all good, but three different palates.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly?\u201d replied Erica, \u201cI\u2019ve only been to one of them, but that was ten years ago at least as a kid. Didn\u2019t Jose Pepper get started in Wichita?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d replied Gary, \u201cthat they did. Now they\u2019re a chain with stores from here to Kansas ty. So, that\u2019s your choice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so,\u201d replied Erica, wondering what was in store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo be it,\u201d answered Gary. \u201cAnd if things go well the others can be visited another time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they drove the approximately 30 miles to Jose Pepper\u2019s original site Gary asked Erica some general questions about her classes. She replied in kind, learning that he knew computers, stayed current on geopolitics and was majoring in business administrator. She began to wonder if he was so cerebral that he\u2019d not even read the <i>Proclaimer</i> or had any idea of the furor she\u2019d caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe last time I was here I had a pair of their avocado and chicken enchiladas,\u201d Gary volunteered. \u201cThey were topped with jalapeno cream sauce and garnished with guacamole. Best of all, they came with the usual Mexican rice and refried beans, but the beans were \u201clard free\u201d, which is unusual for a Tex-Mex restaurant. Of course you can have anything on the menu you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica was already getting hungry but was at a loss as to how to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat about tacos and burritos?\u201d she inquired, reflecting her limited knowledge of cuisine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey have those, and chimichangas as well, even chili rellanos. If you want there\u2019s a huge sampler but you\u2019ll probably wind up taking half it home,\u201d he commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica quietly decided to avoid the sampler, but found herself looking forward to the dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at Jose Peppers Gary ordered chile con queso to go with the complimentary tortilla chips. Gary then ordered his avocado enchiladas and Erica wound up with a burrito, enchilada and taco combo. She was astonished when it arrived with the same sides as Gary\u2019s order. She had expected to be a la carte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust eat when you can and take the rest home,\u201d he counseled. \u201cPlaces like this expect it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy that time Erica had volunteered the <i>Proclaimer</i> issue and told Gary about Emily.  He\u2019d admitted to having made the link after he\u2019d already asked her but felt it was a closed issue so why bother rehashing it. As for Emily, she obviously had her own issues to resolve. He seemed more concerned about his world view and that of Erica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica took her time but after consuming about two-thirds she confessed she was ready to pack the rest. Gary grinned and said \u201cso be it \u2013 and I hope you liked it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh definitely,\u201d replied Erica. \u201cI can see where girls can gain some weight being treated like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot unless they do it every day \u2013 dining out should be a special time, not something to be feared,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt\u2019s what people do regularly and what their body make up is that determines such things \u2013 not everyone is the same. At least that\u2019s what the studies at Rockefeller University indicate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica took a deep breath. She knew how tight her cargo shorts belt felt \u2013 she had stuffed herself silly. But it had been enjoyable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re not into this obesity epidemic thing that has so many concerned?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf the cure has to be feeding children the slop that\u2019s being forced down kid\u2019s throats with this school lunch program, no way,\u201d he answered. \u201cHave you seen the pictures they\u2019re posting on Twitter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but I\u2019ve heard they\u2019re pretty bad,\u201d Erica admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts nanny government gone wild,\u201d Gary asserted. \u201cKid\u2019s shouldn't be made to feel guilty about enjoying meals \u2013 minimizing the sugar and salt is fine, but not this genetically modified fare with chemical additives.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica found herself agreeing with both his statement and passion. She began to see more clearly just how far off Ms Stennis and Emily were. But she elected not <br>\r\nto develop that topic any further for the moment. Gary helped her by shifting to another topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall Erica had a great evening \u2013 one where food was factor but not the whole focus.  Erica went home feeling she and Gray would be seeing more of each other \u2013 and if she gained a few pounds it was none of Emily\u2019s concern. She felt confident that her mom and dad had her back on that one. What she didn\u2019t fully realize was that Gary, who found her to be a sweet if somewhat naive girl he was attracted to, was fully aware of how much she\u2019d consumed. Between the appetizer, entr\u00e9e and two large non diet sodas she\u2019d packed way nearly 800 more calories than he had \u2013 not counting the take home leftovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled contentedly all the way back to Powers.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Erica arrived home full but contented. Emily to her relief was nowhere in sight \u2013 and her parents were sharing popcorn in front of the TV. They invited her to join in, but she declined \u2013 she didn\u2019t care about the program and was too stuffed to snack. She put the leftovers in the refrigerator and retried to her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere she sat down at her desk, the computer monitor off to relax and contemplate. . She reviewed the evening with Gary and felt good about it. She texted him \u201cthks for erytng \u2013 I\u2019ll slp  wl 2nite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she went to bed, removed her clothes for a nightgown and turned out the light. But she was restless, her mind wrestling with the contrast between Gary\u2019s approach and that of her younger sister. She realized that she needed to makeup her own mind \u2013 but what actually did she want?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore losing those 12 pounds and falling into her sister\u2019s web she\u2019d never been truly heavy \u2013 just a little thicker than some. And it hadn\u2019t bothered her to have a piece of pie or seconds on a casserole. Then she\u2019d paid a price to make the cut for cheerleading \u2013 but she now realized something strange had happened along the way. Feeling deprived herself she\u2019d become judgmental of others. And that, she now realized was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought of a onetime friend, Jennifer, who\u2019d taken anther path and tried to warn her, but she\u2019d cut ties rather than listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo one says that you need to hangout on at McDonalds and clean the board with their dollar menu,\u201d Jennifer Wiggins had said. \u201cPersonally I prefer Salisbury steak sandwiches homemade. But we\u2019re growing teens and shouldn\u2019t be starving ourselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d watched Jennifer make her choice \u2013 her thighs and bulbous butt growing a little more bountiful with every after school snack and lunchtime extra pastry. But it was a slow gradual process and Jennifer seemed either not to notice or simply not care. She had no self-hatred or loathing towards her body even as her belly developed into a roll that was plainly visible through whatever she wore. But as her neck and arms followed her thickening torso and she began developing a softer chin Jennifer simply changed her hairstyle to a ponytail and kept on eating, which at the time infuriated Erica<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother year passed and Erica wasn\u2019t talking to Jennifer, who\u2019d by then acquired a boyfriend (something Erica never seemed to attract). The tight waistband of Jennifer\u2019s slacks by then was creating a muffin top even when standing. She changed wardrobes, but not her eating habits.  On occasion she would glance at Erica picking at her usual salad with Emily and shake her head sadly as she paraded by with a tray of spaghetti or Mexican lasagna. But then the school cafeteria went to prepackaged \u201chealthy meals\u201d and laid off their cooks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer had become one of Emily\u2019s \u201chogs\u201d at probably 170-180 pounds by graduation, but somehow Erica had sensed that her former friend was happier \u2013 and friskily attractive both in her prom dress and graduation gown. But she\u2019d moved on and was now attending college at Stanford while Erica was at Powers.<br>\r\nFinally, after midnight, Erica fell asleep \u2013 quietly angry at having allowed Emily to so control her destiny.  She slept until late in the morning. Both Emily and her parents were gone; Erica went to the refrigerator and finished her meal from the night before but didn\u2019t feel full. She went to the freezer and retrieved a half-gallon container of cherry vanilla ice-cream, making it the foundation of a homemade banana split replete with strawberry jam, and some rainbow sprinkles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica was cleaning up just after 11:00 when her mm arrived home and offered to make lunch.  She declined, saying she\u2019d just fished breakfast using the leftovers from the night before (but not mentioning the extra dessert).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds fine by me \u2013 your Dad and I had burritos at IHOP \u2013 then he went over to Jack Rivers place and I went shopping,\u201d her mom remarked. \u201c:I guess things went well last night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Erica acknowledged, \u201cBut if Gary and I start dating Emily\u2019s going to fuss when I gain back those 12 pounds \u2013plus probably some more. He\u2019s with you and Dad \u2013 be myself, and weight choices shouldn\u2019t be anyone else\u2019s business but that of the one carrying the pounds. But I suspect he\u2019ll make choosing food an easy choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudia Mays smiled knowingly, \u201cand you seem happy about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStrangely, within reason, yeah,\u201d Erica replied. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen overnight but you\u2019re going to likely see a thicker Erica \u2013 whether Miss Stennis and Emily like it or <br>\r\nnot.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudia smiled again. \u201cYour dad will be happy to hear that. There have been tines he\u2019s worried you could go anorexic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnorexics loathe their bodies and see themselves as fat and ugly even when their way underweight. I\u2019ve never hated my body, but was just conforming, so I don\u2019t think it was ever a danger,\u201d Erica replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that honey, but if you need a new wardrobe just let me know,\u201d her mom replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica was a little taken back by that statement but her grazing the next week did reflect a new attitude. She made a point of having lunch at t he same time as Gary and letting him see that he was following Powers tradition in  food choices. At home she several times had late evening snacks, ignoring Emily\u2019s censorious glare. And just to rub things in she replaced her usual grape nuts breakfast with more substantial omelets and higher calorie cinnamon toast crunch cold cereal.  Her mom took due notice, as well as the fact that some ice-cream had been used from the freezer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next weekend was the tournament. Powers finished first in 5 of the 12 events, including the teams headed by Madison and Jeff. They came in second or third in four others, garnering enough points to win the tournament \u2013 and for Erica another dinner date with Gary in celebration. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With Power\u2019s success at the state academic competition behind her Madison had another issue to deal with. Video of the contests, rebroadcast on cable tv, had been viewable in Florida.  Of course Madison had already confided the truth to her Dad, at least to some degree; she had also forewarned her concerned mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now there was no more room for hinting.  The television camera even tends to add a few pounds. Both her family and friends now knew just how porcine the formerly svelte brunette had become -- and her mom wasn\u2019t happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u2018What is it with that school? From what I could see on television most of your entire team were made up of overweight students.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom,\u201d protested Madison,\u201d is that really all you saw? We were on television for winning, not because of our waistlines!  And yes, Powers does have a heavier than average student body. But the education quality gives us a hiring record upon graduation in the top 10% of the nation. Doesn\u2019t that count for anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I suppose,\u2019 said her mom hesitantly, \u201cbut how do your classmates feel about becoming such porkers? Not everyone can be as lucky as you and take up with an heir to a fortune.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow cut that out!\u201d protested Madison. \u201cI\u2019ve already had to deal with the gold-digger issue with his family and I don\u2019t need it from my own. I found out about his family fortune the same way Dad did \u2013 from researching after we were already involved. But about my classmates I can give you some stories that you might not believe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what?\u201d her mm replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is a new freshman,\u201d Madison related, \u201cwho came here as flat bellied as you could want. But she enjoys eating so much that her stuffed tummy looked like a food baby when she was finished \u2013 until it wore out the next day. At least at first.  But she came to enjoy the buffet breakfasts, great lunches and of course the dinners that the students make themselves. Gradually her food baby became not just overnight but more like all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter a few months her entire waist began forming what is called a muffin top. Her waistband started slipping down and her top began riding up so that her belly was showing \u2013 she had to start wearing an over blouse to keep it from being exposed.  So what do you think happed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would hope she woke up to what was happening and started on a diet,\u201d exclaimed her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope. Just the opposite,\u201d Madison declared. \u201cAt the beginning, when she\u2019d grab a snack or have desserts she\u2019d make jokes around the dorm about keeping her food baby happy. Her weight gain attracted the attention of one of the guys who likes bigger girls and he gave her a box of cookies for the food baby. They\u2019ve been steady for four months now and she\u2019s into her second wardrobe change. She\u2019s still pampering her food baby and he\u2019s great with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean they\u2019re deliberately getting her fatter? What on earth for?\u201d protested her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess she felt repressed and is now letting it all out \u2013 who knows?\u201d replied Madison. \u201cBut she\u2019s only unusual for declaring it so openly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat school sounds like hog heaven! I don\u2019t know how I let your father talk me into going along with that scholarship offer,\u201d her mom sputtered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand his thinking. No one wants to spend $60,000 for an education if they can get it for nothing. But you\u2019re right about the food policy here \u2013 Michelle Obama and her food Nazi army would be appalled. The student meal program is incredible in both taste and calories \u2013 and it shows. But mom, we\u2019re happy and have a future. Shouldn\u2019t those be important things?\u201d queried Madison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurely not everyone there wants to be a heifer I would hope,\u201d countered her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, although I wouldn\u2019t call any of us heifers. We basically just want the freedom to be ourselves and that isn\u2019t a dress size or a number on a chart. But you\u2019re right,\u201d Madison acknowledged, thinking of Erica. \u201cOne girl wrote a snide letter to the Proclaimer, our school paper, but then she backed off and apologized after others took an opposing view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat same girl after we won the tournament, was with several of us when we celebrated the next day with a breakfast of southwestern quiche.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d asked Mrs. Kraft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEggs, flour, three kinds of cheese, mushrooms, bell peppers, olives, picante sauce, flour and half and half, all baked in a piecrust \u2013 you should try cooking it,\u201d suggested Madison.\u201dIts completely meatless, although quiches can have beef, chicken or sausage if you want.  The recipe\u2019s on the internet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMixing half and half with eggs and cheese is going to have a gazillion calories,\u201d observed her mom. \u201cIs that what they teach there \u2013 high calorie cooking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison laughed. \u201cNot really \u2013 I\u2019ve been learning to cook using the Internet.  But this is  a very pro-size school, no doubt about it. The student center meals have both salads and the high calorie entrees \u2013 its our choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I think you know that electing high calorie choices isn\u2019t my view,\u201d mumbled her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I understand that. It wasn\u2019t mine at first. It\u2019s been a real paradigm shift,\u201d acknowledged Madison. \u201cBut now you have a large economy size daughter who is too happy and too busy to be anything different than what feels right for her. Its really not that bad, Mom.\u201d\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I need to think about this,\u201d her mom conceded. \u201cYou know that I love you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and know that I love you too,\u201d said Madison as she hung up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her mom off the phone she looked out the window and sighed, her hand absent mindedly running over the supple flesh of her inner thigh.  It was soft and spongy, definitely fat, but she did not feel repulsed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered how fully rounded her upper arms looked in the mirror that morning, not to mention her upper torso. This image must have indeed surprised her mom but Madison was already comfortable with these features.  Instead her mind began thinking of the frozen \u00e9clairs and ice cream she knew lay waiting in the freezer, not to mention the package of oatmeal and raisin cookies in the pantry. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison shrugged. The \u00e9clairs could wait. She knew it would take time for her mom to accept her choice, but Madison was comfortable within her body. She could give her mom space to adapt; for now it was time to finish a report \u2013 then raid the kitchen before retiring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Erica she had enjoyed the breakfast - plus grazing twice in addition to her other meals for the day.Her mom actually seemed to favor Erica's zestfully helping herself to a second helping of meat loaf and potatoes that evening - her menus had definitely become more varied. And as far as she could tell it wasn't yet having any noticeable effect except to increase Erica's enjoyment of food now that she was no longer treating it as an enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica was aware, of course, that she had been eating more and things could change. But this didn't seem to matter. She was edging closer to going along with Susan's \"c est la Vive\" attitude about her weight. Why,she wondered as she lay in her bedroom finished off an evening bowl of ice cream with strawberry topping, couldn't her sister Emily accept this?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Emily was sitting at her family's dinner table, watching her family eat and chatter. She couldn't bring herself to say anything because all she could do was stare at how nonchalant her family had become over food, and namely her sister's weight gain. Ever since Erica joined the academic competition team she had slowly become accustomed to their ways of eating whatever and not caring about the consequences, in this case the consequences being the now permanent bulge sitting in her lap. It irked Emily beyond belief that Erica would let herself get like this, and that her parents would be following suit! Even they had put on a few pounds, her dad's shirt straining at the buttons and her mom's pudge spilling out of her sweater some. Emily simply couldn't take it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this to yourselves?!\" She finally yelled as she banged on the table. Everyone abruptly stopped eating and talking and just stared at Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you not seem to care about health anymore! You let Erica eat whatever and hang out with that group of fatties and you even have started eating like that too! It's not attractive and I don't want to have to be associated with that image!\" she yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry you feel that way, honey. I know that the change is hard, but different people are made for different lifestyles. We've simply realized that ours needs to be more relaxed and less rigid. If you want to keep a stricter diet than you may, just like Erica has chosen to follow a more loose diet. You're both adults, it's up to you,\" replied her mom. Her dad nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We aren't going to push you to be or eat any which way, that's your choice. However, maybe loosening up a bit won't kill you, you are in very good shape after all. A little wiggle room won't hurt you,\" said her dad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you're doing this; you're defending your new eating habits like this! You're all going to become fat if you keep this up, I promise you,\" declared Emily. She looked around the table and noticed that Erica was staring down at her rounded stomach, crying over the comments from her sister, and then ran away from the table. Her parents watched this unfold and turned angrily back to Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily, this behavior is now unacceptable! There are now two things you have to do: one, apologize to your sister for those comments. Two, you are grounded for a month, but not in the traditional sense. Your grounding will consist of you following your sister's diet for a month so you understand exactly how those comments made her feel,\" her dad declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what happened to me being an adult and making my own choices? This doesn't sound like that!\" Emily fought back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was before you devastated your sister. Now, whatever she eats, you eat. You are going to essentially spend a month in her shoes so you don't make this mistake again.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I hate you, Erica, god I hate you,\" Emily muttered as she attempted to button her jeans. For two weeks she's had to eat all the same things as Erica, and Erica was not going easy on her, eating worse than usual just to torture her sister the way her sister had tortured her about her new eating habits. Every day It felt like the two were eating an entire grocery store, and it was showing on both of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was displaying everything she hated now. She had weighed herself before getting dressed and was up 15 pounds in 2 weeks, all of it going to her stomach. By no means was she even close to chubby, but she had a belly protruding from her body. It was killing Emily, she was only 2 weeks in and still had 2 more weeks to go, and who knows what those would do to her body. This brought Erica some joy, to know that her sister would finally get a taste of her own medicine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause Emily was having to eat everything Erica ate, Erica was showing results of the extreme overindulgence as well. While she had only put on about 25 pounds before her sister's punishment, she had put on another 20 from eating constantly with Emily (considering she had a head start on her weight and her metabolism had slowed more, she gained more from the same amount of food). The bulge that set Emily off in the first place was now a proper gut, growing wider and taking up a good portion of her lap when she sat and shaking whenever she moved. The rest of her just got softer, her legs jiggling a bit more than they used to and her face looking less angular. Her overall appearance sent her into chubby territory officially, meaning her thin girl days would be long behind her by the time Emily's punishment was over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily, it's time for breakfast!\" Erica's mom called upstairs. Their parents would cook whatever Erica wanted them to as a part of the punishment for Emily, and that meant Erica was choosing the most calorie-laden dishes she possibly could to leave an impact on her sister, but because it was for the family her parents were showing the effects a little bit as well. The sliver of pudge her mom had before had grown into more of a muffin top, love handles hanging over the waistband of her jeans more than just a couple inches. Her dad's buttons were beginning to strain two weeks ago on his work shirts but now he's almost at the point where he has to replace his shirts because the gaps between the buttons are simply growing too big. Her parents were enjoying food before, but Erica's approach to her sister's punishment was causing them to adjust more to this extreme diet, something that would be hard to shake once it's all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica was already downstairs and shoveling food into her mouth when Emily made her way down. Emily was barely able to get her jeans closed, which was evident when she sat down and her stomach formed two small bulges where the jeans dug into her stomach. Erica saw how uncomfortable Emily was and couldn't help but smile a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I chose today for us to eat stuffed French toast. It's filled with a cream cheese frosting and topped with maple syrup. Sounds good, right?\" she said to Emily. Emily grunted and shot her sister a dirty look as she began to eat her heavy breakfast. Emily had to admit that it tasted good, but she was struggling to finish it considering how heavy it was. But, because she had to, she was able to finish the 2 large pieces she was presented (although it was a while after Erica finished hers). By this point it was already 11 AM, which meant Emily only had an hour and a half to recover from her first rich meal of the day, which was her new pattern on Saturdays and Sundays. Emily looked down at her now bloated stomach, something she was ashamed to say that she was getting accustomed to seeing on her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"EMILY, WAKE UP!\" Emily's jolted up in bed at the sound of someone yelling in her ear, looking over and seeing her sister standing right next to her bed with a grin on her face. \"It's the last day of the month!\" She said as she skipped out of her sister's room to make her way down to the kitchen to help her mom finish putting together the last day's meals. Emily got herself out of bed and groggily made her way into the bathroom to get ready for the day. She had a cheerleading competition that day so she put on her cheerleading uniform, it feeling very different than she was used to. She took a look in the mirror and examined all the changes since the last time she donned the uniform. And it was quite a different image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor starters, where she once had abs were now replaced with a fairly sizable roll of fat that was made worse by her having squeezed it into her cheer uniform, causing it to squish out of the crop-top style top. It was a miracle that she had even gotten her skirt on that day considering how much her rear had grown. Once it was flat, but now it jutted out and made her skirt much more risque to compete in since it barely covered her butt. Everywhere else had just some minor changes, her thighs wobbled more than before as their gap was shrinking and her face just looked less angular, more smoothed over than before. She stared at it all, wondering how much damage had actually been done, so it was time to break out the scale. Last time she weighed herself 2 weeks ago she was up 15 pounds, bringing her in at 130 pounds, but there was no question that number had gone up even more since Erica had added even more food into their day which was quite a feat considering how much she had them eating before. She stepped on and was shocked to see the number as high as it was. 155. Erica had managed to get another 25 pounds on her in just 2 short weeks somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily sighed and made her way downstairs to see what she would be eating for breakfast that day. She was surprised to see that it was just a simple stack of pancakes and some fruit and nothing more elaborate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it?\" Emily asked her mom and sister. They both nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I decided to be nice today, you have a competition and it would probably be hard to do all of the acrobatics if you're weighed down by a bunch of food,\" Erica told her sister, patting her belly for emphasis. Erica's belly had grown even more since the last time. She had decided two weeks ago to start adding weight gain powder to all the food she gave her sister, forgetting that everyone in her family would be eating most of it too, including herself. But it was okay because now she would always have something to stick it to her sister. She was surprised Emily hadn't said anything this morning when her belly was about to hit her in the face, she must have been too tired to notice. The 30 pounds she put on made her look like she was about to enter her third trimester it was so round, but it was obvious that it was a food baby with the way it jiggled every time she moved. She also discovered a couple days before that she was officially obese at at 180, but she was saving that zinger to use on another day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes, because that hasn't mattered every other time I've cheered this month, and when I got moved to the bottom of the pyramid last week...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily, please don't complain at the table. Your sister is trying to be supportive of your competition today, so maybe just be slightly grateful,\" said her mom. Her mom took a bite of her own pancakes and as she chewed Emily and Erica could see how this experiment (for Erica) and punishment (for Emily) had impacted her. She now officially looked like a chubby mom, the 40 pounds she had put on over the course of the month having settled in a lumpy kind of way, just making her look kind of squishy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save some food for me!\" their dad called out as he made his was down the stairs. He was the last one down since he was having trouble finding a shirt that would fit. Much like Erica, his weight went primarily to his belly, causing him lots of wardrobe problems lately with him having popped several shirt buttons just the other day. He had even been to his doctor for a checkup that week and his doctor told him he needed to lose weight since he was now considered obese at 245 pounds, having gained 45 pounds that month alone from Erica's meal planning (and powder). But he wasn't planning on not enjoying all the food he was given, so obese he would be... and his family would all probably be joining him too. He sat down at the island in their kitchen but couldn't get as close to the counter as he needed to not spill his food since his belly formed a barrier between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's everyone doing this morning?\" He asked his family. \"Ready to cheer on our cheerleader?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The question is whether I can even cheer at this point, I'm so big I was told last week that if I put on any more weight I won't have a spot on the team anymore,\" Emily said. Her parents looked at her with a bit of concern now, realizing that maybe this experimental punishment had gone a bit too far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, honey, don't worry about it. You'll be fine today, and I think you've learned your lesson, so this is the last one of these meals you have to eat,\" said her mom. Emily jumped up and started cheering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thankyouthankyouthankyou! I promise I won't say that kind of stuff again,\" Emily said. She ran back upstairs to try and figure out her game plan to lose the weight, but as she looked in the mirror (mainly examining her nice, round bubble but) she realized that maybe having a few extra curves wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.</span></div></div>",

There's no way we can have someone who looks like you on the team,\" the captain of the cheer quad told Emily in the locker room. \"If you can have your locker empty within the next few minutes, that would be great.\" She walked out of the locker room, leaving Emily all by herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to cry as she emptied her locker. She had tried to lose weight after the month of eating like Erica, at first managing to drop a couple pounds, but since the rest of her family had decided to continue eating a more high calorie diet her efforts proved to be null since she couldn't counter the calories with nearly enough exercise to even maintain her weight, forget losing any. She took her bag and left the school to go home, not wanting to deal with anyone for a while as she mourned the loss of her school status. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked into her house and was greeted by the sight of her sister and her boyfriend on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Emily! We're just watching some TV, want to join?\" Erica offered, not noticing her sister crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather not,\" Emily said, looking at her sister and remembering how it's her fault that she had been kicked off in the first place. Were it not for Erica's choice to not care about her weight (evident by the over 200 pounds of Erica on the couch), Emily would still be a cheerleader and her family wouldn't all be fat. She glared at her sister's massive stomach, which now sat on her lap and had begun to get wider instead of just resting in front of her. Every other part of her seemed small in comparison to her stomach, and it seemed to be even affecting her boyfriend Gary, who had a bit of a belly the entire time Emily had known him (which wasn't long), but now looked much larger, probably having gained about 35 pounds from the past 2 months with Erica once they started getting serious (Emily didn't know of course that he was part of the reason Erica had gained weight in the first place, but that's besides the point now). Emily huffed her way upstairs, threw her stuff on her bed, and went into her bathroom to see exactly what wasn't right about her for the cheer team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily could admit she had been having trouble cheering as of lately, and it was mainly because she had gained weight in a pear shape. Her thighs had become her largest feature, even having developed a slight waddle in the past couple weeks from growing so large. Her butt had also grown, noticing it had a fair amount of cellulite scattered across it. While it wasn't large, her stomach was definitely bigger too, now hanging over her waistbands constantly. Even her face was taking the weight now, with a semi-permanent double chin dressing her face (although it was nowhere as big as Erica's). Emily would never admit it, but it was a miracle the cheer team had kept her until she was 170 pounds and hadn't cut her sooner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went back to her room and curled up in bed though, still depressed that she had finally reached a point where she couldn't do the one thing she loved.</span></div></div>",

If these peanut butter jars sit open for much longer, we're going to wind up with a rodent problem in the house,\" Emily's mom told her visibly depressed daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it, just leave me alone,\" replied Emily. It had been 3 weeks since Emily had been kicked off the cheerleading squad, and she had yet to recover from the emotional blow of her favorite activity being ripped away from her and it showed. All the time she had once filled with being active through cheerleading was now filled with the consumption of food, leading to her blowing up in size in just a few short weeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, I know it still seems hard now, but you can find another activity to do. Cheerleading isn't the only thing in the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there's nothing I can do in this shape!\" she cried out, lifting and dropping her ever-growing belly for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe try to find a non-physical activity like your sister did, or if you really want cheerleading back then you can try to get back down to your old weight. Also, dinner is going to be in 10 minutes\" her mom replied. Emily just huffed and turned away from her mom. Her mom gave her a concerned look but decided that it would be best to leave her alone for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily turned over and stood up to take a look at herself in her mirror, and she barely recognized the person staring back at her. She thought she was large before, but the additional 34 pounds she had gained since quitting cheerleading made her look as if she swallowed the old version of herself. Now standing at 204 pounds, she had a belly that constantly muffin topped no matter what she wore, even in sweatpants. When she left cheerleading, her legs had begun to alter her walk, but now she was more waddle than walk with how large they had gotten. Gone was the slender face that she used to have, now home to a permanent double chin and chubby cheeks. The girl in the mirror looked as if she had never worked out a day in her life; like she had always been a fat girl, and this bothered Emily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all my family's fault,\" she said to herself in the mirror, still blaming her ever-growing parents and sister for putting her in this position. Never in her life did she think she would have an obese BMI, but here she was. As she made her way down the stairs to go to dinner (since it took her and her family a little while now to get situated at the table), she realized that she was still at least in better shape than her parents and sister when she saw them at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about time you got down here, I was about to start eating without you!\" Erica exclaimed, something she said almost every night now. If Emily had thought Erica was out of shape three months ago with just an additional 25 pounds, then there are no words for what she looked like now. Between the way the house now ate and how her boyfriend encouraged her to eat, Erica had to be closing in on 250 pounds. It was obvious her stomach was still her largest asset, filling all the space that surrounded her in her chair. Everything else seemed small in comparison, but still quite large compared to.. well... anyone. She was a constant vacuum for food, and it didn't seem like she was slowing down any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents weren't much better. Her mom looked like she had been inflated, just looking extremely puffy all over (if one could look puffy at 228 pounds without a bit of sagging). Her dad still had a beach ball gut, usually his belly entering a room now before he did. The rest of him seemed to have taken the last 46 pounds, making his movement much more labored as he neared 300 pounds. Compared to these three, Emily was still thin. But as she ate her meal with them, she realized she didn't want to get anywhere close to their sizes. She helped clean up dinner and went back to her room. She took another long look in her mirror and examined her quivering body again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to start changing this right now,\" she said to herself with an affirmative tone and began cleaning up with peanut butter jars, vowing to make a change in her appearance starting now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I can't still be over 200!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that fateful dinner, Emily had created for herself a very regimented diet and exercise plan so she could try and lose some of the weight (she decided that she liked how she looked with a few extra pounds, so she planned to lose all but 20 pounds, making her goal weight 140). However, a month into her regiment the results were not showing up as fast as she had hoped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked at herself in the mirror, hoping that maybe the 4 pounds she had lost that month maybe showed some kind of change on her body, but there was nothing, and that was in part because of how hard it was for her to exercise based on how the weight settled on her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs were still her largest feature, with enough weight having accumulated on her thighs that she waddled instead of walked, which made the runs she tried to take every day especially hard and the squats more difficult (her calves had even plumped up, a sign that the weight has definitely settled and will be very hard to come off). Her stomach was a definite paunch, but Emily just kept remembering that it at least wasn't as bad as her sister's. Her face kept its roundness, the double chin being unable to be hidden and the chubby cheeks still looking as if they had food in them (these elements of which Emily would later find out would still stick around even after she lost weight). Everything about her just looked puffy, and she wanted that to stop. But only 4 pounds in a month discouraged her, so she went downstairs to try and get a healthy snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, where are the apples I asked you to get?\" Emily asked as she rummaged around in the fridge, searching for her healthy snacks she kept stashed away. Everything she moved was junk, junk, and more junk food, not finding any of the food she kept in the fridge anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot to get them, honey! I'm sorry, make sure they're on the list for when I go tomorrow to the store,\" her mom muffled as she crunched some potato chips at the counter. While Emily had been making efforts to eat healthy, the rest of her family had moved even further in the opposite direction. Looking at her mom, she realized that if she hadn't known that was her mom she wouldn't have even recognized her. Before, she was definitely one of the rare, thinner moms, even with her shorter stature (about 5'3). But now with an additional 85 pounds on her, she had a belly that hung and sloped forward almost like an apron, hips that flared so far out it's shocking she didn't get stuck in anything, and just like the rest of her family, a round chin thank hung down with chubby cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily just shook her head thinking about that, then responded to her mom, \"Okay, just please remember to get then next time, you forgot last week as well.\" She ultimately grabbed a granola bar and made her way to the living room to watch some TV. She didn't though, because when she got there she was met with the sight of her sister and her boyfriend making out on the couch. Emily wrinkled her nose at the sight. The couch was creaking under both their weights, considering Erica just seemed to be ballooning at this point. A month ago she was almost 250 pounds, now she was easily 275 or more, with most of it centered in her midsection. When she sat, her stomach pooled around her, sitting dangerously close to her knees even. When you looked at her face, her cheeks had puffed up so much that when she smiled her eyes turned into a squint, being obstructed by the amount of fat in her face. And her boyfriend was no exception either. The first time Emily met him he may have had a slight belly, as it seems many college guys do after too much beer, but now it seemed like he too was puffing up all over, having to have put on easily over 50 pounds since dating her. Emily looked at them in disgust and kept making her way upstairs, disappointed in everyone around her and the fact that she wasn't losing weight as quickly as she wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went into her room and flopped backwards on the bed with a sigh, trying to figure out how on earth she would lose the weight with people like that around her. She sat like that for a while until she heard a knock on her door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Dad, can I come in?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Emily replied, and in came her father. Or rather, in came her father's belly and then her actual father. He seemed to be growing just as rapidly as her sister, if not somehow even faster than her. While Emily had eventually realized that his weight gain began months ago, the fact that he had put on about 140 pounds in less than a year seemed shocking to her. Just like her sister, he his weight was concentrated in his stomach, making him look like a walking yoga ball, with his belly somehow not having given into gravity yet and still looking perky. His arms stuck out from his sides even due to both the fat they picked up and how round his midsection was. Every part of him was round at this point, and Emily just didn't understand why he let himself get like that when he once had been the spitting image of men's health. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily's dad had waddled his way over to her bed while she was thinking all of this and sat down next to her, the bed letting out a loud creaking noise to remind them that it wasn't built to hold over 500 pounds on it. Both ignored the sound and he put an arm around her (or as close as his large body would let him). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I hear you didn't meet your goal for the month,\" he said to Emily. She nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't understand why I didn't! I've been following my meal plan, I've been exercising every day, but I only went down 4 pounds in a month! That's a pound a week.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, something doctors have told me over the years is that it' much easier to gain weight than to lose it, so it'l just take some time for it to happen. But luckily you're young, your metabolism is still adjusting, so you can fix it much more easily than I can now,\" he laughed as he shook his belly, sending his whole body jiggling from just the small movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right. I just need to accept that it'll take some time,\" Emily said, sounding deflated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't stress it. If it's meant to happen, it'll happen. Maybe this is just your body's way of saying it likes where it is. That's what mine did when I attempted to lose some weight almost a year ago, when I had only put on about 25 pounds, and that's when I realized that I wasn't supposed to be the slim guy forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I don't think it was telling you to be the 320 pound guy either,\" Emily retorted. Her dad let out a loud laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, but I sure do like it at this size!\" He exclaimed as he rocked back and forth to stand up. He walked out of the room, leaving Emily with a lot to think about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What if he's right</i>, she thought. <i>What if I'm not supposed to lose the weight? I guess there's only one way to find out!</i></span></div></div>",

She wanted to get actual firm data on the role weight plays in young adult social society. Now, one portion was to be done with blind surveys of people, but she wanted to supplement this, and that's where Madison came in. Dr. Smith wanted to do a non-empirical first hand study. She figured she could cause Madison to gain weight, and through observing her and talking to her, see what the consequences of that are. Now, this idea did have it's flaws. The research wouldn't be as valuable as the surveys, since Madison was a survey size of 1, and there was no way to see how the interaction would differ if Madison hadn't gained weight, but Dr. Smith still found this idea intriguing. She was also being reckless, if this got out before she published, or even after, she could get fired from the university. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Smith also knew that her whole career going forward stood on making it look like Madison had consented to this project. If she couldn't do that, she would be exposed for massive ethics violations, and probably never be able to teach again at any respectable university.</span></div></div>",

Dr. Smith had gotten hold of a drug that drastically slowed down metabolism over the course of a dose. It wasn't really every being prescribed due to the lack of other medical purposes, but Dr. Smith got some prescribed as part of  a study that she was doing. She had more than enough to last her for the year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, in order for Dr. Smith to observe changes, she would have to get to know what skinny Madison was like. So they often chatted, and Dr. Smith realized she choose the perfect person for the study. Madison was very popular, and from what she gathered, had no issues getting guys or making friends. Dr. Smith also extensively looked at Madison's social media, and was able to get a good scope of her personal life. The final thing that she did was have a small scale installed under Madison's desk chair in the office, ah how wonderful research grants were. Once she subtracted the weight of the chair, she could quickly see Madison's weight with the use of an app she had installed on her work computer. All of this helped Dr. Smith craft her first journal entry for the 'study'- Madison, to guard her anonymity was called to as 'subject a.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''September 3<br>\r\nSubject A Weight- 130 pounds<br>\r\nSubject A is sociable and had made friends on campus very quickly.

After Madison went to the bathroom, Dr. Smith slipped the pill in her drink, which dissolved before Madison got back.

I\u2019ve been really hungry lately,\u201d Madison explained quickly. Dr. Smith waved at the air as if Madison\u2019s concerns were smoke being pushed away.<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, dear,\u201d Dr. Smith said, \u201cI just wish you would have picked up something for me as well.\u201d She winked and Madison giggled, before plopping down in the desk and lifting one of the greasy, fully-loaded burgers to her stretched mouth.<br>\r\n\t\u201cMaybe, we\u2019ll take a trip down there in a bit,\u201d Dr. Smith said, returning her eyes to her grades, \u201cIn the meantime I have some multiple choice tests for you to grade on that shelf to your right.\u201d She pretended to not pay attention, but when Madison reached up for the tests her shirt rose, exposing her slightly softened midriff. Her pants slightly pinched her sides and her butt seemed to bump out more in her pants. Her thighs seemed a little more constrained in her jeans as well, although they still weren\u2019t quite touching, except at the very top. Not a huge gain, but with a quick check of her electronic scale installed under Madison she could confirm that the petite girl had gained 11 pounds in 15 days. Not a bad start, Dr. Smith thought to herself.<br>\r\n\tDr. Smith had found a liking to the girls\u2019 perky attitude, intelligent banter and generally soft-spoken and humble personality. Still, Dr. Smith was a cold professional. An intellectual before all else. Personal feelings would not get in the way. And being a somewhat portly woman herself she knew that it wouldn\u2019t be the end of the world for Madison to put on weight. Madison might think so, but she was barely out of childhood and she would think what she will.<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo, any hot dates or girls' nights this weekend?\u201d Dr. Smith inquired innocently, not lifting her eyes from the papers on her desk.<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh, nothing too exciting,\u201d Madison said, mouth full of French Fries. I just hung out in the dorms and watched movies, mostly stayed in all weekend.<br>\r\n\t\u201cNothing else?\u201d Dr. Smith asked gently, seemingly trying to stoke up conversation, \u201cNo leaving campus, no parties, no work outs.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh, not really,\u201d Madison sighed. Dr. Smith knew she was telling the truth, since she was covertly following her Facebook and Twitter pages.  \u201cJust a lazy, lazy weekend,\u201d Madison said, taking another huge bite of the first burger. Grease dripped down her chin, and she quickly dabbed it away. \u201cAlthough,\u201d she began, mouth still full of greasy burger, \u201cI should probably get back into the swing of working out. Especially with how much I\u2019ve been eating lately.\u201d<br>\r\n\tDr. Smith, once again waved it off, \u201cIt\u2019s just stress. And when you\u2019re stressed you burn more calories.\u201d<br>\r\n\tMadison laughed, and swallowed the half-lie hook, line and sinker. \u201cWell that\u2019s a relief.\u201d<br>\r\n\tThey continued with their banter for a while, and Dr. Smith picked up as many details of Madison\u2019s personal life as possible. \u201cSo, do you want to go grab some more food, I\u2019m starving,\u201d said Dr. Smith, patting her belly. She stood from her desk and Madison looked confused.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI just actually had a pretty big meal,\u201d she said motioning to the tray that previously held two large burgers, fries and a pudding cup.<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh, come now, you\u2019re working hard. It\u2019s on me,\u201d Dr. Smith said cheerfully. Madison still wasn\u2019t sure. Does she\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She also noticed that Madison had heightened eating habits. When Madison first arrived at campus, she rarely ate anything. When she did eat, Madison choose to have something small like a sandwich or a salad. Now, not only was Madison constantly snacking, she was also eating huge meals in the cafeteria for lunch and dinner. It was one of those moments, where timing works out too well, when Madison noted, just then, \"uggghhhh, I don't know why I'm so hungry today,\" as she went to open up a bag of potato chips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the week, Madison continued to eat more than she had usually, plus she often felt sluggish from all this food intake, so she was skipping the gym as well. On Friday during lunch, Madison went up to get seconds, allowing Kelly and Cassi a moment to talk, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassi, what the hell is Madison doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-Yeah, I mean, she was a workout freak before, what is going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, she just snacks all the time now. She'll open up a large bag, you know, the ones with like, 12 servings, and just slowly eat it until everything is gone. She wasn't like this when she came, I don't know what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well do you think we should say something, I don't really want to by hanging out with a fat chick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't come to that, come on, it's Madison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Madison walked back into ear shot. As she sat down her belly bulge was evident, and her shirt rode up a bit to show some new love handles that didn't use to me there. Madison knew that she was gaining weight, but put off going on the scale for a few more days, she didn't want to go on it until she had a good workout, or a day of good meals to lessen the number.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She topped a slightly steep set of steps and felt slightly out of breath, she took a drink of her Diet Soda (fizzing with more metabolism slowing drugs) and had a large bite of her candy bar she had in the other hand. As she rounded the last corner to her dorm, licking chocolate off her fingers she bumped right into another girl. The girls\u2019 books and Madison\u2019s keys all bounced across the ground. Madison hastily apologized to the nebbish girl and bent over to help her gather her belongings. As she did, she felt a satisfying pop and her belly bulge seemed to expand. It took her a moment to register what happened. She awkwardly stood up and sure enough some of her tanned belly poked between her shirt and two pant flaps.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cDammit, this was my favorite pair of slacks,\u201d she said, stomping in frustration. The bookish girl still gathering her belongings looked curiously and nervously up at Madison\u2019s exposed belly. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, that happened to me before,\u201d she murmured, but Madison couldn\u2019t make out her muttering. Madison bent over to help the girl again and she heard a loud rip. Her eyes shot wide open. She stood very straight and her hands flew to her seat. The girl looked alarmed as well. She handed Madison a folder and jerked her head, motioning her to go.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMadison, hastily, made her way back to her dorm building and quickly punched her key in. She slipped inside and sprinted to her room, bringing her keys out, unlocking and opening the door all in the same motion. She slammed the door behind her and made sure she was alone. Cassi had class. She sighed in relief and with some difficulty, tore her ruined work slacks off. She sat at her desk and grabbed one of the cookies Dr. Smith had baked for her, munching greedily. Her ass and thighs spread across the top of the chair like pancake mix, her small panties pinching into her flaring hips.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nAfter she ate three cookies she patted her belly and watched the small bulge jiggle few times. She pinched her soft thighs and sighed. Grabbing another cookie she made her way to the bathroom. And dug out her electronic scale. Now it was time to face the music. She sighed and set the scale at her feet, waiting for it to turn on. She took of her shirt to get as accurate a reading as possible, revealing her boobs spilling over the sides of her c-cup bra. She sighed, she would need new bras. She gobbled the cookie while waiting for the scale to calibrate. When it did she took a deep breath and stepped up, watching the electronic screen flash. It felt like a long time, but the number flashed and Madison felt a sinking feeling in her expanding stomach. It read 149 and it wasn\u2019t even October yet. She had gained the freshman 15 and then some in the first week of school. What was she going to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was 5\u20197\u201d, and now 162 pounds and the weight gain was becoming very evident. Every day now Madison showed up with food, in ill-fitting clothes. Dr. Smith was so enjoying this girls\u2019 evolution. New Facebook friends had dropped to near zero and none of them were men. Picture comments were done. Her twitter had more tweets about being bored than anything else. Even on Friday nights. Her professionalism was dropping dramatically. She used to wear slacks and nice blouses to her job. Today she was bursting out of a pair of sweats and a tacky t-shirt that looked like it would have been tight 30 pounds ago. It pinched her arms in, her boobs stretched out the cleavage, and she kept tugging it over her navel, but it wouldn\u2019t go too much farther. Dr. Smith also supplemented Madison\u2019s greasy meals with baked goods almost every day. Madison was getting quite plump at an alarming rate. Madison tugged unconsciously at her shirt, which couldn\u2019t possibly cover her little muffin top that was forming. And even in sweats Madison\u2019s thighs and buttocks were obviously growing. She would probably become a pear by the looks of it. Just like her mentor, Dr. Smith though jokingly to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Madison, Dr. Smith was checking on her social media right now. And taking notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctober 7th<br>\r\nSubject A is becoming extremely lethargic and apathetic. Motivation is at an all time low, as are social interactions. Her rapidly expanding figure seems to be affecting every aspect of her social life, from activities, to fashion, and even to hygiene to some extent. It is interesting that she is clearly shifting her personality to align more with the overweight members of the study, and away from the thin members. Subject A\u2019s BMI indicates that she is now officially overweight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Smith smiled at the entry. Madison was supposed to be a supplement, but if she kept giving data like this, she might be the focus of the experiment. Dr. Smith smiled at Madison who took another heaping bite of her chili cheese fries. The chili fell into her cleavage, and without skipping a beat Madison wiped it off and licked her finger clean. She would definitely keep giving data, Dr. Smith thought to herself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She got all the way back to her dorm before she allowed herself to cry, clutching a bucket of ice cream pathetically.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison was in a bad mood for the rest of the weekend, she didn\u2019t attempt to go to the gym, or really even leave her dorm. Cassi mostly ignored her, knowing very little about what happened, and caring even less as her and Madison slowly drifted apart. On Sunday, Madison managed to go shopping for some better fitting clothes, although she could only afford a few outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came to work on Monday, Dr. Smith greeted her fondly, \u201cOh, that\u2019s a new outfit, I love how you kids dress these days.\u201d Madison smiled. She wore leggings, that showed off very clearly her expanding bottom half, and a pink, short-sleeved blouse, wrapped with a constricting belt around her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Madison\u2019s smile, it was clear she was in a foul mood, and Dr. Smith was instantly intrigued. She could get some solid data here if it had to do with the weight. So she asked, and Madison told the whole story, of how she overheard the two meat-heads talking about her. Dr. Smith, patted her hand (which even that was softening up) reassuringly, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, Madison, you know how boys are. Don\u2019t let them get to you.\u201d It became evident that Dr. Smith wasn\u2019t very good at this whole teenage girl drama thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that they said it, it\u2019s that they were right,\u201d Madison said, sotto voce, \u201cI\u2019ve gained almost 20 pounds.\u201d Liar, Dr. Smith internally huffed. Checking the electronic scale currently put the plump half-Latina girl in at 168. A gain of almost 40 pounds. Madison\u2019s softened facial features contorted when Dr. Smith didn\u2019t say anything, so Dr. Smith hastily said the only thing on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get lunch,\u201d Dr. Smith said with genuine-sounding pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly going to help my situation,\u201d Madison half-laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me, come on,\u201d Dr. Smith said and rose from her seat. Madison hesitated but followed her out. \u201cNow as you may have noticed by now, Madison, I\u2019m no bikini model myself.\u201d Madison did notice, Dr. Smith was a rounded blubber-ball of a woman. Madison consciously felt the stares on her as the hall, and tried to convince herself that it was just her imagination. \u201cBut I\u2019m successful, I have useful skills, and I have a good life, and do you know why?\u201d They entered into the cafeteria. Madison thought for a second, she could think of a lot of reasons why, but she simply shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause,\u201d Dr. Smith began, dragging Madison with her to the fryer line, \u201cI have to be hard working, interesting, useful and intelligent. I won\u2019t have anything handed to me, and that is the way I would rather live. My sister was consistently voted the most beautiful girl in school. She didn\u2019t realize that she was utterly useless to society and abysmally uninteresting until her looks started to fade. Do you understand what I\u2019m saying?\u201d Dr. Smith even knew this isn\u2019t the thing you should say to a college girl, but she could play her angle on this little rant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand,\u201d Madison said, clearly not feeling any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d Dr. Smith said approvingly, \u201cThen eat up.\u201d And with that she shoved a plate full of mashed potatoes, fried chicken, gravy, stuffing and corn dogs in Madison\u2019s face. While Madison probably wouldn\u2019t take Dr. Smith\u2019s \u201ctough love\u201d advice to heart, it now gave Dr. Smith the opportunity to pretend as if she was interested in Madison\u2019s appetite, expanding body and social life from some sort of unwanted mentor stand-point. It would definitely give her a little more flexibility. Although she wanted to be careful, so Madison wouldn\u2019t associate herself with \u201cSubject A\u201d if she ever happened across the published study.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Madison\u2019s part, she ate until she was stuff, and leaned back in her chair with her stuffed belly burping and rubbing her swollen tummy. Dr. Smith just grinned.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Madison was now taking almost six times the recommended dosage for a girl of her age and size and the effects were almost immediate. She was pushing 181 within two weeks. Up until now Madison\u2019s saving grace was that she maintained a curvy almost hour-glass/pear figure, but her belly was expanding with the rapid weight gain. It protruded as far as her boobs now, which were becoming saggier and rounder by the day. On top of that, her already soft facial features were flowering into full dimples and a double-chin. Cellulite built up all around her backside and her new clothes were already becoming snug on her. Her butt, while constantly getting bigger and rounder, was now becoming wider and looked fatter, instead of round and tight. Panty lines were evident with whatever she wore. Every step sent her lower half, jiggling. Her thighs bulged and pressed against one another, fighting for space with each step. Her bras even cut into her back-fat. Madison went from hottie to hefty.<br>\r\n\tShe and Dr. Smith sat at their now daily lunch, as she polished four large greasy slices of pizza and chatted about life. Dr. Smith tapped on her iPad tablet, taking notes to record later while they chatted.<br>\r\n\tOctober 30th<br>\r\n\tSubject A has begun to rapidly gain weight. She has posted nothing on any social media site in days and has had relatively little contact with others. Social activity is at an all-time low. She has almost entirely given up on gym visits due to several more \u201cevents\u201d like that one before. Apathy or a general laziness is replacing her previously optimistic attitude.<br>\r\n\tDr. Smith looked up at Madison, who was so engrossed in her meal, she hadn\u2019t even noticed that her growing muffin top had oozed out from under her shirt, and burst the first button on her button-fly jeans.<br>\r\n\tAfter work, Madison made her way back to the dorm, stopping by the school corner-shop to get some snacks for studying. The young, attractive cashier greeted her, knowing her from one of her classes and as Madison left with several bags of chips and candies, the girl sighed and giggled, watching the now jiggly teen\u2019s frame move slowly away, already digging into a chocolate bar.<br>\r\n\tCassi barely greeted Madison as she entered, as the two were talking less and less. Cassi was going to a lot of parties, but leaving Madison out, not wanting to be associated with her swollen, inflating roommate. This hurt Madison\u2019s feelings, and she felt as if she was missing out on the college experience.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was strange for her to be so shy, but with her added weight she felt ironically smaller, and less confident.<br>\r\nCassi turned her eyes expectantly towards Madison. The pudgy Latina stood, looking like a frightened child. A very plump frightened child, with her head downward gaze, her shoulders tight and her hands fidgeting. \u201cWhatcha need, roomie?\u201d Cassi asked gently.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was just\u2026 I was just wondering if you would help me lose weight, maybe let me go to the gym with you,\u201d Madison asked with a small smile. Madison decided if she was ever going to be with the group again, and go to any parties, she had to try to fight this mystery gain.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nCassi was surprised Madison was going to make the effort. \u201cWell, of course you can!\u201d she said, almost too excited. \u201cI mean, I would love to have you along,\u201d she said getting some control again.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Madison said, visibly relieved. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve been going on my own, but I just can\u2019t stay focused, and I get tired too easily. I need someone to push me.\u201d Cassi wasn\u2019t sure if Madison truly understood, just how big she had become, but she wasn\u2019t going to tell Madison that to keep up with her at that size would be almost impossible.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a blast, but I\u2019m not going easy on you,\u201d Cassi joked.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you better not,\u201d Madison laughed.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nThe next day, Madison was getting into her new leggings (which showed off every crease and dimple on her fat lower half, and she put on a tank top, that showed her love-handles and would rise to her mid-belly if she put her hands above her head. Cassi wore some nice athletic pants and a sports bra, looking like an Olympic Athlete next to Madison\u2019s new, untoned form.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMadison waited a minute to come out of the bathroom and let Cassi view her new body. Not like she didn\u2019t know, but still, Madison was nervous. She patted her belly with both hands, and ran her hands over her hips and butt, and then returned them to her belly. She grabbed the chubby belly and gave it a shake. \"Bye bye, abs,\" she muttered to herself. She gave her butt a slap in the leggings and it quivered back and forth for a few seconds. She lifted each arm, and patted the new fat that hung off of it. Turning around again she lifted her butt cheeks in each hand and let gravity do its thing, causing the much larger ass to jiggle. She sighed one final, time, turned sideways and tried to suck in, before leaving the bathroom.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nShe smiled at Cassi, which accentuated her facial gain, and said, \u201cShow time.\u201d Cassi laughed nervously, and prayed that Madison didn\u2019t pick up on it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked ridiculous. No longer remembering to suck in, her belly formed a muffin top that stretched all the way around. A little ripple moved through her belly with each step. Madison took her second break and went to sit on a bench off to the side and put her head in her palms.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMadison wanted to cry, but knew that would only add to her humiliation. She looked to see if Cassi was watching her, but Cassi had looked away for a second. Madison considered just sneaking back to the dorm, but knew that wouldn\u2019t help anything. She stood back up and moved over to the treadmill. Turning it on slow, she tried to convince herself it was her warm up.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nHer huge butt and thighs jiggled and rippled under her with each step. She felt the sweat coming on immediately, and any running form she once had was obviously lost along with her toned body. She felt like she had ran miles, but looking at the tracker on the treadmill she could see that she had \"ran\" just over a half mile in six and a half minutes.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nShe stopped the treadmill and got off panting. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s enough for today,\u201d she thought, \u201cEveryone starts somewhere.\u201d She tried very hard to tell herself this wasn\u2019t true, but couldn\u2019t do it.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first thing that Madison had to do if she was going to go out was find something that fit. Luckily, among the new clothes that she had bought a while back was a black short skirt, that she could go out in. Next, she found a looser top that she could put on. It showed that her arms had gotten softer, but at her current weight she wasn't going to win many battles with her clothes. On that theme, it took a bit for Madison to get the flasp on her skirt closed. She had to suck in, and it was clear that she had a belly when she finally got it closed. Madison took some time to apply make-up and do her hair in the 'in' styles that she used to employ almost every evening. While she was doing this she noticed that she was indeed getting a double chin, which she thought dulled her appearance even more, and she was right. Madison very badly missed her sharp features that she used to have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she backed up a few feet from the mirror, she noticed how tight her skirt was, and she saw that her legs looked rather chunky in the skirt as well. \"Ugh, do I have thunder thighs?\" she wondered to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison went down to Megan's room and met the her to go out. The group that they were with consisted of 5 girls from the floor, then suddenly, a sixth walked in, it was Cassi. Madison suddenly realized that Cassi was invited to go as well but didn't tell her. She was crushed. She wanted to go back to the room and cry, however, she hadn't been out in a while, and if she broke down, she could kiss what was left of her social life goodbye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison knew that she was the chubby friend right now, and it tore her apart. She used to be critical of that girl in her head when she would go out. She always thought that girl was lazy, and not smart enough to take control of her own appearance, and now she was that girl. The rest of the girls were skinny and looked awesome. Truth is, before Dr. Smith's effects on Madison, she probably would have been the most popular and hottest of the girls in that group, but not anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all pilled into the backseat of Megan's car. Some of the skinny girls joked, \"ohh I feel so fat\" as they squeezed 5 people into the backseat of a mid-sized sedan. Madison didn't appreciate it, but she figured the girls didn't realize that they were insulting her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the club, Madison got insecure that the bouncer wouldn't let her in. This was new to her, usually she knew that she was the kind of person they wanted in bars, the kind of girl who got free drinks from the club to come back, now she didn't even know if she could get in. At the moment she looked up and she saw a bouncer shaking his head and point at the other girls, but not her, while talking to Megan. It looked like Megan whispered something in his ear, and then he motioned them all in, Madison included. Madison realized that Megan had pulled some kind of string to get her in, which further crushed her--she was now a liability to the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they got in the club, a lot of the girls started dancing. Madison used to have the confidence to know what to do, but she felt somewhat lost at the moment, and kind of just stood there for a while, and then eventually walked over to the bar. She sipped a drink while she saw the rest of her friends dancing with hot college aged guys. After a few minutes, a guy who looked to be in his early 30s, and not all that attractive, came up to her and started trying to chat her up. She was pleased that someone was paying attention to her, but also irritated that this is what she fell to. The guy talking to her was clearly the kind of guy who payed the bouncer a ton of money to get in, and never had any luck picking up girls, so he tried to 'bottom feed' for girls with low self esteem. Madison never thought she would end up being one of those girls. She had a moment of introspection, then decided to take the guy up on his shot offer, then joined him on the dance floor, where she temporarily accepted her fate. </span></div></div>",

She had danced with the sleazy guy that had first come up to her for a while, but once some of the guys took notice of the chunky girl with a big ass grinding and dancing, and some guys were taking some interest in her. Madison was elated at the face that she had gotten a few free beers- one of the guys had even asked for her number! Granted, this was nothing close to her normal amount of guys wanting to hit on her, but at least she wasn't sidelined entirely! Megan- and even Cassi!- had actually accepted her into their throng in the middle of the dance floor- another hour passed, along with a ton of guys, and 4 or 5 more beers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was pretty tipsy by this point and was pretty absentminded- she didn't realize that her belly was fighting against her skirt in the front, and that her butt was popping a few more seams every time she bent over to grind. Madison had just gotten another guy to dance with her- this one was the hottest to dance with her so far- and she started gyrating her hips, getting closer to him, dancing, when suddenly Madison's skirt gave up and split in a giant rip straight down the back, revealing her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the pounding club music, Madison didn't even realize her skirt had ripped- but the guy dancing with her did. Although he was certainly a fan of girls with a donk, this display of fat was a little too much for him. He moved away, slightly revolted, and disappeared into the crowd. Madison turned around, slightly confused, when Cassi noticed the rip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my GOD, guys, look! She busted her skirt! I knew this was a bad idea, we shouldn't have brought her!\" she furiously whispered to the rest of the girls, who had been just about to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a guy that had danced with Madison earlier in the night noticed the giant tear on Madison's butt and bursted out laughing. \"Look, Brian!\" He cried. \"That fat ass bust her skirt! I knew she was a little chunky, but that's HILARIOUS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison heard the man and was mortified as she turned and saw her panties exposed to the world. Quickly covering her butt with her hands, she tottered as fast as her chunky, drunken body would carry her back to the car.</span></div></div>",

When she sat down, Dr. Smith casually checked the scale under her seat, \"Hmm, 186, okay, so she indulged again this weekend,\" thought Dr. Smith. She also noticed that the chunky student looked a bit more bloated in her stomach than usual, causing her love handles to peak out from the shirt that she was wearing while she was at her desk, silently grading multiple choice tests. The looked so soft to Dr. Smith, and less tan than Madison's skin tone had been when she first came to the office looking for a part time job.

Her weight was spiraling out of control, and she couldn't find a way to handle it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I had an incident with my wight this weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh, I'm sorry, is there anything you want to talk about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison thought that Dr. Smith was being rather Motherly, but any Dr. Smith's coworkers would have informed her that she was just extracting information from her. This isn't to say that any colleagues had figured out what she was doing, given the huge ethical lapses it took. Regardless, Madison's soul pouring provided another entry into her study notes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNovember 10th<br>\r\nSubject A has noticed the social stigma attached with weight gain. Her friends have broken down into two classes, one wants to help her, and does not seem affected, the other acts as if she has done something hostile to them by gaining weight. The second class does not mind teasing her, and seems to be the source of her increased stress over body mass. It would appear on social media and in discussion with Subject A, that her ability to select a mate (Dr. Smith knew she needed to iron out this language before even handing notes to her research assistant, given that she was an ardent feminist) also seems to be greatly reduced. Thoughts that this presents- What are the affects generationall in gene pools of larger people? Do thinner people fine more desirable mates that produce children who are smarter and hold more traits that society holds in high value? Need to continue study on Subject A, and monitor continued X factor to see if social stigma is a bell curve that will go down after a certain amount of mass is gained, or if Subject A will become more, and more of an issue among her friends. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Madison was searching around, she found an open life guarding job at the rec center. Given that she had done this in high school for a brief amount of time, she decided to pursue it further. The job seemed to be a good fit on first glance. She would not have to do much active work besides monitoring the pool, plus she didn't have to commute, it would be right there on campus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison sent an email out to rec instructor about the job and heard back the next day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Madison, given your past experience, you appear qualified for the job. Come to my office at 2:00 tomorrow and let's chat about the job. --Deb </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was delighted by this, she didn't expect such a quick response, and one that seemed to indicate that she had the job. When Cassi got back to the room, she told her the news. \"I got an interview for the life guarding job tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're applying to be a lifeguard? That's neat.\" Cassi was somewhat surprised by this. Of the people she had already friended on social media, Madison seemed to be one of the more affluent ones, it's not like a job was necessary for her to make college finances work. However, as Cassi would get to know Madison more, she would realize that this was just one instance of Madison doing things that were not expected of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think I'm going to head down to the pool to check it out. Want to come?\" Madison asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a hot day, so they decided to bring their suits and go for a swim as well. As they walked down campus, Madison noticed how hot it was that day. After the short walk to the rec center, they found the pool adjacent locker rooms and begun to change. It was slightly awkward, but something that they would probably witness nearly everyday given that they were roommates in a small single room dorm. Cassi accidentally let her line of sight breeze past Madison, and she saw how fit the South Floridian was, with her near six pack abs, although it wasn't like Cassi was lacking in the fitness part either, and thus they both exited the locker room wearing bikinis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they saw the pool, they were stuck by how nice it was. \"Geez, nice to see where the tuition money is going,\" Cassi noted as they looked at their surroundings. It was an Olympic sized pool under a huge glass roof. In one corner, it looked to be open, with an inlet that allowed one to swim outside. They walked out and saw a pool that overlooked campus, complete with amazing landscaping and ample lounge space. \"Yeah, I think I read that some really rich older alumnus put up all the money for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they went for a swim, Madison thought to herself, \"Hmm, I could see myself working here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Deb had held this job for around 9 years now after finishing undergrad at Powers. She liked it, but the 31 year old was starting to wonder if this was really it for her. Placing over-eager students in the correct line of employment at the recreation center got old after a while. The only big upside for Deb was the free rec center membership, which helped her keep a flawless body, despite 10 years of university lunches. She guessed the student in front of her would probably be taking advantage of the free gym as well, given her trim physique. \"3 years swimming instructor in high school? Madison, that alone makes you qualified for this. When can you start?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,\" Madison was caught somewhat off-guard by the immediate offer. \"I guess, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" Deb said, \"We had a lot of graduating seniors last year, so we are very low on life guards at the moment, let's get started by giving you a brief tour of our facilities.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeb proceeded to show Madison around the pool, and it continued to impress. A new facility, Madison would be working in the front lines of the college facilities arms race. As they went to different stations, Madison met some of her future coworkers. There was Dave, a 5'10 junior who had a great body, and Madison could have swore he caught him checking her out. There was also Mitch, 6'1 a senior, who seemed to already be suffering from senioritis, but still went out of his way to be friendly. Next they walked by Meg, who was a sophomore and seemed to take a real liking to Madison. Finally, as the tour was wrapping up, Deb took Madison back to the office adjacent break room and another person came in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie, you're late.\" Deb said, somewhat sternly to the new girl. It was the first time that Deb seemed anything other than sunny during the tour, however, that was not the only thing that threw Madison off. Katie was quite chubby, many would say fat. The girl stood in stark contrast to everyone else that she had met on the tour, with their fit bodies and great attitudes. Deb continued, \"Anyway, Katie, this is Madison, you're scheduled to work with her a few times this week. Since you're a senior, I hope you can show her the ropes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess.\" Katie said, walking out of the room to start her shift. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later that evening, all four previously mentioned pool employees had a rare shift where they all worked after class to close. The pool closed at 9, so most of them were eager to get out of there, and filling out their time cards in the admin office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See the new girl today?\" Dave asked Mitch<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Man, no wonder she became a lifeguard, hopefully we see some saves this year, so I'll see her whip that shirt off and dive in!'\" Mitch replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Classy,\" said Meg, sarcastically. She wasn't really thrilled with this kind of work environment, in fact, if it were an office setting, she may have complained, but she knew (or at least hoped) they were joking. They never really commented on her great body, but she knew they found her hot, based off the looks that she got every time she worked outside, and decided to shed her light tank for the sake of a complete tan. Working at the pool had provided extra incentive for Meg to stay in shape during her freshman year, and now, as a sophomore, she possessed a body that was possibly even better than it had been in high school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Meg, you can't blame us, she's a fox!\" Mitch said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't let Deb hear you talking like that, she always seems to be protective of the new students, or at least she was for me.\" Meg responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nListening to all this quietly was Katie. She seethed with jealousy. She remembered when Deb seemed to care about her almost like a friend, back when she was thin. Katie came to the school as a former cheerleader, and after a training course, thought that lifeguard would be an easy. Katie had always been pretty growing up, and in her first semester at Powers was 5'6 115. She remembered all the attention that Mitch had given her fall of freshman year when they were both in training together, they had even hooked up. However, pounds slowly snuck their way on. It was gradual at first, 10 pounds throughout the first semester, bringing her to a still respectable 5'6 125. But then she fell off a cliff her first summer home. With the disposable income from life guarding, and her parents both working over dinner at their high stress jobs, Katie found herself relying on take out more and more, and the results were obvious. When she got back to school as a sophomore, she already weighed 150 pounds, and needed to size up on her swimsuit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all changed after that for Katie. Mitch suddenly was nice to her, but never showed any romantic interest again, and Deb, her demeanor changed dramatically. No longer would she ask how Katie's day was going, just a quick hello, and then Deb would move to ignore her. Trendy diet after tredy diet failed, and now Katie entered senior year at her highest weight ever, 190 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got back to her apartment, Katie saw an email from Deb, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Katie,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope your summer went well. Let me know your new size and preference so we can get you a new suit. Also, you will need to do another physical fitness test with Madison to keep certification.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeb</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't believe it. It was embarrassing enough that her boss thought she would not fit into last year's suit, but now she doubted she was even fit enough to serve?! She would have quit, but she wanted the money, and the job was easy. All Katie knew is that she was going to hate doing the physical with Madison. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, Katie got to the pool before it opened to do her fitness test with Madison. Katie quickly changed into her suit, a one piece that Deb had given her last year that seemed tighter than when the school year ended the previous year. She loathed what greeted her when she got to the pool area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Katie!\" Madison cheerfully said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie looked over her new coworker. Madison was wearing a red lifeguard style two piece swimsuit-- not trendy, but it was still a two piece and it showed off just how much difference there was between the fat senior and the hot freshman. Madison's toned and tanned abs nearly had a six pack, her athletic arms lacked and fat, her boobs were perky without any rolls around the back. Katie, without trying to give the elevator eyes to Madison, noticed how firm her legs looked, and she assumed Madison's ass probably matched the rest. She even noticed how Madison, not wearing any make-up and having her hair pulled back still had a nearly perfect face. Her natural beauty shined through with her sharp features and tanned skin. Katie could not believe her bad luck of having to take this test with a perfect 10. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get this over with, where's Deb?\" Katie asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She had to run and get her tablet from the admin office, she said she should be back in a second.\" Madison responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie, trying to pass some downtime, started small talk, \"So you're from Miami, do you swim much?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I love being by the water or at the beach. Back home we would go to the beach all the time, and I was on the swim team in high school!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Great...</i> thought Katie, sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Deb got back to the pool, Katie and Madison jumped in and did their required drills. For Madison it was easy, with laps coming as easily as a slow paced walk in the park. For Katie, it was a constant struggle. She wondered how she had let herself get so out of shape. Each stroke was a huge effort for her, made worse with the knowledge that Madison's sleek body was burst off the line during drills and flying through the water. Whenever she would finish, she felt humiliated to come up, exhausted and needing to grab the wall, only to see Madison already finished and casually chatting with Deb--the same drills hardly breaking a sweat on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they were done with the physical and tests, Deb looked at her notes, \"Madison, you're more than qualified to do this. You'll just need to pass a written test and then you'll be good to go!\" She then paused, changed her tone and continued, \"Katie, you really need to get in better shape. I'm going to pass you, but only because we're short on lifeguards, and I want you to start meeting with one of the  personal trainers at the rec center upstairs.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison felt a bit awkward standing there while Katie was being reprimanded like this, but she tried not to pay attention. Katie stood there and took it. As she walked away, she breathed under her breath, \"I hate Deb and Madison...\"</span></div></div>",

It being a late summer day in Florida, Tim was confined to his family's movie room, playing xbox, when he got a text, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"3:47 PM- Hey, let's meet up soon. I want to see you before I leave. -Madison Kraft\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim was somewhat surprised by this. Although they were in the same group of friends, she hadn't texted him since...well since they broke up right after homecoming. Tim thought back to how crushed he was. He had just taken her on what he thought was a great evening. They went with their group of friends to a trendy restaurant, then to the dance, and then to  an after party where they each got wasted and had a blast at one of their friends' beach house. Tim remembered how hot Madison looked that night. Her hair was down, and she wore a tight, but not slutty dress, the kind that only someone with a perfect body could pull off. Now that it had been senior year of high school, her boobs had filled in, but she still had a great, and tight, body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was three weeks later when Madison got into Powers University in some middle of nowhere state. Tim knew the school had a really good reputation, and was in an alright sized city, but come on, was she really going to leave Miami to go live in a flyover state? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, Tim got his answer. Madison called him and invited her to his place while being somewhat cryptic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim, you know that I care about you, right?\" Tim knew what was coming. \"Well now that I've gotten into Powers, and am going to accept, I think we should call it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was crushed, and could not say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, we just can't do long distance,\" Madison continued, \"and if we're going to break it off, why delay the inevitable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was asking a question, but Tim knew he couldn't do anything to stop this. Madison was kind, but at the same time, she had made up her mind, and if he tried to change it, she would more harshly break it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey remained friends for the rest of the year and Tim did the best to not be awkward about it. Deep down he was hurt, and slightly bitter, but he never let it show. He knew she was the hottest person he was ever going to get with, and she was way out of his league. They would see each other at parties, but it was the last time that they had hung out together by themselves. He saw photos of her making out with other guys, and knew that she had been significantly more successful than him socially, since they broke up, which made Tim a tad jealous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as Tim starred into his phone, he was happy, and somewhat excited to see her. </span></div></div>",

The relaxed nature made it feel like flashback to a time when they were dating for Tim, and he was very much enjoying himself. Madison was genuine in her friendly nature towards Tim. They had been together during a very formative time, and he had always been great to her. The reasons for their breakup were simple...if they were not going to end up together, why string him along for another half semester, when they could be messing around, or trying new things for that last semester before college, but now she wondered if she made an error. Part of Madison wanted to start taking the conversation into an area where she could make a move, but she didn't want to give him any mixed signals. He was a past boyfriend, and she didn't want him to think she still had feeling for him, and she really didn't want to develop anything right before college. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim was wondering if the night was going to go in the romantic direction. He saw the potential for that, but Madison never took it there, and he sure as heck was not going to open up that wound, or possibility of an awkward outcome. So the night progressed without any fooling around. They mainly talked, and then watched some TV together. As it got close to midnight, Tim excused himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison walked him out to his car. It was pleasant outside, a little warm, but there was a breeze. Before he got into the car, he starred at Madison for a sec, as if he wanted to say something rather deep about what she met to him, but he just could not think of any way to have it come out. Madison though, wanted to communicate the same thing, and looked him deep into his eyes,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Tim, I just want to know, I'm really happy we were able to spend time together.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''It's meant a lot to me too.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I really want to keep in touch.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I would like that a lot.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief silence. And then they both kind of smiled and laughed at each other. Tim moved in for a hug, which Madison reciprocated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well...see ya around I guess,'' Tim blurted out as he got ready to go in his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I'll be home for fall break!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe drove away, and they didn't see each other again until her fall break.</span></div></div>",

Even though he was commuting from home, he was enjoying himself, getting immersed  in the college culture, and meeting some new people including girls, who he was having more success with than he ever did in high school. However, he still thought about Madison frequently. As commonly happens during the first semester, it felt like the fall dragged on forever. Tim could not wait for fall break, and he knew that during the break, Madison would be coming back. It was't like all he thought about was Madison, but he still thought she was better than the girls he was meeting at the local college. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the week of fall break came, and Tim was looking forward to seeing Madison. However, he did not want to seem over eager, so her decided to hold off on texting her. Eventually, midway through the week, he received a text, ''Hey, are you free soon--we should hang out if you are!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim was ecstatic as he read the text, but he knew to play it cool, and responded that he was able to hang out the next evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next evening, Tim wore some clothes that he bought a few night ago, he wanted to look his best, even if it wasn't going to be romantic. Eventually, he heard a knock on the door, and he greeted Madison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Heyyyyyy I missed you!,'' Madison said in a way that was leading him on. They hugged and Tim noticed that she seemed just a tad fuller than she had been before. Not much, but enough to notice, maybe five pounds. Ehh, it was college, he thought. Surely ,Madison would never let it go beyond that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the evening, they hung out, talked, and watched TV. It stuck Tim as a friendship that Madison wanted to keep going, so he obliged, despite still being drawn to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the evening, the decided to meet up again during winter break, something that Tim looked forward to. </span></div></div>",

Over the past few weeks it seemed as though he couldn't keep her off his mind. He texted Madison earlier and she was on her way over to his house to hang out. Tim heard the doorbell and opened the door. \"Heyyyy Tim!\" Madison said. They hugged and Tim felt as though Madison had become much softer since their last encounter. Her growing stomach compressed against Tim's torso, and he noticed that her boobs seemed fuller than before. Tim let Madison in and they went to the TV room to watch a movie. As Madison walked into the TV room, he noticed how her thighs and ass seemed thicker in her yoga pants, and how they jiggled slightly with each step. They both sat down on the couch and Tim turned on a movie. \"We should order a pizza!\" Madison recommended. Tim called the local pizza parlor and ordered a large pizza. Twenty minutes later a steaming hot pizza arrived at the door. During the movie, Tim noticed how Madison devoured 6 slices of pizza, along with two cokes. Madison had easily gained ten pounds since he had last seen her, and it seemed as though she had no intention of slowing her gain. Her soft belly now overflowed her waistband, sitting on her lap. Her shirt had creeped up, revealing somewhat of a muffin top. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That were sitting very close together on the couch, nearly touching, much close than any platonic friends would. Tim was having trouble deciding if this was Madison's way of casual friendship with an ex, or if she was sending signals. For two people who knew each other as well as Madison and Tim did, Tim was having trouble deciding what to do, choosing his words carefully, and trying to figure out the situation.  All the while he was also registering Madison's weight gain. It sure looked like she had enjoyed herself enough in college to have put on the Freshman 15, and he was very surprised by the show of gluttony that Madison had displayed in front of him. As far as he knew, Tim was not really into larger girls, and even if he was, would never profess to it, for fear of ridicule from his friends. However, a 15 pound gain was not enough to deter the infatuation that he had developed with his ex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Tim put his arm around Madison, to no protest, and then he moved in to kiss her. Madison seemed somewhat surprised, but he could see her eyes smile, letting him know this was not unwelcome. A massive rush of excitement and shock that this was happening swept through his body while he was making out, however, as he moved his hands down her body, he realized that this felt rather foreign. The Madison that he remembered had rock hard abs, and was firmed and toned everywhere. Now, he noticed that her body felt...well, softer, most notably in her stomach, and once he went there, her butt. No one would ever call Madison fat by any stretch of the imagination, but her body had indeed changed from what Tim was used to. Nevertheless, as they quickly went into his bedroom, Tim was overcome with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day, Tim and Madison met at her place, and proceeded to go to the beach. As he rolled into her driveway to pick her up, she jumped in, and their first few seconds together was met with silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what does last night mean?\" Tim asked Madison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God Tim, really?\" Madison asked, somewhat put off that was the first thing he brought up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we slept together for the first time since high school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does not mean anything.\" Madison said, not annoyed, but firmly, \"We can't swing a long distance relationship, and even if we could, I like the freedom of being single in college. I like going out with my friends, and meeting new guys, I'm not ready to give that up, especially in my freshman year.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim felt dejected, but also, given his youthful age and maturity, he now partially wondered how to ask Madison if they were going to be a casual hookup. He desperately wanted to date her, but if that was not in the cards, he was still very attracted to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you saying last night was a mistake?\" He asked, figuring that it would give him a hit about where the relationship was going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I enjoyed it, it brought me back to high school, I just do not want to be exclusive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's over if we start getting awkward, or weird, or you start getting attached. I don't want to kill our friendship over this.\" Madison said, leaning to turn on the radio. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the beach, Tim took off his shirt, while Madison lifted her pullover over her head, exposing her bikini, and post fall semester body to Tim. He had seen this bikini before, a lot actually, it was Madison's swimwear of choice. It was a blue halter top bikini top, and matching holdover style bikini bottom, and it exposed the differences in her body. Previously, Madison looked like she could have been a stand in for one of the models at the expensive store she bought it from. Now, it looked a bit tight. Her stomach was puffy and soft, in sharp contract to the abs she had before. She didn't have severe love handles, but they looked like they were in the early stages of forming. Her thighs were larger, not huge, but larger than before, and her butt filled the bottoms in a way they never had before. Again, Madison was not fat, most would neglect to call her even chubby, but she no longer had the perfect 10 body she half a year ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison caught Tim staring, \"I know, I partied a bit too much this semester. Don't worry, I'm hitting the gym when I get back to school.\"</span></div></div>",

He showed his shock on the phone, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, they're coming down here and then to the port?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's Florida for spring break, what did you expect?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, maybe South Padre\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Madison asked, \"are you in? We can share a room\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get back to you on that,\" a nervous Tim stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the kind of thing that he truly wanted a year ago, but the surprise of an invite to spend a week with her now caught him off guard. What would her friends from Powers be like? Would his parents even be okay with this? Yes, he was 18, but he still felt some deference to them while he was still in school, and far more dependent on them, living locally, as opposed to Madison's leave for the midwest. Tim quickly realized that his parents would not really care about where he spent break, and shook himself out of his high school mindset into his appropriate collegiate thinking, and dialed Madison back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison,\" he said before she could say hello, \"that sounds really fun. Count me in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the day finally rolled around, Tom met up with Madison and her two friends, Cassi and Caroline, and waited to board the ship. He noticed that Madison's arms looked bigger, but he could not really tell anything else about the rest of her body, because she was wearing a loose sun dress, and even the sunglasses that she was wearing made him wonder if her face was actually rounder, of if her shades were just giving off that perception. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the other girls, he was not surprised that Madison found equally sociable friends at Powers, Cassi, who was a blonde girl who appeared to have picked up a bit of pudge in her stomach over the past year and went to Powers in state, and Caroline, a girl with black hair, who he learned was from the Northeast. As they got into the ship, he saw the rooms were confirmed, Cassi and Caroline to a room, Madison and him to one. They made a plan to join each other at the pool about an hour after they got to their rooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tom entered, he saw the room had twin beds, and was a fairly standard interior room. Madison saw him scanning the room, \"it's okay, we will not be in here much anyway,\" she said. He wanted to respond, but did not, <i>\"I was more wondering if each bed was going to get use during this trip.\"</i> Madison excused herself to go shower, saying that she felt grimy from staying in the sun while boarding the boat, which gave Tom time to change. When Madison exited the bathroom 20 minutes later, Tom was shocked by what he saw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Madison in a bikini, and she looked very curvy, if not chubby. He thought she had packed around 160 pounds on her 5'7 frame. She didn't look bloated, but he was surprised how soft she seemed. Tim could tell she was sucking in her stomach, and he wondered how far it would extend had she not. However, there was no way for her to conceal that her legs had grown, so he was not surprised when she slipped on shorts to wear up to the deck. Shorts, that he noticed, were rather tight themselves. The shorts temporarily denied him being able to see how much her butt had grown, but before she slipped her t shirt on, he noticed that her love handles had continued to spread outward, now even more accentuated by the elastic shorts. Her boobs had for sure grown, but did not seem to be as perky as before, however, he found it to be a fair trade off. As they headed up to the pool, Tim only wonder how Madison was handling this gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Walking towards the pool Madison\u2019s weight gain was obvious. Her newly rounded thighs were touching and her hips were wider. Collops of flesh bulged out of the single pierce bathing suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim recalled that in high school Madison had always worn a two piece suit but this was a single piece with a large frill obviously meant to disguise her belly.   He noted that Madison\u2019s chunky friend Cassie also had a one piece and that neither of them seemed overly concerned or upset. As for Caroline, the most slender of the trio, she wore a two piece with a noticeably round and soft belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cPowers sure seems to feed their co-eds well,\u201d </i>Tim noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey plunged into the pool. Madison had always been a good swimmer and enjoyed pool games.  This day was no different except that after around twenty minutes Cassi called for a break and Madison agreed. As she hauled herself up the pool ladder Tim estimated that she\u2019d gained at least thirty pounds since they\u2019d gone to homecoming ten months before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassi made a beeline for the refreshment table beside the pool, where a variety of pastries were available for free. Madison followed her lead once she got there in selecting three plus a glass of punch. Caroline settled for two. And Tim, who wasn\u2019t really that hungry, followed her lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four young people chatted amiably about the ship and the upcoming event schedule while enjoying the sun and wind.  Cassie virtually inhaled her pastries but Madison was more deliberate, chatting with Tim and peppering him with questions. Still, after about fifteen minutes her treats were gone as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Tim noted that the stewards had brought out some fresh pizzas and offered to serve the girls. Caroline hesitated but Cassie thought it a great idea and Madison exclaimed \u201cwhy not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim went to the table and loaded up two plates with four slices apiece. By the time he made a second trip and then gone back for sodas Cassie had finished her first slice and Madison was close behind. It was then that Tim got an idea.  He returned to the serving table and brought back four more slices just to see what would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn\u2019t disappointed. Of the twelve pieces total Cassie and Madison each had four while Caroline and Tim wound up with two each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cObviously she\u2019s not overly concerned about her waistline,\u201d</i> Tim observed. \u201c<i>And on her its not bad. But the guys back home would probably say she\u2019s getting beyond chunky.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts not good to get back in the water after eating,\u201d Caroline reminded everyone.  \u201cLet\u2019s get a nap in so we can stay up later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four young people concurred and headed back for their rooms, Tim once again trailing behind Madison\u2019s swaying derri\u00e8re.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn their room Madison peeled off her one piece suit, dried and changed into a loose fitting gown. Her developing paunch, still less than her bosom, was nonetheless clearly evident but Tim noticed she wasn\u2019t embarrassed for him to see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you \u201c she confided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor what?\u201d replied Tim a little confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor volunteering to fetch the pizza and soda. It tells me what I was curious to know.,\u201d she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout what,\u201d he answered, still befuddled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout the weight I\u2019ve been gaining, I\u2019m glad it doesn\u2019t seem to be bothering you,\u201d Madison clarified. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll let me know if it does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim was truly baffled. Here he\u2019d been pining his heart out over Madison\u2019s seeming rejection a few months before, now they were on a cruise financed by her parents and she was fearing he\u2019d be upset? He was exactly where he wanted to be and he thought he needed to make that clear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaddie, I don\u2019t know why you\u2019ve become larger now and are apparently so hungry, but if it makes you happy don\u2019t worry about me. That\u2019s high school jock talk from control freaks  \u2013 adults care about their significant others as people. Surely you know that?\u201d he responded. \u201cThis is a cruise ship with more food being served daily than a small city. People are expected to eat and, yes, perhaps gain a few. It doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he spoke he felt his crotch tightening as he looked at her body and Madison noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do think that truth be told you want me in bed,\u201d she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that\u2019s a dessert I do fancy,\u201d he replied, approaching her with the intent of rolling into the bunk. She grabbed him and they gently fell together, Once again his fingers and body had the sensation of her being substantially larger than last time,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTonight let\u2019s take a stroll under the stars and I'll explain what still might seem crazy to you,\" she purred, \"but for right now let's just enjoy one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoger that,\u201d he replied and began kissing and massaging her corpulent framer intensely. The gentle rolling of the ship plus their full bellies lulled them both to sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This might seem crazy, but I kinda love being a little curvy. After spending my entire life obsessing over my image, I feels great just to kinda let go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim nodded his head in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At Powers it seems like people care less about what's on the outside and more about what's on the inside. No one cares if you're a size zero or a size twelve, as long as you're a good person. Everyone's really nice and accepting which made me realize I don't have to abide by anyone's standards. If I'm hungry, I'm going to eat. It's as simple as that. I just hope you aren't as superficial as the other guys down in Miami.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison stopped and looked up at Tim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I'm not, babe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Tim said this he went down to kiss Madison. They started to make out and Tim felt down to Madison's growing derriere. Suddenly Madison pulled away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We better hurry up and get back to the dining room so we don't miss the buffet. All this walking made me really hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison turned around and started walking towards the dining room. Tim sighed as he saw Madison's butt jiggle with each passing step. The old Madison would have never been this excited for a buffet, especially one at 10:00 at night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Madison placed each one of the plates in front of her place and took a seat, grinning in a combination of excitement and hunger. She immediately tore into her fried chicken, stuffing her face with biscuits in between bites. Tim's small salad paled in comparison to his girlfriend's feast of fried chicken, biscuits, mashed potatoes with gravy, ribs, pizza, and a hotdog. Gravy dribbled down Madison's chin as she spoke to her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, this food is sooooo good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison squirted what seemed like a gallon of ketchup on her hotdog and brought it to her mouth.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tim was standing at baggage claim in the airport, waiting for Madison to arrive and take her home. He checked that her flight was on time (it was), so it must just be taking a while to get everyone off the plane. He wondered what he would see of her this time, considering that last time she had probably put on about ten pounds. <i>Not that I have room to talk</i>, he thought has he rubbed his little but round beer gut from his freshman 15.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim!\" he heard someone call from behind. He turned around and saw Madison... and it was quite the sight to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison stopped when she got to Tim, catching her breath long enough for him to take in her big change. Almost everything about Madison was the same as it had always been except for one thing, and it was bouncing furiously up and down as she tried to cover it. While Madison had put on a little bit of weight when she was last back, it wasn't very noticeable. Now there was no hiding it, she had a belly. It stuck out further than her chest, rounding out a lot like a pregnant woman. He couldn't tell whether the shirt she was wearing was an old shirt or a crop top, it barely came down to her belly button. She had to have put on easily another 20 pounds, but it all went straight to her bulbous stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for picking me up,\" Madison finally said when she caught her breath. She came and give Tim a hug, but both awkwardly giggled when their bellies bumped as they tried to maneuver a hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Powers is treating you well,\" he said to Madison. She let out a nervous laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, maybe a little too well. My mom is going to freak when she sees this,\" she replied, placing her hands on either side of the exposed belly and shook it, watching it wobble some after letting go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't worry too much about that. It can;t be any worse than when she realized that Alexa had put on 40 pounds with her new boyfriend 2 months ago,\" Tim reassured Madison. Madison's eyes got wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She did WHAT?!\" she exclaimed. Tim nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let her tell you herself, it's quite a story. But let's just say you're probably the thin sister now,\" he warned her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's surprising. It seems like everyone around me had put on some weight lately!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's probably just everyone adjusting to change in their life, whether it's college, like me, or a new relationship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not wrong,\" Madison replied. \"Now let's head out. Tell me, who else has grown that you haven't told me about\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hellooo, I'm home!\" Madison called out as she walked into her house. As concerned as Madison was with her mom reacting to her weight, she really missed her family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, honey! Welcome home,\" her mom replied as she walked into the foyer. Madison was surprised how unfazed her mom was when she saw her eldest daughter's 30 pound ball of a stomach not even covered by her shirt. This was completely out of character for her mom, who was always a stickler for eating healthy and working out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, mom, it's so nice to finally be home,\" she said as she leaned in to hug her mom. Her stomach created a bit of a barrier between the two Kraft women, but that still didn't seem to bother her mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to have you back! How was your first semester?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was good! My grades were good, made some great friends, and enjoyed the food quite a bit,\" she said as she patted her gut for emphasis and trying to elicit more of a reaction from her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure looks like it. Glad it all went well,\" Mrs. Kraft replied. \"Your sister is upstairs if you want to go say hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, actually. I'm going to take my stuff upstairs and then I'll say hi to her.\" Madison picked up her suitcase and made the trek upstairs. She left her suitcase in her room and then went to Alexa's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock, knock,\" Madison said as she opened her sister's slightly cracked door. Who she saw when she opened it shocked her, now understanding why her mom was acting like her stomach was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa's gain was much bigger, but hers was concentrated in a pear shape. Her legs were once twigs, but now they were red from constantly rubbing against each other they had grown so large. Her butt was wide, like a Kardashian's except lumpier. Even her calves looked to have gotten thicker, really emphasizing that she was a growing girl still. Alexa had been looking at herself in the mirror, examining how her most recent pounds had settled on her, but turned around when she heard Madison knock. Madison noticed that her face was developing a double chin when she smiled, not permanent yet but probably would be in another 20-30 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi!\" Alexa exclaimed as she ran over to Madison to give her a hug. As Madison wrapped her arms around her sister, she felt her sister's whole body squish against hers, something that felt weird to Madison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how have you been?\" Madison asked Alexa, hoping she would spill on her new weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm GREAT! School's going well, I have a boyfriend, and everything's just perfect!\" she replied excitedly. Madison nodded while still looking Alexa up and down, continuing to take all of her in, and Alexa noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like it? My boyfriend suggested that I get some more curves and it turned out to be the best thing ever! It feels great and my boyfriend loves it too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um... if you don't mind me asking, how much is all this?\" Madison asked. Alexa grinned even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hit 50 pounds gained just yesterday, putting me at 175! Mom flipped when she finally noticed how big I was after the first 40 pounds, but I basically told her nothing's changing so she'd just have to deal with it. That's probably why I didn't hear her cry about your new gut, how much have you put on anyway?\" Alexa rambled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I put on 30, guess you're now the big sister,\" Madison chuckled. Alexa laughed a little bit but then Madison saw the reality hit her that her sister was actually smaller, something she wasn't going to let last for long. After all, she had a month to bring Madison to her level...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI swear, I can\u2019t eat another bite!\u201d Madison exclaimed, rubbing her taut stomach. Alexa and Tim both nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis might be one of the best meals we\u2019ve had this month.\u201d Said Tim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree. Anyone want to go get some dessert?\u201d Alexa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo thanks, I just need to go home, lay down, and let this digest!\u201d Madison replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, o have a run of Phish Food in the freezer at home anyway,\u201d said Alexa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then I guess we\u2019re all set, so to the car we go!\u201d Said Tim. Since Madison\u2019s return home for winter break, the trio of herself, Tim, and Alexa has practically been inseparable (with the occasional addition of Alexa\u2019s boyfriend), and that usually meant feasting, whether it was a monster snack pile in the house or a large meal at a new restaurant they decided to try. Food is what brought them together, and it was apparent that that was the case on all of them as they piled into the car that was becoming too small for the three growing teens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison has come back home with the majority of the 45 pounds she had put on over the course of the semester going to her stomach (30 of the 45, leaving her looking like she was in her last trimester of pregnancy), but the newly accumulated 20 had begun to even out her body, softening her legs, arms, and face more than before. And despite the weight now distributing itself more evenly on her body, she still was regularly fielding questions about when she was due because of her perfectly rounded stomach (and the embarrassment and shock people had when she told them it was just a food baby). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim was certainly not immune to the effects of food either. Over the course of his semester he knew he had put on a bit of weight (drinking a lot of beer, having an unlimited meal plan, and metabolism not being able to keep up with your consumption will do that to you), but he had figured it wasn\u2019t more than the freshman 15, but was shocked to discover that it was more like the freshman 30. And eating with Madison and Alexa has grown that 30 pounds to 54, giving him a beer gut now as opposed to a beer belly, softening his chest to give him what was turning into the start of moobs, and the beginning of a double chin. And with the way his appetite had increased its capacity, that 54 was likely to be significantly higher by the end of the school year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa, of course, saw the biggest change of the trio. When Madison came home she had just discovered that she had surpassed the 50 pounds mark in her gain, something that made her boyfriend VERY happy (and he had seen some side effects too, but compared to his girlfriend his 20 pounds looked nonexistent). With Madison home, she had been trying her darndest to gain even more since she didn\u2019t have school or anything else to detract from her eating time, and she never did let anything do that. With her metabolism having basically stopped working, Alexa had managed to gain 28 pounds in the time she had been on break, and most of it went to her ever-expanding lower half. Her butt, which already dominated her figure, had grown even bigger, causing her to not always fit in some chairs. Her legs had grown bigger to support her larger derri\u00e8re, giving her a slight waddle now with how much rounder her thighs had gotten. Her stomach also now hung over her waistband, losing the battle the once perky belly had with gravity. Her once temporary double chin seemed to have solidified itself on her face, giving her almost a cherubic look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three drove in silence, most of them so full they couldn\u2019t speak. Tim dropped the girls off at their house and then drove home. When he got back, he examined himself in the mirror while thinking about his winter break. Who knew putting on weight would bring me and Madison back together? He thought as he looked  at the overinflated basketball that was his stomach. He poked and prodded it a bit, something he hadn\u2019t done before, realizing it was even obstructing his view of the ground, barely able to see his toes past it. He did a little jump and watched as his torso and chest shook for several seconds after he stopped moving. I kinda like this, he told himself, in that moment deciding that he wanted to get even bigger. Unbeknownst to him, that would be much easier and happen wayyyy faster than he could ever imagine (on the track he was already on he would have reached a 100 pound gain by spring break unintentionally, but his new trajectory set that much higher). <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That phrase had become Ryan's parting words to Tim almost every day for the past two months as chugging soda had become one of his methods for putting on more weight quickly, and his roommate found the method weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it, paired with some other strategies, was highly effective on Tim's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim, after winter break, started planning his school meals more, creating almost a schedule. In the morning he makes himself a milkshake with a few scoops of weight gain powder and eats two high calorie breakfast burritos. At lunch, he eats in the dining hall but makes sure to eat a minimum of three plates of food plus dessert. Dinner he does the same thing. For snacks, he eats a large bag of chips in the morning, cookies in the afternoon, and a pint of ice cream in the evening. He took a supplement that also helped slow his metabolism down more (not that it needed much help slowing, it was practically nonexistent now). Oh, and he drinks a liter of soda a day. All of this has greatly helped him grow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was already up to a total gain of 60 pounds by the time winter break was over (240 pounds), but his new eating habits added 38 pounds in January (putting him at 278) and he was about to find out how much more had come onto him in the month of February. He stepped onto his new scale and waited for the number to be read out to him (he figured with the way the weight settled on him it would be hard to read a scale so he found one that would say the number out loud). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"313,\" the scale read aloud. Tim grinned at that, knowing he got 35 pounds in the shortest month of the year, 133 total since the start of college. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe examined himself in the mirror, examining all the changes that were happening faster and faster now. His stomach has resembled a basketball at the beginning of winter break, but now was more of a beach ball from the weight settling mostly there. When he looked down, all he saw was his bulbous stomach, the floor was barely visible around the round mass of fat sticking out from his midsection. But the other changes he could see in the mirror quite clearly. The face that looked back at him was encased in fat, with a massive double chin and a third one already starting and cheeks always looking as if he had something stuffed in them. His legs had swollen up to give him a waddle now. Even his forearms and hands had swollen up, his whole body really looking like it was stuffed into a sausage casing. He was unrecognizable even from just a couple months ago, and he was loving the feeling.  </span></div></div>",

Also during that chat he had seen just how much Alexa had grown from the shoulders up at least. Her face was unrecognizable from just last fall when she had been a slim and trim young woman. Now her face was dominated by her pudgy cheeks and her rapidly vanishing neck as her chins took up more and more space. She had even admitted that in addition to the 78lbs she had gained by the end of winter break she had added another 39 bring her up a total gain of 117lbs which for a former 112lb light weight was a very big change. <br>\r\nAnd even though he hadn't seen Maddison since the end of winter break Alexa had informed Tim that if anything Maddison's gain had put Alexa's to shame.

Madison was excited and nervous. She's the only one who left the state of Florida to go to college, so it had been a long time since she last saw anyone. However, she was nervous for one reason, and it was causing her pool tunic to look more like a maternity dress than a pool tunic. No one except for Tim had seen her 30 pound stomach and she didn't know what they would think (even though Tim reassured her that all of them were in very similar boats). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim pulled up and honked a couple times playfully, causing Madison to chuckle as she walked over to his car and slid in. She fastened her seat belt, something that was not easy considering the ball sitting in her lap, even pushing her legs apart some to make room for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't know if I'm ready to face everyone,\" Madison told Tim. \"I mean, even if what you say is true, that doesn't mean they'll react well to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, them commenting on you would be a case of them calling the kettle black,\" he reassured her. She nodded and they drove in silence to their friend Rachel's house, not sure what else to talk about during the drive. They finally arrived and Madison took a deep breath in preparation, but what she saw on the pool deck was not what she thought she would see, even with everything Tim said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friends, guys and girls alike, had really grown out. Tim walked over to a group of guys standing around a keg, something that clearly they had grown accustomed to. All of them had beer guts of varying sizes, but the one thing that was clear was that all of them had put on the freshman 15 almost a couple times over by the looks of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison! I'm so glad you came!\" a girl ran up to Madison and gave her a hug, and it took Madison a minute to realize that this girl was Rachel, her best friend. But this version of her best friend was much, much larger than she ever had seen her before. Madison had to take a step back to see all the changes, but the first one she saw was Rachel's face, now swaddled in fat. She had a double chin and chubby cheeks, making her look more cute than sexy, like she used to be. Her breasts had grown significantly, large enough that it would probably be hard to see past them, meaning she probably couldn't properly see her now pudgy stomach that hung over the waistband of her bikini. Not that the bikini bottom could be seen much anyway considering her much larger lower half. Between her shelf of a butt and her thighs that had to be chafing a ton from constantly touching, they bottoms of her bikini could hardly be seen. <i>I thought I put on a lot of weight, Rachel's had to have put on even more</i>, thought Madison as Rachel dragged her over to a group of her girlfriends, all in very similar shape to each other: larger bellies, jiggly thighs, larger butts, less slender faces, all looking definitely chubby or more, no longer slender. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison! It's so good to see you! It looks like you've been enjoying college too,\" her friend Tanya said as Madison sat down, poking Madison's belly for emphasis. Madison, now feeling much better about her body after seeing everyone else in similar shape, chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it looks like I'm in good company,\" she replied, and all the girls nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, it's just too much added stress to try and stay fit in college,\" Rachel said. \"I tried to after having put on the freshman 15 in under a month, but my grades went down the more I tried to stay in shape, so for the sake of my grades I put on another 45 pounds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly! And the food is all simply too good to not eat it, so I just gave up and now I'm up 50 pounds and quite frankly don't know if I'm going to stop,\" another girl chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you Madison, what's your story?\" someone asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I'd have to say it's a combination of things. Yes, the food is really good at Powers. No, I haven't been going to the gym. But it also doesn't help that my roommate is a terrible influence! She's always eating and offering me snacks. At least I only put on 30 compared to her 60, although hers is more evenly distributed than mine\" Madison said while rubbing her Buddha belly, the group all of them nodding in agreement and acknowledging their own over-sized stomachs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I have to ask, what happened to all the guys?\" Madison asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty similar to all of us: eat a lot, don't exercise, but they also all joined frats and are at keggers all the time. The fact that they aren't bigger is a miracle to me,\" said Tanya. \"I mean, Tim's the lightest of the bunch and from what I've gathered he's put on at least 25 pounds if not more, although he says it's only 15. I don't believe him though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah he's definitely more, he's roommates with my boyfriend who's put on nearly 50 pounds and Tim's been borrowing John's old clothes for about a month now, clothes from when John was 25 pounds lighter. All I can say is that none of them will be under 225 wen we come back for spring break, that's for sure,\" said Rachel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget them, I doubt I'll be under that much by then with the way the year is progressing. I'm pretty sure that by New Years we'll all be up at least another 20 pounds,\" said Tanya loudly. Even the guys turned around when they heard her say this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a challenge?\" said one of the other girls in the group. Everyone looked at Tanya eagerly, wanting to know if they had a genuine challenge issued to them or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not! January 1st we'll have another pool party and see who's put on the most weight between now, December 19th, and January 1st,\" said Tanya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think any of us will have a problem with that,\" said Tim, looking around at their comically large group gathered in swimsuits that were all too small for their bodies.<i> These are all small now, imagine in 3 weeks what they'll look like</i>, Tim thought, rubbing his own stomach that was larger than he cared to admit. Last he checked it had only been 15 pounds extra to his originally 170 frame, but in reality he had put on 35 pounds, settling him at 205 with a prominent beer gut. Winning this challenge would be way easier than he thought.</span></div></div>",

You all sent me your starting weights, so let's get to the weighing!\" Tanya cheered. \"We'll start with the ladies. Rachel, since it's your house how about you do the honors of going first. Before you step up, state your starting weight and then read your new weight out so all of us can hear.\" Rachel nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was 185 when we started,\" Rachel stated as she stepped on the scale. She leaned forward to look over her larger chest, reading out, \"211, up 26 pounds.\" She stepped off the scale and it was clear that she had easily put on 26 pounds. Even though she was in a new bikini, it was already being swallowed by her growing lower half. While before her butt had dominated her gain, her thighs had clearly taken most of her new weight, even giving her a slight waddle as she walked away from the scale. Everyone thought that number seemed like a lot, but as the game went on it would become clear that 26 pounds was not a whole lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, for now the number to beat is 26. Lisa, it's your turn,\" Tanya said. Lisa went and then another girl, both of them only getting a measly 19 ans 22 pound gain. Next up was Tanya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going next, I started this at 177, I'm now... 206, a 27 pound gain! Take that Rachel!\" Tanya cheered, her new jiggly bottom bouncing every which way as she stepped off, showing off her biggest asset. As of now she held the record for the girls, but that would be broken soon enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Madison, you're the last of the girls. Step up.\" Madison stepped forward, her body feeling the extra weight she'd put on. She'd spent almost every waking hour shoveling food into her mouth, not realizing how badly she wanted to win this despite what it would do to her body. But she didn't care about that anymore. Everyone else around her was growing, so it wouldn't kill her to do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I started at 160 and now I'm... can someone read the number for me, I can't see it,\" Madison asked the group. All her eating had extended her already round belly out even more, although luckily some of the weight started going to her legs to help support the ever growing bulbous belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I've got it,\" said Rachel. She looked over at the scale and huffed a bit. \"189, 29 pounds.\" Madison wasn't surprised after stuffing herself to the brim every waking hour of the past two weeks. She waddled away from the scale, her walk now resembling more of a waddle to accommodate her large midsection, unlike the other girls who waddled in the group because their legs were so large now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for the guys! John, you're up first.\" John stepped up to the scale. He was the largest of the group already, but now he looked even larger. His gut looked like an even rounder and wider version of Madison's, there was no way he would be able to see anything beyond it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was 220 when we started, Rachel, can you read the number?\" Rachel made her way back to the scale, looked down and said, \"249, 33 pounds. And judging by the competition, I should probably stay here to read for everyone else, it'd be a miracle if you guys can see past your bellies.\" All the guys chuckled and agreed. Unlike the girls, who all varied in body shape, the guys all looked pretty much the same: a stomach that looked like a beach ball attached to their bodies. The next few guys went, all were less than the current record of 33 pounds. That, however, was about to be broken by Tim, the last person to go. He had been working hard, having been the smallest of the bunch at the start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I started at 205,\" Tim told the group. He stepped onto the scale and Rachel looked at the number. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a winner! Tim went from 205 to 241, a winning gain of 36 pounds! Congrats,\" Rachel exclaimed as she handed Tim the pot. Tim was now almost the same size as John, and John was the largest guy in the group! He looked down at his midsection, unable to believe that he went from just a couple months ago having a relatively flat midsection to no longer being able to see his feet. Madison came over to give him a hug and congratulate him, but they had a bit of trouble considering they belly bumped every time they tried to do a front hug. She ended up coming around to his side and he put his arm around her shoulder, just like they used to stand when they dated. She looked up at him and said something that made him very happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I miss this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By this do you mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Us, our relationship. I miss this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to give it a try again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely.\"</span></div></div>",

Since their last encounter before she went off to school, he was still a bit confused as to where they stood in their relationship: were they just friends, friends with benefits, or something else entirely? He was hoping his lunch with Madison would help answer the question, but that would require her to arrive at some point. He was about to pull out his phone to text her when the bell on the cafe door rang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison walked towards Tim, but there was something different about her. As she made her way to the table Tim realized that it was the infamous freshman 15, having settled itself entirely on her lower half. Madison once was ownership to the most toned thighs you had ever seen, but those had been replace with a pair of wobbling legs that looked like they would burst her shorts seams any minute now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Tim! It's so good to see you,\" Madison said as she came up to the table. Tim got up and hugged her. As she turned around to pull out her chair he noticed that even her butt had grown larger, definitely contributing to the tightness of the shorts he saw. Of all the people Tim would have thought would gain the freshman 15, or any weight for that matter, Madison didn't even make the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how's college going?\" Tim asked her. She broke out into a huge grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's amazing! Classes are going really well, I got a tutoring job, I like my roommate, and the food is great!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet it is,\" Tim replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh trust me, if you saw my roommate you'd understand how good the food is. I swear she's managed to gained 25 pounds in the first two months alone! I have to watch myself around her, at the rate she eats she'll be the size of a house by winter break and I definitely don't want to end up like that!\" Madison laughed as she finished her sentence. Tim chuckled along with her. She must not realize that she's put on any weight, he thought as she got up to grab her drink from the barista at the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it turns out at the rate Madison was going, she wouldn't necessarily be the size of a house but would definitely be MUCH bigger by the time winter break rolled around.</span></div></div>",

I'm trying to study in here for a test tomorrow,\" Madison shouted into the common room of her dorm to her roommate, Cassie. She was trying to highlight key pieces of information in her textbook but the sounds of eating in the next room were pulling her focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! Hey, I bought a couple pints of ice cream today, you want one? I have cookie dough,\" Cassie replied.Madison looked down at her textbook, contemplating her options, and as if on cue her stomach growled and it was all decided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a second, I'm coming!\" Madison went into the other room to sit with Cassie on their couch and enjoy their ice cream, something that had become a common occurrence between the two of them and it showed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison first met Cassie as a petite and thin girl, but the same could not be said about the version of her roommate sitting on the couch with her now. Cassie seemed to be addicted to food, something she'd openly admitted since starting college, and this newfound addiction had manifested itself as a 40 pound gain since they started school in August, going from 130 to 170 just before the end of October. It covered her entire body in a layer of pudge but the real star of the show was her belly. Most of her weight had settled there, and as she was sitting on the couch it took up a fair portion of her lap, resting on her thighs that had grown as well. Cassie was always eating and always had a lot of food around, meaning that Madison was picking up some of Cassie's excessive habits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison didn't notice that she had put on any weight from picking up Cassie's eating habits, tricking herself into thinking she was fine since she never ate as much as her very chubby roommate (although their portions were growing closer in size every day). Madison's lower half continued to be the part of her that grew, giving her an exaggerated pear shape. Her thighs now touched almost all the way down to her knees, chafing constantly when she walked. Her butt had continued to grow, giving her the start of a shelf butt. While she still hadn't put on as much weight as Cassie, the 15 pounds she went home with at the beginning of October had turned into 26 by the end of the month, but she still hadn't noticed the effect since she had taken to just wearing sweatpants or leggings. If she had tried to wear any of her pants from the beginning of the semester she would discover that they wouldn't even fit up her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any plans for Thanksgiving later this month?\" Madison asked Cassie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going home. You?\" Cassie garbled with a full mouth of ice cream. Madison swore she could see a slight double chin developing on Cassie, which with the way she packed food away made it only a matter of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm staying here and my sister's coming to visit,\" Madison told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll be fun! If you need any restaurant recommendation let me know, I obviously have a bunch,\" Cassie offered, rubbing her bloated stomach for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might just take you up on that,\" Madison replied as she got up to go back to studying. She threw her pint container away and went back into her room. As she entered her room she caught a quick glance at herself in her full length mirror. It must be warped, she thought as she sat down in her chair. She had to adjust herself more than she ever remembered in her chair due to her growing lower half that was getting close to spilling over the edge of the chair (26 pounds all in one half of the body can do that to a person), but Madison was still in denial that she had changed at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She hadn't gone on the tour or help move Madison in, so this was her first time seeing her sister's place of education. She looked around at the students bustling to some of their last classes before break, noticing that, even with taking into consideration their cold weather gear, the student body looked, shall we say... lumpy and large. It seemed almost every student had a belly bulging off their frame, a derriere that looked like they barely fit into even sweatpants, or a double chin hanging onto their face. This seemed like more than just winter weight, and Alexa was about to find out the extent of its reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked into the building with her suitcase and looked around for her sister, not seeing her anywhere. After a couple minutes of standing around, she heard a voice from behind her yelling, \"ALEXA! You're here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around and who she saw was not at all what she expected to see. Her once slim and athletic sister had been replaced by someone else. Madison's attempt to run up to Alexa was hindered by her ever growing thighs, having grown so large she had begun to waddle slightly. Madison's butt was just as large and getting bigger, moving violently as she moved. Her entire body really jiggled slightly as she made her way to her sister, with every inch being covered in a layer of padding. Her face seemed to be the only thing untouched by her weight gain, but it was bound to eventually catch up. Madison finally reached Alexa, who was still standing in shock at her sister's figure, and wrapped her arms around her younger sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I've missed you,\" Madison told her with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Missed you too, sis. Uh... I guess college is treating you well,\" she replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you'll see this week how it's been. Everything here is just great, especially the food,\" Madison informed her sister. \"It's been practically impossible to stay in shape this semester, but I've at least managed unlike my roommate. You'll get to meet her today, she doesn't leave until tomorrow so we'll get to spend some time with her.\" All Alexa could do was nod as she processed everything, especially her sister's denial of her weight gain. They got to Madison's room and she unlocked the door, leading to who must have been the aforementioned roommate, and she was just as big as Alexa was guessing was the norm on campus at this point in the year. Cassie's belly hung wayyy over the waistband of her pants, even sticking out beyond her boobs. Her lower half wasn't quite as large as Madison's, but it was still quite stocky for a girl as short as Cassie. She just looked like someone had taken a balloon pump to her whole body (even her face, which had a small double chin and very round cheeks) and left her looking round and puffy (which 55 pounds in 4 months can do). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What did I get myself into</i>, Alexa thought, unsure of what to think about how her week might go,</span></div></div>",

You\u2019ve seen the way people eat here,\u201d Madison yelled to her sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be there in a minute, let me finish getting my pants on!\u201d Alexa grunted as she attempted to finish getting dressed to go eat thanksgiving dinner. She was feeling some pushback from her pants as she tried to zip them up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry sucking in, that belly of yours is probably getting in the way,\u201d Madison replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have-\u201c Alexa cut herself off when she realized that she was sucking in some, leading her pants to go right on up. She looked down and noticed that her stomach was not as flat as when she first arrived on Monday, even looking slightly concave. <i>That\u2019s</i> <i>impossible</i>, she told herself, <i>I </i><i>haven\u2019t even been here a week</i>. She just shook her head and went over to Madison, who it felt like was practically ballooning every time she looked at her. And with the food on campus it was not surprising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls got to the dining hall and gasped at how large the feast provided was. There was an entire buffet just of meats alone, and three more just for sides (and desserts were even more)! There was just so much, and the two sisters began to pile their plates up high and scarfing it down immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is AMAZING!\u201d Alexa exclaimed, something she had done at every single meal so far. She was a notoriously light eater, yet here for some reason she was always hungry and always got seconds no matter what the time of day was (and sometimes thirds). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know right?\u201d Madison replied through a full mouth of food. She grinned at her sister as she chewed her meal with vigor, her cheeks resembling chipmunks with how full of food they were. \u201cI told you everything here was delicious!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair ended up eating a combined 7 plates by the end of the meal (Madison had 2 main plates and 2 of desserts, Alexa had 2 main plates and one of desserts), and were so full on the way back to the dorm that they didn\u2019t speak a single word. When they got back, Madison  said \u201cThat might be some of the best food I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost too good, Alexa thought as she made her way into the bathroom. She still hadn\u2019t been able to shake Madison\u2019s comment about her belly earlier from her mind and, while she knew eating a monstrous meal was not going to help her examination, she knew that Madison was right and something was off. She looked in the mirror and saw a very bloated stomach, but noticed it was covered in a layer of soft padding that hadn\u2019t been there even as of Monday. She frowned and decided to step on the bathroom scale out of curiosity, and the number that flashed back at her didn\u2019t seem correct. <i>It\u2019s off because of dinner, </i>she thought to herself. <i>I\u2019ll just try again in the morning.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in the morning she went back into the bathroom, stepped back on the scale, and was again confused by the numbers. Madison walked in and saw what Alexa was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly, don\u2019t trust what that scale says. I looked the other day and it said I was 184, which is obviously wrong,\u201d and then she left the bathroom. Alexa looked down at her pooch of a stomach, having deflated from its bloated state last night but still clinging to her shirt more than ever before. She looked back down at the number on the scale, 138, up 12 pounds from Monday, and in that moment knew that there was something wrong with this college.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

UP!\" Alexa grunted as she fought with the zipper on her pants again, something that had turned into a daily battle ever since her week with Madison at Powers. Something was in that food, something that left a lasting effect on Alexa even a couple weeks after having left there. It should be impossible to put on 21 pounds in a week (3 pounds a day roughly), yet somehow that happened to her while with her sister and it hasn't stopped since. It got so bad that she finally had to upgrade her wardrobe earlier in the week after popping the button off her jeans at the dinner table, giving her parents the first taste of what their children were growing into after seeing Alexa's stomach surge forward and flop over her waistband. She checked the scale the other day and still couldn't understand how the number that was her weight was rising so quickly (she had put on another 21 pounds in the two weeks she was home, bringing her to 42 pounds over 3 weeks). She grunted as she looked in her mirror, trying to figure out how to disguise her rapidly growing figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaining as much weight as quickly as Alexa did made it hard to hide, even with her new clothes. Her belly was her largest feature, looking like a bowl of jelly the way it jiggled and bounced whenever she moved. It was almost impossible to find a shirt that would stay put over the bulbous mass and not leave a couple inches of skin out for the world to see her stretchmarks. Her face was even getting quite round, with her cheeks getting fuller and losing its angular shape it once had. Her legs had some padding too, but those weren't as noticeable compared to her upper body. Her jeans, despite being new, were still digging into her midsection a fair amount, giving her a sizeable muffintop. She was turning into everything she wanted to avoid in life, and she wasn't comfortable with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa went into the kitchen where her mom had prepared a large breakfast for her, something that definitely was not helping bring her weight down. She sat down and after her mom gave her her plate, she asked, \"Hey, mom? Can you make a doctor appointment for me? I'm getting really worried about this weight gain.\" Her mom nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to suggest the same thing. Your stomach has grown a little too quickly in the past few weeks to be healthy, I'll call after I drop you off at school. And to think, if you look like this then what does your sister look like?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You have no idea</i>, Alexa said to herself.</span></div></div>",

She knew Alexa had enjoyed a couple of extra pounds while away for the holiday, but it was clear that they didn\u2019t stop just because she was now home.

Madison started rifling through the kitchen cupboards as soon she had put her things down. \u201cGod there is nothing to eat here.\u201d Madison whined. \u201cHow do you live like this?\u201d She asked her sister. Madison had become accustomed to meals on demand, and snacks ready to eat. \u201cWanna hit McDonalds with me?\u201d Madison proposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaddie, how can you be hungry already, we just got home?\u201d Alexa asked, trying to be kind about her sisters weight adjustment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat else is there to do around here? And it\u2019s not like they served us anything on the plane. Now come on I\u2019m starving.\u201d Alexa agreed to go along, telling herself that she was just looking out for her sisters best interest, maybe she could encourage her to eat one of their healthy options. It seemed as though Alexa was getting ahead of herself, because as soon as they both walked inside, getting a whiff of the greasy fast food and seeing the bevy of menu items, Alexa had thrown her plan right out the window.<br>\r\nThey each carried a tray, bustling with food over to a nearby table, each of them ordering at least three meals, and a couple of sides. Like two hungry hyenas they dug into their food, reminding Alexa of her week at Powers. Madison seemed to be enjoying herself, taking a moment to express her joy to her sister. \u201cOMG we need to do this like every day this vacation, this is sooo good!\u201d Madison gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison\u2019s comment made a switch click in Alexa\u2019s mind. What was she doing? Why was she eating so much? Wasn\u2019t she concerned about how much weight she was gaining? Alexa had been having these thoughts for weeks, but had found little willpower to stop whenever presented with an opportunity to eat, especially something delicious. At least in her moment of clarity she was able to pass on a warning to her sister. \u201cActually mom and I have been concerned about a little weight gain that I\u2019ve had, so I\u2019m going to see the doctor this week. Maybe you should make an appointment too, just to get checked out?\u201d Alexa ended her statement with a recommendation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all Madison heard was that her perfect little sister was being meticulously cared for, and would soon lose those extra pounds, and go back to being perfect again. Madison was not excited for that future, so she decided to do whatever she could to keep her sister for picking up healthy habits. \u201cOh you really think a doctor is going to be able to tell you why you\u2019ve gained a few pounds? All the girls I go to school with have gained a few pounds, its natural this time of year, especially at Powers. It\u2019s getting cold out, and no one is going out as much as they used to. Also it\u2019s the holiday season, time for Halloween candy, Thanksgiving turkey, and Christmas cookies. So you might pack on a few, as soon as the holidays are over, I'm sure they will all melt away, they always do. You might as well enjoy it while the season is here, rather than be miserable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison made a valid argument, well almost valid. A few pounds would surely be nothing to fret over, but 50 pounds was encroaching on a problem. Alexa wanted to keep her appointment, but wanted to take what Madison said into consideration as well.</span></div></div>",

It was the younger sisters sneaky way of getting the chunky Madison to hear the hard truth about their not so innocent recent weight gain. They walked in, Madison distracted on her phone, as she wasn\u2019t very interested in being her sister's chauffeur. She would much rather have been home on the couch watching Christmas specials on TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Alexa had a winning smile, and she did love her sister after all, even if she didn\u2019t like the idea of her perfect little sister trimming down one bit. Maybe she could use the information she gained here to her benefit. This momentary thought made her smile, as she sat in the sterile waiting room chair waiting for Alexa\u2019s name to be called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes a nice nurse was calling them in, putting them in a room, where again they waited. This time not very long, as just a moment later the doctor was knocking his way into the room, introducing himself. Alexa sat atop the exam table, while Madison still had her eyes glued to her phone in one of the corner chairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlexa, it\u2019s nice to see you again.\u201d The aging physician had a hearty deep voice. Both girls had been seeing Dr. Morgan since they were kids, and his deep voice had always calmed them during their visits. \u201cLooks like you\u2019ve gained a little weight since you were last in eh?\u201d He read from the chart ahead of his bespectacled eyes. The nurse had taken Alexa\u2019s height and weight in the room when they first arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted to talk with you about Dr. Morgan. I\u2019m not sure what it\u2019s from, I\u2019ve been trying to watch what I eat, but my appetite has never been this bad before. Is this normal?\u201d Alexa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell 40 pounds in a year is certainly not normal, but for someone your size is not the end of the world by a long shot. You\u2019ve got plenty of time to turn things around.\u201d Little did he know those 40 pounds were just from the last month alone. \u201cTell me, what is a normal meal for you girls.\u201d He gave a side eye to Madison, knowing she could benefit from this information as well. She was looking bigger than he remembered her being, both girls used to be extremely thin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell when I visited Madison at school, we typically ate two full plates of dinner, and then a plate of dessert.\u201d Trying to get Madison\u2019s attention, involving her in the conversation, but it did not seem to be working as she was still blocking her face with her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Alexa, this is what I think you should do. Girls your age should only be having one plate during meal time. And trying to limit sweets should help too. I also think you should try and work in some exercise each day. How does that sound? Reasonable? I think with someone of your age and weight, you\u2019ll be back to your old self in no time.\u201d He said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMadison, did you hear that?\u201d Alexa asked her older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison waved her off. \u201cYeah, yeah, sounds good.\u201d She said, not taking a break from her phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe good doctor thanked them for coming in, wished them a good day, and said he would see them for a check up next year. Rushing to get back to the car, Madison yanked Alexa out of there as fast as her chubby legs would allow her. Once they were in the safety of their mom\u2019s car Madison started pushing her stomach\u2019s agenda. \u201cHey wanna hit Micky Dees on the way home?\u201d She asked her sister eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you hear nothing in there? We can\u2019t be eating poorly anymore if we want to get our\u2026\u201d Alexa stopped herself, as she knew her sister was clearly in denial about her weight. \u201cI mean, if I want to get my figure back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you got from that?!\u201d Madison sounded baffled. \u201cAlexa\u201d Her older sister said sternly. \u201cHe said your current weight wasn\u2019t the end of the world. He also said as long as you stuck to one plate you\u2019d be fine. McDonald\u2019s serves meat, dairy, vegetables, and grains. Those are like most of the food groups right there. Come on! Anyways I already ordered you the same meal from yesterday on the app, so we pretty much have no choice.\u201d Madison admitted as she turned the key and revved the engine alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa wanted to continue to protest, but the idea of McDonald\u2019s sounded pretty appetizing. Following her stomach, like she had done ever since she returned home from her trip to Powers, she relented and started to salivate as the got closer and closer to the restaurant.</span></div></div>",

However, she did think it was odd that they were doing some new program where certain freshman would be rooming with Sophomores. Some assistant dean somewhere probably wanted to try something new and get credit if it took off, she supposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no lack of success in high school for Alison. She was a varsity tennis player and on homecoming court, and she had the body for it. She was thin, about 125 pounds of lean muscle on her 5'9 frame. She had black hair, and a cute diamond shaped face. Getting boys was never an issue for her. She was generally friendly, and she didn't have any trouble landing boys. Being from a small town, she was happy about getting to Powers and hoped to move to a larger city after obtaining her degree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison looked at her placement card again, and saw that she was rooming with Madison Kraft. They had friended each other on facebook before the year started, and Madison seemed friendly enough. One of the things that Alison immediately noticed was that Madison was quite chubby in her photos. Alison went back and saw that the weight was exclusively gained during her freshman year. ''Uh-oh, I have to watch myself, I would want that to happen to me,'' she thought as she packed up her things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the perks of the program was that she got a larger dorm room than most freshman would have. They had a bedroom, living room, and a kitchen, pretty good accommodations now, and unheard of 20 years ago. Plus, she figured the central campus location would be great for partying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alison was unpacking her things the door opened up, and Madison came in,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey nice to finally meet you in person,'' Madison said. Madison looked at Alison, she seemed even skinnier in person. Madison remembered when she had a body like that, but as they talked, Madison realized that Alison was really nice, wanted to have a good time, and that they were going to get along well</span></div></div>",

She wanted to get a freshman roommate so she could meet new friends. This was on top of her not being all that crazy about Powers to begin with. Powers, despite being a very good school, was her safety school. She had been shocked when she got rejected to the ivys that her two sisters each had gotten into. Now, as the youngest and third child in the family she felt like the black sheep. Both her Mom and Dad were prominent attorneys. Her Dad had gone to Powers for undergrad, and urged Liz to apply there, even though he didn't seem to talk about his alma mater much growing up, and seemed more please about the tier 1 law school he had gone to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz grew up rich, but always seemingly falling up short to the success her older sister would have in anything, sports, grades, boyfriends, and her Mom would make that brutally clear through underhanded comments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing that her Mom was not above was criticizing her weight. Oh, not explicitly of course, but in hardly subtle ways. In 10th grade, Liz grew quite the potbelly, that was where her weight had a tendency to pile up, and her Mom actually photo shopped it in their Christmas card. At the time, Liz's potbelly caused her to have pretty large boobs as well, and some fleshy arms, and a little double chin, she was quite topheavy. However, over the course of the next year she worked out and dieted, in no small part because of her mother, and she dropped the weight and enjoyed her senior year as a skinny chick. She was cute, not hot, and had black hair, but was quite pale. Liz had some success in high school socially, but was certainly not the bombshell hottie that somewhat like Madison had been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cassi was shocked when she got packages about a week before Liz was set to move in of clothes, but Cassi just had the movers set up the things, or put the clothes in the second closet that was designated as Liz's. It seemed amazing to Liz that her family wasn't just going to move her things in with her, but Cassi in her small town upbringing had come from a much different family than the hyper-competitive, always busy upbringing that Liz was accustomed to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Liz finally came on Freshman orientation day, she walked in, to a Cassi who sprung off the couch. Liz's first thoughts centered at the roommate in front of her. Unlike Alison, she did not do any background research or social media friending with her new roommate, so Cassi's size caught Liz off guard, \"Oh my gosh, she's fat,\" she thought, rather disappointed and shocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, you must be Liz!\" Cassi said, trying to be friendly to someone whom she knew nothing about, except that they would be living together the next year. In her first impressions, Liz was thin, pale, skinny, and had nice black hair. She was wearing clothing that looked really chic. However, Cassi sensed that back when she was thinner, she was prettier than Liz, as if Cassi had more natural beauty, however, she had yet to learn any kind of personality traits associated with this face she had just seen for the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. So we're roommates...I'm so excited!\" Liz said in what she hoped sounded enthusiastic. In truth, she was slightly disappointed that not only did she have a Sophomore roommate, she  had one who looked huge, but she figured she could make the best of it and meet some new guys, or friends outside of dorm life. Plus, her goal was still to ace college and get into a top business or law school, and open up a lucrative career path, so if she had to make nice with Cassi, she could live with that. </span></div></div>",

She knew it wouldn\u2019t cost anymore for room and she wanted to adapt to her new environment. Up to now she\u2019d been a studious quiet tyer \u2013 nothing exciting, always conforming in the background, happy to let her grades speak for her. It is what you might expect from a loving but strict family background. Now she had a partial scholarship and the opportunity to soread her wings a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra had no intention of doing anything wild or getting into trouble. She had no vices such as smoking or drinking and certainly wasn\u2019t interested in drugs. She was hoping to advance her education, have a good time out on her own, and possibly find a boy friend. She was a lithe 124 at 5\u20197\u201d. all as the result of no special effort on her part. Weighty matters, her own or those of others, were the least of her concerns,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she didn\u2019t anticipate upon her arrival after a two hour delay at the airport because of a missing piece of luggage was the note signed by her new roommate, Jessica Wright. She knew her name, but unlike Madison had never tracked down anyone\u2019s picture on the Internet. Nor had thery texted, phoned or emailed one another. ,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dSorry, stocked the kitchen with food for both us and an upcoming psrty, even cooked two casseroles and put them in the freezer, then got called away for a week to a family emergency.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy as much as you can \u2013 especially stuff that coould spoil. I\u2019ll replace it on my return. FYI, our rent includes free breakfast on the commons ngtil school starts but for lunch and supper we either do our own or pay.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra sighed. \u201cWell, if I\u2019m alone at least  there\u2019s food in the house and I\u2018m starved. Let\u2019s see what I can find.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to the jammed refrigerator and quickly discovered some mayo, cheese and luncheon meat. Six two litre bottles of soda were on the counter. She made a quick sandwich and demolished it in no time with a large glass of root beer. Then she looked in the freezer and removed one of the frozen casseroles so it could begin to thaw. She also found three of what  appeared to be larger than average containers of  old fashioned  ice cream in different flavors. Examination showed them to be genuinely rare true 64 ounce half gallons - not the dumbed down 48 ounce size common today. She ladled out a generous helping of chocolate chip from the first container and seated herself in front of the television with another root beer. By the time the show was finished she fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt three o\u2019clock she awoke from her nap hungry. This time she made two peanut butter and jelly sandwiches which she accompanied with cookies fro a bag and some more ice cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the next program was over her belly was bulging but Sandra was dressed only in her underwear, felt comfortably full and took no notice. Instead she went about unpacking and arranging her room. By six o\u2019clock she was done and it was getting colder. She slipped on some clothes and went to the kitchen to see what had happened to the casserole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts softened up quite a bit -  I could pop it into the microwave now,\u201d she mused \u201cBur as nice as tuna and noodles are here should be some vegetables as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, she found packages of frozen vegetables and emptied the contents of a bag of broccoli into a pan of boiling water.  Then she carved out a hearty serving of the casserole and set it to heating. When it was finished she doused it with ketchup and enjoyed her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cThis is the perfect match to some more of that ice cream,\u201d </i>she thought. She had her third helping of the day and noted that it was two-thirds gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm, at this rate all three containers will be used up before Jessica returns,\u2019 Sandra realized. \u201cWell, she invited me to enjoy so why not? I can\u2019t get fat in just a week and its fun to stuff myself a little.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Sandra had digested her eating from the day before and her abdomen was a flat as ever. She decided for breakfast to explore the dining hall on the commons. It could easily seat over a hundred but only about two dozen people were present. The largest group consisted of five girls and four guys. She couldn\u2019t help but notice that three of the five were fat, two of them obese.  This surprised Sandra but didn\u2019t bother her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cIt\u2019s nice that the guys here don\u2019t mind larger women</i>,\u201d she thought.  As she looked around trying to assess the room one of the guys arose and case over and approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, my name is Mark I take it you\u2019re new here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, my name\u2019s Sandra. I just arrived yesterday and found that my roommate had to go away so I settled in without knowing much about anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must mean Jessica,\u201d Mark replied. \u201cwe\u2019re good friends and I expect  she\u2019d want me to look after you. Would you join us for breakfast?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, since I don\u2019t know anyone I guess that\u2019s  a good plce to star,.\u201d Sandra replied, walking towards thst table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe first two on the left are Jim and Madison with her roommate Allison. Across from them are Tim and Cassie with her roommate Liz. Then we have Michael an Kelli, whose new roommate hasn\u2019t gotten here yet.  That leaves two spots for us. Let me introduce you and then I\u2019ll show you the buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra nodded her assent and Mark did the introductions before going wt her to the serving line. He grabbed a try and placed a regular plare and a dessert plate on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s free till the start of the school year to give newbies on the staff practice,\u201d he explained, \u201cso take what you want. Meanwhile I\u2019ll be happy to get you tea coffee or milk. I think the soft drink machines may also be working.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA large coffee, with cream and raw sugar if they have it please\u201d Sandra replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Mark was getting the coffee Sandra went through the line, having a large waffle, some corned beef hash and what appeared to her to be a cheese enchilada. She put melon slices on the dessert plate,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be tempted to pay for these breakfasts when the semester starts  \u2013 there\u2019s such a variety\u201d she remarked on her return. Mark, Madison and Cassi smiled. Like everyone except Liz and Alison they knew what would likely happen.  It would be five days before Jessica retuned and by then Sandra would be well on the road to acquiring a different life style and figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSje would half-heartedly try to cut back but fail, instead electing to stuff and bond with her new friends<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mark watched with interest thinking \u201cthis girl has great promise and will be a positive influence on Jessica\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he noticed something that bothered him. A guy dressed in a biker jacket  walked up to Sandra. By focusing his attention across the space in the lightly occupied dining hall Mark was able to pick up on what they were saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there sweet stuff, you new on campus?\u201d was the biker\u2019s opening line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yes, Actually I just arrived yesterday,\u201d replied Sandra, who was thinking <i>\u201cHow do I make it clear to his guy that I\u2019m not interested without being rude?\u201d</i>\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you looking to make new friends,\u201d he pressed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaturally, in fact I\u2019m with some now, but I\u2019m afraid all the seats are taken,\u201d she answered, thinking \u201c<i>hopefully he takes the hint, I don\u2019t want to hurt feelings.\u201d</i>\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh,\u201d the cyclist said glancing at the table. \u2019You\u2019re too much of a beautiful goldfish to be stuck in that school of whales.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr, \u201c shot back Sandra,  her temper flaring inside and fighting for self-control \u201cand with attitude I guess you\u2019re like Captain  Ahab, just looking to lob your harpoon?  Well, sorry, that\u2019s not the kind of humor I enjoy,  so just go away and let me fill my plate\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you mean refill? That\u2019s your second one. Keep that up and you might get as pudgy as them you know.\u201d grinned the biker as Sandra ladled some scrambled eggs onto her platter and added a coffee cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to start a fight using stereotype insults you\u2019d better watch it,  You\u2019re living proof about what I\u2019ve heard about bikers.\u201dSandra shot back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d replied the startled bully, who had expected a more defensive response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe most dangerous part of the cycle is the nut connecting the handle bar to the seat.,\u201d she replied, looking at him with a steady gaze, then raising her voice . \u201cNow take your crass bigotry and comments and get lost or I might just stumble with this food and the plate will wind up n your face!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biker saw Mark rising out of his seat ad took off. Sandra stood watching him with a satisfied smile. Mark rushed to her side, \u201cis everything all right? Are you OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra smiled. \u201cI\u2019m fine \u2013 if you\u2019d like to fill up a root beer while I make a taco and cool down I\u2019ll meet you at the table.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer new friends other than Mark hadn\u2019t noticed what was happening and Sandra wasn\u2019t about to share, replying to inquiries by saying simply \u201ccreeps like that aren\u2019t worth the time. What I need to know is what I can bring to this party we\u2019re planning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out Mark wasn\u2019t the only witness. About 15 minutes later a uniformed member of campus security force approached the table and indicated he wanted to talk to Sandra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem officer\u201d asked Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne of the servers felt a guy was coming n string to this young lady.\u201d He replied. \u201cWe\u2019ve had two other reports on his approaching co-eds and he doesn\u2019t appear to be a member of the student body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that explains his lack of class,\u201d Sandra noted, \u201cBut I didn\u2019t get his name. He was just, well, crude and rude. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re told you threatened him,\u201d asserted the officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf he didn\u2019t back off, yes,\u201d answered Sandra. \u201cI know martial arts and can defend myself if necessary. But in a public place his abuse was more vocal than physical. I think he just wanted to see what I\u2019d put up with, which isn\u2019t much..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark agreed. \u201cSandra\u2019s right officer. I was tracking most of the entire exchange and he definitely started it. Everything Sandra said he brought on himself. And when he saw me coming over he took off like a jack rabbit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d concluded the officer. \u201cIf you hear or see him again let us know. We definitely want to talk to him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir. Now, can I finish my breakfast before it gets any colder?\u201d asked Sandra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo right ahead.\u201d said the officer as he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that was a bit of excitement,\u201d exclaimed Cassie,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but I\u2019ve dealt with worse,\u201d answered Sandra. \u201cI really think we need to focus on what we were planning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t seem upset about this at all,\u201d interjected Allison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d agreed Elizabeth. \u201cAre you really trained in martial arts\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Kung Fu approach to Taekwondo specifically.  And part of our training is to react naturally rather than letting fear take hold. That poor guy was just another insecure bully trying to resolve his inner misery by controlling others. Sandra sighed Someday maybe he\u2019ll become teachable, but for now he\u2019s not ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s maybe why we\u2019re the ones in college and he\u2019s on the outside?\u201d inquired Tim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Sandra.  And since you\u2019ve finally said something maybe you can tell us what you\u2019re going to do for the party. Can you and Michael each invite two more guys?\u201d\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, well, OK. I guess so,\u201d Tim said, not entirely comfortable with a new freshman effectively taking charge. But he knew he hadn\u2019t been a leader so it was his own fault. The others just wondered how well Sandra and Jessica would blend given her assertiveness. Sandra for her part was oblivious to this, already thinking of how to make the party a success and develop some relationships for she, Allison and Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back to her room she channeled her adrenalin idea into writing on her computer about the party. Just before 11:00 she received a phone call from Allison asking if she and Liz cold come over. She suggested they do so around 11:30.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Knowing Allison and Liz were coming Sandra did a quick inventory of the suite she and Jessica were sharing. The layout was identical to the other 19 apartments in the dorm building \u2013 two bedrooms that doubled as a study center,  common bath and kitchen and a living room/dining area. There were five such suites on each of the four floors plus a common laundry and storage room, all fronting a central  multi-story atrium. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were ten such structures on the campus on one side of a triangular commons. The base of the triangle was the main classroom building with faculty offices in its upper floors.  The third side was a structure which housed the college\u2019s dining hall, library and administrative offices. Its opposite side faced the main entrance and parking area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore parking was available both underground in the dorms and in a structure adjacent to the classrooms. About 20% of the student body lived off the main campus, largely in frat and sorority houses.  A gym field was located on the other side of the classroom parking structure, affording added capacity for games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of this topography was as yet familiar to Sandra. She\u2019d been there less than 36 hours. Knowing that her visitors would be there during lunch she thought about the spices available in Jessica\u2019s larder and other kitchen resources. First she started a carafe of tea by running water thru the coffeemaker loaded with herbal tea bags. Then she hastily grabbed a package of creamed cheese and a can of tuna, mixing he contents with salsa, parsley and red onion. This created a spicy tuna spread that she put onto a set of three sandwiches, covering them with wax paper and putting them into the refrigerator. By this time the tea had percolated through and could be cooled off with ice cubes and mixed with sweetener.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than ten minutes after she was finished her classmates arrived. She invited them to be seated while she poured them some tea. Allison and Liz were surprised at the hospitality, but it gave them the opening they wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you\u2019re into food like Madison \u2013 but at least its not soda\u201d said Alison, \u201dthis is an herbal tea isn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Jessica has several flavors. I sweetened it with Truvia because we apparently don\u2019t stock real sugar,\u201d replied Sandra<br>\r\n\u201cIts probably better for us anyway\u201d commented Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re comfortable with this focus on food?\u201d queried Alison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know its that unusual \u2013 classes haven\u2019t begun and I think the school is promoting camaraderie by giving us breakfasts. I know I enjoyed mine!\u201d commented Sandra.  \u201cBut I thought you came over to discuss the program for Saturday, not the dining hall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, there is that,\u201d answered Liz, \u201cbut you do have to admit that Cassie and Madison are beyond plump and Kelli is getting there. Your roomie Jessica is also big I understand. It\u2019s a trend and I think we\u2019re a little nervous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra sighed. She\u2019d noted the same thing but felt it was their personal business, not hers. She was in control of her own life and frankly was tired of hearing about weight so much all through high school. To see others comfortable with their size was refreshing. .  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to vent her mind, something she\u2019d been reluctant to do while under her parent\u2019s roof.  \u201cIsn\u2019t that really their own affair? They all have boy friends, are happy and if some like us are average then others must be above or below. Personally I\u2019ve seen more people our age in the hospital from anorexia than obesity. If I had to choose between weighing fifty pounds more or fifty pounds less which would be healthier?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison and Liz looked at each other. This was indeed a different viewpont they hadn\u2019t thought of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra continued, \u201cMark and Jim as well as Mike and Tim seem to be a group that like, or at least don\u2019t mind, heavier girl friends. And since they already have them we\u2019re not affected. They\u2019re not involved with us. The question is, who do we want? Certainly not jocks like that character this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Alison concurred. \u201cby the way, I was meaning to tell you about that. he came on to me last week and I found out his name. Its Bud Morris and he works part time at Sculyer\u2019s Garage, in case you want to tell security.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that is important,\u201d acknowledged Sandra standing up. \u201cLet me write that down so I don\u2019t forget.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz went back to the original subject. \u201cYou weren\u2019t there last week, so you don\u2019t know. But like Mark helping you this morning, there was just so much food. You need to be aware they\u2019ll push it o you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm, as I recall I filled up my own plate twice \u2013 Mark just carried the drinks. Look, thanks for the heads up, but I think we can all make our own choices.  For instance, once we have figured out the entertainment for Saturday I already have sandwiches made for lunch and there\u2019s a box of frozen eclairs we can thaw in the microwave \u2013 just so you know\u201d Sandra informed her guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison and Liz looked at each other. Obviously Sandra didn\u2019t share their concerns.  Sandra changed the subject to Alison\u2019s interest in Karaoke and informed Liz of what she could do to help with some magic tricks. By 12:30 Liz asked \u201care we ready for those sandwiches?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison nodded with some hesitancy and Sandra went to the refrigerator freezer, emptying a package of cream filled \u00e9clairs onto a tray which she popped into the microwave for thirty seconds. Then she unwrapped the sandwiches and put them on plates to which she added two eclairs apiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison winced. \u201cI bet there\u2019s 700 calories just on that plate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe, but if you want to give me one of your eclairs I\u2019ll take it. They\u2019re usually delicious. Bit be sure and try one before you decide,\u201d answered Sandra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison took a bite, \u201cOK, I agree, but we can\u2019t be doing this all the time. I know that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz said nothing. She was already finished with her sandwich, which wasn\u2019t that big. She was privately wishing there was another to be had and was happly for the eclairs on her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after 1:00 her new friends left and Sandra called security.  Then she glanced down and noticed her protruding food belly.  Thinking little of it because she knew it would flatten in a few hours she cracked open a large bag of potato chips and went to the living room where half the tea pitcher remained. After an hour of watching tv the bag was empty. She got rid of the bag into the trash and went to her room for a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra awoke shortly after six, her light lunch fully digested. She was getting hungry and she knew exactly what she was going to do. There were several red potatoes which she knew could be boiled with their skins on, then mashed with Romano cheese, butter and garlic. She planned to make a large batch, saving  some for the next day.  While getting the potatoes ready she\u2019d let a chicken pot pie cook in the oven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra enjoyed her supper \u2013not knowing or caring that the pot pie was worth 1400 calories, the potatoes 300 or the large bowl of ice cream for dessert another 500. Added to the 1300 calorie lunch and snack plus her 1400 calorie breakfast  she had managed to pack away nearly 5000 calories in a single day. None of this was known or mattered to her. She was full and went to bed content.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sandra slept soundly, awaking shortly after 7:00. Knowing that the dining hall opened at 8:00 she quickly got ready because she wanted to avoid encountering Bud Ramsey. She\u2019d called security and passed along Alison\u2019s information the prior afternoon, but her revelation only made her aware that this guy was hanging out around the campus. It gave her the creeps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arrived around quarter past eight. The place appeared deserted because this wasn\u2019t a class day and obviously a lot of people were sleeping in. Se decided to build an omelet from scratch, something she hadn\u2019t even considered the day before, and complemented it with two pancakes, burger patty and a large muffin. It was to her mind a hearty but not excessive breakfast, although with syrup and jelly it was probably 900 caloris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe settled in and was enjoying her breakfast and thoughts when a voice said to her, \u201chello, mind if I share this table with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra looked up to see a young male student with his own tray of pancakes and eggs plus a biscuit. He wore glasses and she thought he iht be a bit of a geek. Still, she appreciated the attention and motioned him to be seated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Roger and I\u2019m new here. You?\u201d he inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSandra, and I\u2019m also a freshman. Where are you from originally?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOlathe, southwest of Kansas  City.  The name is Shawnee Indian for beautiful,\u201d he stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm, must date from the pioneer days,\u201d Sandra observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c1857 \u2013 before the civil  war. It was right on the Santa Fe trail and I went to a Junior High School named after it. The town was half-leveled during the civil war after being occupied by Quantril\u2019s raiders. . But then the railroad came in about 1867 and we\u2019ve been stable ever since.\u201d He volunteered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you enjoy history,\u201d Sandra noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, kinda. But I\u2019m going for a business major because schools today won\u2019t let teachers share real history. My mom\u2019s in education and sick of having to \u201cteach to the test\u201d rather than sharing what she really knows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean,\u201d asked Sandra as she finished the last of her omelet and began attacking her pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvery class has to take a test and make a certain score or the whole school loses money from the government. The teachers are told to just teach the stuff needed for kids to pass the test because there\u2019s not time for anything more. That too regimented for me so I\u2019m not going into teaching.\u201d Roger declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI get you,\u201d Sandra agreed. \u201cBut now you need to ask me some questions so you can eat,. I\u2019m half finished and you haven\u2019t had a bite\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoops \u2013 OK, I guess I got into pedantic mode.\u201d He acknowledged. \u201cSo, what about the town you came from?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a cornfed girl from South Dakota. You\u2019ve probably heard of the corn palace in Mitchell? Well I was born in a small town nearby that\u2019s nearly gone now and we moved to the \u201cbig city\u201d when I was two. The best restaurants in town are at the Casino except for one in the old railway depot..  They even have operating  model trains there \u2013 its really retro, Of course we have Perkins and the fast food chains, but they don\u2019t really count - maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m actually enjoying the free farm-size breakfasts here. As for history, we\u2019ve been there since the 1880\u2019s but we still only have around 16,000 people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger had indeed taken note of Sandra\u2019s generous breakfast, and now she\u2019d confirmed what he suspected. She wasn\u2019t one who worried and fretted about her weight like some in Olathe. But more importantly she could talk in multiple sentences without leaving it up to him to carry the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm, I don\u2019t mean to be too forward or anything,\u201d he said, \u201cbut could I have your full name and campus phone number. Full disclosure: yes, I\u2019d like to find out what restaurants there are around here and take you to one. It sounds like you need to escape from the culinary limitations of Mitchell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d Sandra exclaimed, and supplied him with the information that he  immediately typed into his cell phone. She was sure that anything would exceed the level of the local Perkins restaurant in Mitchell. She had seen personally what generated a thumbs down review on Yelp, \u201ccold food, rude service, and moldy carpet,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger nodded before she continued \u201cNow, full disclosure from me. We\u2019re having a party this Saturday night and are looking for freshman guys to come and mingle. Want to be included?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell uh, sure,\u201d Roger replied. He was pleasantly surprised at her assertiveness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd another thing, there has been some stuff going on and I wouldn\u2019t mind an escort back to my room,\u201d Sandra told her new fiend about Bud Ramsey and Roger instantly agreed.  As Sandra stood he couldn\u2019t help but note as she subconsciously adjusted her snug waistband. Her food belly bulge from the large breakfast was showing, although she knew that as always after a good sized meal it would disappear after a few hours.  Still Roger couldn\u2019t  help but quietly notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way back across the commons they encountered a gardener who was thinning out some yellow daffodils which were likely headed for the compost heap. Sandra asked if she could have a half dozen and was given permission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese I can put in the vase on our coffee table for my roommate when she comes in later today,\u201d she remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra was back to her room before 10:00 and began preparing for Jessica\u2019s arrival. Mark had indicated this would probably be in the afternoon after he picked her up at the Wichita airport and took her o lunch.  She did her laundry and pepared a butterscotch pudding for dessert that  evening \u2013 something she hoped Jessica would lke.  She was nervous, never having had a roommate before, and wanted to make a good impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after 12:00 the phone call came. It was the first time she\u2019d actually spoken to Jessica, who was very apologetic about having not been able to be there when Sandra arrived.  She noted that Mark didn\u2019t have her new room phone number or Sandra\u2019s cell. Then she asked if it would be OK for her and Mark to get caught up over lunch, then make the 45 minute trip from Wichita. Sandra assented, figuring that it meant she probably had till at least 3:00.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra smiled with anticipated. The late afternoon arrival meant she had the time she needed to utilize the left over mashed potatoes from the prior evening. Grabbing cheese, mustard, garlic, onion flakes and the mashed potatoes she combined them in a skillet to make four potato pancakes which she then topped with two fried eggs. This she combined with the remaining broccoli from earlier in the week for a succulent lunch topped off with a home made ice cream sundae. Total calories probably 1300 but she wasn\u2019t counting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround 1:30 she tidied up the kitchen ad at 2:00 flipped on the television with a snack of four oatmeal cookies and tea at hand. At the half hour break she replenished the cookies and tea. Then she went to her room and laid down, awaiting her roommates arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica didn\u2019t arrive until around 4:00 but Sandra had her bedroom door open and heard her. She emerged to find Mark and a sizeable brunette with  small overnight bag. It was apparent she\u2019d left in a hurry and traveled light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome home Jessica,\u201d she exclaimed, glancing at the vase of daffodils.  \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind my adding the flowers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d replied the bulging Sophomore. She looked to be around 180, over fifty pounds larger than Sandra. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest tough, it was quite a stressful trip and I\u2019d like to crash. But this evening we can really get to know more about one another.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing \u2013 I\u2019ve had a nap and can surf the Internet.  By the way, supper will be easy. I only used one of the casseroles you left and I made us butterscotch pudding for dessert, so we\u2019re set for supper\u201d. Sandra informed Jessica as Mark stood listening. He detected no criticism in Sandra of his girl friend\u2019s proportions..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cService beyond he call of duty,\u201d replied Jessica. But can we plan on it around 7:30 or so? Mark and I just had a nice lunch and I doubt I\u2019ll be hungry until then\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d replied Sandra. \u201cI\u2019ll let the casserole start thawing but won\u2019t do anything else until you wake up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica went to her room. Sandra did as she had promised with the casserole. She also started another carafe of tea, then took the last of the old one with the remaining half bag of cookies to her own room to be comfort food while online.  Her calorie count for the day was already 3400 \u2013 with supper it would approach 5000. But the corn fed country gal wasn\u2019t counting. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica\u2019s summer had given her assurance that her family was OK with her new size and she was also sure of Mark. As she lay in her bed resting it appeared that her new roommate Sandra wasn\u2019t a calories counter \u2013 Mark had implied as much at lunch. But what about Kelli? She was bigger than Jessica and had tempered some of her remarks, but was she happy with her new circumstances. Or was she still denying to herself that she was fat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica didn\u2019t really know why she should care \u2013 Kelli was Ginger\u2019s buddy, not hers. But she knew Ginger and Michael had added forty pounds to the former coquette\u2019s once lithe frame and that during the summer she\u2019d packed on what Mark estimated to be twenty more. That she knew now made her at least five pounds heavier than Jessica and within 30 pounds of Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would learn soon enough that there was at least some acknowledgement of reality. Although Kelli still shunned the scale she now knew she was wearing size 16 clothes without any garment swapping shenanigans by Michael \u2013 which fortunately she wasn\u2019t aware of.   Like Jessica, Madison and Cassi she had more pressing concerns, namely breaking in a new roommate, who hadn\u2019t arrived yet, and she didn\u2019t have Ginger to ean on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael had helped her stock her new kitchen, including a number of comfort foods \u2013 including spreads for bagels, which Kelli enjoyed. With a topping such as almond butter or creamed cheese each was worth 400 calories, and Kelli could consume 2-3 in an evening.  Kelli wasn\u2019t a cook so of course she and Michael had fast food in addition to the dining hall breakfasts. Whatever habits had caused her to gain sixty pounds were continuing unabated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie and Madison, however, seemed to have stabilized at 230 and 205 respectively.  They knew they couldn\u2019t allow themselves to go on gaining forever. Their roommates, Liz and Alison, saw their sophomore roommates enjoying food but not in excessive amounts.  In fact, the newcomers were  out eating the larger duo at times, something which at times in her first week gave concern to Alison. Liz had no such worries \u2013 she was more interested in meeting guys and didn\u2019t seem to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica called Kelli to let her know she was back and they chatted for a few minutes. They discussed the new arrivals and speculated on who might be assigned to Kelli. Then, noting the tine, she went to the kitchen to find that Sandra already had the table set and a casserole waiting in the oven while a package of mixed vegetables was cooking in the microwave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything I can do to help?\u201d asked Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm, maybe add some ice and Truvia to the tea and put in a pitcher,\u201d suggested Sandra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Wiil do.  By the way, which casserole are we having\u201d asked Jessica<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Its not the tuna one and has thin noodles, so maybe that will tell you,\u2019 replied Sandra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTurkey tetraziini is the official name,\u201d answered Jessica. \u201cIt has a bunch of stuff \u2013 chicken broth, mushrooms, spaghetti, an egg yolk, shredded parmesean cheese and even cooking sherry. I think you\u2019ll like it as long as you don\u2019t mind a few calories.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra laughed. \u201cThis has been blow-any-concept-of-a=diet week already \u2013sort of a celebration I guess. Why stop now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, look at me and the others. We blew way past the freshman 15 and at first I think we thought we were immune \u2013 especially Kelli. To this day I don\u2019t think she admits she\u2019s gotten fat.\u201d pointed out Jessica<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra hoisted the casserole out of the oven. \u201cwell, one week or one casserole \u2013 even with the pudding on top of it, isn\u2019t going to make tht much difference. But within reason I\u2019m frankly tired of all the fuss over weight. That\u2019s what I told Alison and Liz yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlison and Liz?\u201d asked Jessica. \u201cOh, the ones saying with Madison and Cassi.  Mark mentioned them but we haven\u2019t met.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey were concerned about me packing away big breakfasts, but that\u2019s what we always do in the country. Although I admit I\u2019ve pushed the limits this week a bit. But I think that since I\u2019m allegedly an adult now I can decide my own acceptable weight \u2013 not the government, doctors, peers or anyone else. So I hope you don\u2019t mind if I occasionally seem to be indulging.\u201d Sandra declared<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis declaration was the precise opposite of what Jessica had been fearing. Rather than criticizing the weight of others Sandra was trying to deflect potential critiques of her own. She relaxed and told Sandra, \u201cI\u2019m sure glad to hear that and agree with you entirely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the girls dived into the casserole, each having about a thousand calories worth \u2013 plus the butterscotch pudding for another 500 apiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, when it comes o food I think \u2018m an Epicurean because I enjoy it for the pleasure of what it tastes like, not just to survive on,\u201d remarked Sandra, \u201cAnd this casserole is an epicurean masterpiece.  Where did you get the recipe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI adapted it from one online, \u201c replied Jessica. \u201cMark likes casseroles and other foods \u2013 so maybe I \u2018m a culinary Epicurean at heart as well. Although in philosophy class you\u2019ll learn that he was also a pagan philosopher who opposed the stoics and Plato.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK \u2013 I\u2019ll handle that when I get to it,\u201d acknowledged Sandra, \u201cbut at leat we agree to enjoy and not worry when dining.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d said Jessica, hoisting her glass of tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere in the building Cassi and Madison, with culinary help from Jim, were introducing Alison and Liz to another version of epicurean pleasure. It was a shepard\u2019s pie made up of leftover meat loaf, carrots, corn, mushrooms, gravy and cheddar cheese and stretched for five with mashed potatoes and side dishes of peas and green beans with French bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is almost like Thanksgiving,\u201d commented Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is actually a good way to use up Thanksgiving leftovers,\u201d acknowledged Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcept in this case we have a complete cherry pie and ice cream to share, not leftovers,\u201d noted Tim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz seemed willing enough to go long, but Alison, although thoroughly enjoying the meal, couldn\u2019t help but wonder if eating like this wasn\u2019t why Cassie and Madison were so big.  What neither girl seemed to note, however, was that both Cassie and Madison were taking time to savor and masticate every bite, while the two newcomers were eating faster and consuming more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Kelli, who wasn\u2019t skilled enough in the kitchen to make much of anything for Michael, she\u2019d called him up and they\u2019d had supper in the dining hall \u2013 pizza and chicken with ice cream for dessert.. Since she\u2019d already had her two bagels for the evening she felt totally full. But she wanted to have her roommate arrive and was getting antsy. As for Michael he was wondering if any of the others could tutor Kelli in cooking.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kelsey arrived to campus later than the rest of her peers. She had wanted to spend a bit more time at home, plus she felt lukewarm about coming to Powers to begin with. Kelsey was always decent at soccer in high school, not good enough for a scholarship, but always decent. However, she had been emailing the coach of the soccer team to see if she could walk-on. He was the type of coach who liked getting okay players who were gym rats, to push the scholarship players in the gym, so he was on board. Kelsey and him had a good rapport, and she was all set to go, until he abruptly took another job that summer, leaving her at the mercy of a new coach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the few days in between knowing her soccer fate, Kelsey kept up with her strict training regimen. She ran a over 3 miles per day, and had a light weights routine going, and it showed. Her legs were strong and hard from all the running that she had done, and she had a washboard stomach, without an ounce of fat. She didn't have much of a rack, and if she was ever going to gain weight, it would have been bottom heavy. She had light brown hair, that was often up in a pony tail. Yet, seeing Kelsey, one would most likely doubt that could happen, in her current athletic appearance. She was the girl who everyone saw in athletic clothes all the time, and she wore her trainers everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Kelsey got an email--from the new soccer coach that Powers hired. The news was not good. \"My coaching philosophy is quite different, and I prefer to focus on a small core of players. I wish you the best of luck in future endeavors, although I am afraid they will not be with Powers Soccer.\" Kelsey was crushed. \"Ugh, the only reason why I choose this freaking school was to walk onto the soccer team. UGH.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey had a decision to make, would she take a year off and go somewhere else? That seemed kind of drastic to her, she didn't want to become a non-traditional student. It was too late for her to change schools and participate in the fall, no admissions would let her in on this timeline, even with help from other coaches. Kelsey frantically tried to find something that could work, and sent game footage to a wide variety of coaches. Finally, she heard back from one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like your intensity on the field, we can't do anything this year because my team is full, but if you file transfer paperwork after one year, and keep your skillset, I may have some room on my team,\" Coach Shella Stevensen of a rival squad wrote. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey was overjoyed. She now had no reservation going to Powers, she would just workout like she always had, and she would be fine, get to play soccer, and all would be right in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is probably necessary to note at this point, that Kelsey was not only a fitness freak, but a fatophobe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had requested an athletic roommate, and she ended up with Kelly. In a cruel twist, Kelly had checked that she was athletic--over a year ago when she first enrolled as a freshman. That was a long time, and many pounds ago, and Kelsey was about to end up in a bad situation that she would have no problem gossiping about to Liz and Allison. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was Friday morning, almost 9:00. Since classes woudn\u2019t start until Moday Kelli was still sleeping in when the phone rang. An unfamiliar voice introduced herself as Kelsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, hello Kelsey,\u201d Kelli said yawning groggily. \u201cDo I know you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot personally yet, but I\u2019m told we\u2019re going to be roommates this year.\u201d replied the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the fog in her brain began clearing and Kelli realized who she was talking to \u2013 her missing roommate. She immediately began to consider the state of the dorm site, her state of dress, how she was going to make a good impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah, Kelsey. Where are you? Are you coming up?\u201d Kelli asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, not immediately. I haven\u2019t even taken off from the airport. But I\u2019ll probably be there in mid-afternoon. I just thought I should call ahead rather than just showing up. Frankly I don\u2019t even know how to get there once we\u2019ve landed. There have been issues about whether I\u2019d even be coming, but those have been taken care of. Anyway, the plane\u2019s scheduled to come in  at 2:30 so you can figure it from there,\u201d Kelsey gushed in a torrent of information. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, thanks. I guess I should get your number and see if I can arrange some way of having you met at the airport and some other things. Is that OK?\u201d inquired Kelli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d said Kelsey, \u201cI\u2019ll be available for about a hour before boarding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelli jotted down the number and called Michael, who agreed to drive to Wichita and pick Kelsey up. He also pledged to make himself recognizable by wearing his burnt gold cardigan so that he would look totally out of place in the airport. Then she called Jim and asked if he\u2019d prepare a supper if she paid for the ingredients.  She knew he was already committed to the party the next day  but after a brief discussion he agreed to help out.  Then she called Kelsey and told her what she\u2019d arranged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey was favorably impressed by her new roommate\u2019s hospitality. She obviously wasn\u2019t a disorganized ditz and had friends. Those were good signs that being stuck at a small school wasn\u2019t going to be all that bad despite her own frustrations..  She reminded herself that Kelli wasn\u2019t to blame for her own situation, so she just needed to get along and play nice. Her future depended on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey got onto the plane and when she found her seat she rolled her eyeballs. Her focus was her athletic career and as a result she was also a fatophobe. She found herself sharing a three seat section with a large woman passenger who easily weighed double Kelsey\u2019s 115 pounds. She was sure her seatmate would need a seatbelt extender and Kelsey worried that she might wind up being squashed if a third passenger showed up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately serious nothing happened but her seatmate did indeed get an extender.  Kelsey marveled at how unabashedly she requested it. The woman reminded Kelsey of her biggest fear \u2013 becoming obese.  She couldn\u2019t help but ask herself \u201c<i>has this woman no sense of shame over how immense she is?\u201d</i><br>\r\nThe trip went uneventfully, her seatmate occupied with a book and aping while Kelsey kept to herself. After they landed she was one of the first passengers off the plane. She went to the baggage turnstile where she observed a 20 year old man dressed in slacks and a cardigan. He was waiting for baggage but obviously hadn\u2019t been a passenger. From Kelli\u2019s call she knew this was probably Michael. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello,\u201d she said walking up to him. \u201cAre you from the college?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and looked at the slender but apparently friendly source of the voice. \u201cIf your name is Kelsey, then yes. I\u2019m Michael. How much baggage am I looking for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust two suitcases,\u201d replied Kelsey, who had her carryon including her laptop over her shoulder. \u201cthey\u2019re marked with bright yellow tape with red letters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u201dOK. You can put your carry on that cart over there,\u201d he said gesturing \u201cand I\u2019ll get the others as soon as they come off the line.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin twenty minutes they were on the way home and Kelsey let Michael know how much she appreciated his efforts \u2013 while also relating her opinion of her fellow passenger. Michael knew that his girl friend Kelli wasn\u2019t nearly so large but was put on alert by the monologue. Obviously there was a potential for trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had seen Kelli\u2019s breakfast that morning. Huevos Rancheros with two eggs, rice, beans and a large muffin on the side. All told it was a typical 700 plus calories breakfast for the indulgent Sophomore, who still insisted she was at worst moderately plump. Kelsey, Michael realized, would likely have another opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the apartment Kelli had vacuumed the dorm suite and sprayed orchid scented air freshener in Kelsey\u2019s bedroom. Jim meanwhile was preparing  an appetizing cinnamon apple salad to go with a main course of diced chicken a la king in a succulent sauce over biscuits accompanied by cajon grilled yams and sweet peas. For dessert he was using a store-bought cherry pie with ice cream<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael drove along, making small talk and keeping his reservations to himself, but bracing for what he feared could be trouble. Finally they arrived on campus and he called Kelli to let her and Jim know they were on the way up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelli had the door open and Michael wheeled the bags into the apartment heading for Kelsey\u2019s  bedroom. As he did Kelli emerged from the other bedroom door. and Kelsey nearly lost it. Although not as humongous as he woman on the plane she saw Kelli as fat!  Before her reaction became obvious Michael stopped, went over to Kelli and gave her a warm hug and kiss,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for taking care of my new roomie,\u201d Kelli exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem, darling,\u201d replied Michael, making the relationship clear to Kelsey. Any remarks directed at his chubby girl friend would have consequences. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Jim emerged from the kitchen. He announced \u201cwelcome from the culinary department as well. I\u2019m Jim and supper will be ready in about 45 minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey found herself fighting for control as the delicious aroma from the kitchen flooded the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we need to get these bags into the bedroom and let you unpack,\u201d volunteered Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I guess you\u2019re right. Sorry, Kelly. I\u2019ll try to be ready on time,\u201d replied Kelsey, struggling to keep her real feelings hidden. She succeeded. Kelli, savoring the aroma from the kitchen, was oblivious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No one pressed Kelsey on her portions and she loaded her plate with the salad, praising it as outstanding. , She also politely partook of the main entr\u00e9e and side dishes, albeit in portions about one-half those of Kelli. Michael and Jim.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the course of the meal Kelsey was invited to the party the next evening and she accepted, hoping to meet guys who weren\u2019t already spoken for. She was also invited to breakfast, which since it was free she also decided to accept. Anything to fit in and get along; that was what she knew was critical for her own future. But when it came time for dessert she demurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Jim and Michael left Kelsey told Kelli she needed to finish unpacking and Kelli smiled, telling her she understood. After Kelsey retired to her room Kelli took Kelsey\u2019s rejected dessert along with two cinnamon raisin bagels spread with cream cheese and a large soda to her own bedroom for comfort food; such grazing had become her common habit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning it was Kelli who awakened Kelsey, telling her that Michael had called to inform her that some big news was going to be shared at breakfast. They needed to be ready in thirty minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat could be so important?\u201d queried Kelsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know about this but we had a creep stalking the campus pestering co-eds. He\u2019s been identified and picked up. Now apparently the police want Sandra and Mark to witness a police line-up. I don\u2019t know why -  I guess we\u2019ll get the full story there,\u201d gushed Kelli. \u201cI have to get dressed, you too, so no time to talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey couldn\u2019t help but notice the bulging rolls of Kelli\u2019s torso, broad hips and thighs without an inch of light between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cNo doubt about it,.\"</i> Kelsey thought. <i> \u201cShe\u2019s a nice enough person but she\u2019s a hippo.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the dining hall Kelli confirmed Kelsey\u2019s opinion by loading up her tray with a burrito, two pancakes and some scrambled eggs \u2013 probably an 800 calories breakfast. Kelsey winced and exclaimed \u201cisn\u2019t that a lot? Aren\u2019t you concerned about your weight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I know I\u2019ve gotten a bit thick \u2013 especially compared to when I came last year. But Michael likes meat on the bones and I\u2019ve come to enjoy being a big eater. It\u2019s only been a few pounds \u2013 not like I\u2019m really fat,\u201d chirped Kelli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey was non-plussed. She took some melon slices, yogurt, and a piece of toast.  When they got to the table with Mark, Jessica, Michael, Robert and Sandra she was astonished  \u2013 the plates of everyone else were just as full as Kelli\u2019s. Jessica was just as big as Kellli, though Sandra appeared to be average. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cWhat</i>,\u201d she wondered \u201c<i>have I gotten myself into?\u201d</i><br>\r\nMark confirmed Kelli\u2019s summary. It seemed Bud Ramsey was now a suspect in a disappearance case, but to confirm his modus operandi the police needed he and Sandra to pick Ramsey out of a line up. Because of the weekend this would happen on Monday after classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing like a little excitement to kick off the school year,\" remarked Sandra, as she finished her plate. Kelsey had noticed she seemed to be eating somewhat faster than the others, not really chewing her food or talking as much .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert noticed the empty plate as well, but first had a question. Heasked  \u201ccan I go with you on Monday? I\u2019d like to be there for moral support \u2013 maybe go somewhere afterwards.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d said Sandra, hesitantly glancing at the buffet,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d  exclaimed Robert. Then. picking up on the hint. \u201cBy the way, is there something I can get you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve already had eggs and corned beef hash. But  I was thinking about some of those jelly-filled Danishes with milk and maybe two of the raisin oatmeal cookies,\u201d Sandra replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing right up,\u201d Robert answered as he rose and headed for the buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey could barely believe what she had just seen \u2013 the smallest girl at the table besides herself had just added seconds to an already large breakfast. And what Sandra had come to call her \u201cfood belly\u201d was showing as usual. This of course didn\u2019t matter to her since she knew it always flattened out after a few hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast Michael and Kelli informed Kelsey that they had things planned but would be back for the party.  Kelli invited her new roommate to help herself to anything in the kitchen<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey smiled politely with false courtesy, thinking \u201c<i>like I need to be stuffing my face and getting huge like you! Since you don\u2019t cook maybe I need to be the one who buys the groceries and prepares the meals. It may be the only way I can avoid becoming a fatty here!\u201d </i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After awhile in her room Kelsey felt cooped up. She decided to take a walk around the campus to orient herself. When she got onto the elevator she encountered two other teen girls wearing halter tops and shorts. The difference was in their physiques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello,\u201d the first one greeted her. \u201cMy name is Allison and I\u2019m a Freshman. Are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, my name is Kelsey\u201d admitted Kelsey as she took in Alison\u2019s obviously athletic body, toned from hours of tennis playing and exercise. She appeared to be pretty much in condition, which was better than could be said for her friend, who appeared to be thin and wan in her upper body but fuller in her bottom and lower gut... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMine\u2019s Liz,\u201d said the shorter of the two. \u201cwe\u2019re going over to the gym to work out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a gym open here?\u201d exclaimed Kelsey. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t anyone tell me these things?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all in the student handbook, \u201c replied Allison. \u201cYou probably just haven\u2019t had time to read it yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s true. I just got here late in the afternoon. Maybe I\u2019ll come join you,\u201d she said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alison and Liz strolled away Kelsey analyzed their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison was long boned and slender like herself. For all Kelsey knew she could be into track or even on the soccer team. Whatever the case she wasn\u2019t carrying any excess flesh and that impressed Kelsey, \u201cI need to get to know this girl better \u2013 she could be my savior amidst all these fatties.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz in her vierw was quire another story. Althogh ot overweight she wasn\u2019t lean either and her shorter frame carried tell tale clues that Kelsey picked upon. She of course did not know that Liz had been rid of her samall pot belly for over a year. However she did hsve a residual FUPA ( fat upper pelvic area) which had an effect she shared wityh others who in similar post-weight loss straits.<br>\r\nLike many such persons she wasn\u2019t hat conscious of the FUPA\u2019s presence but it still had a tendency to cause her pants, whether shorts or jeans, to ride higher than normal.  Kelsey had seen this common phenomena before and it told her a world about Liz \u2013 she was a fatty in remission who could easily gain back whatever she had lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz understood rthe risk as well, although her level of concern differed from that of Kelsey.. At her low point  in high school she\u2019d been down to a size six and was only impressing her mother, who she once told that she rather craved having pizzas and burgers even if meant being a size 12. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother time, feeling rebellious, she had threatened to observer National Donut Week \u2013 a fiction of her own imagination. Currently after the summer she was a snug size 8 and willing to exercise to keep in shape. But being lodged with a bodacious brunette behemoth like Cassi wasn\u2019t the end of her world at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later Kelsey arrived at the gym dressed in her workout outfit. Liz appeared to have been working hard but was now wiped out, her bulging FUPA lower belly bearing evidence . Alison, however, was sweaty but still ready to go. She asked Kelsey if she wanted to jog around the track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey pondered. She knew she was fresh and  in good condition. She didn\u2019t want to embarrass Alison. She therefore agreed to pace her for half the distance before cutting loose, remarking \u201cyou can try to catch me but I\u2019m going to push myself so don\u2019t feel bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison assured her she understood and would just maintain her own pace. At the half way mark Kelsey cut loose and beat Alison by many furlongs. A totally winded Alison staggered in 30 seconds later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get something cool for lunch.\u201d Alison suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m ready for that.\u201d agreed Liz and Kelsey decided to join in. To her surprise both Alison and Liz had lo cal salads, although Liz drenched her\u2019s  in ranch dressing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis should tide us over till the party\u201d remarked Alison.yeah, given the guest list there will e plenty of fod, ich is why I\u2019m skiming now. I hea ?Jim\u2019squie the chef\u201d Liz shared<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I may be coming to the same party!\u201d interjected Kelsey.  My roommate\u2019s boyfriend Mike  and a guy named Jim talked me into coming to one tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\u201d chirped Liz. That would be Michael and Kelli with Jim and Madison \u2013 that Alison\u2019s roommate. I guess you haven\u2019t met her. Cassie, my roommate, is going be there with Tim as well along with Jessica and Mark.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ve met Kelli and Jessica \u2013 in fact we were also at breakfast along with Mark, Robert and I think her name is Sandra. They\u2019re all nice. But where I\u2019m from those two would have a hard time getting guys,\u201d observed Kelsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot around here apparently,\u201d laughed Liz, glancing at Alison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean,\u201d queried Kelsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you think Kelli and Jessica are big you should see our roommates \u2013 equally as nice, both with boyfriends, but definitely over 200. You can make book on that.  Having once been larger myself it makes me less scared are of regaining if it happens,\u201d observed Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s all up to you, \u201c agreed Alison. \u201cFor me, I want to be able to run and play tennis so getting that big is something I intend to avoid. But some are born to be bigger or just enjoy eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey\u2019s mind was swimming. The girls at this school, even those not themselves fat, had a totally different perspective than hers. Fat was ugly. Fat was bad. Fat was just plain wrong. Or was it really her that was wrong?  Liz was right. Kelli and Jessica were ice enough people and had guys. So did Sandra apparently, even though she had been scarfing and inhaling her food down her pie hole like there was no tomorrow.  Kelsey was feeling totally confused as the three co-eds went back to their dormitory.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When they got to their dorm Kelsey went immediately to her suite. This left Alison was free to chat with Liz<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you weren\u2019t kidding when you told me you were just a reformed fat girl in a thinner body?\u201d Alison remarked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz looked at her new friend and decided she could be open even though she was an athlete. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m actually 20 years old now \u2013 I just don\u2019t look it. I graduated two years ago and was a little chubby then, probably 145-150. Then  I got a job in retail and wasn\u2019t too active. I had money of my own and bought a lot of pizza and ice cream because I enjoyed them. Also I think I was probably able to start eating bigger breakfasts since I had my own wheels and wasn\u2019t having to walk a quarter mile to the school bus stop on a schedule every day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, plus walking back in the evening. You lost exercise time both ways,\u201d observed Alison, \u201cbut what do you mean bigger breakfasts?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInstead of a bowl of cheerios or a couple of pop tarts I could now have pancakes and eggs or French toast. And since I was making them I usually had around three, not just one. They tasted better than the other stuff, and since I was making them myself no one was monitoring me. Well. after about four months I noticed my clothes getting tighter . I knew I must be gaining a few pounds, but I didn\u2019t care. I just bought  looser ones. That was fine for everyday wear but I had a muffin top when I stuffed myself into my old jeans. I didn\u2019t think it was all that bad and just kept on eating whatever I felt like.\u201d Liz continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd of course gained still more,\u201d prompted Alison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d replied Liz. \u201cI\u2019d have what was now for me a normal breakfast at home plus a pastry and coffee before work, then a good size lunch and sometimes something on the way home.  Next thing I knew I was over 170 with a real muffin top. I could barely wiggle into my old jeans and when I did  I could grab my belly fat and make it jiggle.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that must have upset you,\u201d exclaimed Alison, her eyes widening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d think so, but actually it was arousing and just made me want to eat more,\u201d recalled Liz wistfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d replied Alison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, continued Liz. \u201cI wasn\u2019t upset about my belly or appetite because I still had friends and dates and wasn\u2019t going out in public that way. I didn\u2019t think I looked bad as long as I dressed in clothes big enough to fit, It was stuffing myself into the old ones just for the thrill of it that got me in trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d said Alison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz sighed and rolled her eyeballs. \u201cMy step mom saw me one day fooling around, freaked out and told me I needed to go on a diet and loose weight. She even took notice of my love handles. I told her I was over 18 and had the right to eat and weigh whatever I wanted to. That shut her up for awhile but I knew she was ticked off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you cut back to make her happy\u201d? Alison concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo \u2013 that might have been wiser.\u201d Liz replied. \u201cInstead I bought stuff that I could snack on at night and made it obvious to her what I was doing. She told my Dad I looked like a stuffed sausage. That was just her opinion, not mine. My belly wasn\u2019t past my bust line or anything \u2013 I was just kinda stocky. But she and he then put me on a diet which I had to follow or get out of the house.  It took over a year to lose 45 pounds and my lower belly is still there.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it bother you?\u201d Alison inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy lower belly or that I got fat in the first place?\u201d Liz replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess both,\u201c Alison answered.:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz took a deep breath as tho choosing her words carefully. \u201cI like eating and didn\u2019t mind my weight, but I know it is not the normal thing to enjoy being so big. So I\u2019m trying to get with the program and conform, but  I wish society wasn\u2019t so hung up and I\u2019d put up with the pounds just to be able to eat what I want. The real problem is that guys stopped dating me because I wouldn't let them buy me food to eat or drink. I had to make the weight loss goals and they didn't care for that. \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Madison and Callie, not to mention Jessica and Kelli, seem to be defying the odds.\u201d noted Alison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen that,\" agreed Liz. \u201cBut they don\u2019t have my dad and step mom to contend with. And they\u2019ve got guys who support them. I\u2019m at a double disadvantage.  If I had my way I\u2019d be having a banana split and root beer about now!  That salad was good, but it isn\u2019t enough for my appetite. I want an entr\u00e9e and dessert to go with it. But I know I don\u2019t dare \u2013eating like that would have me back it fatsville in a year! Its going to be tough living with Callie because inside I\u2019m another her! Its only been a week and I\u2019m already envious of her freedom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison shook her head. She wasn\u2019t envious of or upset at Madison, but obviously Liz had real issues within herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls went to their rooms to await the party. After about a half hour of fuming Liz got up with some emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cScrew it</i>,\u201d she thought. \u201c<i>I\u2019m not going to pig out but I\u2019m not going to starve myself either.\u201d</i><br>\r\nWith that she went to the kitchen and made two toasted cheese sandwiches which she devoured with a glass of chocolate flavored milk. This appeased Liz\u2019s appetite enough that she was able to dispose of the evidence and then get a nap. For her part Alison had already been asleep for an hour and would be fully rested for the party. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That evening the three girls went to a party. Alison was dressed in a jean skirt that showed off how thin her legs and waist were and that she had commonly wore in high school. She also had a tight shirt on, given how fit Alison was, she did not have much of a rack, however, she always thought it was a pretty good tradeoff. Alison didn't mind people who were larger, but she was still a social animal, and wanted to stay thin. Being pretty popular in high school meant that she had expectations and standards, so she wanted to get with some hot guys while she was in school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison walked down to Liz's door and knocked. When Liz answered the door, Alison realized that they had different style. Both were wearing skirts, however, Liz's seemed much more stylish and expensive. It also hung differently, it showed less leg. Maybe it was Liz buying more upscale, less \"high schooly\" clothing, or maybe it was a hold over from her larger days, Alison was not certain. However, as she moved upwards, she noticed that Liz's clothes didn't have any clothing chain logos on them. Alison took note, wondering if her somewhat rural style would have to be adjusted now that they were in college. Regardless, the girls were excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heyyyy, ready?\" Liz asked Alison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Let's do this.\" She responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was Kelsey, who had choosen a wardrobe that showed she was fit, but also masked her more muscular legs, since deep down she had always wished she were a bit smaller on the lower side of her body. Sandra was dressed like she wasn't even thrilled to go out, just in normal clothes, possibly a nod to her more down to earth upbringing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls walked in a pack to the party, they were freshmen after all. Their older roommates had made the decision to come separately, they didn't want to completely fawn over the freshman experience of a new class of people, so they started a trend of always being cautious of the new girls' space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while Madison was getting ready, it was hard for her not to dwell over the effect gaining 80 pounds in one year had done to her social scene. She loved being with Jim, but she couldn't remember the last time that a guy hit on her. She also missed a lot of her smaller clothes that had showed off her former beach bod. As she pulled over the dress that was supposed to hide some of her larger figure, she noted how soft her butt had gotten, and her legs even felt more squishy than they were a few weeks ago. She also challenged her decision to go sleeveless, as it showed off more pudge in her arms as well. Madison was in the process of accepting her body, but still, an event like a party would always be hard. She would see skinny girls and think of her former self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the pack of Sophomores arrived at the party, Kelsey saw how large some of them looked in their too tight clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh,\" thought Kelsey, \"Madison's belly is bursting out of that dress. How can she let herself be seen like that?\" She also turned her attention to Cassi, \"Geez, she should wear some shapewear, those rolls are all over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey was still proud of her soccer body, and highly critical of those who had gained anything, this was in part because Kelsey had never struggled with her weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the party got rolling, Allison got pretty tipsy and enjoyed talking with a few guys, as did Kelsey and Liz. They seemed to be a hit at the party. Jim also noticed that while the girls seemed to eat more while drunk, which, he chuckled to himself, was pretty typical. But as he looked at Liz's bluge which looked a tad bigger than last time, he wondered if it would stay in tact. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison lay in bed, listening to the birds greeting the day on Sunday after the last party before classes resumed. She knew it was past dawn and glanced over at the clock, at the same time pulling in air with a deep yawn,  It was 9:40. She caressed her fleshy belly, part of a body 80 pounds greater than when she was in high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe number seemed large but somehow it didn\u2019t bother her. She was a big woman, sure, but she had a guy who loved her, her mom and reconciled herself to her daughter\u2019s right to be her own person, and Madison was free from the diet tyranny she knew others struggled with.  It had been nice to go to a party where women of size were dominant and everyone of them spoken for.  Sandra and Robert seemed to be pairing off as well, leaving three unattached freshman girls to deal with six available men<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim and Mark had done well on the entrees with Jessica\u2019s replenished food stores. Callie and Madison made sure drinks (non-alcoholic of course) and desserts were in full supply. Then came the entertainment and games, including Sandra as mc, Allison doing Karaoke and Liz doing a guitar solo. The evening was topped off by a final round of desserts. She hadn\u2019t noticed any obvious pairing but no one was a wallflower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this Madison was ready to sleep a bit later But she had other concerns as well. Classes would start the next day and she had her reputation as a writer to consider as well as choosing a career. Jim had told her to get a good rest and expect a nice surprise. He 200+ pound bombshell wondered what was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slipped out of her night clothes and showered, then climbed into a plus size blue and white blue pleated skirt that barely reached her knees. It was less confining for her thunder thighs than trying to cram into jeans. Then she slipped on a matching hi-lo tank top from Ashley-Stewart. It was an attractive coordinated plus-size outfit that looked natural, as though she\u2019d always been a large girl - unlike the super-tight outfit she'd been wearing the night before to titillate Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now it was slightly after 10:30 and Jim, punctual as always, would be there at 11:00.  She turned on her computer, checked her e-mail sand began surfing the net. At five minutes before the hour her cell phone came alive, Jim announcing he was parking and would be right up to get her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled approvingly at her outfit and followed it with a compliment. After a quick hug and kiss they were on their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get completely away from the campus for the day,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want what were going to talk about getting circulated until its announced.  Do you mind Subway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison thought of her appetite, realizing that her stomach was still costing after the night before. She wasn\u2019t actually really hungry and here it was nearly lunch time. \u201cThat\u2019s fine \u2013 you did a great job last night and I\u2019m still not over it.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they were settled in the corner of a Subway, each with soda and a pair of foot long Ciabatta bread sandwiches, his of tuna and her\u2019s a turkey breast. Jim had picked the location for its isolation because, even though they were four miles from campus, he didn\u2019t want to chance being overheard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began by recalling where they had met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaddy, you remember a year ago you started writing for the Powers Proclaimer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, you were my editor and for four months I never saw you \u2013 I just turned in my articles and they appeared,\u201d she acknowledged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey were good enough I didn\u2019t think they needed major changes.  But what would you write about if you could choose?\u201d Jim probed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, last year it was fashion, then restaurants and entertainment I could do hsrd news  but haven\u2019t pushed it,\u201d Madison rambled in free thought, not knowing where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim nodded \u201cWhat about political and social commentary?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison wondered what Jim was getting at and chose her words carefully: \u201dummm \u2013 some people might find my views somewhat controversial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim smiled. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d say that because it fits perfectly what I\u2019m about to discuss..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Madison put down the remaining half of her sub. He had her attention. \u201cExactly what are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we must have been doing something right last year,\u201d Jim answered. \u201cbecause this year I\u2019m associate publisher and its been suggested you be feature editor. That means you can write on what you want and even assign articles. What Professor Hastings wants is for this sleepy campus to take more notice of the paper. Its being squeezed by the internet and social media. No reasonable topic, including the faculty and community, is off limits. The only pre-condition is that we vet our sources and present fairly the facts on both sides,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was silent. Professor Jonathan Hastings was the head of the Journalism department but she barely knew him. She had a torrent of ideas but going public with them wasn\u2019t something she\u2019d anticipated. And who besides her would be willing to contribute? This wasn\u2019t 1900 where people spent an hour on their daily paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could start by emulating last year and not getting controversial until we have something truly meaningful. We need to encourage positive improvement, not just change to be different or sensationalizing scandals,\u201d she suggested. \u201cI\u2019d need to find some reliable writers willing to express themselves in sentences rather than text language shorthand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim and Madison began kicking names around and Madison finished off her sandwich, excited about the offer. When they were finished they headed home, Madison\u2019s mind focused on possible topics.  For some reason she kept thinking about the Bud Ramsey affair.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nSandra\u2019s binge week was over. It had been nice stuffing herself to her stomach\u2019s delight, seeing her food belly pooch out and then go away. She knew it had been totally self indulgent, but it had also kept her mind off the obnoxious creep Bud Ramsey and even brought Robert into her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>He may even like bigger girls,\u201d </i>she realized.<i> \u201cAt least he doesn\u2019t mind my appetite.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the party the Saturday before Sandra had intended to be moderate. However, with Robert plying her with seconds and treats, that had turned out to be relative. She had wound up eating about what Jessica and Kelli did and definitely less than Madison and Callie. She didn\u2019t know about Liz, but she knew she\u2019d packed away more than Allison or Kaley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunday Sandra and Jessica had slept in, then made a light sandwich and soup brunch. They then went to the market to restock groceries. Most of the day was spent on laundry and preparing for classes. Jessica prepared a casserole for later in the week and suggested Sandra should decide what would be done about desserts. In the evening Mark has turned up with Tex-Mex food from Taco Bell and soda, so Jessica broke out the ice cream. She and Sandra partook generously of both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, on Monday, Robert would be going to the lineup today with her, just as her roommate Jessica would accompany Mark. The two girls both had early classes so had gone to breakfast together. Sandra was surprised at her appetite. However, determined to exercise discipline and even though she would have liked more she settled for a burrito and two pancakes. She was surprised that Jessica just had eggs and a beef patty with cantaloupe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you hungry today?\u201d she inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could be. But I tend to take time eating and I don\u2019t want to be late the first day for class,\u201d the stocky sophomore replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh \u2013 I guess I get that. This is probably more than I should be having, but after last week it doesn\u2019t seem like it,\u201d Sandra replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalories are the same regardless of the time of day. I\u2019m trying to hold mine to around 2500 so that I don\u2019t gain much more. I\u2019d never hear the last of it from Kelli if I did,\u201d Jessica sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Kelli has much room to complain,\u201d noted Sandra. \u201cYou\u2019re about the same size. And if I eat all year like last week I could be there too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHang around Robert and it could happen \u2013 I hope that doesn\u2019t bother you,\u201d probed Jessica. She didn\u2019t think Sandra was hung up on weight or judgmental, but wasn\u2019t sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess  we\u2019ll just have to see,\u201d Sandra replied with an indifferent attitude. \u201cOK \u2013 I need to get going.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too. See you at the police station this afternoon,\u201d answered Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra had three classes back to back followed by a 1:00 course after a lunch break. She tried dropping by the dining all but it was crowded and she decided she\u2019d have something after 2:00. Robert would meet her at 3:30<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBt 2:00 Sandra was really hungry. The dining hall was still open but out of most menu items. What they did have was plenty of spaghetti with sauce and meatballs plus French bread rolls. She loaded her plate and quickly made it disappear. Then she went back for dessert, winding up with a strawberry sundae and a soda refill  because all the ice cream was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another ten minutes the sundae too was history and her bulging food belly bore testimony. She caressed it gently, then noted a difference. Normally it was distended and firm with the adjacent skin stretched tight. Now however the adjacent flesh felt just a little softer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cAm I actually gaining some weight</i>,\u201d she began to wonder.<i> \u201cIts only been a week and my clothes aren\u2019t any tighter? \u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced at the clock. There was still plenty of time and she had seen a scale under the sink in the bathroom in their suite. she considered going back to her room and checking, thinking \u201c<i>maybe I do need to start counting calories or exercise a little. I don\u2019t mind gaining some weight but not the freshman 15 in the first four weeks</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe texted Robert that they\u2019d need to drop by her dorm before leaving, then pulled open her book bag and began reading an assignment. When she noticed Robert coming into the dining hall about thirty minutes later she pulled her waistband up over her snug food belly. He noticed her adjusting her pants to give her food belly room as she stood. He smiled but said nothing \u2013 the empty plates told him all he wanted to know, thinking to himself with a smile. <i>She\u2019s had a good lunch and dessert.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sandra she got to her room she switched into some looser fitting slacks, then went into the bathroom and got on the scale. She was relieved that the scale only said 126 \u2013 two more than last time and part of that could be clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cI guess I just need to do sit-ups \u2013 my abs are getting soft from my food belly expanding and contracting</i>\u201d she decided. Donning a long over blouse that covered her waist she went out to see Robert, who still pretended not to have noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way to the police station, about a fifteen minute drive, Robert asked Sandra about what they were going to do. She explained that, according to Mark, there would be five identically dressed men of the same height. They had to separately identify the one who had been in the dining hall.. Mark suspected that there was involvement with something bigger at stake but couldn\u2019t be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the line up Robert was allowed to go in with Mark, leaving Jessica and Sandra alone. Jessica noted Sandra\u2019s change of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I had a big lunch and my belly got big like always. But my tummy felt softer so I got on your scale. It must be soft muscle \u2018cause I\u2019d hadn\u2019t really gained anything. But I changed clothes anyway,\u2019 declared Sandra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts brand new weight for you Sandra, and the pounds on the scale come in spurts. The first extra calories simply build the cell walls, then come the ones which fill the cells up \u2013 that\u2019s when the pounds on the scale register,\u201d explained Jessica. \u201cbut you could also be right about your abs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Sandra could fully digest this she was called by the guard to come and view Bud Ramsey. She didn\u2019t see Mark and Robert, but was instead escorted to directly to a viewing room.  Picking out Ramsey was easy \u2013 second from the right. She was thanked and returned to the waiting room. Around 5:30 they were released to leave. Mark and Jessica had plans to meet up with Jim and Madison. Sandra noticed that by this time her food belly had completely receded - she was ready for whatever Robert had in mind for supper.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sandra was hungry by the time they finished up at the police station, so she pestered him into the dinner plans, when he revealed where they were going for dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to Ray's,\" he remarked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, and what might that be??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a BBQ buffet, it's well known around Powers for the awesome food, so you'd be advised to learn about it early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, anything that helps me adjust to the Powers University culture, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked over, Robert noticed that her food baby had receded, and he wondered if he could get it filled up again. His buffet choice was no coincidence, he figured that this would help him in that goal. When they got in the restaurant, Sandra was engrossed by the amazing smell, something common for those in the restaurant for the first time. There were rows of ribs, wings, steak, burgers...pretty much any meat based food you could want, they had. Sandra skipped the salad bar and went straight to the meats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you know you can make two trips, Sandra,\" Robert casually joked, while looking at the pile of food on Sandra's plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know, this all just looks amazing and I can't help it. But yeah, at some point I need to slow down, I already ate too much this morning, can't make this the norm!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert almost took it internally as some kind of challenge, since he found the mock concern by Sandra endearing. For most of the time, through Sandra's first two plates, they talked about the Bud Ramsey developments, and their happiness with his being identified. They both hoped that they could get the entire event behind them at some point. Eventually, they exhausted conversation on that and they moved on while Sandra was up getting her third plate. When she sat back down, Robert tried to segway into other topics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you know magic tricks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Sandra said in between the finishing bites on some fried chicken<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you do any right now for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. Watch this rib,\" she pulled a large rib off Robert's plate, \"disappear before your very eye!\" Sandra quickly scarfed it down. Robert chucked, \"Man,\" he thought, \"she is really attacking this food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were getting ready to go, she had to readjust her pants again to accommodate her food baby. It was bulging, and the softness still felt off for Sandra. Robert on the other hand, felt like he had achieved his goal, well today at least he did. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Mark and Jessica drove towards their rendezvous with Jim and Madison he filled her in on the procedure in the lineup. It had been an updated modern version of the black box arrangement seen in old movies. There those at one end under bright lights in a long room were effectively blinded and prevented from seeing those viewing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow,\u201c explained Mark, \u201cthey use a wall divider with a reverse mirror window. Its totally sound proof and takes up less area.  But I found out something you will find interesting \u2013 this guy\u2019s a suspect in two disappearances.  No bodies yet, so he hasn\u2019t been charged, but the M.O. is similar \u2013 Sandra and Allison may be very lucky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhew,\u201d replied Jessica. \u201cand poor Sandra \u2013 all she thinks she has to worry about is gaining a few pounds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Mark responded with surpise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the waiting room she was done with Ramsey. She instead was fussing over having eaten so much last week with all the stuff I\u2019d left her to enjoy. Its improved her appetite so she got stuffed at lunch again  today.   She\u2019s not seen the results \u2013 yet, but fears they\u2019re coming. And the way she packs it away she\u2019s not wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark rolled his eyeballs. \u201cWell, if I have Robert pegged right she\u2019ll soon be over that hump. Did you notice him making sure she was cared for at the party?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes \u2013 just like someone else I know. You aren\u2019t coaching him or anything, are you?\u201d questioned Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way. I only met hi last week. He hooked up with Sandra on his own because of how she was eating the free breakfasts. She does have an appetite.\u201d Mark observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ve noticed. She\u2019s trying to cut back now but as I\u2019ve learned that\u2019s not easy once you get to enjoy eating  I think she has a bigger capacity than me, if you can believe it.  Speaking of which, I think we\u2019re almost ready to meet our dinner partners.\u201d concluded Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey parked Mark\u2019s  car and went into the Bella Luna Cafe, a Mediterranean style restaurant rated as one of the best in the Witchita area. Madison had concurred in an uncredited review she\u2019d written the year before, calling it \u201cpricy on some items but worth every penny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the foursome linked up Jim immediately ordered a Hummus Shawarmah appetizer for everyone to share while they mulled their choices. It included  sliced chicken marinated in vinegar and spices with<br>\r\nparsley and pine nuts. He\u2019d promised to treat for the entrees as long as entr\u00e9e choices were kept to $12 or less. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim went for the pasta Diablo, flavored with peppers and onions in a roasted tomato cream sauce.  Madison would have preferred the more expensive braised lamb shank but settled for beef curry and rice. Mark went with Bella Luna\u2019s signature steak sandwich which comes with a pasta salad. Jessica, ever the lover of Italian dishes, hungrily ordered the six cheese pasta, a dish including Mascarpone, Fontina, Gorgonzola, Swiss, Pecorino Romano &amp; Parmigiano-Reggiano Cheeses tossed with tomato and spinach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they waited for their order to arrive Madison listened quietly while Mark related the day\u2019s events \u2013 including the possible link of Bud Rasey to actual crimes.  Wenhed finished she and Jim glancedat each other. She\u2019d told him erlier she\u2019d go head with thea yet unannounced promotion and now thery both understood the implctins of wehsat Msrk had shsred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMark, I have one question.  Is there any reason why it has taken this long to piece things together?\u201d Madison asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe live in one town, Ramsey\u2019s in another, and campus security takes care of the college. I guess its lack of coordination,\u201d suggested Mark. \u201cWhy, for instance, aren\u2019t the police aware of Alison having been approached \u2013 or, if they are, wasn\u2019t she called in today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly. Why doesn\u2019t local law enforcement use Go to Meeting or some such to compare notes and connect dots better. The bad guys opeerate across jurisdictions \u2013 why can\u2019t law enforcement?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u201dPrivacy and confidentiality?\u201d suggested Jessica,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefinite factors \u2013 but should they be the overriding ones?\u201d broke in Jim<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison continued her thought train. \u201cMark, if the campus paper were to run a story on Alison and Sandra and what you did today would you mind? Especially if it were part of a campaign to get better cooperation?\u201d asked Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince when is the Proclaimer the crusading agent for change?\u201d he replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince Professor Hastings said it should be \u2013 like this semester. And this sounds like something we could jump on, right Mr. Associate Publisher?\u201d she said looking at Jim. The others suddenly caught on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe new Features Editor has spoken. And personally I agree.\u201d returned Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy question is willingness to put up with the attention this will bring? I think Alison, Sandra and maybe others would be better off for it.\u201d Madison  declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s for sure,\u201d agreed Jessica. \u201cI\u2019d be proud to stand with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark hesitated no longer. \u201cOK \u2013 get Alison and Sandra to go along and tell them I\u2019m in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the foursome finished their appetizers the conversation moved on to other things and they enjoyed their dinner. Madison and Jim both knew that they should wait on publishing until Bud Ramsey was formally charged and behind bars before revealing the Powers University angle, but they had their first \u201cnew look\u201d story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica and Mark also realized something else \u2013 as good as the use of recent events might be the stress wouldn\u2019t suppress Sandra\u2019s appetite.  Alison\u2019s response, however, was unpredictable. Right now she was planning on exercising more with Kelsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the meal drew to a close, Mark offered to pay for the desserts and beverages since Jim had done the appetizer and entrees. They were both proud of their well-fed and rounded girlfriends.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It seemed to be a soft, non-rolled, fleshy mound under the tight shirt that Liz was wearing. She wondered if this was temporary, of if what Liz had previously mentioned regarding her weight was going to be a reoccurring event.  Regardless, Allison didn't want her weight to follow the trend at the school, or at least among the girls she knew already. Allison loved her current body, and although not as judgmental as Kelsey, she had no desire to gain any weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey came into the room after that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey ladies, what have you been up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much, we indulged a bit a lunch,\" Liz responded, patting her belly. \"Speak for yourself,\" thought Allison, who ate a bit more than she was used to, but planned to work out with Kelsey later in the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. I see.\" Kelsey noted, somewhat annoyed, \"well I just got done with my workout, I love to get that stuff out of the way.\" Allison didn't know that Kelsey had done that already, \"rats!\" thought Allison, \"now I'll have to workout on my own.\" As things would have it, Allison never got around to working out that day, but she figured she could do it tomorrow. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liz fidgeted a bit over Alison and Kelsey\u2019s banter about lunch and exercise. She knew she\u2019d slimmed down from where she once had been but was already eating more at Powers, not just at lunch today but generally. It wasn\u2019t deliberate, and it wasn\u2019t enough she felt to be showing, but just rooming with Calli made her more undisciplined.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Sunday for example Liz had brought home a box of 6 pastries expecting them to last until Monday morning.  By bedtime she\u2019d devoured four and shared two with Calli, who had prepared two meals that day herself which she\u2019d shared with Liz. Lunch had been a quarter poundrr deluxe value meal at McDonalds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz keenly remembered all of this when she said she and Allison had indulged at lunch. It was true enough but not the whole picture. And she felt Alison could tell that she still had some soft flesh from her previous size \u2013 regaining it could occur quickly, but she knew that would likely bring criticism from Kelsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison\u2019s statement was more honest. Unlike Liz she\u2019d skipped breakfast, then devoured a plate of spaghetti with meatballs and two chicken thighs plus a large soda. Then Liz, who\u2019d eaten similarly, had suggested cookies for dessert and brought her two large tollhouse delicacies. She knew it was a bundle of calories but she\u2019d honestly expected to work them off th Kelsey.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLiz decided to go on the offensive to distract attention from herelf, asking Kelsey \u201cAre you planning on going out for one of the teams? Is that why you exercise so much? You sound like an athlete\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yes,\u201d acknowledged Kelsey, \u201c I originally came here to be part of the soccer team as a wak-on but then they changed coaches and I gor frozen out too late to go elsewhere, But I have another school locked up if I do well in my classes this yesr.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suspected that, \u201c replied Liz, \u201cI\u2019d never have the skills or discipline for that but I admire you for it.  Power\u2019s loss is going to be that school\u2019s gain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad for your encouragement,\u201d Kelsey said a little condescendingly . Liz seemed a little thick to her, definitely not soccer msterial. She was a nice person though and she had no reason to criticize her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison listened to the exchange with another view. She had become aware the night before of her roommate Madison\u2019s pending big announcement and was surprised someone that heavy could be so well regarded. But just talking with the big girl for the past week had convinced her she had brains and wasn\u2019t lazy. Discrimination by the athletic department sounded like just the kind of crusade Madison might be looking for. So Alison decided to ask \u201cwhat would happen if the student body and alumni discovered that you\u2019d been frozen out? Would you be embarrassed if someone started a campaign to get you included?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what are you talking about?\u201d Kelsey asked, intrigued but uncertaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy roommate said the school paper is looking to spice things up a bit with controversy. She\u2019s probably going to be Feature Editor and this sounds  like a story\u201d Allison volunteered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey thought of Madison, whom she regarded as simply a 200 pound whale not in her league. Could someone that big actually be able to help her?  She didn\u2019t want to be unkind but the idea seemed preposterous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould I like see some justice? Of course. But let\u2019s face it, Madison\u2019s a porker. Who is going to take her seriously.?\u201d answered Kelsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d snapped Liz. \u201cI used to be bigger myself and it had nothing to do with my abilities and talents elsewhere. You shouldn\u2019t put someone down just because they\u2019re not like you. Why not let Alison ask?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey realized she\u2019d gone too far.  So many of the students here were either fat or kindly disposed towards those whe were. She sighed and said, \u201calright. Excuse my skepticism and see what she can do.  But I\u2019m not optimistic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d replied Alison quietly. She wasn\u2019t anywhere near as antagonistic to people of size as Kelsey. She just knew that her own goal was an Ivy League school and being bigger wasn\u2019t going to help get there. But she had already developed a respect for Madison. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of optimism,\u201d said Liz to change the subject, \u201cWe had 5-6 guys at the party Saturday. I gave my number and email to four of them and have heard back from two with one date. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI save out four as well and have one date\u201d replied Alison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t checked my email and my cell phone battery was dead yesterday. I don\u2019t remember how many I gave out,\u201d answered Kelsey, who wasn\u2019t quite telling the truth. At the party he\u2019d been dumbfounded by the food an atmosphere, choosing to sit by herself and not mix in. She\u2019d only had two guys try to talk with her and had given both the cold shoulder. She felt Sandra\u2019s magic tricks, Alison\u2019s Karaoke and Liz\u2019s instrumental solo were attention getting gimmicks that were beneath her. She was there for appearances without consuming and gainging weight \u2013 something everyone else seemed not to care about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK,\u201d said Alison. \u201cI need to get back to my room and do some study.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too,\u201d said Liz, aware that in her desk was a half finished packet of coconut macaroons. She felt like nibbling on some before sdupper, whatever Calli was preparing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey said nothing as the others took off. She knew she weighed twenty pounds less than either of them, but at Powers it didn\u2019t seem to matter. She recalled that the night before her overweight roomie Kelli had offered her a cream-covered bagel. She had of course turned it down<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning it had been the same. Kelli had invited Kelsey to join Mike and for breakfast but she\u2019d declined. And she knew Aison wanted to exercise, but she felt she couldn\u2019t wait and besides might slack off as Alison wasn\u2019t as committed. Kelsey felt lonely. It seemed everyone else was circling in a different orbit than her and their solar system revolved around food.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In a manner that wasn't atypical of freshman year, most of the guys who got numbers from girls were from the same group of friends. Liz, Allison, and Kelsey were not the only girls there, but there was enough socializing going on that there was some overlap. On the top floor of the same freshman dorm that Madison had been in a year ago, Kevin got a knock on his door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's unlocked!\" he shouted as him and his roommate Eric were in a tight battle on their game counsel against some foes online.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup, guys, how's that game going.\" Clark asked his two new buddies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, ever since we got bumped up a level, we have been getting sloughtered.\" Erick replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, bet you're getting owned by a pack of 12 year olds back from class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most likely.\" Neither Eric nor Kevin were the type to get too into video games, but used them as a fun time suck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the first weekend, Eric and Kevin became friends. Both were from suburbs about 4 hours away, in different directions from Powers. They were typical guys who grew up in upper middle class households, likeable, but never the king of the class by any means, just typical. Eric was about 6 ft tall, and Kevin was 5'11, each were average build. Clark was a tad shorter, and from a rural area, but they were all hitting it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did you all think of the party?\" Clark asked, as Eric reached over to power off the game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was alright, maybe we want to go to something a bit more wild in the future,\" remarked Eric. \"Yeah, agreed,\" added Kevin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you say that? I did okay, I got that girl Liz's number,\" remarked Clark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah she seemed pretty eager, didn't she,\" Eric noted, \"I mean not that it's a bad thing, I guess that's kind of what college is about. Did you do well, Kev?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that girl Allison gave me her number, we're going to grab dinner together in the dinning hall later this week. She seemed pretty cool. Plus, we both have played a bit of tennis in our past, although I think she's better than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice. Hey, should we be alarmed that all the sophomores looked, you know...bigger?\" Eric asked, being honest, and not overly critical about the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I noticed that as well,\" Kevin responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither Kevin nor Eric, or really even Clark preferred larger women. They wouldn't be overly mean to a larger girl, they just probably would want to avoid dating them. It was for a variety of reasons, first, they didn't know if they would be physically into that, and secondly, for social reasons, they didn't really want to go that direction, plus third, in high school, there were not that many larger girls. Lots of fast metabolisms and controlling parents kept waistlines thin, as Madison and Cassi found out last year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing that was universally reflected on by the guys was that Kelsey as pretty hot, but she seemed distant, and rather intimidating, so no one made a pass on her. It was hard to say if she would have decided to go out with any of them, but her demeanor meant that she didn't have the chance. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On Tuesday evening Alison strolled into the Powers University dining hall wearing well fitting auburn colored slacks and a striped top. The country girl  wanted to make a good impression on Kevin, whom she\u2019d met at the party only four days before. Other than the fact that he came from the suburbs, played at tennis and seemed friendly enough she knew nothing about him.   Of course, she realized, that applied to him as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin had arrived a few moments earlier, equally nervous and not wanting to mess up his first date in college. He was about three inches taller than the lithe 5\u20199\u201dAlison and suspected she was better at tennis than him, but he hoped they\u2019d find other common interests. What he wanted was a girl who was down to earth, intelligent, idealistic while at the same time realistic, unlike the boring pretentious airheads in high school \u2013 hung up on appearance and personalities with no substance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time he was curious. Alison at the party seemed totally accepting of the larger girls there, particularly her roommate Madison, yet herself ate like an athlete \u2013 only having one burger, some salad and a single dessert. Others, particularly Sandra, seemed to be eating every second. But Alison was ignoring all that, focused on getting to know the new guys. That\u2019s why she and Kevin had exchanged numbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, hello there,\u201d he said, coming up behind her, \u201cRight on time I see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, my mom trained me to be punctual. Classes let out four hours ago which gave Kelsey and I a chance to run today. I hadn\u2019t done it since Friday and really needed it. Then I got ready for us,\u201d she replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then let\u2019s get some food and we\u2019ll find a table. Things aren\u2019t apparently as busy now as at lunch and breakfast,\u201d noted Kevin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably because the meal plan only allows for two meals a day, you pay extra for a third. Morning and lunch are the easiest to have because you\u2019re tired in the morning and too rushed at noon. But in the evening you can have groups on your own. Or at least that\u2019s what I\u2019m told.\u201d related Alison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two freshman went through the line, Alison resisting the emptation to have spaghetti and meatballs with French bread and settling on a taco salad topped with guacamole and a burrito. Kevin went for meatloaf, potatoes and green beans. They both had soft drinks, Kevin noting that Alison was selecting moderate items suitable for one into athletics. He thought <i>\u201cNot much likelihood she\u2019ll become a plumper even if her dorm is filled with them.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then felt awkward about this thought. He knew it should be none of his business, but the discussion in the dorm had intrigued him. Why was this he started to wonder, but then suppressed his brain for the moment, shifting the subject. . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI enjoyed your guitar playing Saturday,\u201d he noted. \u201cI wish at times I\u2019d learned to play an instrument but I never had the discipline,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell its nothing formal. I picked it upas part of a church program and know enough to be dangerous with a ballad, but I\u2019ll leave the really fast stuff to the experts,\u201d Alison replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re a church girl?  My family is Baptist,\u201d Kevin said. \u201cSome people unfortunately think of us a bible thumpers. Actually we just listen to sermons and then have potlucks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere he went again, bringing up food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why is this going on?</i> he wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThumping a bible doesn\u2019t do much \u2013 reading it can if you want it to,\u201d answered Alison, watching to see Kevin\u2019s reaction as she continued eating her supper. ..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin laughed, \u201cyou\u2019re right on with that. Actually I\u2019ve never seen a Baptist or anyone else actually thump a bible. But doing justice, loving mercy and walking humbly before God I\u2019ve heard about plenty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Micah 6:8 as I recall \u2013 a Baptist who knows the old testament. I guess I should be impressed.\u201d noted Alison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK \u2013 and I suppose that\u2019s why you\u2019re at Powers \u2013 it has a conservative heritage and no booze in the dorm parties.\u201d probed Kevin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison shook her head \u201cNo, just plenty of food \u2013 like your Baptist potlucks. Actually I\u2019m at Powers because my grandparents are footing the tuition. They made their\u2019s before the bottom fell out of the economy and this is where my grandmother attended. She taught school for forty years, so it at least helped her. Me, I\u2019m torn \u2013 I like the small town but the big city is supposed to be the future, at least monetarily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sound like you\u2019re not really in love with the big city\u201d replied Kevin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not. But 80% of the shops in our town have closed in the last ten years. And the assembly factories are kaput \u2013 jobs gone overseas. I\u2019m not sure the big city is any better tough,\u201d she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that why you weren\u2019t eating as much as your friends Saturday? Life has you depressed?\u201d inquired Kevin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s not the reason. I\u2019m just not into food like some \u2013 but I\u2019m not critical of them either. After a;l, they all have guys and I\u2019m still looking, right?\u201d she observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, but I can tell you it surprised some of the other guys and me. I wonder how they came together?\u201d mused Kein.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, four people, four stories. Callie\u2019s always been big, Madison tried to help her and found out she and Jim enjoy life in the fat lane, Jessica I\u2019m not sure about yet, Kelli\u2019s making Michael happy but is still in denial l, if you can believe it. But as long as I watch myself and workout with Kelsey I\u2019m likely to avoid joining them.  As for Sandra and Liz, who knows?\u201d Alison rambled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'\u2018So none of them are trying to lose anything,\u201d Kevin said with a look of amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, Why should they? They\u2019re happy, have guys, and it\u2019s a pain trying o fight our metabolism and appetite. Madison\u2019s mote concerned with helping Kelsey\u2019s career than er own waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Kevin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison summarized Kelsey\u2019s soccer ambitions and Madison\u2019s new role. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll see a story in the campus paper by next week,\u201d she concluded. \u201cIf she needs my help she has it \u2013 anyone should be given a chance and this new coach is just being unfair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time they\u2019d both finished their meals and Kevin offered to get Alison a dessert but she declined, remarking  \u201cexercising only burns off so many calories and I\u2019ve probably had more than my share today. But thank you for the nice dinner \u2013 we can do it again sometime if you want\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin accepted her refusal and appreciated her offer. He wasn\u2019t into bigger girls especially but part of him had wanted to give her a treat and he sensed she wasn\u2019t full, just being disciplined. But he walked her back to her room and promised to see her again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin would have been surprised to know that after he left Alison went  immediately to the refrigerator where a large slice of left over cherry cheesecake was calling to her,<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Drop by this evening for supper and tell me all about it.\u201d </i>Liz had shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201c6:00 OK?\u201d </i>asked Alison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cPerfect. I\u2019ll have chicken pot pies in the oven. Callie won\u2019t be home,\u201d </i>Liz replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cGreat</i>,\u201d thought Alison, \u201dmore calories to work off. It\u2019s good that I\u2019m doing things with Kelsey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kelsey had expressed amazement to Alison at the decadent bliss of Kelli, who seemed to still be oblivious to her growing girth. She had described her torso as being  \u201dlike a bloated wine barrel under the eaves of two breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe walks around with her breast thrusting out, as if she doesn\u2019t realize her belly rolls are out nearly as far. The slabs of back fat are getting creases, but she struts around as if its nothing. Then she lays half naked on her bed like Cleopatra watching TV munching on stuff, \u201d  Kelsey  had continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison had confided to Alison that Kelli was truly in denial over her size, which was probably within thirty pounds of her own. Alison hadn\u2019t responded because it was really none of her concern, but she understood where Kelsey was coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison\u2019s own breakfast had been light, two slices of French toast and some melon slices.  Lunch had been a tuna salad after the text invitation from Liz. Her workout had been a good 45 minutes. She felt ok having a good sized supper, but she wondered a bit about Liz, who had seemed a little softer on Sunday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz really that wasn\u2019t concerned about whether she regained some of her lost weight or not. But she was concerned about Madison and what Alison had done to help Kelsey, What had been done to the would-be soccer player wasn\u2019t fair. And if it meant sharing a high calorie meal with Madison\u2019s roommate to find out the details she\u2019d gladly pay the price.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was all smiles when she welcomed Alison in and seated her at the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDinner will be ready in a few minutes\u201d  she announced.   There were two generous pineapple and cottage cheese salads already set out along with place settings and a carafe of tea. She brought out a colander of mashed potatoes.  The pot pies were cooling on the counter. Using gloves she flipped them onto plates and brought them steaming to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook good?\u201d she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied Alison, mentally calculating the laps it would take to work off this spread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK,\u201d then, dig in and tell me what\u2019s going on,\u201d Liz inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison began aerating the pot pie by mixing in the cooler mashed potatoes  while she delivered her report. \u201cWell, Jim researched Kelsey\u2019s records in school \u2013 respectable but nothing spectacular. But what she says about the rules being changed after she was accepted at Powers and having another offer for next year are both true.  The story will run tomorrow in the sports page of the Proclaimer with the main lead being the creep who accosted Sandra in the cafeteria. It seems there\u2019s a lack of communication between law enforcement departments around here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz listened intently with satisfaction. \u201cGood. Its time people started taking notice of these things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and this supper is great. I\u2019m glad for working out with Kelsey or I might pack on a few pounds,\u201d replied Alison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me about it,\u201d said Liz. \u201cI think I\u2019ve regained about five already. Living with a confident BBW like Calli can be contagious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can believe it,\u201d agreed Alison, who now had confirmation that her prior observations hadn\u2019t just been her imagination. \u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m hanging with Kelsey and Kevin \u2013 by the way, have you heard from Clark?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d replied Liz. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked twice and even had lunch today.  He\u2019s from the country and a little shy. He tried to ask me diplomatically about our dorm full of chubsters. I think he was surprised to find out I\u2019ve been one,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?  Did that bother him?\u201d asked Allison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think he\u2019s more puzzled than bothered. He told me I wasn\u2019t heavy to him, certainly not like our hosts Saturday. But then he said they seemed to be nice and together people and he just needed to get used to people being different in the city. He wasn\u2019t down on them at all,\u201d answered Liz<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm, but I bet he didn\u2019t offer to get you dessert.\u201d Alison commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, We both had burgers with sides. Mine was potato salad and cold slaw;  he had French fries. I would have had a slice of pie if he\u2019d offered but it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d Liz replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm. I bet Callie\u2019s place is packed with enough of that kind of food anyway.\u201d Alison said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really, Callie cooks great and has healthy portions but doesn\u2019t have a lot of desserts or snack foods. I think she\u2019s trying to level off and just not get any bigger. After all, she\u2019s close to 230\u201d disclosed Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat much?\u201d Alison said, surprised but not overly so. \u201cI\u2019m surprised she\u2019d share that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe did, just in passing. Her mind isn\u2019t on her weight as much as it is  caring about kids. She does great with them, according to Tom. They make a good team and he doesn\u2019t mind her size at all. That\u2019s what I hope will happen for me some day,\u201d ventured Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to be bigger again? After losing like what, forty pounds\u201d Alison said with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr maybe a little more \u2013 I\u2019m not exactly sure how much I lost. I\u2019m not pushing to gain it back, but let\u2019s be real: it will likely happen and I don\u2019t care. I wasn\u2019t unhappy before but just wanted to life easier with my mom and friends.  But I know the stats Liz confided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd to all of this Clark said what?\u201d Alison asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing. I didn\u2019t get into this kind of detail with him. We split for classes after lunch and that was that. But he did text me afterwards and said he hoes we can do something again. So he\u2019s not out of the picture.  And now that we\u2019ve finished the pot pie I do have some ice cream to share before Calli gets back and finds out I bought it.\u201d Liz said with a sly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison started to decline, but realized that after the hot supper it really did sound delicious.  After polishing off a generous four scoop bowl with topping she went back to her own apartment.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Guys like Robert and Mark are the true connoisseurs of the Ruebenesque \u2013 I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve even considered dating anyone who doesn\u2019t have a good appetite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess Robert\u2019s  hit the jackpot with Sandra.

I never had that with Kelli because I was already close to her. She did herself in by ragging on her roommate who then started cooking for her knowing she couldn\u2019t resist. I knew it would make her less judgmental to gain  few, but I didn\u2019t anticipate what append.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you implying I could fall for a chubby chick?\u201d Kevin said. He didn\u2019t dislike heavier girls but in his peer group that just wasn\u2019t done. College seemed to be different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m stating it as a fact \u2013 not that it will, but that it could. . And what\u2019s so bad if it happens? Especially if they lift you up and are fun to share life with? Kelli was thin but her Mom is bigger than Callie \u2013 and with her hips she could be too eventually.  Doesn\u2019t bother me. Now if she were downcast and having to be propped up all the time that would be another thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI went out with Allison. I think she\u2019s too strict with herself to ever gain much,\" Kevin remarked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could be right \u2013 and nothing wrong with that. In fact if you have a problem with heavier chicks someone like Allison or Kelsey is where I think you should be looking,\u201d Mike pontificated as Sophomores are prone to do,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh Kelsey? No thank you. I guess I see what you mean about fat girls \u2013 I\u2019d go for Sandra this minute even knowing she\u2019d someday be over 200 than deal with that one!\u201d Kevin exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa now, Kelsey\u2019s a strong personality but she\u2019s not the wicked witch of the west. Just a bit of an exercise fanatic,\u201d cautioned Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd even critical of other exercise buffs. I\u2019ve even heard her slap at Alison, who\u2019s trying to lean on her for support. Have you heard her once laugh or compliment anyone? She has an anger unr the hood I\u2019d be careful of\u201d declared Kevin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo then, you\u2019re answering your own question \u2013 it isn\u2019t just size one way or the other but the total package. And different people have both preferences and ranges of acceptance.  For instance,\u201d continued Michael, \u201c its fine that  Kelli\u2019s bigger but I think she needs to learn cooking basics. She know and admits it. People have done things for her all her life and she\u2019s never really had a chance to learn.  But would you believe she feels sorry for Kelsey, not angry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you have to be kidding me \u2013 Kelli wants to mentor her roommate, who is totally the opposite?\u201d Kevin declared<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf she knew how she might try it, yes, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s thought it through that far \u2013 yet. But Kelsey hasn\u2019t had one offer of a date from the party or even a contact , and that\u2019s a fact. Alison and Liz, who isn\u2019t shy about saying she\u2019s an ex-plumper, have both had dates.  And after listening here I guess we all know why.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I suggest something \u2013 if you don\u2019t  mind?\u201d volunteered Clark, who had been discreetly quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d replied Kevin and Michael togerther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark took a deep breath. \u201cOne of the remarks Kelsey made at the party was that she knew how to cook health food instead of the stuff we had. Say what you will about her distant superior attitude I don\u2019t think she makes claims she can\u2019t back up. Do you think she\u2019d go along with teaching Kelli cooking if she thought Kelli would then help her maintain her tofu life style?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm,\u201d mused Michael. \u201cAs long as I promise to make it up on weekends it might be doable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on Michael invited Kelli out to a Greek gyro caf\u00e9 for a couple of wraps and some baklava. He knew it would be her supper but his real goal was to discuss Clark\u2019s suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know it might actually work. I\u2019ve come to be proud of my body but I can see the look on Kelsey\u2019s face whenever I\u2019m lying ion my bed with M&amp;M\u2019s or a bagel. She thinks I\u2019m a cow. But if she thought she was helping me by learning to cook her way \u2018cause then I\u2019d eat that way all the time she might do it But please don\u2019t ask me to really go that route! My belly would protest!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael nodded. He realized Kelli thought he was in the same FA camp as Mark, Robert and Jim, but didn\u2019t care. He knew that she would acquire skills that would be adaptable to any cuisine down the road.  But would Kelsey go along?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric meanwhile was pondering what Michael had said. He hadn\u2019t asked either Alison or Liz out, Alison because of her interest in physical exercise which he didn\u2019t really relish, Liz because his instincts were that she would likely become a plumper again. He\u2019d seen her trying to be moderate at the party but could tell she really wanted more.  Was he being too cautious?  Did that really make a difference?  He had her phone number \u2013 what harm could it do to take her out once?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe called Michael. \u201cIf I can get Liz to say yes, where would a nice place be to go on a double date? And would you and Kelli be willing to go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand there\u2019s a country and western show at the civic auditorium next Saturday night, but it probably costs $25 a head \u2013 the good news is that the student store has a limited 2:1 offer for those who\u2019ve bought enough, and I bet we all have with our text books,\u201d volunteered Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me about it \u2013 over $200.  But I can spring for $25. Should we do supper before or after?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Doesn\u2019t start until 8:00 so why not shoot for dnner at 5?\u201d Michael answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood for me \u2013 wish me luck in talking to Liz.\u201d Eric replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth was surprised to get his call and Eric sounded a little nervous but sincere. She felt comfortable being off campus with Mike and Kelli along and accepted.  None of the four had any idea of the firestorm about to break in the campus paper the next morning.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was close to midnight on Tuesday. Jim and Madison smiled in satisfaction as they did the final proof for Thursday\u2019s front page headline story in the new Proclaimer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 POSSIBLE SERIAL KILLER<br>\r\nFINGERED BY PU STUDENTS<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBud Ramsey, an auto mechanic, has been arraigned in connection with the alleged disappearance and presumed death of three women in the Wichita  area over the past two years, authorities have confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bodies have not been recovered. However, articles of clothing belonging to one of the presumed victims contained DNA matching that of Ramsey, who cannot establish any reasonable other connection with the presumptive victim. Neither can he account for his whereabouts at the time of her disappearance, accord to the eight count indictment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is known is that a man matching Ramsey\u2019s description approaching women in the general area and time frame has been documented in all three cases. Until two weeks ago, however, authorities did not have a name to match to the MO and description.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe break in the case came from cooperation with the Powers University Security Department. Two Powers university female students were approached by Ramsey in the last month. A third male student was close enough to one incident to make a positive ID. Ramsey in talking with one of the students had supplied his name and place of employment but she still denied his offer to join him for a date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the second approach incident, leading to a verbal exchange in the Powers ding hall, that was referred to campus authorities by dining hall workers. Ramsey verbally denigrated the Reubenesque friends of the co-ed and inferred that he would be a better choice. This incensed the boyfriend of one of the students involved who tried to intervene, causing Ramsey to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three students plus two dining hall workers subsequently participated in police lineups and positively identified Ramsey, according to the indictment. What is remarkable, Proclaimer researchers have discovered, is that all police jurisdictions involved had the similarity of approach in their separate case files. However, none were concurrently aware of the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch territorial barriers exist and need to come down\u201d insists Criminologist Gary Beckstrom. \u201cCriminals have no restraints of city boundaries and it will only facilitate apprehensions if jurisdictions can share ongoing investigations.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe would like to share more, \u201c concurs police PR representative Julie Mitchell. \u201cHowever, there are budgetary constraints and privacy concerns we have to respect. Sharing can be and is done on a selective basis, but its not feasible  to do it routinely on a large scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProclaimer investigative journalists have been unable to corroborate the validity of Beckstrom and Mitchell\u2019s statements at press time, but we feel that our student body should be proud of the contribution of our classmates.  Hopefully the appropriate legislative agencies will investigate this matter further.\u201d[/indent]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat article plus the piece on the soccer coach should stir things up,\u201d Jim commented. \u201cI think the DQ is open for another hour \u2013 want to drop over?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know my answer yo that,\u201d Madison said, caressing her ample belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim smiled. Madison wasn\u2019t gaining like last year but she wasn\u2019t getting any smaller ether.  He would have been even more amazed if he\u2019d been privy to what was going on with Kelli and Kelsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelli, whose idea of cooking was popping pizzas into a microwave, had been annoying Kelsey no end just be being her newly self-indulgent self. She still thought of her size relative to Madison and Cassie, which meant thsat ven ho she as erring a tight size16 she wasn\u2019t actually fat fat. Kelsey of course saw her roommates 180 pound frame as an obese whale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Kelli had supper in the dining hall with Michael. Nothing huge \u2013 chicken  fried steak, mashed potatoes, salad and  a big dessert. Of course she fully intended to have a cream cheese bagel and maybe something else at home. But she\u2019d promised Michael to try to make nice with Kelsey be becoming her culinary student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind she was happy to find a weary Kelsey watching television with a bottle of Gatorade.  Kelli announced that she was going to the kitchen and asked Kelsey if she wanted a bagel.  Kelsey, as always, declined.  Then, instead of exiting to her room as she usually did, Kelli came back with her bagel plus two sodas and a large bag of chips, which she offered to share with Kelsey, who again declined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next twenty minutes Kelli proceeded to polish off her bagel, both sodas  and a good portion of her chips until Kelsey could take it no longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you stand it.\u201d she burst out finally<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShtand Whaat?\u201d sked Kelly innocently with her mouth full of chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPacking your pie hole like that. How big a house do you want to become?\u201d fumed  Kelsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMichael likes meat on my bones and I\u2019m quite comfortable with it myself\u201d replied Kelli, who actually had reservations she wouldn\u2019t share. \u201cAnd besides, I can\u2019t cook that heath food you use so this is what I\u2019m stuck with. You wouldn\u2019t want to teach me how to do things differently would you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey was taken aback. Was the next campus blimp asking her for advice.? It was the first time in memory Kelsey could recall being asked to be supportive of anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, cooking might be involved but it needs to start with menu planning. If I do it will you co-operate?\u201d Kelsey demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever you say. I\u2019ll even help pay for the food for the first three months. Michael really wants me to master cooking and I have no idea. We always had someone to do those kinds of things:\u201d whined Kelli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey thought  \u201c<i>Hmmm \u2013 if I play this right she\u2019ll be like my servant and not have  a clue.\u201d</i><br>\r\n\u201cOK,\u201d agreed Kelsey. \u201cWe can start tomorrow - but I expect your full cooperation.  No junk food on the premises after you use up what you have. Agreed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed.\u201d said Kelli. She thought she could get a fix from Michael whenever needed. She had no idea that Kelsey was about to become a local minor celebrity when the Proclaimer came out in two days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(rejoin main storyline)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison had been working on the first story of the new semester for a while now, and she was just getting ready to submit it. She knew that this one was going to be a bomb dropped on the athletic department. This was her first story that she had done that ventured outside of the social columns which had garnered her a lot of praise. In fact, although the Proclaimer had done some really good stories over a decade ago, as Madison found in the paper's archives, for the past 10 years, it seems as if they had missed on a lot of things. Preferring to do really shallow editorials, lacking depth and just parroting national talking points that the writers had picked up to cement their already entrenched beliefs. Madison wanted to change that, she wanted to look into things that were happening on campus more deeply, and really pick up on stories that were not being covered anywhere else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis started with the athletic department. In her opinion, it was a question that needed to be asked as to why the soccer team did not have a walk on policy. It surely was not for a depth of talent. Powers was good at some sports, but soccer was not one of them. Madison did some research on it, but came up empty in terms of actual rules prohibiting it, and the team wasn't near any kind of cap on available players. While she was writing it, she wondered what affect this would have on Kelsey. What if this backfired? Madison was all for this idea, but she didn't expect the campus to go nuts over a story about women's soccer. \"If only she played basketball,\" Madison joked to herself, \"then this would be a bigger deal.\" Still, Madison knew that the athletic department needed to realize what was going on, and if this was the only way to do it, then, well, so be it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe worked pretty hard on the story, and she was spending a lot of meals grabbing more fast food than she normally had, and less home cooked meals with Jim, who understood given his prior role at the paper. However, this meant that Madison put on a bit more weight than she had before, bringing her up past 215 pounds. Most of it was contained in Madison's enlarged behind, but her thighs also looked enlarged as well, and she could swear that her shirts sleeves were a bit tighter in her upper arms. This wasn't the same crisis that it was for her last year, but nonetheless, she was hoping the weight would stop soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that week, Madison posted the story, and she left the questions up to the readers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Walk on policy a loser.\" Madison thought the title could have used work, but what the heck, it's not like she was a copywriter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Powers soccer team is rebulding after last year's 2-10 disaster and we have a new coach. In farness its way too esrly to second-guess him on most things. However this writer and the Proclaimer are puzzled by one bit of trivia - and possibly Powers University soccer fans will be too.:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is a policy in place, new this year, excluding from tryouts potential walk-on players? Especially when this singularly impacts a potential player with a proven high school record? One who came here sincerely hoping to be a part of the program at Powers? And who has alresdy, according to our information, now been offered a slot next year at another school?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A request to inteview our new coach about the newly modified walk-on policy was not responded to after two days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This writer has never met the player in question, has never seen her play, has no idea if she'd totally bomb out if given an opportunity. Our new coach may already be so loaded to the gills with potential world cup class talent that he's had to holler \"no mas, por favor.\" But, seeing thst 80% of the team are veterans of last year's disaster, I for one doubt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in coach - loosen up! What harm can come from at least giving the new gal a chance to compete!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe article was being talked about around campus, and Madison liked the new attention that it was getting. The next morning, at the Proclaimer office, she wrote an email to the coach, hoping for a response from the article, but still, nothing. \"Hmm, you think she would be more apt to respond after some of the PR,\" Madison wondered. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alison continued her occasional workouts, with or without the help of Kelsey when available. She was determined to stay in shape, and had a front row seat to what happened if you stopped paying attention, in Madison and her friends. However, even with the desire to stay thin, occasional lapses were bound to happen, such as the one she had after her date with Kevin a few days back, where she got back to her room and had a rather large slice of cherry cheesecake after a decent sized dinner, or the more frequent ice cream after dinner. However, she told herself these things were okay, she worked out, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she would never admit it, part of the desire to stay thin was a point of pride, she had been thin in high school, so she wanted that status to continue in college. The other part was athletics, which she greatly enjoyed. Her now recreational tennis habit, after a pretty good run in high school, was something that she wanted to keep at, and she knew that she looked pretty hot when she was out there in her informal uniform. She knew that Kevin had mentioned that he played tennis as well from their date, so she texted him, and decided, \"hey, if I look hot, and I could smoke him in a match, why have I not done this yet?\" So she jumped on the phone, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hey Kev--tennis this afternoon? Can meet at the courts. Want to see game you have been tlking up.  </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin received this text and got excited. Another chance to hang out with Alison was something that he would happily accept. However, as he looked around his dorm, he realized that he left his racquet back home. \"Rats...okay...who would have one?\" he thought. Kevin walked over to Clark's room, figuring maybe he by some chance had one and had just never mentioned it. \"Hey Clark, you got a tennis racquet I can borrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a matter of fact, I do.\" Clark's was an older one that he hadn't used for a while. He actually starred at it while he was unpacking a while back, and wondered why he had even brought it to Powers. He went into his closet and pulled it out, \"Playing with Alison?\" he remarked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what gave me away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, why else would you play?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin almost chuckled at the by product his conversation with his friends, before he said goodbye to Clark and headed out. Kevin just wore some standard athletic shorts and a t, and walked over to the courts. When he got over, he saw Alison in what he assumed was her workout gear. She was wearing pink tennis shoes, an expensive brand, somewhat out of his image of her. He looked up her lean legs and thighs, towards the tight green (her high school colors) short shorts she was wearing. She also had a high school practice shirt on, which was tight and showed just a hint of her toned midsection, along with a little logo of her high school mascot, The Norse (something Kevin wanted to playfully make fun of her for). Her racquet was a nice brand, and although she was just casually checking her phone, Kevin wondered if he was even a bit intimidated by someone who clearly had some experience in this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you ready?\" Alison said as she casually put her phone into a gym bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, let's see what you have.\" Kevin replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison wasn't about to hold back just because she liked Kevin, she had never slouched off before in the sport, so why start now? She served and although she felt rusty from her high school varsity days, it was more than enough to make a novice like Kevin fumble while trying to return. As the ball hit his racquet and flew backwards into the backstop, she realized just how much of an upper hand she had. \"Oh, poor Kev, he is about to get killed,\" she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the match didn't differ much. A Kevin had a few flukes, or balls she decided were not worth charging the net for, given the huge lead she would open up. But by the end, she had won straight sets without much of an effort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" said a gassed Kevin, \"I had no idea you were this good.\" After the last point wiffed past him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I had some good coaching growing up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin was covered in sweat, but he was surprised to see her breaking some as well, given the effortless win she exerted on him. She had a bit of sweat on her back, and over her hairline. He wondered if that would have happened prior to coming to Powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I lost, how about I treat us to smoothies at the Union?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went over to the smoothie stand in the student union, which was a bit of a walk from the courts. Alison felt this to be a pretty safe option, given the healthy reputation that smoothies hold. However, what she didn't realize, was the sugar in these ones. The large strawberry kiwi one that she ordered, actually put away about 850 calories. Kevin had read an article about how some smoothies were in a sneaky way loaded with sugar and calories, but what was he going to say to her? Hey, btw, you're ordering too much? No. Plus, it's not like he didn't still have curious thoughts about that. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Michael, Kelli, Eric and Liz were ready to double date and take advantage of two student discounts: a restaurant deal thru restaurant.com and the 2:1 concert tickets from the Powers student center. Michael had become somewhat of a culinary and performing arts wizard squiring Kelli about and Eric was impressed. He expected that the total evening would cost each couple less than $50.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they considered the modest but authentic menu a costumed waitress furnished them with two baskets of complimentary homemade tortilla chips with salsa. Michael declared his preference for the double chile rellano dinner  while Kelli went with the #1 combo, which includes a corn beef taco, bean tostada and a cheese enchilada.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric held back, wondering what Liz would do. He knew she was a former plumper and he was curious to see how disciplined she was now. At the same time he was wrestling with his own conscience for even caring.

It was a contest to which Michsael and Kelli were oblivious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think I should have a pair of sanchos or the carne asada?\u201d Liz  asked Eric, who hadn\u2019t a clue as to what either one was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSanchos are tortilla with beef, beans, cheese and lettuce rolled up \u2013 sort of a fancy burrito\u201d Michael explained. \u201cCarne asada is a flank steak entr\u00e9e with pico del gallo sauce and is usually served with rice and beans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d Eric replied, totally flummoxed by Michael\u2019s knowledge. Liz obviously knew Mexican food better than he did and Eric felt like an ignoramus. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we order one of each and both share?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds great to me,\u201d replied Liz, who was starved after deliberately skipping lunch and actually eager to try some of both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were waiting for their orders to arrive Liz asked Kelli how Kelsey felt about the Proclaimer article about the bullheaded soccer coaching policy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s expecting some sort of reaction from the coach and figures there\u2019s nothing to lose, but so far nothing.\u201d Kelli informed her.  \u201cBut she did get a call from the local paper\u2019s sports writer asking about her soccer qualifications. Now that this things been opened I don\u2019t think its going away.  But she told the reporter that she wasn\u2019t planning to push the issue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to. The alumni will create enough of a ruckus I think,\u201d declared Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but after yesterday and today\u2019s breakfast training I can tell you she\u2019s  a disciplinarian. If she gets a chance she\u2019ll give it 110%,\u201d Kellli observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d replied Michael \u201cShe\u2019s starting to teach you cooking, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and it isn\u2019t what I feared. Actually the first meal was great \u2013 an omelet made up of two eggs, smoked salmon, asparagus and goat cheese. BUT here\u2019s the weird thing. Once we laid out the ingredients she put us thru an exercise with barbells and leg raises. Hers weighed ten pounds and she treated them like they had the weight of napkins. i struggled to do ten with a five pound set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds she\u2019s in condition,\u201d observed Eric with a tone of awe in his voice..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, she\u2019s an exercise freak who wants to be an athlete \u2013 but yeah. I don\u2019t mind being heavier but it was a little humiliating. Then she surprised me by saying she wasn\u2019t doing the calisthenics because of either of our weights, but to help me want to cook and eat right. Its all part of her zen, whatever that means.\u201d Kelli shared<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd so what happened the second morning? \u201c asked Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOrient express oatmeal \u2013 that\u2019s made with blueberries , with multi-grain waffles with more berries. She says that\u2019s for anti-oxidents. I don\u2019t know about that but it was delicious.\u201d Kelli acknowledged. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd so you think you could cook these now?\u201d asked Michsael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably, but not as fast or as organized as her.\u201d Kelli grimaced. \u201dShe says she expects me to do this regularly once I get the hang of it and she\u2019ll help pay for most of the food \u2013 she realizes good ingredients aren\u2019t cheap and wants to get away from the stuff in the dining hall. She claims I\u2019ll eventually lose my taste for bagels if we get rid of gluten and white sugar at the start of the day and replace them with protein and anti-oxidants. But at least she\u2019s communicating \u2013 which is the good thing. We may even get to like each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet she only had one waffle but you had more,\u201d observed Liz. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually we each had two, but you\u2019re right. I usually eat more than she lets herself. But that isn\u2019t what this is about. I\u2019m actually learning my way round he kitchen while getting her to loosen up on comments about my size,\u201d gushed Kelli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re with Michael \u2013 what\u2019s that to her?\u201d commented Eric<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I used to be smaller than now and I looked down on bigger people. I\u2019m still not really fat but I see things different after having gained some. She\u2019s just in a different world.  Maybe by June we\u2019ll better understand one another\u2019s reality.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, its definitely healthy cooking,\u201d Liz agreed. \u201cbetter than the tofu and cottage cheese I would have feared for sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, she says you need to know what you\u2019re cooking and be careful not to lose nutrients \u2013 stuff like licopane in tomatoes and stuff in avocados that is good for your heart. She has a version of egg mcmuffin using lean turkey, tomato and avocado that we\u2019re doing Monday that she swears is both better and more healthy than McDonalds,\u201d cooed Kelli with anticipation.  \u201cI know that even I can cook a muffin in the toaster, peal an avocado and slice a tomato!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI say congratulations and I want a breakfast invitation as soon as you\u2019re ready,\u201d Michael chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point the food arrived and the two couples spent the next half hour devouring it. Eric deliberately held back to see what Liz would do and she chattered amiably, then wound up eating over half of their shared meals, confirming his suspicion that the former plumper would likely regain herr lost pounds. . But he enjoyed their conversation and was surprised at the comfortableness Kelli and Michael had with the newly minted BBW\u2019s size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround 7:00 they drove over to the two hour country and western concert.  Michael and Eric waited in line at the pickup window while the girls sat on a bench, Kelli being noticeably the larger of the two. Ric remarked that it sounded like Kelli was getting an education.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts been a year of changing paradigms for both of us,\u201d Michael acknowledged. \u201cShe used to rag on bigger girls and now she\u2019s become one- but she\u2019s nicer for it, even though I don\u2019t know if she yet realizes how big she really is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to mind,\u201d Eric noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, not at all. She happier and better this way and I love her,\u201d he declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the concert Michael suggested hitting the local DQ and the others went along.  Eric had a Blyzard along with his three companions, quietly thinking to himself that maybe he needed to reevaluate his biases.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sandy finished the last class of her day, giving her books to Robert and promising to meet her after the meeting that she\u2019d reluctantly agreed to. He watched as his girlfriend walked towards the Powers University administration building. She was attired in black slacks with a loose fitting Liz Claiborne button front tank top. They\u2019d both been picked up the day before at J C Penny. Beneath the sheer snake print pattern e knew there lay a stretchy camisole that insured a modest appearance to the scoopneck top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe objective, Robert knew, was to minimize Sandy\u2019s food baby belly in the upcoming meeting. Over the last few weeks it had stopped receding a few hours past a meal. Instead it had simply become an ever present bulge in Sandy\u2019s gradually expanding belly.  This was due to her constant feeding of the food baby every 3-4 hours.  For her and Robert this was not a problem, but in light of the Bud Ramsey situation it had landed her a referral to the school psychologist after a deposition by Ramsey\u2019s counsel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy disappeared into the building and took the elevator to the third floor. She walked down the corridor to room A-312 and noted the sign, Dr. Janelle Farnsworth.  Inhaling deeply she knocked and was greeted by a cordial  \u201ccome on in \u2013 its open.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting behind the desk was a pleasant looking brunette with glasses. Sandy estimated her to be in her mid-forties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou re Sandra, I presume?  Be seated,\u201d the brunette psychologist offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra complied, feeling like she was under a microscope, although Dr. Farnsworth hadn\u2019t said or done anything hostile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know you\u2019ve been referred to me because of the Ramsey matter,\u201d Dr Farnsworth began, coming to the point swiftly. \u201cI\u2019ve read the papers I can imagine its been more than a little stressful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, especially with the media pestering me for interviews that the police and district attorney have told me not to give. But I\u2019m handling it. My social life and grades are both fine. I honestly don\u2019t really know why I\u2019m up here. I\u2019m aware that I just have to be patient until the trial.\u201d Sandra declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s it?\u201d Dr Farnsworth pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the deposition from the defense took a whole day and was a nightmare. My stress level went through the roof for a few days after that one. But I got past it,\u201d Sandra admitted a little defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what did you do to get past it?\u201d came he next question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve always done. Find something to eat and enjoy that rather than dwelling on what\u2019s done and can\u2019t be changed. And, yes, I know that\u2019s why I\u2019m probably up here,\u201d retorted Sandra. \u201cSome people have made remarks that I\u2019ve been scarfing food like it was on a sale that ends tomorrow,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, some seem to feel the stress has increased your appetite and it might be affecting you in other ways,\u201d concurred Dr. Farnsworth with a smile. At least this student wasn\u2019t trying to hide anything..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yes, I have probably been eating a little more than normal  to keep from focusing on all the chaos.  But it hasn\u2019t caused me to gain enough to be worried about. Actually its been rather enjoyable to eat a little more and my boy friends cool with it.\u201d Sandra replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould I ask how much you\u2019ve gained?\u201d the doctor inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know and really don\u2019t care to find out because then I might feel I had to do something about it, which frankly I\u2019m not interested in right now. I just wish the pound police would mind their own business instead of turning me in to you..\u201d Sandy declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you must realize that eating disorders can and do occur, and the authorities plus a lot of parents expect us to be vigilant. May I ask what did you had for breakfast this morning?\u201d asked Ms, Farnsworth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWaffles with strawberries and scrambled eggs and hash browns in the Powers University dining hall as I recall,\u201d answered Sandy truthfully but leaving out how many and how much.  It had been three waffles and a double scoop of the other two items \u2013 definitely a larger than average portion.  \u201cAnd, before you ask, a quesadilla for lunch along with a piece of coconut cream pie. I don\u2019t pretend to be on a low calorie diet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd in the evening?\u201d Pressed Dr. Farnsworth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy meal plan only allows two dining hall meals so I eat with my roommate or go out \u2013 usually once or twice with my boy friend and on Thursdays the girls on our floor have been ordering in pizza.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about afternoon and evening snacks \u2013 ever take time for those?\u201d inquired Dr Farnsworth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes. I don\u2019t keep a diary. But doesn\u2019t everyone?\u201d Sandy shot back, knowing full well hat for her both happened nearly every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome do, not everyone. But its how much and often that adds up,\u201d the Dr. acknowledged. \u201cHow many calories a day do you think you are ingesting?\u201d <br>\r\n.<br>\r\n\u201cProbably more than the average \u2013 but I exercise and burn a lot. But yes, I know I\u2019ve added few pounds. Shouldn\u2019t that be my affair?\u201d demanded Sandra,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you are over eighteen and an adult. And I\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t eat and weigh whatever what you choose. But if you wish we could offer help \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike shots or pills or something?  No thanks.  If I think I\u2019m getting too big I\u2019ll trying working it out on my own. For now I\u2019d just appreciate your telling the busybodies to stop wasting your time trying to run my life. As I said, I\u2019m totally enjoying being a little fleshier and eating whatever I want.  Now, is there anything else?\u201d Sandy demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess not,\u201d Dr Farnsworth sighed. \u201cYou can go and I\u2019ll certify that you are healthy and aware of your own life situation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, I\u2019d appreciate that\u201d said Sandy as she got up to leave.  Dr Farnsworth noticed that through the newly purchased slacks the freshman\u2019s thighs were touching and that Sandy had to subconsciously adjust her waistband as she arose. This was obviously a co-ed gaining weight but not one who needed or wanted her help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I've seen the pattern before,\"</i> thought Dr. Fsarnsworth. <i>\"They are destined to become what they will be if they don't want help now. I just hope it works out for her, Maybe after the trial she'll have a different view, but I doubt it.\"</i><br>\r\nSandy left the building thinking about what she hadn\u2019t told Dr Farnsworth, but suspected rhe good doctor knew. She was ingesting around 4000 calories a day, twice as many as normally required for someone of her age an height, but only burning off 1000 extra. This meant that she was probably gaining two pounds a week, but really didn\u2019t care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe met Robert waiting in her car and gave him a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, let\u2019s find a fast food place with some good burritos and I\u2019ll tell you what happened\u201d she said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kevin just sat down for lunch after a typical slate of morning classes. He was liking them more than high school, the more independent nature of a college course, with less busy work, and more individual emphasis on studying fit him well. For some students, it could have led to lower grades, but for a self starter like Kevin, the extra time spent studying, and not doing things like worksheets for a participation grade, was something he favored. If he knew it was building to something useful, he was fine putting in the effort. If it was busy work that wasn't going to lead anywhere, than it annoyed him. At the moment, Kevin was early to lunch, alone for the moment, and wondering which category his relationship with Alison fell into. Something meaningful, or busywork? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, they had gone on two \"dates\" but had either really addressed it like that? The first one was a group dinner, and the second was a game of tennis, where he wondered if he had embarrassed himself. At that moment, Clark sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was class?\" Kevin asked Clark, who looked a bit annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, you know, same old stuff,\" Clark was waiting for the weekend, and this midweek lunch seemed like the furthest point from the fun of the weekend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey aren't these supposed to be our glory days?\" asked a semi-joking Kevin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't think many people look back fondly on Tuesday mornings of mid-week, regardless of the point in their life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touche.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got to talking about other things, and the conversation shifted towards Kevin's game of Tennis,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how did that Tennis game go?\" Clark asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh, let's be thankful that it never got on tape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yikes, did my racquet survive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. There were no rage incidents or racquet throws, but Alison smoked me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark took this as a chance to see how things were going with that, \"So what is the status of you and Alison?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think we're progressing. Neither of us have really gotten anywhere near romantic...just kind of feeling it out I guess.\" With that Clark raised his eyebrows and started to smile, Kevin realized the bad wording, \"Ok,\" he stated, \"figuratively feeling it out, not...yeah, ok.\" Luckily, that awkward moment was broken up by Eric, who was sitting down with his lunch. Eric pleasantly greeted them, and Kevin got to asking about Clark's life, \"So, how do the prospects look?\" Clark knew what he was reffing to, \"I don't know, I may just play the field, although I think Kelsey is really hot, I just need an in with her, to see how it goes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it never came up, him and Liz were also in kind of the same area as Alison and Kevin, maybe a bit further. Eric seemed absentminded during the lunch, as he had been for a few days after his date with  Liz. He was trying to figure out what he would think if she pilled on some of the weight she had lost. She knew that Liz did it in part because of her critical mother's influence, so he wondered if there was something deeper there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Liz, she had continued to indulge. Unlike Alison and Kelsey, and even Madison, who were often in a hurry and skipped breakfast, Liz was always sure to go to the dinning hall and grab some bacon for breakfast. It was another vice that was coming out during her first semester at Powers, combined with the rest of the food she was eating, it was only a matter of time before she started to see some effects. </span></div></div>",

Athletic Department Chair James A Fredericks stood as she entered. President Harrison gestured for them to both be seated, then sat down himself and took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ve all read the <i>Proclaimer</i> article last week \u2013 and the follow-up editorial asking why the Athletic Department isn\u2019t willing to respond plus a listing of this Kelsey girl\u2019s high school records. Ms Thornburg has advised me that she shares their interest. Jim, is it true that you\u2019ve refused to be interviewed?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be interviewed about in Coach Woolsey\u2019s opinion. He did change the policy as claimed and intends to keep it. This Kelsey girl was unfortunately caught in the transition but we can\u2019t let the school paper dictate school policy\u201d Chairman Fredericks asserted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven if it\u2019s a bad policy and a losing team misses out on a possible plsayer who could help them?\u201d queried Rebecca. \u201cMaybe she\u2019ll turn out to be a total no talent, but her high school record indicates this is not the case. My concern is the lack of opportunity to prove one\u2019s self one way or the other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean Harrison realized that he needed to clarify things regarding the <i>Proclaimer</i> . \u201cProfessor Hastings runs the Journalism Department and he is encouraging the student staff to be more pro-active. I\u2019ve told him that he has the Board's and my full support as long as they stick to facts.  Have they been inaccurate Jim?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChairman Fredericks squirmed. \u201cNo \u2013 they appear to have dug up this Kelsey\u2019s genuine high school records. Under the old rules she definitely would have been a leading contender. \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean Harrison furrowed his brow. \u201cSo they do have a point that you need to deal with \u2013 stonewalling isn\u2019t going to work. Didn\u2019t I hear something about Janice Anderson getting injured?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but she\u2019lll be back within a month.\u201d Chairman Frdericks replied. He wanted to support his soccer coach but he knew the policy shift had been sudden and personally regretted its impact<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill, who\u2019s replacing her? Isn\u2019t the team going to be one person short during training?\u201d President Harrison pressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying give her an opportunity to strut her stuff during training without calling it a walk-on?\u201d asked Dr. Fredericks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo guarantees, but an opportunity Would you find that a suitable compromise, Rebecca,\u201d President Harrison looked at the Alumni Association president her hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is certainly better than nothing \u2013 and you can be sure we\u2019ll be monitoring the results,\u201d she replied. Rebecca Thornburg was tough but also realistic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.  Now Michael you can call the <i>Proclaimer</i> with a statement. I suggest you get it in soon for this Thursday\u2019s issue,\u201d intoned President Harrison with a look that said he considered that his suggestion would quickly become an accomplished fact.  He had other business pending with the Alumni and this issue needed to be put to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day Alison saw Kelsey in the gym and immediately greeted her, \u201cHey Kel, what about the great news?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat news?\u201d asked Kelsey, who was totally clueless as to what Alison could be referring to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c You haven\u2019t heard?\u201d Alison gushed barely taking a breath.  \u201cMadison got a call from the Athletic Department. They\u2019ve issued a statement that you\u2019re going to be part of the preseason training team since someone got hurt and that your long term involvement will be decided at a future date. Its going to be published in Thursday\u2019s <i>Proclaimer</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey was taken by surprise. She\u2019d spent the morning teaching Kelli how to make mock mashed potatoes using chopped cauliflower, then gone to classes. She hadn\u2019t been near the gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. I guess I\u2019d better check into this,\u201d she reacted with her mind swirling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey turned on her cell phone and found she had four messages. The first confirmed that the report was true. Her first practice would be at 4:00 the next afternoon, then three times a week thereafter for five weeks, assuming she was agreeable. With related conditioning exercises she quickly realized this was going to take serious free time from her schedule but she had no intention of declining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter acknowledging the message Kelsey dashed back to her dorm apartment, hoping to catch Kelli in, which she was. She shared the good news with Kelli and asked if she could not only do the cooking but also some of the other chores - for suitable payment of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelli had been bonding with Kelsey over the last week as her understudy and decided to go along. It never hurt to be indispensible to someone. Relieved, Kelsey went off to work out. Kelli, knowing there was already a healthful green bean and mushroom casserole in the refrigerator for her and Kelsey later that night, called Michael and the two of them went out for a quick sundae.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to his own dorm Michael ran into Clark and shared the news with him. Clark was both surprised and ecstatic.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cMaybe Kelsey will be willing to celebrate,\u201d </i>he thought. <i>\u201cThis could be my chance to go out with her.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAloud he simply said to Kelli\u2019s boyfriend, \u201cI\u2019m happy to hear that. Do you think maybe we could make it a foursome for Saturday with Kelsey and Kelli?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably. But you should know that Kelsey\u2019s a bit of a health nut, so don\u2019t be surprised if she just has salad,\u201d Michael replied.  Clark shrugged, indicating that didn\u2019t matter to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael knew what to do. First he went to Kelli and Kelsey\u2019s apartment and announced that he and Clark wanted to celebrate her opportunity with a dinner. He asked Kelsey if she\u2019d accept an invitation.  Kelsey, who hadn\u2019t yet been out on a date at Powers, didn\u2019t want to offend so agreed.  Later on in the evening she got a direct invitation from Clark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, going to the Internet, Michael arranged for a pair of 2:1 discount coupons for an mid-scale eatery known as the Bedrock Canyon Grill. This he thought would be sure to get them out for under $30 per couple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they entered the grill three evenings later Clark was with Kelsey behind Michael and the full figured Kelli. Her hips seemed possibly wider than that of her escort and Clark could discern the growing collops building on the backside of her rib cage. Kelli might be trying to downplay her size but Clark knew she was fooling no one. She was obviously over fifty pounds larger than Kelsey and as big as Jessica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also however noticed something else. Kelli somehow exuded a confidence and vibrancy that showed. Clark had to admit that, dressed in her lime colored top and black slacks the fulsome chick looked compatible with Michael. He even had to admit that she looked good, something which in passing puzzled him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon being seated they were given a courtesy order of the Grill\u2019s famous iron skillet cornbread.  Kelsey immediately sensed that she needed to be on guard but Kelli eagerly grabbed the first piece. She then began  salivating as she perused the extensive menu,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou might enjoy the Chicken Enchilada platter,\u201d suggested Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dUmmmm,\" cooed Kelli. \u201cCorn tortillas filled with rotisserie chicken, topped with monterey jack and salsa verde. With sour cream and guacamole.  You do know how to pick tasty items.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think the Shanghai Chicken Salad  might be more my style\u201d said Kelsey, carefully avoiding any references to calories but attracting Clark\u2019s attention anyway. \u201cIt has celery, carrots, toasted almonds, sesame seeds, mandarin oranges, and rotisserie chicken, all tossed in a spicy Asian peanut dressing and topped with crispy rice noodles. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark chewed his lip thoughtfully. \u201cThis is a steakhouse, and I\u2019m a meat and potatoes type. I think I\u2019ll go with the ribeye. Its hand cut and hardwood\u200f grilled  with canyon mushrooms, then served with redskin mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael grinned.  \u201cMy thoughts  exactly. We\u2019ll make that two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelli reached for her second piece of corn bread while Kelsey continued to hold back while trying not to be conspicuous, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the meal ordered Michael and Kelli began consciously plying Kelsey with questions. Clark joined in although he wasn\u2019t in on the game, which was to help Kelsey have a great time by getting her to talk about her favorite subject \u2013 herself!  In the process Clark got to know a great deal about Kelsey.  Now it remained to be seen if he would ask her out on his own.  The good news was that she felt comfortable with him and would likely say yes if he opportunity arose. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liz was a committed breakfast eater. Unlike Calli, Kelsey, Madison and Alison (all of whom could wait till lunch at will) Liz knew that not eating her first meal would destroy her focus in class. That is why she faithfully stopped by the Power\u2019s University dining hall each morning and had an egg plus a strip or two of bacon.  She was trying not to regain her lost pounds, but being energized for her classes took priority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew better than to follow Sandra\u2019s ballooning example.  Her classmate thought nothing of adding 2-3 pancakes to a serving of eggs double the size of what Liz had. Or if not pancakes, then a pastry with hash browns. Sandy liked to justify her eating as from the stress of the Ramsey trial, but Liz didn\u2019t believe it. She\u2019d noticed Sandy eating even more during the complimentary meal week before school , even bragging about her food baby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer familiarity with Sandra\u2019s patterns didn\u2019t stop with breakfast. The multi story dorm building they shared had a certain social rhythm. Callie and Madison hosted a pizza night for interested coeds on Thursdays. Of course Sandy loved pizza so always came over; Liz lived with Callie and saw her each week, routinely devouring 5-6 pieces to Liz\u2019s 2-3. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark and Jessica ate in on Wednesdays and of course automatically included Sandy as Jessica\u2019s roommate. Liz had been invited twice and noted that Sandy had seconds on about everything, including double rolls and dessert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert had friends who had parties on Sunday and Tuesday plus usually ideas of his own for Friday and Saturday. Liz knew he tried to encourage Sandy to eat her fill and had never seen him fail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis pattern Liz knew meant that Sandra was eating large meals or party food  every night but Monday, which happen to be one of the three evenings Liz\u2019s own roommate Callie was working in the campus Library.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree weeks into the school year, just after Kelsey\u2019s big break, Liz was planning on having breakfast in the dining hall on Monday about the same time as Sandra. They decided to sit together and Liz noticed that Sandy was having her typical large breakfast \u2013 eggs, corn beef hash, and a large jelly filled pastry.  Sandy had to adjust her slacks a bit in sitting down and Liz wondered if maybe they were feeling snug.  As a former plumper herself she knew the signs as pants grew too small for the belly within. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls were on short time for class, but Sandy invited Liz over for supper. Liz accepted, not knowing what to expect.  That evening she found out. A broasted chicken from the supermarket, baked potatoes with sour cream, green beans and a store bought pie.  Sandra wanted to share her feelings about the news media pestering her regarding the trial \u2013 which she couldn\u2019t respond to per the police and prosecutors. Then she wanted to watch a movie for relaxation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz, seeing that Sandy was indeed a little stressed and not wanting to be alone, went along with this. She actually had a good time. Unlike the partying Sandra, Liz had been becoming a book worm. At the end of the evening Sandra asked if they could do this regularly and Liz agreed to \u201cif she could.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz by this point was feeling rather secure about her own weight issues. She hadn\u2019t noticed any re-gain of her lost pounds and she was getting dates. She began to relax some of her morning discipline. Instead of one egg she allowed herself two. Instead of two strips of bacon it became three. Then she began to have an English muffin or a piece of toast \u2013 with jelly of course.  It was more filling and she felt it helped tide her over to lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunch was also at the dining hall. The first few weeks Liz would typically have a small salad and possibly a half sandwich.  But she was always kind of hungry by afternoon, so the week before dining with Sandy she started having a little more. Like the larger breakfasts it seemed to succeed in keeping her from becoming hungry before supper. Her guard fell further and further. The day after her dinner with Sandra she actually had a dessert with her lunch. It was heavenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the week Liz zoned out, eating whatever she felt like. Had she been counting she would have noted that her total caloric intake had jumped by a thousand calories a day to nearly 2500.  And by the next Monday, her scheduled supper with Sandra, she had figured out what was likely to happen even without the numbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel guilty tonight,\u201d she confided to Sandy after helping demolish a casserole with an ice cream sundae for dessert. \u201cI\u2019ve been letting myself eat like crazy this past week and I know its going to show. The insane thing is, I don\u2019t want to stop.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen don\u2019t,\u201d her fellow freshman replied. \u201cI\u2019ve gained a few pounds this year myself and don\u2019t care. Haven\u2019t you noticed how big some of the sophomores are and they\u2019re handing it. Who are we foollng? Some of us enjoy eating. Big whoopee!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy\u2019s bluntness surprised her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t mind getting larger?\u201d she exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I did would I be partying so much and eating so much at the dining hall?  I know I tell people its all from stress, but that\u2019s a cover. Sure, I\u2019m stressed but I actually enjoy playing with my chub, and so does Robert\u201d Sandy declared. \u201cI\u2019ll probably get as big as Kelli or Madison eventually and I don\u2019t care.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about your parents?\u201d Liz inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs long as I make a 3.5 average and am happy they could care less Its my life and body!\u201d Sandy declared. \u201cThat\u2019s why I could kiss off that busy body psychologist I told you about. I wish Madison would do an expose in the <i>Proclaimer</i> on her for snooping where no one should be. If I enjoy being thicker that\u2019s no one else\u2019s business and a problem that\u2019s not a real problem that needs solving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sound like you\u2019d like to abolish weight related ads,\u201d observed Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefinitely. They give false hope, don\u2019t work and those who really need to lose weight usually can\u2019t do it without a doctor. Its not done by someone giving phony baloney hope in an ad,\u201d railed Sandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish my mom were so open minded,\u201d Liz replied. \u201cI didn\u2019t mind being plump but it was all that I heard about \u2018till I lost it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand and feel for you.  But, yeah, I like being a little thicker,\u201d repeated Sandy. \u201cI also have Robert, but I know you don\u2019t have anyone in your corner like Mike, Jim or Tom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that would help. I think then I could stand up better to mom,\u201d admitted  Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards she went home and looked in the refrigerator. She found a half empty box of mini-\u00e9clairs and, knowing Callie wouldn\u2019t mind, had an extra dessert before bed. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liz wished that she had a more understanding Mom like Sandy's, however, she doubted she would ever be able to say any of what Sandy told her back to her Mom. Her Mom was image obsessed. It could of come from their high social standing, or maybe even her Mom's own insecurities, but Liz highly doubted that her Mom would ever be fine with her gaining much weight at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this did not keep Liz from further indulging. She was often slipping bacon into her breakfasts, something that she often joked was her main vice. She was never going to find any protest from her roommate either, Cassi often had snacks around the room, and Liz saw her eating them in most of her spare time, or to help her study. Liz and Allison had talked when they first got to campus about how their roommates had each gained so much weight the year before, and this seemed to be the reason, for anytime after lunch that Cassie seemed to be coming or going from something, even something pseudo athletic, like a swim, she had some kind of food in her hand. <br>\r\n----<br>\r\nClark had been quite pleased about how the date the evening before went. He learned a lot about Kelsey, and she seemed more than willing to share her triumphant evening with him. He called Michael to ask how it had gone. Michael confirmed that it had indeed been a hit. After Michael got off the phone with Kelly, he asked about it, \"So,\" he asked Kelly, \"what did you think about last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It went really well!\" The blonde said, \"Actually, Kelsey and I were talking, and I think that she wanted to go out with Clark again, soon.\" Michael was pleased with this info. He was relayed it to Clark, who was now trying to think of another good date idea, and smitten with himself, that he was laying the groundwork to get with an athlete. An athlete on the team for odd reasons? Yes. But still, and athlete, went his reasoning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was rather bored that same morning walking back from two classes that felt like they would never end when she got a text from Allison, asking if she was interested in hanging out. Liz was pleasantly surprised by the text, since it seemed like Allison and Kelsey usually worked out at this time, but she responded and they met at in Allison's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz walked in, \"Hey, where is Madison?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's working at the paper right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, she didn't tell me, I guess we'll find out later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guessed you would be out exercising with Kelsey right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, actually you wouldn't guess it, but her being on the team may cut that down a little bit,\" Allison said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, why is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as long as she is on the soccer team, she is going to be practicing with them, and doing drills specific to the sport. So that leaves me on the outside for the time being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that sucks.\" Liz replied, trying to be sympathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm happy for her.\" Allison wasn't lying, she was pleased that a friend who she thought was getting a raw deal had a chance to show her stuff. However, it was also true that Allison was now lacking for a workout partner. She wondered about asking Liz. She also wondered if Liz looked a bit fuller? Maybe she would want to make sure that didn't turn into anything else?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Allison noted, \"want to go to the gym with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I'm a bit hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, there will be hot guys! And plus, it feels really good when you're done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz sat there...she wanted to have lunch, but maybe she could convince Allison to come with her to the dinning hall instead?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liz waffled. She wanted to help Alison, but after two energy-draining classes since having a light breakfast with Sandy she was hungry.  Then she remembered something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pensively replied \u201cAlison, to be honest, I didn\u2019t eat much for breakfast and have two more classes to go.  But besides, aren\u2019t we both on the two meal a day plan for the dining hall?  If we don\u2019t use our voucher for lunch we lose it, because neither of us are coming here tonight \u2013 its Thursday and we\u2019ll be at Madison\u2019s for pizza.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison sighed. She knew Liz was both right on her facts and obviously not interested in the gym.  She decided she could work out another time and turned towards the dining hall. Her own breakfast hadn\u2019t been that large either and maybe she could just have a salad..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they entered they ran into Greg Williams and Don Snyder, two fellow freshman they both knew by name but not much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreetings,\u201d said Greg. \u201cGoing to lunch I assume?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied Alison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts pretty crowded at this hour. Mind if we share a table with you girls?\u201d he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison glanced at Liz, who smiled and shrugged her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, why not? Its not like we\u2019re carrying on secret negotiations affecting the fate of the world,\u201d Alison joked sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four freshman loaded their trays and found a vacant able. Alison had a tuna salad with some fries on the side. Liz chose a jalape\u00f1o cheeseburger, also with fries.  Greg served himself spaghetti with meatballs and vegetables. Don had mashed potatoes wth chicken thighs and peas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPowers U does have variety in its dining hall,\u201d Don remarked as he glanced at the variety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and its all good, \u201c agreed Greg as he wound his spaghetti on his fork, then glancing at Liz, \u201cBy the way, weren\u2019t you mixed up in this court deal that\u2019s been in the paper?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndirectly, yes. I knew the name of the guy who pestered Sandy, Bud Ramsey. He\u2019d approached me the week before but not so directly and it never got reported then. How did you know\u201d Liz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone in the dorm brought it up that you were the one who told Sandy his name. I\u2019m glad the guy is off the street.\u201d Greg remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, the way to best pick up girls is to invite them to a group party and get to know them and they get to learn to trust you,\u201d Don concurred, \u201cwhich of course is part of why we wanted to talk to you two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?,\u201d said Allison, who preferred the change in topic,\u201cYou\u2019re doing a party?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our dorm is doing one Saturday \u2013 no liquor but plenty of food, dancing and games,\u201d Greg stated. \u201cIt begins at 6:00 with a buffet supper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore food for the famished fems,\u201d Liz chimed in. \u201cNo wonder no one loses any weight around here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd this is bad because?\u201d asked Don. \u201cNeither of you look like you have a thing to worry about. But for the record I prefer plump to snobby any day!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d said Greg. \u201cThink you can make it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t see why not. I want to meet new people,\u201d Alison replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCount me in as well,\u201d said Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd with that negotiation completed, I offer you delightful ladies your choice of dessert, which of course is on the house\u201d Don offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison hesitated but Liz almost eagerly said \u201cWhat are you having?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApple pie with vanilla ice cream,\u201d said Greg<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI noticed some oversized brownies with nuts,\u201d replied Don.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go with the pie a la mode,\u201d Liz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison, not wanting to offend, took a deep breath and said  \u201cI guess I\u2019ll go with the same.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four freshmen finished their meal and dashed off to their classes, with Don taking special note of Liz\u2019s slightly plump form.  None of them noticed a visibly agitated Robert in an animated discussion with Sandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you assured her that I\u2019m my own person and run my own life, but she does have nerve,\u201d Sandy was exclaiming, talking about her nemesis, Dr Janelle Farnsworth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I want to know is who it is that is yanking her chain,\u201d Robert groused. \u201cShe rather pointedly asked me how many times a week we eat together, like she already knew. I pointed out to her that you had an appetite before we started  going together. Sure, I like it but I didn\u2019t invent it, so I can\u2019t be held responsible as the cause. But she flat out asked whether I was encouraging you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, do you think, would she say that\u201d Sandy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think because Bud Ramsey, or more probably his attorney, expects you to blame your weight gain on him to get the sympathy of the jury, like it\u2019s a kind of revenge. He was sort of a fatophobe about your friends when he was trying to get you to give in to him.\u201d Robert speculated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, there is that, but its crazy. If anything eating helps me not think about him but I\u2019d do it anyway\u201d Sandy protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Dr. Farnsworth doesn\u2019t know that,\u201d Robert observed,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. Yesterday I was telling Liz that the <i>Proclaimer</i> should do a profile on her harassment \u2013 now after what\u2019s going on with you I\u2019m getting more serious about it,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert winced. He knew he had in fact been an encourager, and Sandy a cooperative gainer, although not for the motives Dr Farnsworth was attributing. He just like watching his as girlfriend was becoming bigger. But did he want this featured in the <i>Proclaimer</i>?  He didn\u2019t think so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSandy, is that the wisest thing? Right now we go where we want, enjoy what we please, without attracting much attention. I sort of question whether making a public issue of this wouldn\u2019t be playing right into the hands of Ramsey. \u201c he said analytically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy thought a minute and sighed, \u201cyou\u2019re right. But don\u2019t think I won\u2019t threaten her with going public if she creates any more hassle. But I\u2019ll keep quiet at Madison\u2019s pizza feed tonight. Now, would you care to serve me some of that luscious coconut cr\u00e8me pie m\u2019lord?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefinitely, m\u2019lady\u201d said Robert obediently.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy contentedly rubbed her food baby, which was sticking out quite nicely.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alison and Liz were walking back from the dinning hall and talking, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the party on Saturday should be fun.\" Alison said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, those guys were pretty cute. And really friendly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if I should invite Kevin, I want to see where that goes, but who knows.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to seem to...I don't know, out there, or eager,\" Alison trailed off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but think of the signals that you would be sending if he found out you went to a party with tons of guys and didn't invite him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right about that. Yeah, maybe I'll send him a text about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison was still full from the large meal they had just had, \"Ugh, I need to work out,\" she thought. But she never got around to it that evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin was doing some light studying at his desk when his phone buzzed. He looked up and saw the text from Alison asking what he was doing on Saturday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i></i> Alison: Are you free on Sat?<i></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused, and thought to himself, \"well if it's with Alison I am.\" He sent back a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i></i> Kevin: I think so. What's up?<i></i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i></i> Alison: Oh just some party that I don't know about, I want to come.<i></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin figured, why not? It could be a fun time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i></i> Yes. Sounds fun. Count me in<i></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Kevin went back to studying. Although he didn't notice because he wasn't looking out the window, Kelsey ran right by the dorm. She was still training really hard. With her first practice after being invited to try out as a walk on coming up, she didn't want to blow any opportunities. In her mind, she still had one singular goal, to play well enough that she would force the coach to give her a scholarship spot on the team next year. That was her purpose, she told herself. That was why she was running laps around the campus in her spare time to increase her cardio. The last thing she wanted was to tire out just when the coaches were trying to figure out who to play. Kesley continued her jog, with paced breathing, and a sweat covered tank top with tight running pants. \"Hmm, I bet I look pretty hot right now,\" she thought to herself as she ran by a group of guys and just cooly nodded her head.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kelli emerged from the shower to the smell of \u2026. Pancakes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly switching into her sweats she made her way to the kitchen to find Kelsey indeed flipping a pancake in the skillet with several already on a plate. In a bowl was a large amount of what appeared to be scrambled eggs with something reddish inside them \u2013 could it be salsa? A pitcher of tea, a small carafe and a cup of brown stuff was also on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with the lumberjack breakfast?\u201d she inquired. \u201cI thought you were supposed to be teaching me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am and intend to continue,\u201d replied Kelsey as she began cooking her sixth and final pancake, \u201cbut I need to practice myself to be sure I know where there might be problems. That\u2019s applying sports thinking to the kitchen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelli, missing the point, looked confused and said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey sprinkled some blue and boysenberries around the base of a stack of three hotcakes and put it in front of Kelli. \u201cTry it. Tell me what you think \u2013 by the way use that spread as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it\u201d asked Kelli cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlmond butter, and the liquid in the carafe is a different kind of syrup. Now spread some on, use the syrup, dish out some eggs and take at least two bites of each, then give me your verdict.\u201d instructed Kelsey. \u201cI\u2019m the coach in this game so be a good team player and follow instructions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelli wasn\u2019t too sure but did as instructed, then smiled. Kelsey\u2019s breakfast was good.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t this a ton of calories?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, Less than 25% of the dining hall for the same quantity and more high protein than meets the eye,\u201d replied Kelsey. \u201cthe pancakes are made with oats, water, cinnamon, protein powder and almond exact. The eggs have two thirds of the yolks removed with yogurt paprika plus salsa added. And the syrup uses blood oranges with some real sugar. The berries are anti-oxidants Next time we do it together and the time after that I\u2019ll be in the shower trusting you to do it right. Deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the fifth of Kelsey\u2019s health oriented breakfast menus, two of which Kelli had already mastered. She had to admit the would be soccer team star knew something about food. Kelli had never dieted and knew she wasn\u2019t being asked to. Still she realized this stuff was both healthful and good tasting. But she wondered if this is what Michael expected. Or even what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal,\u201d Kelli nodded in agreement as Kelsey filled her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, your first tryout is coming up?\u201d she inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied Kelsey. \u201cAnd I\u2019m told the Alumni Association is expecting me to do well \u2013 they\u2019re even pressuring the Coach to counter the offer for next year that I have and dangling a scholarship at Powers if I do well enough,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful,\u201d exclaimed Kelli. Have you told Clark?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, no. Why should I. We barely know each other. We\u2019re not an item,\u201d shot back Kelsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm, well, maybe I\u2019m not supposed to tell you this but he was quoted as saying it was too bad you were only going to be here one year. He thinks you\u2019re a nice person and he\u2019s into athletics himself,\u201d Kelli informed her dorm mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey was surprised. Clark had encouraged her to talk about herself but hadn\u2019t volunteered much concerning his thoughts. Then she thought about Alison, whom she\u2019d brushed off twice in the past week and seemed to be hanging more with Liz. Could Kelsey\u2019s focus on her own career be causing her to miss the obvious?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK,\u201d she responded. \u201cI\u2019ll tell Clark. And mayber Alison too. I thionk shemay feel I\u2019ve been shuning her.  But you can understand why, an\u2019t yolu? Now that the <i>Proclaimer</i> has gone to bat for me I have to focus on succeeding both in the classroom and in the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d answered Kelli, \u201cAnd I appreciate what you\u2019ve been teaching me. I need to test some of these recipes out on Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed, but give yourself another two weeks, OK?  Also, what is important is the techniques \u2013 he may not want to eat like an athlete.\u201d answered Kelsey as she finished her own breakfast. \u201cNow I have to clean up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelli nodded her assent while quietly thinking that while these high protein meals were alright she didn\u2019t want to always eat like an athlete herself.  At one time, perhaps, but not these days.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That evening, Kelsey walked over to the locker rooms early. She wanted to get a jump on her eventual teammates and focus on the practice ahead of her. Kelsey had often tried that in high school and it worked very well. Now, she walked into the room hoping she would be alone, so she could visualize what a successful practice would look like. When Kelsey walked in, she saw that someone was there even earlier than her, Greta Hopkins. She was their Senior center-back who was probably the only legitimately good player on a team full of sup performers or flat out spare parts. When the old coach had recruited Kelsey, she saw on tape how good Greta was at sensing where the game was going, and closing down one side of the field near the keeper, while efficiently getting the ball out of the penalty area. Her ability one one side only showed how inept the other half was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi,\" Greta said, putting tucking her jersey into her shirts, \"are you the girl who is filling in while Janice rehabs her injury?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey, from looking at the roster previously, knew that Janice was a senior, the other center-back so Greta probably would be friends with her. \"Yep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't get used to it. Janice's injury is not a season ending one, and you'll  have to prove yourself if you want to hang around for any period of time. This isn't high school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey wanted to snap back at her, something like, <i></i>Yeah, from your record, my high school team could have given you guys a run for your money<i></i> or something of that variety, but instead she tried to be more subtle, \"Yeah, well Janice seemed to be letting you down on her side of the field, and I play center back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta didn't like that pointing out of an individual, \"Hey, we win as a team and lose as a team, no one is letting me down,\" and with that Greta walked out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey sat there in the locker room, which only had half the lights turned on, and got ready, now collected with only her thoughts, <i></i>fine, if she's going to be like that, I'll have to earn her respect.<i></i> Kelsey walked out onto the field, hoping to show that she could cut it at this level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of campus, Alison was waiting nervously for Kevin to come to the room. She knew that she liked him, because usually she did not get this kind of eagerness tied in with nervousness before a date. She had put on some trendy clothing and was ready a bit early, all she could do was wait. She went to the couch and turned on some college football. It was just starting to get a bit cooler in the air, and the football game as a backdrop felt comfortable and right for her, given her upbringing in the somewhat rural town where football was by and away the most popular sport. She flipped out her phone and texted some people, waiting for Kevin to come so they could go to the party. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\nKevin walked out of the bathroom, freshly shaven, and threw on a nice shirt. Eric was sitting there watching the game, \"Who's up?\" Kevin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"State is beating U by 7 right now.\" Eric replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. 8:44 left in the third? Tons of football left,\" Kevin noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No doubt. You usually don't see teams this highly ranked this early in the season.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Text me score updates.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't just check on your phone.\" Eric replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...ok good point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin started to walk out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck with Alison.\" Eric shouted at him, smiling. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Don Snyder started to don his shirt but noticed the strain on the bottom two buttons. He grimaced and shook his head.  The shirt was one from his high school days \u2013 before 15 pounds this summer and no doubt a few more at Powers U. His belly wasn\u2019t huge, but had developed enough of a pudge that he had taken to wearing newer polo shorts to class because they concealed the gut overhang at his betline. He went to his closet and found a shirt two sizes larger and out it on. He buttoned it easily. His pants, however, were more snug in the thighs and a little uncomfortable. He sighed and made a note to get some newer ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis roommate Greg Williams emerged from the bathroom. Like Don he\u2019d picked up a few Powers pounds as well, but his clothes at least fit loosely. .Greg hadn\u2019t dieted during the summer. He\u2019d had had a job in his brother\u2019s construction company that burned a lot of calories. He\u2019d actually lost about seven pounds but by now had regained them plus a few.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither guy thought of themselves as more than perhaps a little husky, and since they both like eating and plumper girls their respective gains didn\u2019t bother them.  They just hoped that at this night they could find some non-anorexic types that could happily consume some calories without complaining. That\u2019s why they\u2019d invited Allison and Liz to the party \u2013 the way they ate in the dining hall and the thicknesses of their midriffs, especially Liz, had raised their hopes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon had tried to follow up with a phone call to Allison, only to learn she\u2019d already invited a friend, Kevin, and that Liz was planning on coming with them.  He also learned that Alison was the roommate of one of the editors of the <i>Powers Proclaimer</i>, Madison Kraft,  whom he knew was a definite BBW but also spoken for. Still, if Alison was getting along with her it was encouraging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs chance would have it the two FAs arrived just about the same time as Kevin, Alison and Liz.  After introductions Kevin and his date headed for the buffet line, leaving Don and Greg with Liz. She was dressed in an attractive party dress that displayed a slight tummy bulge. With her brown hair cascading down over her shoulders and friendly demeanor Don thought she was lovely and his face showed ir. The only trouble was Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg held a similar opinion but his primary interest had been Alison and he knew what Don was thinking \u2013 he needed to get lost. He suggested that Don and Liz join Kevin and Alison while he saw if he could help the party organizers.  Don nodded and squired Liz to the buffet line. She followed his lead in picking up half  a sub sandwich, a piece of chicken with some vegetables pus mac and cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoever put this together sure gave it some thought, she said approvingly. \u201cThe variety is terrific.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Don replied, \u201cGreg and two others did the shopping. Six of us chipped together for the food. Once we get thru eating the buffet we\u2019ll play some parlor games, then have dessert and dance a little.  The idea is to mix it up and try to include everyone \u2013 shy guys and wallflowers included, if we can get them involved.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Alison or I exactly qualify as wallfowers, \u201c Liz responded a bit defensively. \u201cWe\u2019re both away from the dorm 2-3 nights a week!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh definitely not, \u201c Don hastily concurred. \u201cBut notice around us. There are several people by themselves, not looking very happy. Once the games get going they\u2019re going to find themselves being drawn in.  Everyone, you and I included, will have sheets with four numbers in a quadrant pinned to our backs. For two of the four games the girls have to find the guy with their number, for the other two it\u2019s the guys and girls. The match-ups are partners for the game.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, that works!\u201d exclaimed Liz, \u201dand who knows, maybe those in the final set will get to share dessert together. I saw that cake and the pies. They look sensatonal\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt could work.\u201d Don concurred, noting her positive spin on the high calorie fare. And speaking of food our plates are empty. Can I get us seconds?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, sure,\u201d said Liz, wondering what Don would do. He returned with two fairly well loaded plates with different items than before. It appeared to be some beef enchiladas, casserole, and a slice of meat loaf. Liz chatted amiably, suspecting that Don was testing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings went as predicted and both Liz and Alison got to know a few guys better. But at the end they both gravitated back to their dinner companions for dessert. Unlike Don Greg hadn\u2019t tried to ply Alison with seconds because she\u2019d shared her frustration over lack of the planned exercise opportunities with Kelsey. But she couldn\u2019t resist the multi-layer German chocolate cake with a generous helping of ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was no less reticent, although her choice was apple pie and ice cream. And she responded favorably to Don\u2019s discussions of various types of foods. If Don was indeed testing her out as a dinner companion she was willing to pass and be pampered a little. She knew her belly was returning but didn\u2019t care \u2013 in fact, if Don became another Robert she didn\u2019t mind his huskiness at all. Maybe she\u2019d even nudge it a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the dancing began Don was called away to help with the audio/visual equipment and Liz found herself alone. That\u2019s when she noticed a slightly heavier Latina girl sitting by herself, looking rather forlorn.  Liz went over and sat beside, introducing herself as a freshman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Maria,\u201d replied the girl, \u201cAnd I\u2019m a freshman too. Unfortunately this is Kansas and it\u2019s a little lonely for a brown skinned salad dodger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSalad dodger?\u201d exclaimed Liz. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell amiga, look at me, Maria complained. \u201cI reflect many tamales and beans, would you not agree? We call plump chicanas salad dodgers back home and we laugh. Guys here don\u2019t have the same responses to a little extra thigh as in Las Cruces. This is my first party here because my roommate insisted.  I only ate two tacos and some salad tonight but to them I\u2019m just senorita gordita.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz\u2019s mind grasped the situation and she had a idea but she knew she needed help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaria, I\u2019m almost your size and I\u2019ve been forty pounds heavier,\u201d Liz disclosed. \u201cNow it may be true that some guys don\u2019t want chubby girls but I\u2019ve never lacked for dates. And your brown skin has nothing o do with it.  Would you let me prove it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d asked Maria, the lonliess showing I her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI happen to know a half Hispanic student here on campus who weighs over 200 pounds and has a great boy friend. And there are other larger girls with guys as well. I think you need to get some supportive friends to restore your self confidence,\u201d relied Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf being forty pounds bigger wasn\u2019t an issue why did you lose it,\u201d queried Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cParental pressure mostly. But now I\u2019m over 18 and don\u2019t care \u2013 and its coming back, which is OK. But we\u2019re talking about you. Can you be free Monday night?\u201d queried Liz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose so. But why?\u201d Maria answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo hopefully you can meet the support group you need.\u201d Liz answered. \u201cNow will you promise to stick around for a few minutes?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMight as well promise that. My roommate dragged me here and she\u2019s not going home any time soon,\u201d said Maria. \u201cI\u2019m marooned unless I walk back alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz flitted off to find Alison, who was with Kevin.  While she was describing the situation Don and Greg joined them out of curiosity. Don promised to engage Maria while Alison called Madison. Fortunately, even though she was with Jim, Madison had her cell phone and told Alison and Liz to go ahead.  Greg volunteered to be Maria\u2019s escort knowing that Don would like more time with Liz. Kevin was a bit bewildered by all he wheeling and dealing but agreed to go along as well. He didn\u2019t want Alison to be there without him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the dancing slowed down and Don returned to the sidelines with Maria Liz, Greg, Alison and Kevin were waiting. Liz made the introductions  and Alison confirmed the invitation. Greg asked Maria if he could have the next dance and then he and Don would draw straws for the pleasure of being her escort. This drew a scowl from Don  but he played along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Maria was on the dance floor with Greg Liz told Don she was, with his permission, going to fix the drawing so that Greg would get Maria.  Don sighed a sigh of relief and gave her a hug. Liz found it very comfortable and noted the solidness of his developing paunch. .  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the way,\u201d he asked \u201cI know you came with Kevin and Alison, but would you like a nighttime snack with me on the way home instead of going with them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would \u2013 and frankly I think they would like that too\u201d she concurred \u201cWhat about DQ? I understand they\u2019re open till 2:00.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds great to me,\u201c Don replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz sent a quick text message to Alison who responded with a smiley face and then waved from across the room. As she and Don eased onto the dance floor she silently hoped that the DQ was but the first of many shared meals together. For his part his fingers tingled over the firmness of the developing rolls of her midriff. He knew he and Greg had both fund girls with potential.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While the others were at the party chowing down, Kelsey was doing much of the opposite. In an evening soccer practice, she felt like she was being run into the ground. She had always though of herself as a very good player, but at the moment, she seemed to be getting burned by people who she did not feel were her equal. Was she rusty? Or was the pace fast at this level and she could not keep up? During drills, she was amazed by Greta's skills, she was effortlessly running through these exercises, while Kelsey was barley keeping up. She was slightly shocked that a few other players looked a bit out of shape. <i></i>Hmm, maybe that is why this team hasn't been up to snuff. If they had more people with Greta's work ethic, they would probably start to turn things around,<i></i> Kelsey thought during a moment of downtime. None of this kept Coach Woosley from riding on people, and a few people, not Kelsey yet, but others, got into his line of fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny ARE YOU KIDDING ME? WHY DO YOU EVEN COME OUT HERE IF YOU ARE GOING TO HALF A IT.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHRISSY--WHAT ARE YOU DOING? IF YOU BREAK OFF LIKE THAT THE ENTIRE PLAY COLLAPSES. UGH. Let's run it again everyone!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey was actually fine with the coach's harsh attitude, and with being pushed by Greta, as they would be in the same position if she ever saw playing time and Kelsey wanted to be ready. Even though Janice got injured, Kelsey still needed one of the two center backs to get subbed out to be put into the game--she figured the only thing she could do was work for it until she achieved her goal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that may not be as easy as planned, she could tell that Greta was annoyed with her at times, and when the squad scrimage started, she could tell that she was a bit over matched in this initial outing. In the lights of an empty stadium, during a nice fall evening, Kelsey was subbed in, so Coach Woosley could see what she could do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially what stuck her was how much stamina the other girls had. After a few minutes he was shocked that they were still going pretty fast. The opposing teamates knew that Greta would have her side locked down, so they started attacking Kelsey's side. A few times people got by, leading to favorable scoring chances and an irritated Greta. Kelsey was distraught after the scrimage. She felt like she got embarrassed out there. After practice, Greta walked up, and Kelsey expected the worst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, nice effort, you'll get better if you keep up like that,\" Greta said, as she walked into the dim hue of the stadium grandstands. Kelsey stood there, thinking about it and wiping off her face. That bit of encouragement was all she needed to keep going. </span></div></div>",

I take it Mike enjoyed the ground turkey yogurt kababs you made for him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, he says you\u2019re turning me into a gourmet chef. And I\u2019ll be honest, I thought an athlete like you would be all about salads and veggies,\u201d replied Kelli. Kelsey ignored the deepening dimples of Kelii\u2019s smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I do have more of those than most probably.\u201d Kelsey admitted. But turkey and yogurt done with some spices can taste good while beeng good for you \u2013 unlike KFC!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoint made,\u201d her roommate answered, at the same time noticing what Kelsey had in her hand.  \u201cNow what, pray tell is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts called a Dynaband, and is like a footwide rubber band made of latex.. You use it to practice side and squat lunges. Greta lent it to me after practice to build up my leg muscles and stamina for soccer.  She I think feels I could make the team,\u201d mused Kelsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018With all the effort you are extending you may well make it,\u201d concurred Kelli, whose idea of exercise these days was spreading cream cheese on another bagel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, \u201cyour helping with the meals gives me time to both practice and study more, so I owe you a vote of thanks,\u201d replied the muscular soccer player with sincerity as she slipped the Dynaband around her upper thighs and began to shimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelli nodded. She had no desire to exert herself for an hour with calisthenics like Kelsey and saw no point in telling her what she had served Saturday  with the kabobs \u2013 rice, vegetables and a store bought pecan pie which had been served with Reddi-wip..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, elsewhere in the building that Monday night, Alison was welcoming Greg and Maria along with Don and Liz, followed shortly by a mutually growing Robert and Sandy and shortly thereafter Kevin. Calli was working so Madison had another helper. Jim was cooking turkey for Madison\u2019s guests as well, but in the form of 200+ calories bombs called turkey taco cups.  Sure, they had 30% less fat than pork, but after adding salsa, egg whites, cheese, olives and healthy helping of refried beans three cups made a 1000+ calorie meal.  But because it was turkey Alison would gullibly think of it as healthy.  Kevin kept his thoughts to himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was happy to see the hefty Madison\u2019s light brown complexion and was even happier when Madison addressed her with a few words of fluent Spanish, She knew she had a friend. Before the evening was over Madison let the Freshman coed know the Proclaimer was looking for someone to take over her role in doing restaurant reviews  Jim mentioned the availability of 2:1 coupons and that was all it took. Greg volunteered to do escort duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy, a regular part of the Monday night dinners, was as usual contentedly scarfing down everything in sight, taking note that her beau Robert was growing a belly as well. Liz wasn\u2019t quite as eager, but smiled when Don offered to dish out seconds for her.  Sandy finally got up the courage to ask if she could help with supper the next week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs in what?\u201d asked Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you can make Mexican food with turkey, why not Italian \u2013 as in turkey eggplant lasagnas.\u201d replied Sandy.\u201dIts gluten free and goes great with ice cream.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria eyed Sandy\u2019s belly, barely smaller than her own and thought \u201c<i>you will be bigger than me soon eating like that..\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like its worth trying,\u201d answered Jim. \u201cMaria, can you and Greg make it? Don. That includes you and Liz as well.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surprised couples looked at one another, hesitated, then smiled and said  \u201dsure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe another time I\u2019ll cook up some cazuela,\u201d contributed Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d said Jim \u201cNever heard of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt comes from Chile \u2013 it\u2019s a true South American dish. You take drumsticks, boil them in chicken broth with squash, potatoes, corn, carrots etc, then serve atop rice with hot pepper sauce and cilantro. Most in this country have never had it because restaurant parons just want Tex-Mex.\u201d responded Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see we have the right person for our restaurant reviews,\u201d beamed Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and we are now ready for dessert \u2013 a special in honor of our guest: Sopapilla Cheesecake \u2013 made with crescent rolls and creamed cheese by Madison,\u201d Jim announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was astonished while Liz and Sandra\u2019s eyes grew wide at the tray of goodies  After everyone had two (and in some cases three) of the rolls the party was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert took Sandra home, hitching his tight pants a bit.  Sandy smiled. She knew her own belly was growing as well Just the evening before she\u2019d discovered she could close her belly button around her finger.  Her protruding food baby liked the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz felt stuffed (again) but sensed Don liked that, even if her mom eventually wouldn\u2019t. She thanked him for the evening and they parted with a friendly kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria went home with Greg on cloud nine, wondering what she had stumbled into. She wasn\u2019t a plump also ran in this group. All the other girls (and some of the guys) were heavier too \u2013 except Alison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin of course went home alone \u2013 Alison lived with Madison. SAs he walked along he reaffirmed to himself his belief that she wasn\u2019t likely to become heavier like the others. But he knew she\u2019d pretty much eaten what they had. Not as aggressively as Sandy or with the susceptibility to coaxing of Liz perhaps, but more than any exercise routine could burn off. Thing was, Kevin cared about Alison as a person. Whether she got plumper or not was bothering him less every date.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The last month had been exciting for Alison, for a few reasons. First, she was seeing things progress with Kevin, and the feeling of a new relationship with someone that she liked was an exciting one. Second, her good friend Kelsey was trying to make the soccer team and she felt like she was living that adventure through her at times, seeing Kelsey deal with the highs and lows of the experience. On top of that, her social life was strong, and she got along great with her roommate Madison. Even her studies had still been strong. There was only one thing that Alison was finding her mind drift off about occasionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Alison was getting ready for school one morning, she noticed that her stomach seemed just a bit softer than what she was used to. <i>Is this temporary bloat from last night, or am I putting on some weight?</i> Alison dropped the pants and went over to the mirror in the bathroom. She couldn't tell the reason, but she thought that it did look just a tad bigger, although you  would have had to be looking for it, or seen a comparison picture, and even then, it would have been nothing to write home about. Alison smiled at herself in the mirror, <i>At least the cute smile is still there</i> she thought to herself as she continued with her morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe issue of weight had been in the back of her mind. She could tell Liz was putting on weight, and Sandra's was even more obvious. She also had seen photos of Madison and Cassi before they started college and it was night and day. She did not hate larger people, she just did not want to be one at the moment for a variety of reasons. Kelsey, Kevin, friends from back home, she just didn't really want to change a formula that had been working for her. So Alison didn't jump in as deep as Liz or Sandra and was not eating as much. However, not eating as much as Liz and Sandra did not necessarily mean that she was eating light. With the fatty foods that were being served at their get together, Alison was eating an altered diet, and even with the (increasingly sporadic) workouts, an explanation for her slightly softer stomach could be found. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was less hesitation and resistance over in Liz's dorm, and one would be able to guess this by looking at Liz. She had always had larger boobs, which came with a softer stomach than she wanted when she came to college, but now it was obviously morphing into a belly. Her boobs had grown, but so had her arms and her love handles. She needed to buy new clothes, but she hadn't really found the time yet. Despite her guess that Don was okay with all of this, she still knew her Mom would not be, so she was looking for an excuse to get her to give her money for clothes without letting her know why. <i>Maybe I'll just say I need winter clothes, that could work</i> was a common thought for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Alison and Liz, despite all their differences, their diets were slowly diverging. With Kelsey often off at soccer, the social creature in Alison gravitated towards Liz, and they often made plans to go out, even if their current romantic interests were not involved. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"When was the last time I washed these?\" Alison asked herself as she tried to button her jeans before class. She had been doing the skinny jean jump, jumping, stretching, and yanking to get them up her legs, but now they wouldn't close. She tried pulling them closed, then sucking i- <i>wait, sucking in?</i> Alison thought. She looked down and sure enough, there was a bit more to her stomach this week than was there last week. She just sat and stared at it for a minute, thinking back to all the meals she'd had over the past week leading her to this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and Liz had eaten lunch together nearly every day, with Liz sometimes dragging her to breakfast with her as well. Liz was noticeably larger than before, but that wasn't a shock considering how much she ate. Then she and Liz ate dinner with Sandra more, and it was no secret that Sandra ate enough at a meal for two or three people, and that seemed to be rubbing off on her friends. Then she would sometimes snack with Madison as she studied in their room. But Alison still didn't think she had put on that much weight because she always ate less than her friends, but what she didn't consider is that even though she ate less, it was still more than she usually would have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was able to close her jeans finally, but with one look in the mirror Alison knew that this was not a look that suited her. The waistband of the jeans dug into her new middle, causing the little bit of pudge there to form a muffin top. Her butt had grown too, looking wider and crammed into her jeans than was suitable for the fabric to contain. Her shirt didn't do her any favors either, clinging to her skin and showing very clearly where her jeans cut into her. And when she sat down, a small roll of fat bulged over the top of the jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison decided it was probably time for her to step on the scale and see the damage. She got on and the number that flashed back at her was not one she liked to see. 143. Nineteen pounds more than when she moved into Powers. She had already gained the freshman 15 and then some. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Have you tried the apple pie? It's sooo good!\" Sandra said to the group at their lunch table as she set her plates down on the table and sat down. She was the last one to join the table, with her plates piled highest out of the three girls at the table. It took a bit of reorganizing the table to fit Sandra's plates though considering each one of them had 2 plates: one for their entree and one for their dessert. Alison, Liz, and Sandra all did this now since they couldn't ever get it all to fit on one plate. This two plate system wasn't entirely new for Sandra and Liz, but it was for Alison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you could join us,\" joked Liz with a mouth full of food in her chubbier cheeks. She knew she had regained over half the weight that she had lost just a couple years before and she didn't care. The food was just too good to care how much farther out her stomach was over her pants (it now always stuck out over the waistband, getting close to dropping). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, there was a line for the pie!\" Sandra retorted as she took a bite out of her double decker burger, a feat that should have been harder to do but considering that she had become so accustomed to consuming unusual amounts of food it was easy for her to unlock her jaw. The wideness with which she opened her mouth put her new double chin on display, something that now always seemed present even when she had a resting facial expression. But that was nothing compared to her stomach, which was never not filled with food anymore, always in a permanently taut state, making her look as if she could be several months pregnant. There was no hiding the forty pounds she had gained this semester, and frankly she had no desire to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it took you so long to get to the table I already have to go refill my Coke,\" said Alison, pushing her chair out and walking over to the drink fountain. Liz and Sandra stopped eating for a minute and stared quizzically at Alison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're seeing what I'm seeing too, right?\" said Liz. Sandra nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, how can you miss it? Her belly was jiggling as she walked and you can see her butt crack!\" Sandra replied. \"She needs some new clothes for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we tell her about this though?\" asked Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, what kind of friends are we if we don't at least tell her that she needs to pull her shirt down and her pants up?\" joked Sandra. Liz nodded in agreement. They watched as Alison walked back to the table, her stomach (while not as big as the ones her friends had, was still becoming a prominent feature) bounced up and down, even the bottom curve being slightly exposed by her shirt. She set down her drink and sat down, but as she sat the table heard a <i>riiiippp</i>. Alison's eyes went wide as she realized it was her the sound came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we were going to tell you that you probably needed to pull up your pants some, but I think they just told you that it's time to get a new pair,\" Sandra said to break the silence. Alison looked a bit downfallen at the fact that it had come to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that I've put on weight, but I didn't think it was this bad! I thought my clothes still fit!\" She cried, her face buried in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, we've all had these problems,\" Liz replied, looking down at her own new jeans which were already getting tight. \"Listen, you can borrow some of my old clothes, they should fit you just fine.\" Alison looked over at Liz for a minute then down at her stomach, seeing how it sat in her lap even more than last week, covered in angry red marks from the comically tight pants. She sat in thought for a minute, remembering how the warning signs were there this morning when she tried to put them on and she couldn't get them over her butt and once she did it took all her might to button them. She looked back up and nodded at Liz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll take you up on that clothing offer,\" she told Liz.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Seriously, Liz, I can't thank you enough for the clothes! This might be the most comfortable shirt I've owned,\" Alison told Liz over FaceTime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, glad these clothes are getting some use! Hey, and if you need another size of something, I've now got my 12s and 14s available, those definitely aren't fitting me anymore,\" Liz chuckled on her end. \"The food here is just too good, I swear by the time Thanksgiving comes in 2 weeks I'm going to have to go up another couple sizes just to make sure I don't explode my clothes! My mom's not going to be happy that I gained back the weight and then some, 65 pounds in 4 months will make her FREAK!\" She slapped her belly that had gotten even larger as of lately, spreading out all around her when she sat down, usually poking out out whatever shirt she wore now too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I know! I haven't even mentioned to my parents that I've gained anything. I might need those sizes up to survive the break,\" Alison replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll bring them by later. Byee,\" Liz said as she hung up the phone. Alison set down her phone and examined her look in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the incident in the dining hall with her pants, Alison took Liz up on her offer to borrow some of her old clothes since hers didn't fit as well anymore (and by that she meant that most of her clothes didn't fit at all). So she took Liz's clothes that Liz had outgrown since the start of the semester (even her old \"fat\" clothes didn't fit her anymore, she had regained the 40 pounds she lost and an additional 10 pounds on top of that). So those clothes were a perfect fit for Alison's new figure. They went through a few different options of sizes, and eventually they determined that the size 10 clothes might be the safest bet, especially since the trend among students was that once they started gaining, they didn't slow down for quite a while, and that was already true of Alison. If the clothes were looser, than the extra space was likely to get filled quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe current outfit she was wearing was a cute sweater and a pair of leggings, and most of the outfits Alison now wore were very similar to that: looser clothes that wouldn't restrict her and prevent another embarrassing clothing mishap. And it worked, but at a cost. As Alison saw now while examining herself in the mirror, the sweater wasn't as loose as it was 3 weeks ago when she tried it on, getting close to looking tight even. It had originally hung like a tunic, falling to about mid-thigh, but now clung just below her ever-growing bubble butt that was sticking out more shelf-like every time Alison looked in her full figure mirror. She turned to see her profile in the mirror, disappointed that it didn't look quite the way she thought it would. The sweater was clinging to her bulging gut, emphasizing its roundness it had developed in recent weeks. It couldn't be hidden by anything, even getting people asking her if she was pregnant it had gotten so round. Her thighs had grown too, closing any gap that had ever been between them. Even her face had taken a hit, losing the sharp definition it once had in place for softer cheeks (not quite round and chubby yet, but starting to rise to that) and a double chin began to appear whenever she looked down, like she was doing now as she realized that she couldn't see her feet because of her belly obstructing her view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flopped onto her back on her bed, still not sure how she felt about her appearance. As she was on her back, she couldn't help but notice how her belly stuck straight up in the air when she laid down and how it didn't stop wobbling for a few seconds after she landed on the bed. She struggled to sit up more than she used to, and once she did get into a sitting position she saw how she had to spread her legs some to make room for her belly to sit, now filling about a third of her lap. She sighed when she realized that it was probably time to check the scale, something she had been avoiding doing so she wouldn't have to acknowledge the damage she'd done to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped on the scale and had to lean over a few inches so she could read the numbers that her belly was slightly obstructing. And the numbers she saw sent a shiver down her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n174. a 26 pound gain since October, a 45 pound one since the start of the semester. Never in her life did she think she would ever see herself get this large. She stepped off and felt her body jiggle as she walked back to her mirror. She lifted up her sweater and placed her hands on her belly, shaking it some and watching it flop down as she released it. She poked her butt, watching as her finger sunk in a few inches to its heavy padding. She did a little jump and just watched as everything shook, and was surprised by something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think it\u2019s safe to say these 14s are getting tight,\u201d Alison said with pride, patting her stomach as she sat on the couch with Liz, an activity that was becoming increasingly difficult with the growing girth of each girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean yes I do but not as much as before, I\u2019m still able to wear most of it,\u201d Liz replied. She looked over at her fellow freshman, taking in how quickly she had grown in such a short period of time. Ever since she had started borrowing clothes from Liz, Alison had been growing almost at an exponential rate. While she had a belly before, now it looked like she had a small beach ball attached to her waist, somehow defying gravity when she stood up and sticking straight out, not drooping at all. Her butt was also taking up a significant portion of the couch, being her largest feature now. Her thighs had no gap, having grown closer together and now starting to grow out. Her breasts had also gotten a bit bigger, but were still small compared to the rest of her body. Her face was no longer the slim, angular one that Liz met when the two freshmen moved in, it now was the owner of two chipmunk cheeks and a small double chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the clothes! This really is a great arrangement,\u201d Alison responded. She reached forward to grab the pack of Oreos sitting on the coffee table in front of them, having to do a bit of rocking back and forth to get herself forward to reach them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlison, are you sure you\u2019re okay with all this?\u201d Liz asked. Alison kept chewing as she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be? You\u2019re saving me so much money!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean your size. You\u2019re getting a little big a little fast, don\u2019t you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, I like it! I wouldn\u2019t have put on another 30 pounds if I didn\u2019t,\u201d Alison replied. \u201cAnd I\u2019m hoping to get another 6 pounds before I go home for winter break next week, an even 210 to surprise my parents.\u201d She grinned as she put another Oreo in her mouth. Liz\u2019s jaw dropped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou realize that\u2019s how much I weigh?\u201d Liz asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, really? Then maybe I should start asking Sandra for clothes, she\u2019s larger than both of us!\u201d Alison was right (Sandra was easily 15 pounds more than Liz and Alison, she had been eating the way Alison is now all year), but that she was so blas\u00e9 about it disturbed Liz a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlison, how big do you plan on getting? You\u2019re almost the size of our sophomore roommates, and it\u2019s only the first semester of college.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I tell you a secret?\u201d Alison asked. Liz nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think the weight gain turns me on. At first it didn\u2019t, but once I couldn\u2019t see my whole profile in my mirror I realized I liked that. I want to be bigger. I don\u2019t know how much bigger, but for now I\u2019m just going to keep eating everything and not caring how big it makes me. I never thought I would like having 80 additional pounds on my body, but it feels really good,\u201d Alison took a pause once she finished talking and looked over at Liz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you might want to start buying your own clothes, I don\u2019t think mine will fit you for much longer,\u201d Liz replied. \u201cI mean, my clothes barely fit me anymore, but finding something that covers this blob of a belly is difficult nowadays, it oozes out of everything.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy problem is pants, either they don\u2019t fit over my thighs or my butt, there\u2019s no in between! At least Kevin doesn\u2019t seem to mind it too much,\u201d Alison exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat seems to be a trend with guys here, the girls get larger and the guys just end up accepting it,\u201d said Liz. Alison nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping maybe even they\u2019ll start putting on some extra pounds too, why should we be the only ones to have a little extra to grab!\u201d Alison cheered. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHi, mom!\u201d Alison cheered as she made her way towards her mom at the airport. She was running as fast as she could to reach her, but that run resembled more of a waddle considering for how her thighs had grown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom turned around and was shocked at the girl who was panting in front of her. Her daughter had never been a particularly in shape girl, but the girl standing in front of her was far from the one she left at college 5 months ago. Now she had what could only be disguised as a Buddha belly, one of the roundest bellies she\u2019d ever seen. Her face was puffier than she remembered, with cheeks that always looked like she had something in them and a double chin encasing her jaw. Even though Alison was face to face with her mom, her mom could still see her daughter\u2019s largest asset: her bottom, which had gotten so wide and round it could be seen from any angle of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, sweetie. Welcome home,\u201d her mom said as she continued to take in her larger daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks! Hey, can we go grab some food? I didn\u2019t get a chance to eat before I left and I\u2019m STARVING,\u201d Alison said as she started to walk towards the parking lot. Her mom stood in place for a minute then went after her daughter, wondering whether to ask about her new shape or just leave it be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>\r\n\u201cLiz! I\u2019m disappointed in you,\u201d her mom said when her daughter arrived home. Her mom was the one who made her lose weight the first time and couldn\u2019t believe the shape her child was in now. When she lost weight the first time she had dropped 40 pounds and got down to 130, but even 170 looked skinny compared to the girl here today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know mom, but it\u2019s hard especially when everyone else around you is eating!\u201d She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHard enough to send you up what, 60 pounds?\u201d Her mom asked. Liz shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c70?\u201d Liz shook her head again, looking down in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c85,\u201d she whispered. Her mom was shocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, you\u2019re going on a diet while you\u2019re home,\u201d her mom declared and dragged her daughter inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\nSandra heard the door open to her house and her parents come inside. She got home before they did, giving her time to leave an imprint on the couch. Her parents came into the living room and gasped at the sight in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra was easily 100 pounds heavier than when they left her 5 months ago. She was laying on the couch , but laying is relative since she barely fit on the sofa. She heard them enter and took a minute to maneuver herself off the couch, which made her parents gasp again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir daughter was huge to say the least. They watched as she waddled over to them, her stomach swaying back and forth like a pendulum. It hung down significantly, covering the waistband of her pants completely but her shirt couldn\u2019t cover the bottom, leaving several inches of skin covered in red stretch marks exposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, mom! Hi, dad!\u201d She grinned, but even that caused her parents discomfort as her new fat cheeks hid her eyes when she smiled, her double chin masking any jawline she once had. She was massive, and they didn\u2019t recognize the blob of a girl in front of them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison grunted as she wriggled her way out of the cab she took home from the airport. She gazed at her house and took a deep breath before walking up to the door, nervous about what her parents might think about her size still growing (she hadn't checked the scale since starting the fall semester, but with the way her roommate was shoveling her food and putting on weight, there was no question she had packed on some extra pounds as well). She knocked and awaited someone to answer the door, and after what felt like a millennium the door opened to a sight she was definitely not expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, sweetie, it's so good to see you!\" Madison's dad said as he wrapped his arms around his round daughter. The difficulty hugging wasn't entirely because of her bulk though. Her once muscular dad had softened all over, with a beer gut protruding prominently from his frame, maybe up about 35 pounds or so. \"Your mother's in the kitchen if you want to say hi while I take your things upstairs.\" Madison nodded hesitantly and waddled into the kitchen to see her mom, nervous about her reaction to her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, mom,\" she said as her mom turned around. When her mom saw her, her jaw dropped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison, I thought we agreed you were going to lose weight, not keep gaining!\" She scolded her daughter from the other side of the kitchen. \"Get on the kitchen scale, let's see what damage you've done.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison looked around confused. \"What do you mean, kitchen scale?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well once I had to start conducting weigh ins with your father and sister because their weights were getting too high I kept a scale in the kitchen so they couldn't hide their weights and make sure they were actually losing, not gaining. Your father's already down 15 pounds in a month, your sister... well hers seems to be more stubborn. Now up you go!\" Mrs. Kraft explained as she took out the scale. Madison maneuvered herself up and tried to look down to see the number, forgetting that she hadn't been able to see numbers on a scale since last winter break. Her mom gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"252, 45 pounds up! We got you down 20 pounds over the summer and you gained it all back and then some! I'm disappointed,\" her mom said as she walked away. Madison's jaw was dropped when she heard the number. She knew she had grown but not by that much.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------<br>\r\n\"Cassie, we've missed you so much!\" Her mom squealed as she saw her daughter approach the house slowly. Cassie had been large the last time her family (who were also all MUCH larger than regular), but she seemed to have gotten even bigger since they last saw the petite college student. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Cassie had returned to Powers, she clocked in at 215 pounds, which with her short stature meant she looked particularly round, especially with her weight being focused in her waist. Now she resembled a walking beach ball, with every part of her body covered in fat. Not that it mattered to her family, who were all lined up as she entered her house. And, despite the fact that Cassie now weighed 285 pounds, a 70 pound gain, she was still the least round member of her family.<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________<br>\r\nKelly's family never thought they'd see the day when their daughter would have a waddle. The once star athlete had gained over the summer, sure, but only about 40 pounds, and since she is more pear shaped, it didn't really show anywhere else on her. But now that was far from true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese last 45 pounds still settled in her legs, which gave her quite a waddle, but now her belly began to hang over her waistband and her once slim face was now encased in a double chin. Her family had no problems with the weight per se but were now getting concerned that 85 pounds in under a year is a bit too much for one person.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sandra once again found herself on the third floor of the Administration building, responding to what she regarded as a summons from Dr. Farnsworth in room A-312. She was wearing the same black slacks with a loose fitting Liz Claiborne button front tank top as before. But what had been loose fitting a month and probably ten pounds ago wasn\u2019t nearly as flattering now. A tummy roll over her waistband, mild fupa development and a pair of nascent love handles were clearly evident., not that she really cared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should have brought along some candy bars to munch ion just to gross her out,\u201d Sandra thought. She knew Dr. Claiborne had talked to Robert and seemed overly concerned about her weight and food intake. She\u2019s seen er in the dining hall when Sandra was loading up her food tray, sometimes adding an item just out of spite.  She knew she wasn\u2019t the only fat and gaining coed on campus and resented the special attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached the door of room A-312, paused, took a deep breath and knocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome in,\u201d answered the familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra entered and moved cautiously to the chair in front of Dr. Farnsworth\u2019s desk, aware that her every curve was being taken in. She sat down, a good three inches of her food baby belly settling onto her thighs. Her bra felt rather snug as well. When she was with Robert this was exhilaration, but in front of her presumed nemesis she felt like a specimen. To her surprise Dr. Farnsworth made no mention of her obvious continued weight gain since their last visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSandy,\u201d she instead began, \u201cI know you are going to a court hearing next week. I think in fairness you deserve to know what you\u2019re in for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra was taken aback. What did her appearing at Bud Ramsey\u2019s latest hearing have to do with a college counselor?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Farnsworth took a deep breath. \u201cAccording to the depositions one of our cafeteria staff workers overheard the Ramsey boy trying to get you to go out. When you declined he made reference to saving you from your fat friends. You and I know that he was just goading you but his legal counsel is going to maintain that he was sincerely trying to rescue you from falling under their influence, especially Robert.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have gained weight because I didn\u2019t want to be slim \u2013 and was doing it before I even knew Robert,\u201d Sandy sputtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve investigated and am satisfied that\u2019s true,\u201d the doctor continued. \u201cBut you can expect them to contend otherwise to make his motives seem honorable. He will say that he saw you loading your breakfast tray a second time and felt the need to try to help you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s crap,\u201d declared Sandy. \u201cIt was all you can eat for free pre-orientation and I admit to taking full advantage. Just as I have a lot of free food opportunities on this campus. But no one was forcing me then or since! I don\u2019t need to be saved from myself by anyone \u2013 certainly not a guy older than me who is not even a student.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly. I don\u2019t claim to understand or agree with your position but we\u2019ve discussed this. You\u2019re over 18 and making choices which are your\u2019s to make. I\u2019ve told the District Attorney my opinion and offered it in rebuttal if things get rough on you.,\u201d Dr. Farnsworth informed Sandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy shifted her ample and growing derriere in her chair. She felt the sides slightly gouging her hips.  Visions of pancakes and French toast for breakfast, Boston cr\u00e8me pie for late night snacks, burgers with strawberry malteds at lunch and a dozen other high calorie goodies over the last several months paraded through her head.  Yes, they had all been her choices \u2013 the meat loaf and baked potatoes, spaghetti with oversize meatballs, snapper Veracruz, Chinese all you can eat buffet -- no one had forced a single bite on her.  And she had no desire to cut back either!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, I guess,\u201d she replied.\u201dRobert I know likes his foodie girlfriend, but he didn\u2019t make me this way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I wanted to be sure he wasn\u2019t pressuring you and I\u2019ve confirmed you eat the same way when he\u2019s not around. \u201d Dr. Farnsworth replied. \u201cHe does have a history of being a chubby chaser you do realize?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, he\u2019s definitely that. But my private desire to be more like my Aunt Graciela and some other larger women all my life began years before coming to Powers. In public school the pressure was always the other direction. This past summer I I decided I\u2019d had enough and ten pounds flew on like nothing. I\u2019ve added nearly 20 more since, but I\u2019m still not obese.  If Bud Ramsey thinks I need rescuing he\u2019s an idiot. I like my food baby belly, my thunder thighs, my soccer ball breasts, my baby cradling arms and, yes, even my bountiful butt!\u201d Sandra declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know all that dear, but his legal counsel seems determined to portray you as some sort of deluded victim being manipulated and pushed by your friends. I didn\u2019t want you to be the victim of a surprise attack. Now, go on your way \u2013 and you might want to get something a size or two larger for court.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra knew she was wearing a now snug size tern \u2013 was it already time to move up to a 14? As she went back down the corridor to the elevator she made a mental note to visit the mall. But at the momet she had a hankerting for a jelly filled donut. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was hungry again, despite telling herself that she was going to eat light, after she passivly plowed through a double serving bag of chips while she was studying, losing track of what she was eating while immersed in freshman course material that was not interesting enough to be truly fascinating, but still not intuitive enough to wing the day of the test. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison walked down to the dinning hall, expecting to run into at least a few of the people that she knew at school. She had made many friends, even outside of the core group that she hung out with, and did some friendly waves as she walked down campus. \"Hmm, it's getting a bit cripser out these days.\" Then suddenly, a slight gust of wind came, and she felt it hit her backside, which was exposed between her pants and shirt. Alison pulled it back down, and wondered why her shirt was riding up slightly back there, a rarity for a shirt that she had previously thought was a perfect fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got into the dinning hall, she could smell the scent of pizza that was coming out of the oven, so she went into that line. Yet another day of deciding she would splurge. If Alison was looking into it, she would realize that it wasn't splurging anymore, because she was doing it almost every day. After she got her large glass of non-diet soda, she sat down with Liz. \"Still no Kelsey today?\" asked Alison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, she grabbed a to-go meal.\" Liz replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she didn't even have practice tonight,\" Alison semi-protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said she needed to catch up on her readings, and this was a chance to do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense,\" Alison felt at least somewhat appeased by that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was sitting down, Alison noticed that her two, she did not want to call them this, but they may have been--lovehandles were exposed again as she sat down. She also felt her stomach under the table, and that was pushing out and creased a bit as she sat down, something that never happened in high school. This was enough of an alarm that she stopped listening to the new story that Liz had jumped into and she started to focus on her body. Was she really gaining weight? There was no way it could be as bad as she perceived it to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got back to her room, Alison stripped down again in front of the mirror and saw that the changes were noticeable. Sure, it wasn't huge, and not something any passerby would notice, but to the image conscious Alison, this 7 pound gain were more than enough to catch her attention. \"This isn't good,\" she thought to herself. \"I better work harder to get rid of this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Apparently they\u2019ve figured out what you and Robert know \u2013 my parents are pretty conservative and didn\u2019t care for me to share my fantasies. I liked occasionally having a food baby but it was only an occasional thing, yet inside I always saw myself as bigger than I actually was. Then you gave me a chance to stuff myself my first week here and it was a fantasy come true. I\u2019d planned to stop but instead got in the habit. Now I\u2019ve gained close to twenty pounds. Fortunately no one back at home cares as lonmg as I\u2019m happy and not in trouble. \u2013 but they don\u2019t like the trial\u201d replied Sandra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny more than you probably liked being referred to as a goldfish in school of whales,\u201d recalled Robert, referring to the deposition he\u2019d seen. \u201cI\u2019d like a crack at that guy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts too bad Jessica can\u2019t take the stand and share what she told me,\u2019 noted Mark<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich is?\u201d Sandra inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat she knows I\u2019m not settling for her size but delighting in it, letting her know that she can relax and be herself because I enjoy every curve, that even naked she can still feel beautiful because she sees it in my eyes,\u201d recited Mark<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica blushed. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were were transcribing that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts what bullies like Ramsey need to know \u2013 guys who go with bigger girls aren\u2019t doing it because they can\u2019t get others but because they want it.  Right, Robert?\u201d Mark declared, trying to bolster Sandra\u2019s confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Robert replied. \u201cBut so many girls larger girls have been bludgeoned into not liking themselves. Sandy seems to revel in what she\u2019s been doing \u2013 and I\u2019ve never pushed her, just been happy to share. I\u2019ve always had a soft spot for bigger girls and wanted to hug those who are hurt by the stupid remarks of guys like Ramsey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys,\u201d Sandra spoke up. \u201cI didn\u2019t start out to get a permanent food baby or love handles or back fat \u2013 I was just enjoying the freedom to stuff myself. But then something inside me said I\u2019m be happier with a tummy I could squish and a butt that jiggled a bit. And its been true.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor emphasis Sandra\u2019s hand slipped under her belly and jiggled it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what you mean. \u201c agreed Jessica. \u201cWe should be able to enjoy our big bodies if we want to. I was always having to hold back from eating and enjoying life till Mark helped me feel sexy and beautiful. Now I have a different view and don\u2019t care what others think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a personal decision \u2013 one Sandra may have to assert under oath,\u201d noted Mark. \u201cI think Madison may want to use it for a story in the Proclaimer but I doubt if the mainstream media will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably not,\u201d agreed Sandy, \u201dbut they should! If Robert and I have potato  soup, prime rib with baked potatoes and sour cream plus chocolate cake for dinner and I pick up a quarter pound that\u2019s our call \u2013 not the diet police. I\u2019ve found that I like food and of course it shows. But it will level off eventually and I\u2019ll have a body I enjoy plus a guy who likes his girls bigger \u2013 best of both worlds!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell said,\u201d Mark agreed. \u201cI read in a blog somewhere that is more honest to acknowledge one\u2019s growing belly as something you enjoy more than you want to conform to what others think you should look like. When you stop enjoying eating and growing, then's the time to stop. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the dinner Jessica and Sandra did tonight wasn\u2019t stopping. It was great\u201d Robert declared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. But its not a transition you make all at once, \u201c Jessica noted. \u201cWhen I came here a year ago you could see my ribs. Then I let myself have a little too much pizza and ice cream and they disappeared, but I didn\u2019t notice. It was only when someone took some pictures and uploaded them to Facebook that I realized I\u2019d picked up maybe 20 pounds.  had to make a decision \u2013 diet or go with the flow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt first I tried the diet route, but then I got interested in a guy and found I  wasn\u2019t his \u2018type,\u2019 which I took to mean not big enough. At that point I was maybe 145. So then I let myself gain a few more \u2013 but he turned out to still be unimpressed because I could never be his type!  He had a boyfriend offf campus! Fortunately that\u2019s when Mark walked into my life.\u201d Jessica smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what she weighed then \u2013 I just knew she was great and didn\u2019t mind sharing good food,\u201d related Mark.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t know it but I was enjoying playing with my belly and having to get new clothes. By the end of May I was up to 160 and I\u2019m more now, thanks to my mom\u2019s cooking this summer. I guess I\u2019m now officially more tubby than just plump.\u201d Jessica said. \u201cIf you told me in high school I\u2019d be this big I would have laughed but as you\u2019ve seen my appetites still strong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know when or if I\u2019ll get to where you are, but it doesn\u2019t frighten or bother me,\u201d noted Sandra. \u201cI did martial arts at one time and should probably exercise more, but I know that I have no desire to slow down my eating for now \u2013 and that means more pounds to play with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of which, as I recall somebody\u2019s boyfriend brought ice cream over for banana splits tonight,\u201d Robert interrupted. \u201cShould I serve them now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, sure,\u201d replied Jessica as both her and Sandra\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cYou\u2019ll find the toppings and Redi-Wip in the refrigerator \u2013 the bananas are to the left on the sink.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese two are coming along just fine, grinned Mark to himself. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile, in the freshman dorm, Alison was having a bad day. She had overslept through her first class, then tripped and fell on her way to class, scrapping her knee. She got called on in her freshman lit class and did not know an answer, and finally, she stubbed her toe on a desk during her last class of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, this day needs to end.\" She thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got back to the dorm she was exhausted and fell onto the futon, where she started to browse the past day's event on her smartphone. \"Hmm, that's a pretty big dinner,\" she thought while looking at photos that Sandra has posted of the night's previous dinner. It looked like Jessica, Robert and Mark were also there. \"Jessica looks a bit bigger than even a month ago,\" she pondered as her thoughts also driffted to her own stomach, which was just a tad softer than usual, something she had no intention of keeping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison scrolled down and saw that Kelsey was posting a photo from soccer practice that someone else had taken. She was in an athletic stride, chasing down a ball, and from the photo it looked as if she was successful in that act. <i>I hope she makes the team, but at the same time, it would be nice to have my workout buddy back...</i> Alison just kind of sat there for a few more minutes until she got a text. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Come to my room, I have a surprise. --Liz</i> Alison obliged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got down the hall to Liz's room, Liz rushed to the door to let her in. Alison took a moment to look at the outline of Liz's belly on her shirt, and noticed that she was rather top heavy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won the monthly student union contest!\" Liz excitedly told her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison had no idea what Liz was taking about and looked back at her squinting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, each month, they do a contest during lunch to raise their email lists, and get people to go to local restaurants, and I got two free tickets to the really good Chinese buffet right off campus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison was kind of tired out from the day and wanted to pass, \"Isn't Don free?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No he has to study, come on why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Liz and Alison went down to the buffet. Alison walked in a the aroma of food was much better than any thing she had ever experienced at a buffet before. It also appeared to be nicer than the standard Grandpa and Grandma crowd buffets that were frequent in her hometown. They quickly got seated and Alison found herself filling her plate with the salty and high fat food, more than she had intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came back with her first plate, Liz was already started. \"Isn't this food incredible!\" she said as she finished another crab rangoon. Alsion bit into some orange chicken. \"Oh my gosh, it really is.\" They both quickly finished their first plates, and two plates after that, they put away a bit of desert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...I don't think I can move.\" Alison stated, after wiping some soft serve off her chin, \"that was so good.\" There was something about the food that went beyond the taste for Alison. She was having a cruddy day, and the intense happiness that came from just enjoying her meal and focusing on the great food made her stop thinking about it. She looked over and Liz's stomach looked bigger than before, and almost to be resting on her lap, although her's was also far more bloated than normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they slowly got back to the dorm, Alison was too tired to work out, and lounged around for the rest of the evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was no longer winded on the point of exhaustion after practice, and it seemed like her stamina was actually better than some of the girls who had been on the team for a while. Greta was impressed with this progress, to her at least, it seemed like Kelsey had way more upside than the currently injured Janice. Kelsey also seemed more amendable to instruction, possibly because of her freshman status. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Greta wonder, if Kelsey continued to improve, would she actually challenge Janice for her spot? Even if it was not Janice, if Kelsey improved more, she was going to deprive a player of their spot on the team, Coach Woosley wasn't going to settle out of loyalty when he had the option to give the spot to a better player. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another successful practice, Greta tried to do some more team building,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kelsey,\" Greta said, approaching Kelsey, \"I was thinking about having some people over to my apartment Friday, want to come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey knew that she had plans with Alison and Liz that evening, but she didn't want to miss the opprotunity to hang out with seniors and her teammates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...sure, I guess, sounds fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, I'll text you details later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelsey thought about it while she was undressing, she probably should have declined, but she was sure that Alison and Liz would understand. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was Monday night at Madison\u2019s. The week before Sandy had made a pledge. Now she was happily indulging her inner chef by preparing turkey eggplant lasagna. She had begun by using specially purchased whole wheat lasagna noodles. Then the day before she had prepared a special sauce purloined from an Internet cooking site. In addition to layers of lasagna, cheese and turkey she now included one of saut\u00e9ed spinach for further flavor variety. This entree was to be served family style with salad and a crock of steamed vegetables \u2013 plus of course dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the guests arrived she couldn\u2019t help but notice the contrast between the comfortably plump self-confessed \u201csalad dodger\u201d Maria and the less sanguine former fatty Liz in dealing with their respective bellies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was larger than either Sandy or Liz, but this didn\u2019t seem to faze her. With her newly minted band of heavier friends she was quickly acclimating to celebrating her larger body. It had never been an issue back home in New Mexico and inside her own mind she didn\u2019t think it should in Kansas. . Saturday evening she had been out to dinner with Greg. It was field research for writing her first restaurant review for the <i>Proclaimer. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing his preference she\u2019d worn a shortened top with horizontal bands that teasingly allowed exposure of about an inch of her belly muffin top. It was a ploy from her high school days that she had seen other plump chicanas use. The roll protruded just short of two inches over the waistband of her snug slacks It delighted Greg so much that he\u2019d encouraged her to dress similarly for Monday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz on the other hand was far more demure. She didn\u2019t mind being heavier but was still dealing with what she expected to be censure from back home. She knew it was inevitable that her Mom would discover her regaining what she had once lost. She wore a loose fitting top with narrow vertical black and white stripes whose bottom hem extended to her hip joints, well past her waistline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outline of her softening belly could still be discerned bulging out from her upper rib cage against the fabric, but her clothing deemphasized the growing plumpness of her figure. This modesty did not seem to bother her new friend Don at all, especially as he fully expected that her appetite would not be diminished one bit once dinner began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim, Madison, and of course Sandra\u2019s boy friend Robert, completed the octet. Despite the upcoming court drama Sandy had was becoming quite comfortable with her own expanding body. This was good because she was routinely consuming well over 3000 calories per day and packing on over a pound a week. So far most of her nearly twenty pound gain had been in her thighs and now constant food baby belly, but her upper arms and back were getting slightly softer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everyone present and the table set Madison helped Sandy bring out the food, starting with dinner rolls and salad. The salad was in keeping with the promised Italian theme, including romaine, butter and iceberg lettuce shredded into bite size pieces, then tossed with chopped tomatoes, Provone cheese cubes, kidney and garbanzo beans, turkey sausage chunks and mixed with olive oil and a red wine vinaigrette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came the crock of mixed vegetables and two large casserole dishes with the four layered lasagna. It was obvious that Sandy had gone all out, perhaps with some assistance in menu planning from Jim. Maria was amazed both at the meal and the gusto with which Liz initially filled her plate. Sandy as chef waited her turn to the end but she too enjoyed the meal along with her friends. Neither she nor Maria were surprised when the guys began having seconds and then Liz accepted Don\u2019s offer to refill her plate. Greg and Robert followed his example but Madison refilled her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough there was discussion of the Ramsey affair Greg wanted to focus on Maria\u2019s upcoming article. Using the coupons they had visited Felipe\u2019s, which had been in Wichita for nearly a half century. Greg praised their homemade guacamole which included tomato, onions and seasonings along with the traditional avocado. It was served as an excellent appetizer with tortilla chips while the entrees were being prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria agreed, but focused on the more unique menu items, such as sopes and fuego ribeye, declaring \u201c this you definitely won\u2019t see in most Tex-Mex food joints, which are hardly authentic!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what are sopes?\u201d had asked Don, unfamiliar with the term..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGround corn patties, usually homemade, They\u2019re fried until golden brown, topped with beans &amp; meat plus a layer of lettuce, cheese and salsa, served with beans &amp; rice. The meat can be whatever you choose - beef, chicken or chorizo,\u201d Maria had answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded. \u201cAnd fuego steak?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused a moment before replying. \u201cRibeye steak hand rubbed with spices: ancho, chipotle &amp; poblano pepper spices. Its usually served over roasted red potatoes \u2013 according to the menu Felipe\u2019s version features topping with their own tequila butter sauce. I suggest we order both and then share.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg had readily agreed. The portions were generous, but not so large as to preclude refried ice cream for dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow on Monday Jim and Allison nodded at this synopsis and encouraged Maria to turn it in as a review for the <i>Proclaimer.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK \u2013 but you do realize you\u2019re may get blowback from the rye crisp and lettuce leaf crowd!\u201d she responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat,\u201d replied Jim. \u201cThe controversy will show the paper is being read!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRestaurant reviews are great for those who can afford them,\u201d commented Robert. \u201cI think reviews of great meals by our own student body talent like Sandy tonight would be a good idea as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison and Jim looked at one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d said Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe if food were thought of as art form instead of the enemy attitudes would change, \u201c mused Maria. \u201cSome people would rather date someone who is high or drunk than a fat girl \u2013 but we don\u2019t cause accidents or sacrifice our school or careers. Its stupid \u2013 and we all seem to know it, but many don\u2019t!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts all popularity and a sense of dread,\u201d interjected Liz, \u201cNow I see things from a different perspective but when I first gained I really didn\u2019t pay any attention. I was in denial over the first twenty pounds even though everyone else I knew could tell. The next twenty I was more aware but still dismissed it until my friends and Mom started getting on my case. Then I felt I had to change to please them to be a worthwhile person. That\u2019s why I forced myself to lose. But I felt like crap denying myself. What I should of done was acknowledge I was fat and then simply embraced it. \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison nodded as Don quietly made mental notes. She replied \u201cMy mom was appalled at me for gaining and not caring, but then had to accept it. You can be more accepting of yourself as you get older but teens tend look at their peers, not inside. I realize that now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys are making me see myself and I\u2019m ashamed,\u201d commented Sandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? What are you talking about?\u201d queried Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPart of me has always wanted to be bigger. I even liked bigger guys and padded my clothes in my bedroom. That\u2019s why I never teased bigger people. But I was involved n all kinds of activities and never seemed to gain because I didn\u2019t take time to eat like I wanted. Now I\u2019m becoming what I\u2019ve privately dreamed about and fortunately I have Robert in my corner. He happens to like bigger girls. \u201d Sandy explained. \u201cBud Ramsey and his lawyer can say whatever they want, but I like being bigger. No one is forcing me to get that way. I\u2019m just sorry for having lived a lie till now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, mi amiga. That was quite a speech!\u201d exclaimed Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but it is from her heart and I appreciate it,\u201d declared Robert. \u201cThere\u2019s more to a relationship than just size but there\u2019s nothing wrong with acknowledging what you like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim and Madison exchanged knowing glances as Don and Greg took deep breaths. Neither yet felt comfortable discussing their preferences even in a friendly group, but they sensed he implications. Sandy meanwhile beamed and decided it was time to serve dessert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At the end of the week, Alison got a reply to the text that sent earlier, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kelsey: Yes, I'm still able to hang out tonight, I'll be to your room in 10.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison was happy and put her phone down to pick up the room a bit. Madison and her had let the room get a bit messy during the week, and with some tests coming up, neither had gotten the time to clean it. There were some containers that were in the sink that she quickly washed and put away, the leftovers from Monday night that Madison saved took a while to get through, and Alison was shocked when Madison had told her how much initial food there was. \"Hmm, well I guess I can see where the extra weight on her came from,\" Alison thought, not as judgmentally as much as matter of fact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Alison also knew that she wasn't all that immune to changes either, she had gained another three pounds since she last weighed herself, bringing her up to 135 on her 5'9 frame. Sure, it was only three pounds, but that equaled a whole ten pounds since she had gotten to Powers, and she was not thrilled at the prospect of crossing over an even number like that. Soon, she feared she would be one of those people trying to lose 25, or even 30 pounds, as opposed to someone who just needed to work out more...the current way that she had classified herself. And even then, she was probably being hard on herself, she wasn't even overweight, not even close to being chubby yet. Her legs were a bit bigger, but they were nothing that was out of the ordinary, she was just shifting from very thin, thinish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese thoughts went through her head as she changed out of her sweats and into jeans, it was officially cold now, and a trendy top. She sat down for a few minutes and watched some TV, until she got a knock on the door and proceeded to let Kelsey in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! How's it going!\" Kelsey said while smilling, happy to see Alison. Alison looked Kelsey over, who was as fit as she had been before, if not fitter. Soccer had clearly whipped her into even better shape. She was wearing a very tight shirt, and skirt, that showed off her legs, which may have been bigger, but looked more toned. Alison responded, \"Good, looks like soccer has been going well for you,\" Alison meant competitively, and Kelsey did not catch that it could have also been taken to have meant physically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm having the time of my life, I'm actually competing for a permanent roster spot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all news to Alison, who was glad, but wondered what this would do to Kelsey's time constraints, and other friend commitments, she never did ask how Kelsey enjoyed hanging out with some of the soccer players last week. They continued to talk, mostly about class, and Alison wondered, <i>If Kelsey and I spend even less time working out, maybe I can workout with Kevin...I really need someone to help motivate me. </i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Alison and Kelsey went out to a party, it was Friday night, and each wanted to have a good time. She texted Kevin, who showed up about 40 minutes after they arrived. It was a pretty typical off campus house party, people just mainly talking with some too loud music on in the background. After a while, Kevin got a text from Clark and after reading it, let Alison and Kelsey know that there was a rager going on a few blocks down, \"...so are you both interested?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison thought it sounded pretty fun, but was going to go with the consensus of the group. Kelsey however, did not want to get caught drunk so close to achieving her soccer goal. On a normal evening she probably would have been okay with it, but the timing was not right, and she informed the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" Kevin responded, \"how about we get some late night food then? There is a really good dinner open until 2 a bit off campus\" Being a college guy, he was always pretty hungry, and both the girls agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got there, Alison was planning on getting something small, maybe a side of fries, but then on the way she got hungry, and by the time she was there, she was convinced that she wanted a burger....and maybe some pie to spit with Kelsey and Kevin.  </span></div></div>",

This involved devouring four pieces of chicken, half of two sides of cold slaw and green beans, and the majority of a container of macaroni and cheese. Two large chicken pieces and the balance of the sides were left for Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIncluding the soda that\u2019s another 1200 calories, girl,\u201d Jessica thought. She knew Sandy was regularly packing away 3590-4000 calories a day and it was showing \u2013 perhaps close to twenty pounds in three months.  And tomorrow finally was the hearing on Bud Ramsey, where they suspected the defense might try to prove he wasn\u2019t bullying and harassing  with unwelcome advances, just trying to intervene on what he perceived as an eating disorder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, right,\u201d thought Jessica. \u201cThen what about the others he\u2019s accused of being involved with? Sandy may be a foodie, but not a sicko like him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica and some of the others from Powers planned to be on hand for moral support. Jim and Madison would be writing a story. Jessica planned to wearher skin tight leggings and body suit that emphasized her thighs and belly. Other media might be on hand as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica warmed her dinner in the microwave and had her supper. Later Sandy got back and they shared generous helpings of chocolate chip ice cream before retiring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know they\u2019re going to make a big deal of your weight gain, right?\u201dshe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that. But I like feeling stuffed and being bigger \u2013 and so does Robert. Its not like I can go on having fun with food forever, but I not even officially fat yet \u2013 am I?\u201d Sandy observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably not \u2013 but I\u2019m bigger than you so I\u2019m no one to talk. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not bothered by it,\u201d replied Jessica.<br>\r\n\u201cNope, I\u2019m not bothered. There\u2019s actually a story to why I want to be bigger that you don\u2019t know. Maybe after the trial I\u2019ll share it,\u201d Sandy replied mysteriously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Robert met Sandy at the Power;s commissary where she had her typical breakfast, including a three egg cheese and avocado omelet, hash browns and a couple of pancakes. She had on her empire cut dress with short sleeves. The outfit displayed both her growing belly and softening upper arms. Robert noted that the outfit also tended to emphasize her ample hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look great for the big day,\u201d he noted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I intend to be the self-confident fattie vs the the village creep. They started this but I\u2019m ready,\u201d she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hearing began with the cafeteria worker who had initially reported the incident repeating what she had observed. Sandy, she related, was minding her own business; Ramsey (who the server knew wasn\u2019t a student) uninvitedly approached her, then began making derogatory references about her appetite  and choice of friends when she declined his advances. If hadn\u2019t been for the intervention of  the other students it could have escalated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ramsey\u2019s attorney had his turn. He established that Sandy was getting seconds and tried to establish that this was part of a pattern of overeating. The Judge however sustained the objection of the prosecution that Sandy\u2019s eating habits weren\u2019t germane to the charges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was Sandy\u2019s turn. The plumpness of her body was fully evident as she was worn in and settled into the witness chair. The prosecution had her corroborate the attendant\u2019s testimony and then it was the defense\u2019s turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs the first time you\u2019ve brought charges against someone in a matter such as this?\u201d he enquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t charged anyone. It was Powers that came to me investigating,\u201d Sandy corrected the attorney. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you knew that my client was actually right in his perception of your eating disorder and were just going to let it slide?\u201d said the attorney.<br>\r\n\u201dObjection\u201d said the prosecution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSustained.,\u201d replied the Judge. \u201cCounsel will refrain from that line of questioning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, then,\u201d pounced defense counsel. \u201clet me ask this \u2013 does the name Ozzie Haverlick mean anything to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy blanched a bit but maintained her cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOzzie was accused but never indicted \u2013 and again, it wasn\u2019t me making the charges. I just try to run my own life,\u201d replied Sandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, will you please tell us about the matter with Ozzie as you recall it,\u201d probed the attorney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn high school he liked me but I was just courteous in response. We never dated or did anything. Then someone slipped me a date rape drug and I got woozy at a party. Ever wanting to help Ozzie saw me struggling and offered me a ride home. As we were going out to the car some other guys ran up and accused him of being the one who spiked my cola. Two of them held him while the third called the cops. He got arrested but claimed he\u2019d been set up by these guys, who I know had a gripe against him for turning one of them in for cheating. He got suspended but graduation was three weeks away and the DA said there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to prosecute. No one ever proved who did it \u2013 personally I don\u2019t think he was the type and these guys were bad news.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it was during the summer after that incident that you began gaining weight, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d charged the defense attorney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI picked up a few pounds, yes, but it had nothing to do with the incident. I wasn\u2019t as physically active and enjoyed a lot of ice cream in hot weather. I didn\u2019t mind a few pounds then and still don\u2019t.\u201d Sandy shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt had nothing to do with the stress of that event? Didn\u2019t you tell your buddy Natalie Franks that if you had a few extra pounds something like that wouldn\u2019t happen again?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd didn\u2019t you also tell her hat he stress had you snacking more?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yes. But it was my choice. Frankly I\u2019ve never been against being plumper, it just didn\u2019t happen in high school because I was so busy. \u201c Sandy answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow we\u2019re getting somewhere,\u201d the defense attorney proceeded. \u201cLet me ask you, haven\u2019t you been eating more since coming to Powers Isn\u2019t that because of the stress of being away from home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cObjection,\u201d said the prosecution, \u201ccalls or a conclusion not supported by any foundation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour honor, replied the defense attorney, \u201cI am trying to show the bias of this witness. She is in denial of stress induced overeating patter that the most rudimentary investigation readily confirms. My client was able to sense it and she herself hasn\u2019t denied it. Power\u2019s University knows I\u2019m right \u2013we are prepared to put one of her counselors on the stand to confirm this diagnosis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm,\u201d said the Judge, \u201cYou can proceed, but carefully. The witness is not on trial for anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK. Now, haven\u2019t you gained weight since coming to Powers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,. Replied Sandy levelly. \u201dBut not because of what you are insinuating. I like food and being a bit bigger. Your client\u2019s behavior may have caused me to eat even more and gain faster but that doesn\u2019t make what he did trying to control my behavior right. What about the others he\u2019s charged with? Were they persons of size as well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat we\u2019ll deal with down the road \u2013 my question to you is, how much have you gained since graduating high school?\u201d probed the attorney<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least twenty pounds \u2013 I don\u2019t know the exact number. But your client isn\u2019t my judge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, but I suggest he was only trying to help you wityh a very obvious issue, not harass. And enjoy your dinner tonight,\u201d concluded the defense with a smug smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Sandy was allowed to stand down, fuming.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a load of crap,\u201d Jim said to Sandy in the court hallway as Madison looked on. \u201cI have the perfect headline for this: \u2018fat folks are fair game for predators says defense\u2019\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree,\u201d said Madison, \u201dand that\u2019s the way I intend to write it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo days later the next day article appeared, portraying Ramsey and his attorney as self-righteous anti-fat bigots and Sandy as a nice girl with a forgiving nature and a full waistline. It was a sympathetic piece meant to combat size discrimination and as such drew favorable comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamsey\u2019s preliminary hearing dragged on for two more days, the defense generating as must of a dust cloud as possible, and he was finally bound over. Ultimately the state was unable to prove its worst suspicions and he plea bargained to supervised probation. No Powers student would ever report Ramsey on campus again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Feel free to make up any characters, or take the story wherever you wish.)</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison decided that she should take it easy after her first week of class and ventured over to the gym after class. The gym was filled with people who seemed to care about their bodies. Madison was no stranger to the gym and quickly ran a few miles on the treadmill. She chatted with some guys who seemed into her, and also looked over and some girls who were larger and struggling to lose weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked over on the elliptical she saw girls who looked like they hated their condition. Unlike her workout, in which she seemed to easily breeze through exercises, and her tired look almost made her more attractive, she saw girls who were filling out their shirts with spare tires, or who had to work out while their thighs shook everywhere. Madison would never say it out loud because she was nice to nearly everyone she met, but she was happy that she didn't look like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she was done working out she took some laps in the pool to cool down. She wore a bikini that showed why she was so popular back in Florida. Madison had lean, toned legs, a firm butt, nearly washboard abs and a good sized, but perky bust. Guys couldn't help but look at her when she was getting out of the pool after she <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison finished her workout and arrived at the cafeteria, and could not believe how great the food looked. She had previously remembered the food looking good on the tour but neither she nor her parents really paid much attention to that area when deciding what school was right for her. There was pizza, burgers, an amazing looking burrito bar, and Chinese food. Usually one to avoid such foods, Madison was hesitant to give in on her first night, besides, out of the corner of her eye, she noticed the salad bar, and also some soup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile pondering her decision, Madison looked across the cafeteria, and saw her new friends Kelly and Cassi just sitting down to enjoy their meals. It appeared to her that they got salads and water. \"I should probably fit in,\" Madison thought to herself, \"but then again, maybe I should celebrate my first night here?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison wrestled with the food display, part of her craving Mexican food, another cautioning the need for discipline.  Starting to yield to temptation she asked an attendant what was in the burritos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have a choice of chicken steak or Chorizo for the meat. We mix it with mushrooms, baby spinach, poblano peppers avocado and a spicy white cheese called queso blanco. Its accompanied by rice and beans with guacamole and sour cream optional,\u201d gushed the attendant. \u201cPersonally I love it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison looked at he attendant, whose full belly pushed her aporn out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cIt certainly agrees with you</i>,\u201d she thought. But still the craving lingered and she gave in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK \u2013 I\u2019ve worked out hard today. I guess its OK to try one,\u201d she replied, \u201cand a sarge diet soda.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent choice,\u201d replied the attendant, \u201cyou won\u2019t be sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe burrito filled the plate, with side bowls of rice and beans. Madison went to the table where her new friends Kelly and Cassie were seated with their salads.  Both were surprised at her meal but initially said nothing, but Madison picked up on their thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I know. It\u2019s a calorie bomb. But I\u2019ve been starving myself for a week and just couldn\u2019t resist,\u201d she said after her third bite. \u201cAnd frankly I\u2019m not sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh its ok,\u201d replied Cassi. \u201cYou\u2019re as thin as a rail compared to me. I kind of wish I could have had a burrito as well. Maybe tomorrow I will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook,\u201d agreed Kelly, \u201cwe\u2019re all adults here to learn. I\u2019m scared to have a meal that big but that doesn\u2019t mean you two can\u2019t have something if you want. We\u2019re just getting to be friends and shouldn\u2019t be making each other feel guilty over such things. That\u2019s so high school!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that assurance Madison relaxed and finished her meal. It was very filling and she felt stuffed but comfortable. She went home, watched a situation comedy and had worked on her homework for an hour when Cassi came into her room with a bowl of popcorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere,\u201d Cassi offered. \u201cI was starving after that salad to match Kelly, and made this to compensate but there\u2019s more than I could handle. Would you like some? I have some root beer to go with it\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm, sure,\u201d Madison replied. She knew she shouldn\u2019t have room but for some resdion was thrsty.  Within a half hour both popcorn and root beer were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Madison got on the scale, curious to see the damage. There wasn\u2019t any \u2013 she was still 128 pounds, actully a pound less than the prior weekend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cThat\u2019s good \u2013 proves it pays to exercise,\u201d </i>she thought, and went down to breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Powers meal plan Madison was on allowed two free dining hall meals a day of anything you wanted. Up until now Madison had usually had a bowl of cereal with some fruit for breakfast, although many other things were available. Cassie was on another plan and had to pay. This  morning she\u2019d decided to let it be her meal for the day, skipping lunch, and suggested Madison try one of the oversized muffins with an omelette and grapes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cWhy not,\u201d</i> she said to herself. <i>\u201cwith exercising and my metabolism it can\u2019t hurt \u2013 and I can skip lunch as well.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day Madison tried to repeat her workout of the day before. It had been over eight hours since breakfast and she\u2019d skipped lunch, which meant she curtailed her effort compared to the day before and headed with Cassi for the dining hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m having Italian tonight,\u201d Cassi announced. \u201cTuesday is lasagna with spumoni ice cream available for dessert and I\u2019m going to enjoy it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why not me too?\u201d thought Madison, glad to be able to eat a big meal without judgment. The lasagna came with a side of asparagus and pita bread. Kelli wasn\u2019t around but both girls enjoyed every bite plus the generous triple scoop dessert which followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to watch it,\u201d Madison observed to herself as she went home. \u201c I couldn\u2019t exercise as much today because I skipped lunch and had no energy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the next day, despite another good sized breakfast, Madison did have a tuna sandwich and soda for lunch. This gave her he stamina to work out fully and she felt she was back on track \u2013 and could handle in good conscience the chickem fried steak and mashed potatoes that was the evening\u2019s special entr\u00e9e, along with coconut cream pie for dessert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThursday night she knew would be a pizza fest in the dorm, so she used her meal ticket at lunch for a tamale and enchilada plate. And she worked out  before having four pieces of pizza and two of chicken along with two sodas Thursday night, about half of what Kelli had, but nothing was said. Still, the next morning, the scale showed no change.  What Madison did not realize was that she was expanding her stomach capacity and improving her appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis pattern kept up for the next two weeks \u2013 eating more freely but not in her mind extremely, exercising and keeping her eye on the scale with no discernible effects, But then one of her instructors mandated study teams which cut into two of her workouts \u2013 and of course someone brought chips and sods for the meetings. It probably wasn\u2019t more than 500 calories twice a week \u2013 but her energy output was cut by at least a thousand as well.  But by then Madison was too busy to be checking the scale.  Had she done so she would have found that by her second full month at college she\u2019d gained a barely noticeable five pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy his time she was eating and partying on the weekends. Ron Westlin in particular had taken note of her appetite and took her to dinner as well as plying her with snacks at parties.  Cassie meanwhile was not on the two meal a day dining hall plan like Madison. She had taken to keeping a pastry stash on hand so that she could skip breakfast \u2013 and would share items from it with Madison in the evening two-three times a week. Madison enjoyed the maple bars, bear claws and eclairs and never turned one down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the third month Madison noticed her clothes getting snug and got on the scale \u2013 which this time read 138 pounds.  She was up a dress size and faced with the possibility of dieting. But both Ron and Cassi told her it was not that noticeable and she should just take it easy over the holidays. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wrote a worried email to her mom, admitting she\u2019d gain ten pounds and wondering how she would react. She didn\u2019t expect her mom, who was a tad plump herself, to be overly upset but still she wondered. Weight discussions hadn\u2019t been typical table talk in the Kraft household.  The reply was reassuring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarling, you\u2019re there at Powers to prepare for a career, not competing to be a runway model. Your guy and roommate have it right. With less activity and your focus on grades, as it should be, a few pounds are to expected. I\u2019ll send you a check for a better fitting wardrobe and let you concentrate on your schoolwork,\u201d e-mailed her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs promised the check arrived two days later. Relieved, Madison bought some new clothes and elaxed, determined o uust cut ck so she wouldn\u2019t gain any more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course that didn\u2019t happen. She\u2019d formed a new cycle of normal eating. Breakfasts were typical. Pancakes with eggs for breakfast one day, French toast another, corned beef hash with scrambled eggs another, even enchilada  casseroles were among the succulent dishes that enticed her in the Powers dining hall each morning. A burger and shake with Ron at noon followed by an entr\u00e9e with dessert in the evening and even less exercise during holiday break were also mixed in. Madison avoided the scale, inwardly knowing what was happening but choosing to be in denial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe declared to herself that she still looked fine, which was true if you didn\u2019t mind flared hips, noticeable belly pooch, soft arms and growing thighs. She carried the new pounds but there was no doubt that Madison Kraft was no longer svelte. Her belly was even with her ribcage, not concave, when standing and gathered into a small roll when seated. Her formerly angular chin was fleshy, although not yet sporting a second section. A thin layer of back fat was forming on her rib cage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie\u2019s snack habits were no deterrent. In addition to the pastry supply she had chips and other snack foods on hand, particularly popcorn, which she insisted on sharing with Madison. Her weight was climbing as well and it seemed as if she liked having company. By March Madison was up to 150 and ready for another wardrobe upgrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cFreshman 15 plus seven</i>.\u201d she grimaced. \u201c<i>Shouldn\u2019t I be hating it? But I really don\u2019t. I\u2019m 5\u20197\u201d and this is just barely overweight for my height. Its not really that bad, but guess I\u2019ll need to ask mom for some more clothes money.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison got some more money from her Mom and went clothes shopping, while she was there, she noticed she was up to a size 8. A year ago, still in high school it would have been more problematic. As she got to college, Madison started to move out of the high school chain stores that sold short jean skirts and too tight tanks for $95, towards more young adult oriented stores. She found their clothes to make her feel more intelligent and respectable. Sure, she still was going to get her 'slut' outfit, as she called it, for her occasional crazy night out, or fraternity party, but more and more Madison found herself going for adult clothes. Chinos, respectable, yet trendy tops, shorts that she could pull off at the bars and an afternoon at the country club. The wardrobe change was somewhat standard for most girls transitioning into adulthood, however, for Madison it allowed to make an excuse to show less skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lack of skin was something Madison could not hide when spring break came. She was extremely nervous, especially because she was nowhere near as fit as she was in previous years, when wearing a bikini was a point of pride. When the girls from her floor, and a group of guys including Ron went down to Mexico for spring break, she did not know what to expect. The girls made 'Spring Break xoxo!' tank tops, and it was Madison's hope that those would provide her mid-section with cover while she drank light beer with the rest of their crew. However, after a while, Madison noticed that her body did not seem that bad in comparison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, Madison had gained a few more pounds since she weighed herself at 150, but her body looked mostly the same. What had changed was the girls around her from other schools at the beach. Yes, outside of Cassi, who had put on a significant amount of weight, the rest of the Powers girls were still stick thin, but she looked around, many of these college girls seemed chubby, if not downright plump. This was in sharp contrast to what she was used to in Miami, where it felt like no one ate anything and everyone was thin. It was reassuring the Madison that her 150 pound body was close to normal here at their party beach in Mexico, and this caused her to indulge, taking full advantage of the lowered drinking age and abundance of beach food. What Madison had not noticed in this situation was that they were the young ones. Most of the girls on spring break were juniors or seniors, and had reached comparable bodies over 4 years, not one, and if Madison didn't change her current trajectory, she was going to get far bigger than them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spring break was over, it was time for Madison to calm down and study. Even though no one would say she didn't enjoy herself over the year, she had still kept good grades, and with some challenging classes starring her down, Madison hit the books, staying inside and trying to get the highest grades possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis however, did not come at the expense of food. Madison would often get pizza to go from the dinning hall, or order in. Her planned exercise regimen fell victim to the studying as well. \"I can always work it off this summer,\" thought Madison. Between the meals and snacking, Madison continue to do harm to her figure through the spring. There was an upside to all of this though, after it was all over, Madison felt like she had done exceedingly well on her finals, and later in the summer, her high marks would confirm that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the studying, Madison's grades were not the only thing that were high, and on one of the final nights before she left for her summer break in Miami, Madison was finally forced to confront her weight. Her and Ron were going to go out for a final dinner before the year was over. As Ron was waiting outside of Madison's dorm room, he heard her sounding very distressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughhhhhh, come on!!!!\" He heard Madison grunt from outside the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need any help, can I come in?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Actually, I think we should cancel.\" Madison responded, on the brink of tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ron responded, entering the dorm room to a shocked Madison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ron?! I said I want to cancel. Ron would see why. Madison was in her panties, which looked excessively tight. She had been trying, with not a ton of luck, to close the pants she had bought a few months ago, when she was 150. If Madison had previously been on a the fuller side of thin, she now looked chubby. Her thighs had seen a significant amount of growth, and now touched for most of the way down to her knee. Ron could see that they loooked softer than he previously remembered. She now had a belly that stuck out slightly, and love handles to go with it. Even if she could have been able to get the pants to go up, Ron suspected she would have had a muffintop. Madison's arms looked softer still, and he noticed that when she smiled, a previously absent double chin was starting to form. Ron didn't have to worry about the smiling part at the moment, though, because Madison looked like she wanted to cry. She was up to 167 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ron, I'm getting fat. Look at me.\" she said, throwing her unbuttonable pants to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you can always work it off.\" he said, trying to comfort her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, stop it. No one is going to want to date me. I look horrible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon found his opening and walked up to her, \"No, you don't\" he said, gently touching her face, \"Besides, I kind of like it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison could not decide if Ron was being truthful or just trying to make her feel better. Either way, she did not care, and smiled. Even thought she wanted to lose the weight, and was planning on a heavy workout in the summer, Ron was making her feel better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no dinner that night, but neither of them ended up leaving the room until the following morning. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nRon knew it would be 10 weeks until he saw Madison again. He would have liked to taken her to an elaborate dinner but their night together was for both of them great \u2013 they\u2019d even ordered in some pizza. The memory was burned into his mind. Sure, she\u2019d gained some weight but he knew he\u2019d enabled a good part of it and liked the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll during their relationship he\u2019d taken her out dining to a better restaurant such Cheesecake Factory and Olive Garden at least once a month. He\u2019d also joined her for \u201cstudy\u201d lunches that seemed to focus in studying the latest edible novelties in the Powers dining hall \u2013 there always seemed to something. He\u2019d also introduced her to a variety of fast food emporiums as part of off campus weekend excursions. Madison had come to know all about McDonald\u2019s double jalapeno burgers, Hardee\u2019s Texas BBQ Thick burgers, Arby\u2019s roast beef and cheddar burgers and smokehouse brisket sandwiches, and IHOP\u2019s Burrito and pancake breakfast combo, among others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison had changed in her first college year and he couldn't help but wonder what would occur when she returned home.  Madison wondered as well, but the fact was that she wasn't of a mind to give up her new interest in food and wasn\u2019t really upset at the results. She went along with Cassie\u2019s philosophy that eventually she would find a balance between her base metabolism and her food intake \u2013 but hadn\u2019t really done the math to figure it out. Had she done so she would have discovered the balance point to be well over 200 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Florida her parents were initially wondering as well. They were expecting a larger Madison because of her emails and decided ahead of time to keep a discreet silence. Despite the anticipation they were still a bit surprised at her 40 pound plus expansion but were pleased with her grades and concerned mostly about her happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Kraft initially served the same kind o breakfast Madison had previously consumed  \u2013 toast, fruit and cereal. Madison accepted it but inwardly felt deprived. It was far less than she had become used to. Her mom could tell it wasn\u2019t enough and asked her for suggestions,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe eat more at Powers,\u201d Madison stated factually. An omelet with hash browns would be nice, or  maybe an enchilada casserole. I\u2019ve become quite the gourmet at college \u2013 as you can tell. It\u2019s a great way to keep up your energy for studies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Mom felt her daughter was asserting herself as a test, and decided to play along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if its what you\u2019re used to I\u2019ll try and be more creative. You seem to actually enjoy having gained so much weight,\u201d she remarked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I do need to slow down the pace perhaps, but yeah. I\u2019ve gotten used to being a big girl and Ron like it so why not?\u201d she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friends from high school were initially shocked at how much she\u2019d ballooned, but since she obviously was happy hesitated to confront her. Madison then introduced them to some of her favorite treats and they came to accept her change, even sharing some meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe result? After 10 weeks Madison had picked up 12 more pounds, much to Ron\u2019s delight when she confessed to it in an email.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Ron picked Madison up from the airport, he saw Madison in clothes that actually fit her pretty well, \"Those must be a new pair of jeans,\" he thought to himself, and indeed they were. Madison's Mom took her shopping for almost an entire new wardrobe before she sent her back to Miami. For Madison, these were another in a long line of \"line in the sand\" moment for her on her weight gain. With each high number, she told herself that each new weight gain enabling point was it before she would start trying to plateau her weight gain. Now, with fitting clothes for her 179 pound body, she was doing nothing but enabling herself to become comfortable with her habits, and outgrow another wardrobe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon could see that the extra weight was there though, even if she wasn't bulging from her recently purchased threads. Her face was finally starting to take a bit more of the weight on, and her sharp features were now dulling, giving her more of a cute face, with that double chin slowly making an appearance as more and more weight piled on. He wondered how much more weight it would take for it to be permanently there, 30, 40 pounds perhaps? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got out of the car to great her, \"Welcome back!\" Ron said with genuine enthusiasm, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed you so much!\" Madison replied, running up for a hug and a kiss. When they hugged, Ron could feel her softer backside, and concluded that not much exercising had been done in Miami over the summer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the drive back to the house they were renting, Madison and Ron decided to grab the dinner they were unable to sneak in before summer break had began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that they were sophomores, the option of living off campus was now open to them. They decided to rent a house near campus with Cassi, since that arrangement had worked out well the previous year. With Madison's parent's wealth still having it's perks, by the time she got to the house, she saw that all her stuff had already been moved in, as expected. \"They came by last week, Ron explained as Madison saw her bedroom already set up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon knew that Madison would be wearing a new dress that night, mainly because he suspected that her old ones would not fit. It excited him to see what she would come up with. He enjoyed watching his girlfriend try to find new ways to make her body look good as her weight rose, and he wondered what kind of dress she would go with, imagining the skin tight cocktail dresses of old were most definitely out of the picture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Madison met Ron downstairs, she was wearing a yellow dress that attempted to hide her weight gain, with not total success. It was a yellow dress with small straps. Her larger bust was evident, and he could see that she was probably wearing shapeware around her midsection--despite that, the outline of her tummy could still be seen. The cut of her dress broke almost at the knee, far longer than what she used to wear back when she was a 4, yet another concession to her larger legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night they went to one of the best resturants in town, and Ron took note of how Madison didn't think twice about finishing her whole steak, and then wanting to get ice cream on the way home. As they arrived back at the house, Madison noted to Ron, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so stuffed, but I think I'll probably try to work out a bit tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look great, Madison! You dazzled at the restaurant tonight.\" he replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I don't want to have to go and buy new clothes again. Plus, I should probably watch my weight anyways.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked inside, Ron was left wondering how committed Madison would be to this effort.</span></div></div>",

As she walked over to the display she noticed a greasy pepperoni pizza had just been placed its delicious aroma wafting into the air. Madison paused slightly taking the smell in before being interrupted by the lunch attendant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready to order?\" impatiently said the attendant \"Do you want a salad or not\". Madison looked at the attendant who clearly had not eaten a salad in years. \"Yes please\" despite the attendants rude behavior Madison had always been taught to be polite and courteous.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison grabbed a water and finished her order, looking down at her food she noticed how small and petite it looked. She suddenly was wishing she had grabbed a slice of pizza or maybe even two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Madison walked over to Cassie and Kelly taking a seat next to Cassie. \"Hey girls\"  \"Hey Madison\" they said in unison \"How was your workout\" as the girls noticed that Madison was still a bit sweaty from her workout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was great thought I am wishing I got a bit more nut have to watch those calories right?\" replied Madison. \"I know the feeling I swear I put on a couple pounds even if I have a small container of ice cream\" sighed Cassie who was lightly nibbling on her salad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\" said Kelly \" We shouldn't have to all feel so guilty about wanting a filling meal we can indulge a little we are all working out fairly often no need to have a crappy salad  for every meal\". The two other girls nodded and decided that they shouldn't feel bad if they indulge every once in awhile and they won't judge each other if they do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the meal Madison was back at the dorm still feeling hungry from lunch and thinking about Kelly's words. Why scolding she grab something to ea if she is still hungry she shouldn't have to starve herself!  Madison decided that she was going to stop at the store and grab a few snacks. When she came home Cassie was home and surprised at the amount of bags that Madison had brought inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelping her with the bags Cassie noticed Lays, Pringles and other junk foods in the bag. \"Looks like someone went to the store on a empty stomach\" smirked Cassie. \"I don't know what came over me Cassie it all looked so good and I never could have them back at home so I figured I could try a few..\" blushed Madison. \"No need to explain yourself just pass the ice cream I think we deserve a movie night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat Night Madison and Cassie finished off the half gallon of ice cream. Feeling stuffed Madison felt assured that her workout and salad would mitigate any damage done tonight not knowing that she had not accounted for how many calories were actually in the container....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
