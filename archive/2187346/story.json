This was part of a yearly routine he hated to do. The dreaded cleaning of the house. Every year on the first day of spring Kevin's mom made them all clean part of the house. His mom would clean the living room, his sister the kitchen, Kevin upstairs, Jacob the basement and his father the garden. This was something of an ongoing tradition he hated. That's why Kevin thought he could escape his chores by going to Josh that morning. Sadly when he returned home he found his mother standing on the front porch, her arms crossing her chest. While Kevin was spending his time with Josh, Jacob cleaned upstairs. So the only thing left to clean was the basement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, it stinks.\" Kevin smelled the washing machine as his mom had already cleaned it. Kevin quickly opened the small window taking in some fresh air. Still, the funky smell stayed in the air. Trying to figure out where it came from, Kevin moved some boxes around. When he pushed the last box out of his way he found out what it was. Lying in a corner was a chalice; a golden chalice covered in jewels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning his eyebrows Kevin took a closer look at the chalice. That thing looked pretty valuable. Maybe they could sell it online and fetch some money for it. Kevin assumed they wouldn't buy anything for him alone, but a new 4K television would be to the benefit of everyone. Grinning, Kevin grabbed the chalice to take it with him. And that moment it happened. Kevin felt a power coming from the chalice, it felt like a bolt of electricity was coursing through his body. His mind only thought of letting go of the thing, but his hands wouldn't let go off the thing. Kevin thought his live would come to an end when suddenly he felt being taken away, like he was floating on the air. The only thing he couldn't do was steer. Not knowing whether to enjoy the flight or to cower in fear, Kevin felt his body floating back up the stairs. He closed his eyes as he expected to crash through the door, but nothing like it happened. Instead when Kevin was in the hallway, he saw someone standing and before he knew it, he crashed into the person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was this person?</span></div></div>",
