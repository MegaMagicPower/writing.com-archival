For the main part, John doesn't mind, or really, he <i>can't</i> mind, whenever he protests to a slice of cake, his dad gets this sad little look, like John is scolding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's taken nearly a week, but John's finally stopped caring. Sure, cake gets tiring after a while, but it's not like his father's cakes are bad, and after a while the sugary flavors don't seem so overpowering. Plus that Gushers-cake dad had made the other day had really opened John's eyes to the wonders of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, John is perched at his desk, working on 'homework'; he and Dave are actually currently discussing what they're learning in history and unhonestly debating which slight variation is true. A slice of carrot cake rests on the desk beside him, a few mouthfuls missing, and John picks at it as he types.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn is precariously unaware of how little cake is left, and when he finally logs off pesterchum, hearing his father call out something about dinner being done downstairs, his fork is absently scraping across the empty plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging off his fullness, John climbs to his feet and calls out a \"Coming!\" back downstairs.</span></div></div>",

It was a lazy Sunday, so he only wore his heart print boxers on his lower half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was currently preoccupied with another mind-numbing video game as he slowly consumed a large bowl of nacho chips his Bro had bought the other day. Dave was sure he was going to get yelled at for pinching it, but that was later, and Dave was hungry now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s not like anything else was in the house. Bro was a cool guy and all, but he was an\u2026 interesting guardian at best. The fridge was full of shitty swords, the kitchen cupboard full of fireworks. The only food Dave got was either the things he bought for himself with his meagre allowance (which sucked because it was so small even though Dave <i>knew</i> Bro was damn loaded with cash from the puppet biz and other side projects) or the cheap fastfood that Bro bought occasionally for dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave knew this pseudo starvation tactic was part of Bros larger plan, whatever the fuck that was. At least it, along with the near daily strifes he had with his Bro had kept Dave in pretty good condition. Lean but not skinny, broad shoulders, lightly toned muscles composing his makeup. Dave was good looking and he knew it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached another hand into the bowl of cheesy deliciousness. But instead of his fingers finding any more nachos as expected, his sadly touched the bottom of the bowl. <br>\r\nA shocked Dave paused his game and looked down at his problem, he didn\u2019t want to believe it, he had already eaten his way though the whole thing, and it had been jumbo sized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave let out a weary chuckle, the reality check prompted a dawning realization of how full his belly had gotten. It was taut and noticeably bloated, if only a little. <br>\r\nDave was just surprised he had eaten them so fast, he had made such a glutton out of himself, and he still kind of craved for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t exactly unusual for Dave to eat voraciously, he was raised to be ravenous or he wouldn\u2019t get any of the good food if he wasn\u2019t fast enough when Bro brought home take out. But this had to be a new speed record for finishing a big bowl of chips Dave thought glumly. He rationalized, maybe the chip packet were more stingy these days, though his fullness didn\u2019t agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to just sit on his butt playing video games without refreshments, even if he wasn\u2019t hungry, Dave weighted up his options.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Or hey, maybe it was just sweeps of sitting on his ass all day and eating junk that finally caught up with him. There's a reason for the fat nerd stereotype, and he seems to be perpetuating it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever, it's cool, he probably needed to gain a few anyways. Being that thin wasn't healthy, so this would make him normal. Or normal-ish. Same difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly growls, breaking him out of his internal monologue.

However, a few ground rules for everyone to keep in mind before adding stuff on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Let's keep this slightly realistic. No 100 pound gains overnight or anything, but, as it is a fantasy, you shouldn't restrain yourself. Just...let's avoid John waking up one day and realizing he's immobile.<br>\r\n2. Let's try to avoid turning the kids into gross blobs.<br>\r\n3. Male? Female? Both are acceptable here.<br>\r\n4. You can say characters are intimate or have sex, but let's avoid any explicit sex or anything like that. These are kids, so it's kinda disturbing if you guys write stuff that's...kinda very creepy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, go crazy.</td>",
