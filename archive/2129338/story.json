They even have genitals of either gender. They don't automatically attack when they see a human but they can be triggered into an attacking frenzy by any of the Nine Titans (nine humans that can transform into titans including Ehren, Ymir, Reiner, Bertolt, and Annie). When not in an attacking frenzy, they act like the Talking Titan, capable of primitive communication and emotions like guilt. Otherwise, all powers, rules and motives remain the same as the canon universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: There are more than nine humans that can transform into titans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 4: Create your own variation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 5: Create your own variation.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While she had been assigned to the rear guard, Mikasa couldn't stop herself from abandoning her post in order to go check on Erin. She didn't care if she got in trouble, just as long as Erin was safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had promised his father that she would protect him, although that promise was a little redudant, as she had decided to do that the day Erin saved her life before then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take her long to spot the squad of soldiers flying through the air in their ODM gear with the way they all leapt from rooftop to rooftop. There were less of them than their should have been, but Mikasa saw the only two that really mattered to her. Armin was back with the other four soldiers and Erin was...chasing after a titan in the midle of the street while wildly screaming his head off without any regards to his years of training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikasa picked up the pace to try and intercept Erin before he could do something stupid, but as they closed the gap betwen them, it looked more and more as if she would arive too late, if just by a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, something horrific happened. The titan moved faster than it should have and turned around to open its jaws while Erin flew closer at the wrong angle to get a cut it. The monster was going to be in a position to bite his legs off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight sent a wave of fear as she reached out and screamed Erin's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a bright flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Mikasa knew, she was standing in the middle of the street, much colder than she had been a moment before. Erin was laying unconscious in her hand while the titan that had tried to eat him sunk its jaws into her wrist. Not fully processing what was going on, Mikasa balled her free hand into a fist and quickly smashed the titan's head in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dead titan fell to the ground, Mikasa's concious mind caught up with the situation and she looked around as the rest of the people Erin was with, including Armin, landed on the roofs a block away from her.</span></div></div>",

Only, the titan Mikasa had turned into didn't look like any titan Armin had ever seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titan Mikasa had turned into looked like a much bigger version of Mikasa...only, without the clothes. She looked just a bit taller than the adverage titan, maybe sixteen to sixteen and a half meters. She also looked female, very...VERY female. Two large breasts stuck out of her chest and female privates that probaby could have swollowed a person whole were also quite apparent on Mikasa's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...this is um...okay...\" Armin mumbeled to himself as he tried to process the fact that he had just whitnessed his friend turn into a titan and that he was now looking at something he had been much too frightened to take a peek at during the years when boys did most of their thinking with the head between their legs instead of the one on top of their shoulders. Overwhelmed by the hundreds of questions running through his mind, Armin found his usually brilliant tactical mind reduced to cutting to the basic facts of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin had been hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikasa had protected Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Armin needed to see if Erin had suffered any serious injuries after getting in over his head again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his ODM gear, Armin took off through the streets and landed on the roof next to Mikasa. \"Hey, is Erin alright? Let me check him for concussions.\" <i> Please don't eat me. Please don't eat me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikasa looked over to the tiny blond teen. \"Armin?\" she asked in a dazed voice before looking down at the boy in her hand. \"I think, I knocked the wind out of Erin when I grabbed him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's...wait,\" Armin said as his mind regested something very different about this titan aside from her female parts. \"YOU CAN TALK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
