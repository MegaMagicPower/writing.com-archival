But despite all this he could not forcuse on his book, his mind was on his 15 year old daughter Janet who was up stairs listening to some god awful pop music. They have just had another huge fight over the Play Boy and Jugg's magazines he found under her bed for the third time.(The first time they were in her closet and the second time he found them hidden under the couch cushions.) He was trying to get her to come out of the closet about being a lesbian but she claimed that she was hold that stuff for her boy freaind. Paul swear she was so much like her mother Kathren that is was down right scary. <br>\r\nFor the past 15 years since the divorce he and his ex have beening fighting over Janet, it wasn't until last year that he could prove the Kathren was giving Janet anti-growth drugs, so she would countinue winning beatuy pageants, also mentally abusing her Kathren was abusive and sneaky women who cared about no one but her self and Paul was afraid that it was to late to save Janet from her mother influence. But that was all about to change because Paul was visted by an old freaind, a genie named Karlose, that promised he would make it so only Paul who raised Janet and the spell would start to take inafect at 8:00 to night and would slowly change her and the world around her over a month long period giving her time to adgust to her new reality and body. Paul looked at the clock it was 7:59... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul Cowan is a 40 year old single dad who owns a car repair shop and also deals with magical items part time. He is thoughtful, open minded, and loves learning new things. He loves his daughter Janet even though she a bitch. He is 6ft 4in, weighs 215 pd with most of it being muscle, has green eyes, dark red hair, and fairly tan skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet Cowan is a 15 1/2 teenage girl. For most of her life she lived with her controlling mother who forced into beauty padgents, and other such things since she was old enough to enter, turning Janet into a teenage version of her. Kathren did all kind of things to her, bleaching her hair and skin, giving her anti-growth drugs, starving her, and much more so she would be the perfect, bitchy, copy of her. Because of this Janet is 5ft 5in, has light skin, bleached blonde hair, C-cup breasts, and natural green eyes, just like her dad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJewel is Janet's yappy annoying male chihuahua that barks and growls at every one but Janet. Janet dose love her little dog, but treats him like a toy instead of a dog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarlose is a 39 year old genie who has been Paul's best friend since college. He is of Indian decent. He agreed to help Paul because he can't stand to see his friend so unhappy. He was able to get Paul's wish to make it so it was him that raised Janet, granted by the magical counsel and was then placed in charge of handling her transformation. He has no idea what Janet will be like but it has to be better than this. His job is to make sure that the magic goes smoothly so it won't hurt or kill Janet by moving faster than she can handle. Being a genie he can be a little wild and will probably have some fun with Janet during her transformation. </span></div></div>",

Janet's face?! Janet was shocked by this and had no idea what to make of it, she was about run out in painike, but Karlose instead had her collapse onto her bed.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Janet got up the next morning from some very vid dreams. They were flashes of Paul and herself being together when she was a child, the two of them were doing things like playing catch in the yard, going to places like baseball games and museums, Paul teaching her how to fix cars, and other father and daughter things that never happen. The dreams were strange dreams, but for some reason they made her feel happy and a little bit regretful that she never got a chance to do them with him. \"No I don't want to do those things with Paul. Only boys or losers would want to do those things.\" Janet told her self, but even as she got ready for school she couldn't shake how those flashes felt more like real memories than simple dreams. On top of that Janet's clothes felt as if they had shrunk a little bit, even her shoes. \"Oh dame you Paul can't you do a better job with the laundry.\" Janet mumbled as she got dressed. Janet put on a white thong and bra, a denim mini skirt that showed her amazing legs and the top of her ass when she bends over, a tight pink t-shirt that showed her flat stomach ( she use to have a belly ring but Paul made her get rid of it, saying that it was trashy). Now even though they were even more tight than normal she put them on anyways, partly because she liked having people paying attention to her, but mostly because Paul hates seeing his little girl dressing in such sexy (or as he put it trashing) clothing, she was still made it him for all kinds of reasons. Soon she heard some whining from out side her door, so she went over to open for her little Jewel. \"Good morning Mars, did you come to see your mommy.\" Janet said happly as open the door to let the large pit -bull in. \"Wait a minute, Mars? Pit-bull!?\" Janet did a double check on the dog that jumping around her feet. But no pit-bull just a little chihuahua that was happy to see his mommy.\"Sorry Jewel, I don't know were my head is today.\" Janet told her little puppy dog as she scratched him behind the ears as she finished getting ready for school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul was down stairs cooking bacon, sausages, and eggs, talking to Karluse on the phone. \"You sure I need cook all this stuff for Janet? I don't want her to get fat or have high cholesterol when all this is over\" Paul asked, wanting to make sure he is not doing more harm than good. \"I already told you she is going to need to eat a lot of protean for the transformations. It is not going to be an easy on her, you know how much energy even a simple transformation spell is. And this is little project you have going is like a thousand times bigger than that .\" Karluse told the nervuse father. \"I know, I know, I just... Oops I think Janet is coming down stairs, I better hang up.\" And with that Paul turned off his cell phone as he heard the foot steps of a teenage daughter and the yapping of that poor crazy dog. \"Eww. Eggs!? Paul don't you know how much fat they have.\" Janet whined at her dad, even though the smell was making her drool, and her stomach was screaming at her to eat them. \"Janet! You will refear to me as dad or farther! Got it?!\" Paul told his daughter sternly. \"What ever.\" Janet mumbled as she sat down. \"What was that, Young Lady!?\" Paul asked as he served her a heaping pile of eggs, bacon, sausage, and two grape fruits. \"I said, Yes Father.\" Janet responded sarcastically. \"Good.\" Paul than sat down to eat his grape fruit and oatmeal and began to eat, Janet on the other hand was already inhaling her huge breakfast. In minuates the two grape fruits, the six eggs, the eight strips of bacon, and the nine breakfeats sasuages were gone, and Janet acted like she didn't even relised what she just did happen, which she didn't. \"Honey how many times have I told you shouldn't wear such tight clothing when going to school. You need to have a little more self respect for yourself.\" Paul quietly told his daughter. He didn't want to start another fight but still, he felt he need to say something. \"Oh come on daddy every one dresses like this now a days. Oh I need to get going, the bus is going to be here soon.\" And with that Janet ran out the door, shutting it on Jewels face. \"Wait you didn't feed.... OHHH SHIT!\" Paul roared in pain as the little demon dog-rat narrowed at his ankle. \"Fine let me get you some breakfeast.\" Paul said as he got the dog food out. \"At least I now I'm 100% positive that I made the right choice.\"   </span></div></div>",

But for some reason when she got on the bus and the boys started trying look like there weren't staying at her boobs and ass, she started regretting wearing such revealing clothing. When Janet was living with her mother, she was lead to believe that the only way for some one to like her was because she was sexy and beautiful. After all what else did a girl like Janet have going for her, it wasn't like she was smart or funny. No!! The most important thing was to be pretty, popular and to marry a rich man. Yet her Paul's words were still lingering in her mind as she sat down, maybe getting attetion this way was the wrong way to do it. What ever, what does that old fool know about \"Self-Respect,\" Janet thought to her self as sat down next to her friend Sally. Sally was a blond cheerleader from a wealthy family, and she was just as bratty, bitchy, and shallow as Janet. <br>\r\nThe two bimbo's talked all the way to school and when they got there the two of them went to there first class. <br>\r\nTheir first class was History, BORING thought Janet, why do we have to know what some dead guy did a hundred years ago. The only good thing about this class was their teacher Miss. Rivers. She was in her mid thirties, with raven black hair, nice tan skin, a fit body, an excerlant set of legs, nice boobs, not that she showed even the tops of of them the shrew, and an amazing ass. Today she was her hair in a bun, an old fashion white shirt with that puffy thing in the middle and a long red skirt that looked great on her rock hard ass, oh if only she would have Janet stayed after school. Then with Janet sitting on top of her desk Miss. Rivers would slowly walking up to her, undressing as she walked until all she had was that long red dress, then Janet would get down and slowly start unzipping that amazing ass, while kissing each of those legs as she went down. Next, now standing in all her naked greatness Miss. Rivers would start striping Janet of all her clothing while .... \"JANET!\" Miss. Rivers said loudly and sternly while she stood next to Janet's desk. \"I was just asking you if you would like to tell the class who invented the cotton gin and why it was so important?\" She said sarcastically. Janet was about to say no when all of a sudden the answer just popped into her mind. \"It was Eli Whitney who created it, and by doing so he made it so cotton production would expand greatly, enriching America economy.\" \"I'm impressed Miss. Conwan. Apperantly moving in with your father is paying off.\" Miss. Rivers said, both proud and shocked that she new the answer. After she turned to walk to the front of the class, Sally turned to Janet and said, \"Where did that come from?\" \"I don't know. I must of remembered it from one of Paul's dumb-ass documentaries.\" Janet still confused at what happen. \"I guess.\" Sally said and just turned back to the front with a blank stair once more. But Janet spent the rest of the class trying to figure out what was happening.             </span></div></div>",

Gym was only slightly better than history because at least they didn't have to think much or listen to lectures. But still going to Gym meant having to work hard and getting all sweaty and smelly, worse was that the gym teacher Mr. Dublin cracked down on any bullying that happened in his class. Weren't gym teachers so post to treat Jocks and Cheerleaders like they could get away with anything. BUT NO the fat-ass made sure that his student treated each other with respect. <br>\r\nJanet and Sally meet with their other frieand, Michelle Steven, in the locker room, away from the prying eyes of Mr.Dublin who was yet another empty headed cheerleader from a semi-rich family. She was African American and was slightly taller than the other two. \"Hey girls guess what I just heard.\" Michelle said always happy to spread some gossip. \"What is it? Common tell.\" \" Ya don't leave us out of the loop.\"  The two other girls pressing for more info on this juicy peace of gossip. \"Are you SURE you want to hear it? It is pretty shocking.\" Michelle teased. \"Oh come on tell already.\" Janet whined impatiently. \"Well I just heard that your dad was fucking Miss. Rivers.\" \"Oh come on, there is no way that would happen. It's simply impossible.\" Janet said defensively. \"O I don't if it's impossible Janet. I mean look at how many times in the past year did the two of them had a parent-teacher confreres.\" Sally said, happily making Janet squirm as if she was a worm under her foot. \"I know and like have you seen the way she looks at him when ever she sees him. It's like she just wants to just do right there.\" Michelle chimed in. Janet know that she need some way to get them of her back by having their claws turn on some else. \"Hey isn't that Chubby Su, looks like she put on even more weight.\" Janet pointed to the chubby Korean girl at the other end of the locker room. Suki was a little bit over weight, at 5 ft 7 in and 150 pd but she carried it well, giving her a good hour glass figure with big boobs and a nice ghetto. But even though Janet found her very attractive, she still joined in when the other girls starting picking on her. The three bimbos started giggleing and pointing at her, but Suki just rolled her eyes and walked out. While all their teasing did hurt it wasn't like she was just going to break down and cry for these three bitches. Soon they were all in gym and Janet was enjoying the eye candy, even if she still felt a little trashy from this morning by wearing such tiny gym clothes that have the words hottie spelled out on the back of her blue shorts.      </span></div></div>",

The eight of them went to get lunch, and why the other seven got salads, Janet by the end of lunch had gotten one huge stake, 4 boxes of chicken nuggets, 6 baked salmons, three hot dogs, five hamburgers, 4  low fat chocolate milks, 75 fruit cups and entire chocolate cake for desert.(Karlose made sure to make the bill only to be 5.99 and that no noticed that.) She new the other girls were staring but she just couldn't help her self, her whole body was just screaming for food high in protein, calcium, vitamins and fat. Like at breakfast she just consumed everything, and it all tasted great, especially the stake, she had no idea how the school could afford such good food. While the girls were at first shocked at this sight of gluttony they soon started acting like it wasn't happening, which confused the already slow minded Janet.    </span></div></div>",

And why she was still pretty confused about all that happen that day she just put it out of her mind as she walked into Paul's house. \"Jewels, sweetie mommy's home.\" Janet said as she walked through the front door. The little chichuia came running full speed at his beloved mistress with her arms wide open. So with her dog in arms she walked dropping her stuff right by the door. The smell of food drifted from the kitchen reminding Janet just how hungry she was again. But apparently dinner would have to wait. \"Janet, sit. We need to talk.\" Said Paul as he stepped out side the kitchen. \"Can it wait, daddy I'm...\" \"No it can't.\" Said Paul sternly. \"Fine, what is it this time Paul.\" Janet said as put Jewels down and marched to into the kitchen and sat on one of the stools by the island. \"Listen Janet, I just got another call from school, apparently you failed yet another test.\" Paul coldly told his daughter. \"So?\" Responded the uncaring daughter. \"So I told you that if you failed another test you would have to be grounded for a whole week.\" He told his daughter as gently as he could. \"WHAT!!! THATS NOT FUCKING FAIR!!!\" Screamed the enraged Janet how dare her father punish her. \"Watch your language young lady, and yes it is fair. I told their would be consinces if you didn't bring up your grades. Now you have to deal with them.\" Paul said with his voice slowly begging to rise. \"BUT PAUL!!!\" Whined Janet. \"I told you to call me father! And unless you want to make for two weeks I sudgest you calm down and understand I'm doing this because I love you and want you to succeed.\" \"IF YOU REALLY LOVED ME YOU WOULD AT LEAST LET ME GO TO THE CHEERLEADING FINIALS YOU!\" \"Now wait a minute!\" NO!

He sits down next to her on the bed, puts his hand her head and says very soft and calmly, \"Sweetie I'm sorry I got son angry with you. It's just I feel that you could do such great things if you would simply try. And when you say things like am sleeping with your teacher, that just makes me so angry.

Ok.\" He gets no responds but he gets the first tray of food, a giant bowl of tomato soup, her favorite appetizer. Then the second tray, an entire roast chicken with corn and portatoles.

Thanks to Karlose, who is only know checking in on his little project, making sure that every thing was going as planned. This time Janet ate much slower than the last two times she ate, and now she looked like she may have gained a little weight, her stomach slightly bulging from under her tight shirt and over the top of her mini skirt that she unbutton. Soon after words she goes to sleep next Jewels with out even taking her clothes off. Karlose is about to leave when he picks up that she is having some what unplanned dreams. Now they weren't effecting the memories they were putting in her head and wasn't quite unexpected due to all the emotional activity since she got home. But would it hurt to check. Karlos letting his more chaotic genie side take over decides to see what his little project is dreaming. So he has a look and sees her with own secret fantasy, she was with Suki, Miss. Rivers and half of the cheerleading squad, having sex. That was not to weird except that as squad was humping her, and Miss. Rivers was french kissing her while hiving Janet playing with her vagina and Janet was sucking on Suki's huge tities Janet's belly and boobs began to expand until she looks like she is 9 months pregnant. Then all the girls surrounded her and told her how pretty she was, how such a good mom she was going to, and things like that. But all of a suddenly (Just before Karlose had a chance to masturbate) the dream changes, and Janet is all alone, naked and normal size, with chains attached to her hands and feet like a puppet only in a zoo cage. And the one holding the other end of the chains is a giant monster version of her mother, with eyes of fire, long pink claws, giant fake boobs on her chest, and a pair of horns sticking out of her head. She hold the chains in each hand and made Janet dance for her, surrounding the cage are all the girls from the last dream, including Miss. Rivers, only now fully couthed laughing and throwing things like I-pods, clothing, jewelry, cell phones and anything else a normal teenage girl would want. And every time she tries to protest, even so much a whimper, her mother forces a pile of pills down her throat and injects a huge needle into her ass to her smiling and dancing. Than her father walks up to the cage and Janet looks up, and while she is smileing, Karlose can see that she in her green eyes that she is both miserable and in incurable agony each time her mother pulls on a chain, and dream Paul looks down at the encaged Janet, points one finger at her and says, \"Faliure.\" and then turns to Miss. Rivers and then start humping her while all the other girls laugh at her pain and humantion. Then a door opens and a huge hairy monster of a man with a gaint dick walks up and Kathrean forces her daughter on her back saying, \"This is the punishmeant for being a fagit, you slut.\" Then Janet weaping but still smiling and the growing crowd continuing to laugh and throw things at her, the man pushes his penis into her vigina and every time he thrutes Janit looks more like her mother, until finaily she looks like a miniture virsion complete with horns and giant fake boobs.     </span></div></div>",

How that change would happen, when it'll happen and what else are going to happen to the persons around him. And if his daughter would be affected by the changes as well. He was hoping she would change for better. Maybe into something less trashy and bitchy. A good daughter who cared with the persons around her, someone less selfish and who would do anything to get the last trends from the rags. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Paul didn't notice was the change already was happening. He was starting to think like a mother. When he went to his room to sleep he didn't noticed the room already looked different, with pastel color painted walls, a Victorian like bed and a desk full of make up and some small magical trinkets which he got from some clients. He was pretty proud of the fact he is the single mechanic who took care of magicians and other magical beings cars and trucks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the next morning Paula went out of her bed.

She then left the table, grabbed her book bag, then headed out the door to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul shook his head.  He hated the fact that his daughter treated him like that.  Maybe turning into a lesbian was good thing, if it meant that they'd get along better?  Perhaps, but he still didn't want to become a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dumped his daughter's discarded cereal, then had some breakfast for himself, before heading to his car repair shop.  It wasn't a huge business, but it kept him afloat financially.  Of course, that wasn't his only job.  He also dealt with magical items on his off time.  That's how he met Karlose.  It didn't pay a lot and was more like a hobby than anything else, but it was good to have a little bit of extra cash every now and then.  He momentarily wondered if maybe one of the magical items he dealt with might be able to help his situation, but came to the conclusion that they wouldn't.  After all, if they could, he wouldn't have begged Karlose to help him with his daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up from the clock on the car radio, Paul saw the entrance to Paul's Repair Shop (yeah, it's unoriginal, he knew that), then drove into the parking lot and parked behind the building with all the other employees' cars.  Stepping out of his car, he then walked into his shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel Summers (32 years old) was already busy at work fixing a pick-up truck in the garage, along with Larry Smith (45 years old).  At the cash register was Molly Sherman (30 years old), who, as usual, looked pretty, for a woman who worked at a car repair shop.  Paul took a moment to look her over a little more than he should have, imagining what he'd look like as a woman.  \"Is there something wrong?\" she asked him, noticing how he was looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no.  Everything's fine,\" Paul quickly said.  Then he went to his office.  There were still two more employees who weren't there at the moment.  Steve Donaldson (21 years old) only worked part time, as he was still in college, and Eddie Booker (28 years old) was on his honeymoon with his new wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul sighed, sitting down at his desk, and wondered how much his life would change when reality would start to alter.  He had a feeling that if he was still the owner of this car repair shop, then Larry wouldn't be working here, as he's quite a chauvinist.  He'd never work for a woman, lesbian or not.  More likely, Paul wouldn't even be the owner.  He might not even work here at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day unfolded normally.  He had to occasionally deal with his more sensitive nipples.  They gave him a jolt every time his shirt rubbed against them.  Annoying, yes, but it didn't keep him from doing his job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd by the time he knew it, his work day was over and he was heading home to be with his bitchy daughter.  Man, he wished that Karlose had gotten that wish right.  It would have been so much better if his little girl were the one changing instead of him.  He sighed, then headed home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, he looked in the mirror, but didn't see anything different than he saw that morning.  He yawned, then went to bed.</span></div></div>",

But when he passed the bathroom mirror, he stopped in his tracks.  He changed again.  His reddish-brown hair was a little longer, now down to almost his shoulders.  And he looked slimmer.  He didn't look nearly as muscular as he did the previous day.  And his body hair was almost non-existent.  Stepping on the weight scale he had in the bathroom, he saw that he had definitely lost quite a bit of weight.  Instead of 215 pounds, he was more like 175 pounds.  \"My god, I lost forty pounds overnight!\" he nearly shouted, in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock on his bedroom door, causing him to go answer it.  Outside in the hall was Janet, looking no different than normal.  But, of course, Paul was the one changing, not her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, Dad?\" she asked, actually sounding concerned.  Usually, she didn't care about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do ... do you notice anything different about me?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over his shirtless body, then shook her head.  \"No, Dad.  What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" he said.  \"Just forget it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders, then walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul closed the door, then went back to the bathroom.  He still had to get ready for work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, when he was getting dressed, however, he paused, thinking that his clothing wouldn't fit him.  After all, he was much smaller now - 40 pounds smaller.  But when he put his clothes on, they actually fit him, snugly, in fact.  Then he realized what was happening.  Reality was already changing a little.  His clothes were changing to fit his new body.  And if reality was changing <i>this</i>, then perhaps it was changing other things too.  He briefly wondered if he should even head to work, but then figured he wouldn't have any good excuse for not being there.  After all, it's not like he could tell them that he was turning into a woman.  That sounds crazy, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, he ended up going to work.  And, as it turned out, his day wasn't anything out of the ordinary.  But that didn't really make him feel any better.  Because he knew that eventually, things <i>would</i> start to become out of the ordinary.  People would be treating him differently.  The silver lining to that was that his daughter was one of those people, but was it really worth turning into a woman for that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, again, he didn't see any more changes.  But, he assumed that he wouldn't notice anything until the next morning.  And that made him antsy, causing him to have a hard time getting to bed.  But eventually, he did go to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Just get it over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of his bedroom mirror, he saw that, yes, he had indeed changed again.  His hair was now down his shoulders and he looked even slimmer than yesterday.  All of his body hair was gone now and his cock was noticeably smaller.  But that wasn't all.  Maybe he was imagining it, but he thought that maybe his waist was a little narrower and his hips a little wider.  Sighing, he went to the bathroom to check his weight.  Now, instead of 175 pounds, he was about 135 pounds.  Another 40 pounds gone!  And his muscles were barely noticeable.  He looked like some scrawny kid, although his age wasn't any different.  It was hard to believe that anyone would take him seriously looking like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast with Janet was a little more tolerable.  They actually had a conversation.  A short one, but still ... it was more than just a sound of disgust and an eye-roll.  After that, Janet left for school, and Paul headed to work.  Just like the previous two days, nothing seemed out of the ordinary, despite his changes.  Larry was being a little more temperamental towards him than usual, but other than that, nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with the work day over, he headed home.

The curtains on the windows were also magenta-colored, instead of the usual gray, and looked more fluffy than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled the covers back and saw a change to himself.  There were two small bumps forming on his chest.  They were breasts.  Very small, at the moment, but definitely breasts.  Reluctantly, he got out of bed to inspect any other changes.  Standing in front of his bedroom mirror, he saw that his previously-noticeable musculature was now gone.  And his waist was narrower and his hips were wider.  Yeah, he looked a lot more like a woman now than a man.  He still had his male genitalia, though.  So he was definitely still a \"he\".  But the way things looked right now, he almost looked like a shemale.  Shaking his head, he then went to get ready for work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then he paused.  Should he go to work today?  Looking like this, he didn't want people to see him.  Although, reality was changing, so as far as people knew him went, they all thought he normally looked this way.  That wouldn't stop him from feeling uncomfortable, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment's thought, he decided ...</span></div></div>",

He called the shop and told Molly that he was feeling under the weather and wouldn't be able to make it in today.  She told him that she hoped that he'd feel better soon, then hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the day, Paul just puttered around the house, watching TV and doing some cleaning.  No, he wasn't turning into a mother (in the mental sense).  Being a single parent, he had to occasionally do cleaning around the house.  Janet wasn't really much help in that area.  So since he had a lot of time on his hands today, he thought he might as well get some cleaning done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd by the time he knew it, the front door was opening and Janet was walking in, having come home from school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was your day, sweetie?\" he asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged, then said \"Same as always.\"  Then she asked \"Are you feeling any better?\"  He told her the same story as he told Molly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, then walked upstairs and went to her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the evening was almost like the previous one.  Janet really was getting along with him better.  It was hard to believe that only a week ago, she was a bitchy spoiled brat.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, Paul awoke to the feeling of something on his chest.  He pulled back the covers and stared at his breasts.  They were bigger, maybe a B-cup.  No way he could hide <i>those</i>.  He got out of bed, feeling the weight of his breasts pulling down a bit, then went to his bedroom mirror, which was now attached to a make-up table.  He groaned.  It was a vanity.  On the table were a small assortment of make-up products.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking into the mirror, he saw that his hair now went down past his shoulders and his waist was even narrower and his hips were wider.  He felt his butt and noticed that it seemed plumper and softer.  Pulling down his pajama bottoms, he saw first that his boxer shorts were gone, replaced by a pair of white briefs, and second that his cock looked even smaller.  In fact, it was barely a nub.  He grabbed his head, feeling more than uneasy about all of this, and that's when he noticed that his fingernails were noticeably longer.  But not just that, his hand looked daintier.  He really was becoming a woman.  But he wondered how long these changes would continue.  How long would his hair get?  How big would his breasts become?  He hoped the changes to his body wouldn't last much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got ready for work, figuring that he shouldn't try to get out of it today.  It was definitely an odd experience getting ready as a woman (or mostly-woman), but he managed.  As he headed to his closet, he remembered that this was the fifth day of his transformation.  That meant that in a couple more days, he would start to gain new memories of growing up as a female and a lesbian.  He wasn't really looking forward to that.  Sure, he'd be able to keep his own memories, but it was still disconcerting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the closet, his jaw dropped.  All of his clothes were definitely female ones now.  There weren't any dresses or skirts, but all of his shirts were now blouses and all of his pants were now capris.  And his shoes were different too.  Now all women's.  Anywhere from flats to a 3-inch heel.  He chose the flats, but then realized that that wasn't a good choice for work.  So he reluctantly chose the heels.  Slipping them on his feet, he realized that his feet had also shrunk.  He wobbled a little, standing up on the shoes, but soon got the hang of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking into the mirror, he saw that his breasts looked odd in the blouse.  But then he realized that that was because he wasn't wearing a bra.  He opened his underwear drawer and pulled out a plain white bra.  He just stood there for a moment, thinking about how absurd this was.  Less than a week ago, he was a 215-pound muscular man, and now he was contemplating wearing a bra!  Shaking his head, he took off his blouse, then put the bra on, before putting the blouse back on.  There, that was better.  And the weight of the breasts wasn't bothering him as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast with Janet was more than pleasant.  They talked about what she was planning on doing at school that day, about life with her friends, and so forth.  She almost seemed hesitant to leave, when she had to go catch her bus.  Wow!  What a difference!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Janet left to go to school, Paul headed to work.  He felt kind of silly wearing the women's blouse and capris, not to mention the 3-inch heels, but these were his clothes now and it was what he normally wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the shop ...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The moment Paul entered the shop, he noticed something different.  But it wasn't something different with the room or how people were treating him.  It was the people!  Instead of Daniel and Larry, there were two women working on the vehicles!  But they weren't two different people.  There was a definite family resemblance.  He didn't know how or why, but it seemed that Daniel and Larry had become female!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, boss,\" the female Larry said pleasantly in Paul's direction.  Then her eyes roamed over Paul's body, like she was checking him out.  Larry hadn't just become a woman.  He had also become a lesbian!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot waiting to meet the \"new\" women, Paul headed straight for his office.  Molly (who still seemed the same) turned and said to him \"Paula, wait.  I have to tell you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly, not now,\" he said, his voice cracking.  If that was because his voice was finally changing into that of a woman's or it was because he was overstressed, he wasn't sure.  He opened the door to his office and closed the door behind him.  Sitting down at his desk, he made a call to Karlose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, dude, what's up?\" his friend asked over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karlose, something weird is going on at work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two of my employees.  Daniel and Larry.  They're women!  And I think they might be lesbians too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you done anything out of the ordinary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like an odd question.  \"No, nothing.  Well, I mean, I didn't come into work yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell did you do <i>that</i> for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the problem?  So I missed one day of work.  So what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The spell only works right if you go about your normal routine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't tell me that,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured you wouldn't do anything different than usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karlose, you are really screwing up my life here.  It's bad enough that you made <i>me</i> the target of that wish instead of Janet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already apologized for that, dude,\" Karlose said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, okay.  But what else is going to happen because I didn't go to work yesterday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hard to say.  I guess you'll just have to deal with changes as they come.\"  He paused, then asked \"Are you having any new memories yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it should be any day now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't remind me,\" Paul said sourly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul sighed, then said \"I gotta go.  But we're not done talking about this.  Please try to figure out what's happening, okay?  I don't want to be left in the dark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Karlose said, then hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in,\" Paul said.  The door opened and Molly came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but this couldn't wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul sighed.  \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Women of Christ group is boycotting us again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Paul asked.  He never had a problem with that group before ... but then again, he never had lesbians working at his shop.  And that group was famous for being against homosexuality.  This wasn't good.  He could lose a lot of business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I wish those women would just leave us alone.  So we're lesbians.  So what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul's breath caught in his throat.  Did Molly just imply that she was a lesbian too?  In fact, it sounded like she was implying that <i>all</i> of the employees of the car repair shop were lesbians.  Did that mean ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and Edith is still on her honeymoon with her wife.  So ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that settled <i>that</i>.  Everyone there really was a lesbian.  And soon, Paul would be too.  (He was still only mostly female.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough conversation, he learned that Daniel's new name was Dani, Larry's new name was Lori, and Steve's new name was Stephanie.  All of them were female now and lesbians.  And they all thought that they were supposed to be that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, he got a call from Karlose, who told him that the break in his routine caused the spell to change.  Paul would still become a woman and a lesbian and reality would still change, but now reality would change to make his life more conflict-free.  Paul (or Paula, as he was now being called) wasn't against having a more carefree life, but he didn't want <i>this</i>.  Surely, there was a better way to make his life more conflict-free without changing his employees into lesbians.  Apparently not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul went to bed that night feeling even more worried than any of the other nights.  He really messed things up and it seemed that there was no way to fix any of it.  He was starting to have some serious regrets about Karlose granting that wish, despite how much better his relationship with Janet had become.</span></div></div>",

He knew that he wasn't a man anymore.  <i>She</i> was a woman, and <i>her</i> name was Paula Cowan.  Other than that, though, there wasn't anything about her life that she knew.  But she identified herself as female now.  Even though she remembered being a man, it started to feel like a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got out of bed and saw that her breasts had once again gotten bigger, now a C-cup, the same as Janet's.  And her genitalia was completely female now.  She wasn't the sexiest woman alive, but she was attractive enough.  Looking at her face, she realized that while there was a family resemblance, she definitely looked like a woman.  She briefly looked down at her make-up table and wondered if maybe she should put some on today.  She felt like she should, but she didn't know how to do it.  She focused on the vanity, hoping to force her new memories to emerge, but nothing happened.  Sighing, she headed to the bathroom to get ready for work.  Today, her clothes consisted of a lacy bra and panty set, a blouse, a miniskirt, and a pair of 4-inch heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTying her hair into a ponytail, she then headed to breakfast, having yet another pleasant morning with her daughter Janet.  She was a little startled by her new female voice, but decided that it sounded good, kind of like what she remembered her mom's voice to be like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was off to school for Janet and off to work for Paula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving towards the shop, Paula groaned, seeing a group of prudishly-dressed woman amassing outside the building, all of them holding signs protesting homosexuality.  It was the Women of Christ group.  This was very bad.  With this kind of behavior, her shop would be out of business by the end of the week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe parked in the back, then headed inside, getting shoved once by one of the women, who called her \"disgusting\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Dani, Lori, Stephanie, and Molly were standing together, unsure of what to do, waiting for Paula for help.</span></div></div>",

She now believed that she was and had always been a lesbian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love is love!\" she shouted at them.  Looks of disgust was what she got in return and more yelling, but now the yelling was directed towards <i>her</i>.  But one by one, the yelling became less and less.  And before she knew it, the yelling was gone.  The seven women looked around, confused.  Why were they there?

It was obvious that these women weren't ashamed of their attractive bodies.  She inwardly groaned.  That was seven more people changed by this disaster of a wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning away from the window, she headed straight to her office and made another call to Karlose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" came the voice of Paula's friend (or was it Paul's friend?).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karlose, it's me.

That's why it happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were creating conflict in your life.  So the spell changed them to make your life more conflict-free.  I already told you this before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly conflict free.  I still have to make a speech at that pro-gay rally tomorrow and I don't know the first thing about being a lesbian.  A guy, yeah.  But I'm sure the experiences were different.  You don't think you could speed up the emergence of my new memories, could you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paul!  What the hell, man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The spell is going to change something else now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fact that you know you won't be able to make a speech at the rally ... that's a conflict for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think that counts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah, it counts.  Now reality is going to change and I don't think it has anything to do with your new memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to stay easy-going until the spell is complete, in 24 days.  After that, you can have as much conflict as you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy oh why did Paula have to agree to a \"month\" as the duration of the wish?  A week would have been more than enough.  \"How am I supposed to go conflict-free for another three weeks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's <i>your</i> problem.  Deal with it, dude.  Remember, this never would have happened if you hadn't broken from your routine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that wouldn't have happened if <i>you</i> hadn't botched up the wish in the first place!\" Paula yelled into the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence from Karlose's end.  Then, after a moment or two, he said \"Just be careful, okay.\"  Then the call disconnected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day went, well, conflict-free, but that didn't stop Paula from worrying all the time.  On one hand, she was glad that she probably wouldn't have to make a speech about something she knew barely anything about, but on the other hand, she was fearing what might change to make her speech non-required.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got home, she met Janet's girlfriend Sydney.  Apparently, they had been dating for months now.  Paula felt a little strange about it.  Sure, she was a woman now, but she wasn't really a lesbian, yet, even though people treated her like she was.  She tried to play along as much as possible, trying to sound like she was already familiar with Sydney, even though this was the first time she had ever met the girl.  Once her new memories came through, though, that may not be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it was finally bedtime.  Paula stood naked (except for a pair of panties) in front of the mirror, knowing that some kind of change would probably happen by the next morning.  Hopefully, most of the changes would occur to her mind.  It was distressing not knowing things that she was supposed to.  And with that, she put on her nightgown and went to bed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Paula opened her eyes, she immediately noticed something different.  She started to remember her early childhood as a little girl.  To tell the truth, it wasn't really too much different than her memories of Paul as a little boy, except that her toys were girl toys and so forth.  Her relationship with her parents wasn't really any different.  But there was only so much that anyone could recall through the age of five.  It seemed that her memories would emerge chronologically, meaning she wouldn't have any memories of being a lesbian probably until she got to her teenage years.  There was no way she was going to be able to do that speech.  Why did she even agree to do it in the first place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the covers off of her, she got out of bed and went into the bathroom to look at herself.  The only immediately noticeable change she could see was her breasts.  They were bigger, maybe a D-cup now.  She went and checked her bras.  Yeah, a D-cup.  But there also seemed to be something happening with her skin.  She wasn't quite as tan as she was before, as a bunch of freckles were now showing up here and there.  Other than that, though, it seemed like there were no other physical changes.  She momentarily wondered if this was where her changes would stop, but she had a feeling that she still had more to go.  She hoped her breasts didn't get <i>too</i> big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer car repair shop was closed on Sundays, so she didn't need to go to work today.  But she did, apparently, need to go downtown.  The previous day, she looked up on the internet where the rally would be taking place.  It was downtown, in front of City Hall.  The purpose of the rally was to get the mayor to reconsider some anti-gay law or something.  There was supposed to be quite a large crowd too.  People from other towns and townships.  Paula dreaded the idea of doing a speech in front of that many people, especially since she knew nothing about the concept of living as a lesbian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she promised that lesbian who came into her shop yesterday (Margaret Mills) that she would do the speech.  So with that, she got ready and dressed, then headed downtown.  But when she got there, there was no rally.  Just the usual milling about of people doing shopping or whatever.  She spotted a woman she recognized as one of the former anti-gay women from yesterday and approached her.  \"Excuse me,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman turned towards her and smiled.  \"Oh, hey, Paula.  Out doing some shopping?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's the rally?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rally.  You know, the one to make sure the mayor didn't pass that anti-gay law.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would Mayor Thomson pass an anti-gay law?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula made a gesture, indicating she didn't understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mayor is gay.  You know he's married to a man, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo!  He wasn't married to a <i>man</i>!  He was married to a <i>woman</i>!  But apparently not anymore!  So that's how reality changed.  The mayor obviously wouldn't pass a law that would make himself illegal.  Paula really hoped that these changes would stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh ... yeah,\" Paula finally said, not wanting the woman to think that she was crazy.  \"I forgot, I guess.\"  She paused, feeling awkward, then said \"Okay, I'll see you later then.\"  And with that, Paula hurried back to her car, and drove home.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of that Sunday, Paula just sat around and watched TV, to try to get her mind off of what had been happening over the last few days.  Now, she didn't have a problem with gays and lesbians, but she didn't like the idea of a bunch of people's lives changing against their will and without their consent.  Okay, yeah, that's what she was going to do to Janet, but that's different.  Janet was a bitchy spoiled brat.  These other people weren't, for the most part.  For all he knew, they might have had a better life before the change than they did now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that evening, Paula had dinner with Janet.  \"So, you and Sydney are pretty serious, huh?\" Paula asked, filling Jewel's doggie bowl with new food.  Janet's dog Jewel yipped into the kitchen, then began to munch down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we are.  I just wish her parents were more understanding of our sexuality, then she could come out to them about it.  But I guess not every parent can be as cool as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess not,\" Paula said, sitting down at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you should start dating.  You seem lonely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you need someone to love, you know.  In that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know of anyone who ...\"  Paula began, wanting to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Margaret Mills?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know.  Margaret Mills.  The head of the local lesbian liberation movement group?  I think you two would be great together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sure.  I'll look into it,\" Paula said, hoping that that would get her daughter to change the subject.  And it did.  They talked about something else, and finished their dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterward, while Janet was finishing up her weekend homework, Paula looked up this Margaret Mills woman on the internet, just out of curiosity.  It turned out that she had met her already.  She was the woman who came into her shop the previous day.  The woman who used to be the leader of the Women of Christ group.  Now she was the head of a lesbian liberation group?  Oh man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into her bedroom and getting undressed, she thought about it some more.  Maybe dating wasn't such a bad idea.  After all, with another woman around, raising Janet might be easier.  With her job running the auto repair shop, she wasn't home all that often.  But who was she kidding?  With her dealing with the wish situation and reality constantly changing when she didn't want it to ... she couldn't possibly ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, she slipped on her baby-doll nighty and got into bed.  Then she went to sleep.</span></div></div>",

She shifted under her covers and looked beside her, seeing that there was a woman in bed with her!  The woman opened her eyes and smiled, saying \"Morning, babe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula focused on the woman's face and realized that it was Margaret Mills.  But ... how did she get in bed with her?  She went to sleep alone last night.  Unless ... this was one of the changes to her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaret moved her head closer to Paula's, then kissed her.  After that, she got out of bed and casually walked over to the door to the bathroom, wearing nothing more than a skimpy bra and panty set.  She turned and grinned at Paula.  \"You want to take a shower together, hun?  It'll save water.  Plus, it'll give us more alone time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh ... no.  You go ahead,\" Paula said, still stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaret shrugged.  \"Your loss.\"  Then she entered the bathroom and closed the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell?!  Now she was dating Margaret?  Or were they married?  These reality changes were ridiculous.  How was she supposed to get through the next three weeks with everything changing so much?  And speaking of changes, there were more of them (besides her new relationship with a former-anti-gay-woman-turned-lesbian).  Once again, her breasts were a little bigger, now a DD-cup.  And she had access to more memories from her new life.  Unfortunately, they weren't really all that helpful, as they stopped at about age 8.  At this rate, it'll be another three or four days until she actually gets any helpful memories of what it's like to grow up as a lesbian.  And another week beyond <i>that</i> before she gets any memories of present day.  If only they would all come at once.  But apparently that would be too overwhelming, or so Karlose said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula heard the shower running and wondered if maybe she <i>should</i> shower with Margaret.  She was a pretty hot woman, now since she was no longer some religious prude.  But maybe it was better to keep her distance.  After all, she didn't really know anything about her, other than what she read on the internet.  If they were sleeping together in this new reality, then they probably knew more about each other than was posted online.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Paula decided to go have some breakfast.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Paula slipped on her pink robe and headed downstairs to the kitchen.  But it seemed that someone was already there, making breakfast.  She could smell it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the kitchen, she saw Janet at the stove, flipping pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Janet?  What are you doing?\"  She never made breakfast before.  Was this another reality change?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer daughter turned and smiled at her.  \"Morning, Mom.  I just thought I'd help out with breakfast today, since I thought you and Margaret would be too busy.\"  Okay, Janet was being way more considerate than normal.  It must be another step in their growing mother-daughter relationship.  And did she just call Margaret by her first name?  That probably meant that they weren't married.  So it must be that they were just dating.  She wished she wouldn't have been so startled when she woke up.  She might have gotten the chance to be \"busy\" with Margaret, as Janet said.  It had been a long time since she had been with a woman.  Well, actually it was Paul who it had been a long time for.  And specifically, it was Kathren, Paul's ex-wife.  So that meant at least fifteen years without sex.  Of course, that was sex as a man.  Any sex in <i>this</i> body would be for the first time.  At least, it would seem that way until she got all of her new memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula sat down at the table and said \"That's very thoughtful, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Paula was eating breakfast, and about ten minutes after that, Margaret walked in, wearing a short silky robe that showed off her legs, her hair in a towel.  She walked over to Paula, bent down, and kissed her.  \"Mmm.  Pancakes,\" she said, tasting it on Paula's lips.  \"Tastes good,\" she added, smiling.  Then she took a seat and had some pancakes for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta run, Mom.  Bye, Margaret,\" Janet said, before grabbing her book bag and heading out the door to the school bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got an amazing daughter, Paula.  I just wish the world was a more tolerable place so that people like us wouldn't have to hide who we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Paula said, weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaret seemed concerned.  \"You okay, hun?  You've been acting strange ever since we woke up this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing.  Really.\"  Well, actually, it was something.  A <i>big</i> something.  But she couldn't talk to <i>her</i> about it.  She'd think she was crazy or something.  In fact, there was only one person who she could talk to, but she wasn't sure Karlose would be in the best of moods.  After all, Paula thought she might have pissed him off too much with that last phone call.  Better to give it a few days before calling again.  She'd just have to deal with all these changes by herself for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you ever need to talk ...\" Margaret said, reaching over and holding Paula's hand.  \"I'm here for you.\"  She looked up at the clock.  \"Shit.  Look at the time.  I gotta get ready.\"  She stood up and started walking out of the room, but paused and looked back.  \"We're still on for lunch today, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was gonna stop by the shop and then we were gonna go out, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, yeah,\" Paula said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaret looked concerned again, but then just shook it off and headed back upstairs to get dressed.  Apparently some her clothes were here?  Paula didn't take the time to look.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Paula finally came back upstairs, Margaret was putting the last of her clothes on.  Paula just stood there, taking in the sight of her.  \"Wow,\" she breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaret turned and smiled at her, then strutted over to her, wearing a tight blouse with a low neckline to show off her cleavage (she must have been wearing a half-cup bra underneath), a short miniskirt (not quite a micro-skirt, but close), and a pair of 5-inch heels.  She was a sexy sight to see, that was for sure.  And her make-up only accentuated it.  Her look made her look professional and sexy at the same time.  It was hard to believe that less than a few days ago, this woman was an uptight prudish gay-hating devoutly religious person.  Whatever that out-of-control wish did to her, it didn't just make her a lesbian.  It made her sexy and loose, flirtatious and, well, fun.  Her whole personality was different!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her arm around Paula and kissed her, then said \"See ya later, babe.\"  Then she strutted out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh ... yeah.  Okay,\" Paula said, still in shock over how much sexier Margaret was, now that she was a lesbian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Paula recovered from her momentary daze, she got ready herself.  And about an hour later, she was ready to go, wearing a blouse and miniskirt and 3-inch heels.  It sure took a lot longer to get ready as a woman than a man.  But, of course, men never looked this hot when they were done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drove to work, hoping that there wouldn't be any problems today.  She didn't want anymore reality changes.  She knew that they were inevitable, but she didn't want it happening <i>every day</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, once she got to the shop, she immediately noticed something different, but it wasn't exactly a problem.  There was a car wash attached to the main building.  That had always been something Paula wanted, well, something Paul wanted.  But there was never an opportunity to make it happen.  Well, it seemed that in this new reality, it <i>did</i> happen.  This would only mean more money.  And that wasn't a bad thing at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter parking, Paula headed in and saw that there was a new face there.  Except, it wasn't someone that she hadn't seen before.  In fact, it was the woman she met downtown on Sunday, when she was wanting to know where the rally was.  At first, Paula thought she was a customer.  But then she saw that she was wearing one of the form-fitting jumpsuits that were worn by the other technicians (Dani and Lori).  Through conversation, Paula learned that her name was Samantha (or Sammy, for short) and that she worked in the car wash portion of the business.  Also, the car wash wasn't really new.  It had been there for almost a year.  And Sammy had been working there the entire time that the car wash had been in use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Margaret, Sammy used to be one those anti-gay church women before she was changed into a lesbian.  But unlike Margaret, Sammy seemed to be less feminine and more butch, liking to do \"guy things\".  It was odd, though.  Paula recalled that she didn't seem like that on Sunday.  That change must have just happened when the car wash came into existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the morning was typical, although Paula noticed that she had more business.  Maybe she'd have to hire more people soon to accommodate the increase in customers?  She could worry about that later.  Oh, and speaking of her employees ... why were they all lesbians?  Surely, there must have been a man or a straight woman who wouldn't have a problem working here.  So why was it that everyone who worked here had to be a lesbian?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock at her office door broke her out of her thoughts.  She looked at her clock and saw that it was getting close to lunchtime.  \"Come in,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and Molly walked in.  \"Paula, we've got a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula moaned.  She couldn't just go <i>one day</i> without there being a problem?  What was it <i>this</i> time?  \"What's wrong?\" she asked Molly.</span></div></div>",

I'm not sure this ever happened before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, that's right.  The last protest was by the Women of Christ group, but that was in a reality that no longer existed, so Molly wouldn't remember it.  \"Never mind,\" she said, getting up from her desk.  \"Where are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly guided her to the front of the store and pointed out the window.  There was a group of five women, all conservatively dressed (but not as prudish as the previous protesters), in the parking lot outside, all shouting anti-gay remarks and thrusting their anti-gay signs in the air.  It was like deja vu all over again.  Only this time, she could do something about them.  Maybe get them to leave before they were changed too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait here,\" Paula said, before leaving the shop and heading straight towards the group of protesters.  Once she got to them, she said \"Listen to me.  You have to get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't make us leave here, you disgusting dyke,\" one of the women said, poking her finger into Paula's chest.  \"The law says that we ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you don't understand,\" Paula said, cutting off the woman.  \"If you don't leave, you'll ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you trying to threaten us?\" another woman asked angrily, not letting Paula finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not!  I'm trying to <i>warn</i> you.\"  Paula really hoped that they would just listen to her.  \"If you don't stop protesting, you'll all ... you'll all turn into lesbians!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" asked the woman who poked her, apparently the leader of the group.  \"Do you think we're stupid or something to believe a load of crap like that?  Why would we believe anything <i>you</i> say to us anyway?  You're just like the rest of them.  A disgusting pervert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" one of the other women said.  \"I think she's kinda cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" the leader asked, looking to her left and doing a double take towards her friend.  Did she just say what she <i>thought</i> she said?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right Linda.  She's pretty hot,\" came another woman's voice, from the other direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader turned to her right and stared at her other friend.  Why would she say something like that about a lesbian?  Or any woman, for that matter?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd totally do her,\" a third woman said.  Was the leader losing her mind?  Or were her friends suddenly okay with perverse behavior?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too, but only if she'd do me first,\" said a fourth woman, who was the one who earlier asked if Paula was threatening them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please!\" Paula yelled, getting the attention of the leader of the group (although, probably not now).  \"You're already changing.  You have to go now before ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the look of horror and confusion on the leader's face disappeared and was replaced with a smile.  \"Hey, you're Paula Cowan.  I've always wanted to meet you.  We all have.  You've been such a great inspiration for us.  Well, you and Margaret Mills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula's mind was spinning.  It happened again.  It happened <i>again</i>!  These reality changes were ridiculous.  Ludicrous!  Was this going to keep on going for the duration of the wish?  By that time, the whole <i>world</i> could be made up of lesbians, the way things were going.  She had to get on Karlose's good side and try to get him to do something, anything, to stop these reality changes.  She didn't think she could take any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, when's the wedding?\" the leader asked Paula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Paula asked.  She wasn't really listening to what the woman was babbling on about.  \"What wedding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Your</i> wedding,\" the woman clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Paula asked, startled.  Then she looked down and saw an engagement ring on her finger.  Where did <i>that</i> come from?  That wasn't there <i>before</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look, there she is!\" one of the newest anti-gay-turned-lesbians said, pointing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula turned and saw Margaret sexily strutting towards them, smiling all the way.  When she arrived, she slipped her arm around Paula and greeted the other women.  And then she confirmed what the woman said.  They really <i>were</i> getting married.  In just a few more months, in fact.  Paula <i>really</i> didn't think she could take these changes any longer.  Things were just changing way too fast.  Just a few days ago (a few realities ago) she didn't even <i>know</i> who Margaret Mills was ... and now they were getting <i>married</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter talking with the \"new\" lesbians, Margaret excused herself and took Paula with her.  It was noon, so it was time for their lunch date.</span></div></div>",

Margaret seemed to be very suspicious of why Paula insisted on being alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula dialed Karlose's number with trepidation.  Not only had he been very upset the last time she called, but she also feared that this might count as \"conflict\" to the spell and set off who knows what changes to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone rang several times without Karlose picking it up and then went to voicemail.  Paula stayed on the line.  She would leave a message if she had to.  She had to speak to Karlose as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voicemail message began to play.  \"Hello,\" a melodious, female voice said, \"You have reached Karla's Fortune Telling Parlor. We can't come to the phone right now, so please leave your name, number, and a brief message after the beep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula hung up the phone without leaving a message. Karlose had now apparently been caught in his own spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula slumped down in her desk chair and began to sob.  She felt two arms try to wrap around her very awkwardly from behind.  Margaret was trying to comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Considering your condition, it's natural for you to be hormonal,\" said Margaret, \"I am as well. Is that all that is wrong, or is something really troubling you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHormonal? Wait? What was she talking about?  Paula looked at her left hand and saw that it now had two rings on the ring finger.  A look at her desk revealed a photo of Paula and Margaret, each in a white gown and veil.  A look straight down showed Paula her own bulging belly. She was probably about five months along.  She spun in her chair and embraced Margaret. Beautiful, understanding Margaret who was herself at least seven months pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did this happen? Where would it end?</span></div></div>",

As underwear he found some girl\u2019s boxers\u2026But he very soon realized that he will also need a bra to cover his new assets and also prevent it from shaking and also avoid that the nipples are poking through the fabric of the t-shirt, visible for everyone\u2026Damn, being a girl is not easy\u2026<br>\r\nAfter the dressing part he was about to leave as suddenly a well build man was blocking the exit of his room: \u201cWhere are you going such early on a Sunday morning?\u201d asked the man, who must be his father now.
