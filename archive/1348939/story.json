You continue for a while, making sure the brush gets all over, before dropping it and continuing with your claws. Dancing and clawing all around his belly button makes him squirm horribly, making funny noises and faces all the while. Digging in all your claws at once produces a sound like \"Yai yai yai yai yai!\" and everyone starts laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce can't stand just watching anymore, so he starts fiddling with Tech's fluffy feet. Lexi joins in to start kneading his hips, and so on. Pretty soon, you can't get anywhere near him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, let me out of here!' cries Rev. \"I want to try his belly out, too!\" Instead, you decide to lay into Rev's belly. After a bit of torture and high-pitched laughing, you pop open his restraints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know if the Looney Toons are around here somewhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, they're right upstairs. If you go out that door, down the hallway, up the elevator, and come back this way, you can't miss them.\"</span></div></div>",

But meee...\" It pushes a theatrical, long-suffering sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Y-you\u2019re a ...Robot?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It rolls it's eyes, or so you assume. The actual action it carries out is to blink it's one remaining spot-light eye while leaning it's head inhumanly far back and bringing it snapping forward again. You realize that the droid it more beat up than having a tangled mass or wiring in place of a second spotlight- it is after all missing one of it's four legs, the source of it's complaints. Several other patches of exposed parts- which you had formerly taken for scraggly tufts of fur- denote areas short of smaller limbs or other artificial body parts. Many parts of it's chassis look like they've been removed, severely pummelled with a crowbar, and then screwed back on the wrong way multiple times. Some are scorched; others bear the long-dried stains of various unpleasant fluids. This robot had clearly been through allot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"No, mammal; it should think that it's fairly obvious that I'm the Tooth Fairy.

So that's it! 'Detain and tickle' !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As you leap up the side of one box, sending it clattering to the floor behind you, you glance over your shoulder. Rather than pursue, RF simply stands in place as well as he can on his uneven support. A hatch opens in his bulky chest, and some kind of thick green liquid shoots out, splattering over you and your avenue of escape.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You try fruitlessly to yell, gunk sealing your mouth and one eye shut, as you fall backwards off of the teetering objects.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Wha' the- G\u2019mmph!\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Fortunately for you, the pile is more stable than it appears, and some heavy items in the box keep the container from falling over on top of you. Even better, the green goo covers nearly all of your back-side, including your heels. When you fall, they stay in one place, attached to the box. Your body swings down and thuds into it, cushioned by the plasma, rather than falling back to the floor. The momentum also flings your arms out 'behind' you -now above your head- before you can pull them in. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Adhered to the side of the surface, you struggle, barely able to move a fraction of an inch without being rebuked by the rubbery compound, and seeing worryingly RF advance on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 From the corner of your remaining operational eye, you see the defunct security robot shoot out a thick tube; shaking, the cannula deposits a half dozen smaller robots; graceful disks about the size of your hand with multiple slender legs, onto the floor. Apparently done with talking, RF slowly turns about on his rickety legs and staggers doggedly away into the gloom, whirring and clicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You own attention now focussed on the remaining robots left behind as they advance on you with single purpose, you redouble your efforts to escape. All you succeed in is shaking the part of your shirt not directly glued to the container into falling down over your face, and at accelerating the rush of blood to your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A few seconds later, you're jerking on the spot again, this time at the feel of tiny pointed feet walking over your soft belly, with two sets of tickling pinpricks heading off down your legs and another two straying off near to you underarms. <i>Oh god, this tickles so bad already, and they're just getting into position... Darn it, Rip , where are you? I gotta get out of this!</i> You think, though all the noise you can make is: <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \" Mmmph! Mm-mmph! Gmmhmm. Mph-mmm!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The material is actually quite porous; you can draw small breaths through it, and are in no immediate danger of suffocation. It's really the way that it prevents your jaws from opening and closing properly to make sound that inhibits you. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In short order, having clambered their tickling way all over your helpless body -taking roundabout, meandering course -two spiderbots cling to the pads of your feet, legs intertwined around your ankles. One rests in each of you underarms, having extended their legs to meet in the middle and connecting them to the other across your chest to secure their position. The fifth has carefully asserted its position on your lower belly, centered carefully around you bellybutton. While you can't see it to confirm, you think that the final one may have split into two new bots, each fresh one having settled on one of your sides, right where your ribcage meets your belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Knowing that their attack is imminent, you tense, waiting. Some tightening and last minute adjustments ensue, but otherwise they remain fixed in place. Cautiously, wondering if they had blown or fuse or boasted corrupted software that\u2019s interrupted the proceedings, you start to relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The tickling hits you like a sledgehammer. Hard.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In sync, countless tiny bristles telescope from the undersides of each disc, each vibrating super-rapidly and moving in the fastest, tiniest strokes. The droids poised over your underarms pull together, forcing their individual masses of stiff brushes into the taunt hollows, probing deep into the nerve-ridden flesh. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Similar tactics are used by the right member of the duo assaulting your footpaws, only all of it's brushes move as one, swiftly dragging up and down your feet, from ball to heel and back. Over and over. The one on your left,  possibly programmed to take advantage of confusing sensory input resulting from multiple methods, instead raises itself up and slams itself back into your sole repeatedly, driving its brushes in in a way that is almost, but not quite, painful, covering a new, equally unprepared sector each time, whether heel, arch, ball, toes, or some combination thereof.    <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 6a and 6b don't bother to use their brushes to tickle; being small anyways, they simply secure their grip by twining them into your fur, using their actual primary locomotive legs to prod firmly into your ribs or the nerve clusters and down your curved sides. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Meanwhile, a single flexible tendril drops into your navel, the end ballooning into dozens of miniscule brushes that can sweep out the inside of even that inaccessible but all-the-more-sensitive-for-it spot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 While the nuances of their tactics may be lost on you, the effects certainly aren't. You shake wildly in your amorphous bondage, struggling to relieve the feelings flooding through you. You try twisting your arms and arching your back, but are in the wrong position to do either, even if doing so wouldn't remove the fur from the relieved area. The only part of you that can move freely is probably the tip of your long bushy tail, which is nearly a blur as your pent up energy struggles to find a release from your body. And all you can make is a muffled moaning noise; seemingly almost comically quiet in comparison to the volume of messages demanding succour. If Rip's lost you in the maze, he may have quite a hard time finding you again, you think distantly, eyes squeezed shut.        <br>\r\n\"MMMMMPH-MMMMMM! GMMGHHMMMM!\" </span></div></div>",

Her matching black high heels have been discarded onto the floor, leaving her paws bare and fully exposed for your pleasure.

I was hoping she would give us some privacy. I always love touching and playing with cute paws like yours when I have them all to myself without any interruptions.

But...without the ability to even remember where Lala is, how will Ms. Theidnar get out of this situation? Unless someone comes along to save her, her lovely, sensitive paws are doomed to become your personal play toys until you either become satisfied or bored.

Her eyes slowly widen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no no no! Kyaaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahehehehehehehehehahahahahahaha!\" And there it was. The sweet sound of her laughter once again pleasuring your ears. Her toes wiggle and then curl, holding that position as if locked into place.

You burst into the room, and, without a clear plan, energetically squeeze the mink girl's sides. Her short fur is<i> incredibly </i>soft -almost as soft as her surprised laughter-as she seems to seize up and sink to the ground, back resting against your shins. Your dexterous paws persue her soft belly every inch of the way, and she shakes in silent laughter, bunching into a fetal position on the thick carpet to escape your probing fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You always keep your paws on the move, remaining one step ahead of her swatting hands as you look for something in the room you can use to fully decide the encounter, prodding at her ribs, squeezing at her sides, poking at her belly, and what other tickling tactics you can think of on the spot. You notice a small, elaborately carved table next to the stocks, positively loaded witht tickle tools and other goodies. Seeing one that looks particularily helpfull at the moment, you snatch up a pair of richly padded leather handcuffs, with a pair of gloves attached to the rim of each loop. Kneeling down, you keep her occupied with one hand worming around in her underarm while you slip the cuffs on her with the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A number of hooked ropes hang down on the periphery of the room, and you tug one into useful range, risking leaving off tickling the mink, but figuring she is still too busy giggling to pose much of a threat. You hook the chain up to her 'cuffs, noticing that the built in gloves fit over her paws, preventing them from touching anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee-hee-hee! No fair! Hahaha... You took me by surprise!\" She giggles beautifully, trying to rise. The rope attached to her paw-cuffs leads through an eyelit in the ceiling, and from there to a winch on the wall.

Under merely the light tickles, her mouth stretches in a manic grin and she bites her lip to keep from laughing. You wait patiently, just simply circling those two fingers around and around, staying on top of her spastic squirming and shaking on the spot.

It looks like an enlarged cross-section of dry rot or a cross-piece of a termite nest in wood; full of big holes and with weird scraggly arms sticking out in odd directions. In a hollow set a little below head-hieght, formed by two such inorganic limbs, is a computer monitor of all things. Or a tv screen. It's hard to tell exactly which, for fairly obvious reasons. \"Hey, Rex, come check this out. I think it's a-\" As you speak, you peer in closely at the device, and casually prod it. The screen lights up electric blue. A calm but clipped female voice says. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Terminal active.

Any contemplation of it's linguistic surprises is dispersed when something hits you in the legs. One of the seemingly stone protuberances swiftly coils around your lower limbs, almost completely encasing you from waist to ankles in solid ceramic coils. To your disbelief as you are lifted almost a foot off the carpet, there is no sing of it extending form some concealed hole in the wall; it seems to just be stretching itself out to encompass your lower-body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What the- Rex! Help!\" You yelp, pounding on the thick tentacle wrapped around your waist. While failing to free you in the slightest, it does accomplish two things; one, hurting your hands, and two; getting them caught and pinned to your sides as the malicious masonry comes around again. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0To his credit, your fellow rodent doesn't hesitate to leap back in. He beats repeatedly on the offending tendril, sadly without effect. At least it finally stops coiling around you; now everything from just above your squirrel-paws to just above your waist is engulfed, snugly trapped in the animate construction. The rest of you is, thankfully, free to wriggle and squirm to your heart's content.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rex falls back, rubbing his own sore paws. \"It's no use, I couldn't get you out of that with a jackhammer!\" He says, pacing back and forth in worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's okay. I just wonder how long I'll be here before this thing let's me go-oh-oh-oh! Heehe!\" Your speech breaks into a series of high-pitched giggles as <i>something</i> drags along your wiggling foot. \"Uh -haha!- Rex, ishishis that... you?\" You stammer, feeling the mysterious tapered object dragging itself down your foot again. Giggling, you try to pull the appendage up to safety from whatever's taking advantage of it's exposed position. No use; the thing has you wrapped up so snugly that you can barely flex your leg at all, let alone pull it to safety.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, it sure isn't me, friend.\" He sounds bemused. Laughing and struggling, you lean out and peer down. You see the edge of the tentacle probing deliberately about your foot paws- and then a wickedly ticklish sensation blazes a path up your legs, scrunching your feet and putting you to twisting helplessly in the bizarre device's grip.\"Wha-ha-ha-ha-t now?\" As the tempo increases noticeably, running up and down your wiggling soles with ever-increaisng speed, you laughter rises to match it accordingly. \"R-hehehe-he-ex!

Without even hesitating, you grab her by her waist and place her on a nearby table. She struggles only a little as your restrain her wrists and then ankles with the straps provided. She now lays there, looking up with a shocked expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Whoa! Hang on there! I didn't expect you to restrain me! I have no control at all now! When will you stop?\" She asks nervously. You just grin and giggle as you walk down to the girls exposed paws. Her fur is a soft yellow color and the pads on her paw bottoms are pink.

It's just you, me and your precious, helpless paws~.\" You say back, looking down and admiring them. Buneary bites on her lower lip, curling up the three toes on each of her simply adorable paws.

No one would come save her or her beautiful restrained paws. Only you could decide when her paw tickles would stop.

You'll just have to lay there like the sweet, helpless girl that you are and take all of my paw tickles!\" You say as you drag your nails up and down the sides of her paws, making sure to scratch at the heels with each pass you make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KYEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

The ceiling, on the other hand, is some kind of earth-toned stone, vaulted and raised in a way that makes the chamber feel bigger than it really is. The walls are bare but for the odd picture frather up; at human-height they are suddenly covered in vases of exotic plants, hung with sets of padded leather straps, and inset with various sofas. The furninshings rest on a long lip that follows the cirular walls opposite the dais, given the surrounding floor a sunken appearence and making it look taller. All of which is cozily but dimly lit from lights concealed around the room, out of sight.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The muffled noises come form the dais, where a male chipmunk, wearing only a set of pants, has been stretched out and gagged, a vixen reclining besides and tickling him relentlessly. Tied spread-eagled, every paw has a dark strap looped around it and leading to one of the many unobtrusive eyelets you now notice fixed to the sides of the dais. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Aw, is the wittle 'munk tickwish?

Chuckling, she keeps the tickling while rolling over and sitting up to straddle him, switching one hand to his other armpit. His entire body arches in a futile attempt to buck her off, and she opportunistically dropps a paw to scuttle around on his suddenly tightened belly. With a massive exhalation, strength departs and he flops back on the pillows, grunting into his gag in  in ticklish frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Feeling like you've lingered on the doorstep long enough, you decide to </span></div></div>",

Conveniently, theres an x-frame built into the far wall, which you swiftly strap your prisoner too. Pulling the trolley in behind you, you shut the door and face your detainee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has wavy, shoulder legnth blonde hair with two enormeous ears sticking straight up through it, and soft, creamy white fur. She also has huge breasts and large feet. Pulling a feather duster from the trolley, you say \"All right, what's going on here. Where am I? How did I get here? Speak up!\" She stares at you fearfully with a pair of big blue eyes, and says\"I-I don't know. I woke up in a cell in the building a good distace away; this place is massive. I heard them call it 'Bing's Tickle Mansion' or something. When I woke up, some of my friends were with me, but they started  tickle torturing them. They decided to make me a cleaning attendant. I don't know what's going on.\" You notice she's also wearing, in addition to her narrow blue tube-top and short skirt, a thick leather collar with a brass ring in the front of it.<br>\r\n    \"Oh? And who's this 'they' you kep referencing?\" You ask. <br>\r\n    \"The scalies! There were dozens and dozens of them where I woke up, in the dungeons. Most of them looked like gaurds. Since then, though, I haven't seen a single one, or another furrie for that matter.\" <br>\r\n     \"Hmm, well, where is the entrance to the dungeons from here? What is he general layout of this place?\"<br>\r\nIn response to your question, she hangs her head and says\"I don't know.\"<br>\r\n     \"Oh? Well perhaps I can refresh your memory.\" You let down the duster and start tickling her sides, making her  scrunch her face up and shake with laughter. You kneel and start blowing raspberreis on her navel, positively making her shriek. Even though you continue to apply your memory refreshing techniques for quite some time, you don't have any luck, and finally admit defeat. Letting her down, you ask her her name  \"Oh\", she looks at you shyly, and you have a hunch that she secretly enjoyed your interrogation. \"It's Christy.\"</span></div></div>",

Turning, you're shocked by the sight that meets your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dungeon\" might be a good way to describe the room: The walls and vaulted ceiling are made of heavy dark stone blocks, and it's illuminated by torches in wall brackets. They cast an unsteady light on the rooms inhabitants. Several scalie guards stand watch over a group furrie girls held in a variety of ways by \"x\"-frames,\"I\"-frames, \"Y\"-frames, stretch racks, stocks, vertical pillories, or simply chained to the wall, ceiling, and floor.<br>\r\n      And they're being tickled.  <br>\r\nTo your right, a red-headed tigress is bound in an upright  \"Y\" possition, howling with laughter as two translucent, magical hands dig their fingers into her sides. To your left, an enormos polar bear lady chained with her arms and legs wide strains to swat away a comparitively small female scalie who's toying with what must have been her victems supersensetive navel. Her bindings allow her to yank her muscled arms somewhat, and allow her hands to get frustatingly close to her tormentor befor yanking them back again. \"Coochie-coochie-coo, my little bear.\" Chirps the scalie, swirling a claw in her captives bellybutton.                                                                                                      Just seeing these and a dozen other scenes arond the chamber make your ticklish spots tingle, which is virtually your entire body. In horror, you turn and try to open the door and return to the hallway, but there's  no door-knob on this side! Suddenly, you feel rough hands grab you from behind, and your dragged by one of the larger guards to a vacant rack.\"Look at this, girls: We got another prisoner to play with!\" She yells. As she does so, she throws you down, and puts your feet and hands in stocks, then pulls a lever which stretches you out uncomfortably. Another guard forces a shiny red ball-gag into your mouth. \"Right, now where shall we tickle you?\"</span></div></div>",

The soft leather lining the stocks lets your hands slip around somewhat, and keeps the strain off of your wrists and ankles, but refuses to surrender its steadfast grip. Intense awareness of the accessibility of your ticklish body concerns you, rivaled only by acknowledgement of your inability to defend yourself or escape the predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your captors- some kind of monitor and a smaller humanoid python, both in rather scant leather uniforms- drift down towards your feet-paws. One smirks and snickers something to the other as they size up your bound paws, before running just a single, delicate claw lightly down your curvaceous sole. You tense up electrically, useless tugs on your bindings abruptly shifting from wearily hopeful to outright frantic. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Grrrumph! Nou-unggf!\"  You plead, barely capable of believing how unhinged the very threat of tickling has you. Of course, the multitude of screaming, laughing voices forming the room's ambience don't assist your piece of mind in keeping it's feet with any great success. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ms. Monitor guffaws, evidently pleased  at your reaction. She slowly let's her other hand descend to your large, soft foot, three fingers wiggling adroitly. You yelp into the gag as your toes scrunch up, foot reflexively pulling backward only to be rudely rebuked by the stocks, the digits on the other limb flexing wide in comparison. The trio trace their torturous train down the length of your sole; over the large, bare black primary foot pad covering your deep arches, curving out of their way to form faint spirals as they pass through the short fur on the firmer ball and heel, moving with a slow, rhythmic scratching motion all the while. <br>\r\nIt's maddening as hell, and your helpless body shows it to the fullest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Wow, Ceshellia, this wolf you captured must be ticklish as laughter itself on her feet! Veeery nice catch.\" Complements the python, casually seizing hold of your right big toe to worm an exploratory finger into the nerve lined crevice beneath. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Thank-you, Set-yin. Let's make the most of it, eh?\" Ignoring your horrified, stifled pleas, the two sadistic scalies kneel down and begin to tickle your large feet in earnest. All hands come to stations, running up and down as  they poke and prod, skitter and scatter without warning. Claws trace all over the trapped appendages, circling the pads, dipping down into the toes, performing exquisite little dances as fine and as practiced as any ballet as their wielders drive you mad with grim focus.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Your muscles spasm uncontrollably, well beyond your ability to consciously direct them in an escape attempt or any other objective for that matter, meeting the limits imposed upon them by your bindings and fighting in a vain attempt to exceed them. Your feet twist and twitch on their own accord, struggling fruitlessly to evade the pointed fingers that pursue them relentlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Gmmph! Mpph-m-m-m-mph! No-umph!\" You splutter into the gag. Cesh eventually finds and starts to work a tiny niche where your arch commences its' slope up towards your toes, and you arch your body completely off the ground, pushing with only your wrists and ankles, a shocked lupine howl not being fully penned back by the muffle as all of your toes uncurl at once. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As you collapse back to the mattress after several seconds in the frozen crescent pose, veritably sobbing with frustration, Set turns slightly, twisting her arm up and around to put a finger between each of your toes from behind. She trades a wicked eye with her monitor confederate, before starting to scratch, nails beginning their strafe at the sweet spot, moving up and digging in hard on the ball, while their placement in the midst of your toes prostrates you entire foot, resisting its' every attempt at a return to its previous relative freedom. Cesh, meanwhile, leans her snout in close, nibbling and licking at the fleshy part of your soles in considerable enjoyment. She grabs hold of your toes with both hands, holding your feet steady as she cleans every inch of it with liberal usage of her tongue. To compensate, her fleshy tail curls around her sculpted body, the tip stabbing lightly into the center of your major pad.     <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And still the tickling continues unabated, the ladies heavily engrossed in their task, while you're unable to so much as beg hopelessly to relieve your mood and  distract either them or yourself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As time wears on and on, your struggles start to slowly decrease in tempo, strength showing it's gradual, inevitable drain. Tears come to your eyes, and your feet begin to feel slightly sore as well as ticklish under the seemingly unending ministrations of your captors. Your jaws, held open for an extended period of time, slowly start to ache, ton say nothing of your exhausted throat. This was worse than any of the various tickling incidents you had undergone in the past, more intense, focussed, merciless. Your friends or siblings would never have gone this far... Or so it seems in vague retrospect.                                        </span></div></div>",

An extra pair of tenticle-feather things move up and tickle his wingpits and sides. You can already tell that he won't last long. \"Aaaw, is the tickler ticklish? Well, that's ironic. Tell you what: i want out of this place. You tell me the way out, and i'll turn this all off and this can be forgotten. You got a deal, ticklee?\" You ask with a glint in your eye.
