Ms. Alverez cleared her throat, obviously trying to remind everyone of that, but it didn\u2019t make much of a difference.

Unfortunately, Braden had about as much success with that as Ms. Alverez had trying to get the class to settle back down, and it wasn\u2019t long before her thoughts had strayed back to two weeks ago, when <i>the incident</i> occurred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore we get to <i>the incident</i>, is Darcie\u2026</span></div></div>",

She balanced her cruelty with kindness and ruled the school with a seemingly effortless hand, and even though she had lots of \u201cfriends\u201d, she didn\u2019t actually have any real friends to speak of. Perhaps part of this was because of her refusal to let people visit her house, or to visit other people\u2019s houses. Because you see, even though Darcie was the most popular girl in school, she was also a\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BEDWETTER!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcie had wet the bed every night for as long as she could remember. At first her parents had told her that she would grow out of it, then as she got older with no sign of a dry night in sight, they took her to doctors who also told her she would grow out of it. By the time she was sixteen, Darcie was pretty sure they were lying to her. After all, what had been embarrassing when she was seven and humiliating when she was twelve was now something far beyond mortifying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMornings for Darcie began the same way every day: she\u2019d wake up and for just a second, she thought she had made it through the night without peeing herself. Then she would feel the damp, heavy sag of her goodnite and realize that even though her bed was dry, she was not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, sometimes she woke up and knew immediately that she had wet her bed, because she had peed so much that the goodnite leaked and left puddles of urine underneath her body. That was why, despite her protests that they were loud and advertised to everyone who entered her room that she wet the bed, she still had rubber sheets underneath the linen ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rubber sheets, along with the boxes of goodnites in her closet and the fact that she could never be sure if she\u2019d wake up dry (although she <i>was</i> always sure to wake up wearing what was <b>basically</b> a diaper) were the reasons Darcie could never have friends over. And since she couldn\u2019t risk accidentally falling asleep at someone\u2019s house, she didn\u2019t visit anyone else\u2019s house after six or seven at night. (She accidentally fell asleep at a neighbor\u2019s house once when she was eleven. It was humiliating and nothing she ever wants to repeat.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcie was lucky that her school\u2019s cheer camp only ran during the day and didn\u2019t require an overnight stay, but unfortunately her luck was about to run out because...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA. The Junior Class was taking a mandatory field trip<br>\r\nB. Their Cheer Squad was merging with another school\u2019s, and their cheer camp <b>was</b> overnight<br>\r\nC.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Darcie was eleven years old and she had a crush on her neighbor, Eric Richardson. Eric was fourteen and the son of Darcie\u2019s mom (Sandra)\u2019s best friend (Eileen). The two of them had been hanging out since they were babies. Well, Darcie was a baby, Eric was a toddler. The Richardson\u2019s had lived three houses down from the McCallister\u2019s her whole life, but they were moving to Washington next week and Darcie and her mom were both eager to spend more time with them before they left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner Friday night, Darcie and her mom walked over to the Richardson\u2019s house to see their friends. Darcie was feeling tired after a long week, but she was excited to see Eric and tell him all about cheerleading tryouts. She had tried out last year and didn\u2019t make the squad, so she knew how happy for her Eric would be once he found out that she made the squad this year. When they got there, Sandra went to the living room to have a glass of wine with Eileen while Darcie headed down to the basement to hang out with Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the bottom of the stairs, Darcie was surprised to find out that Eric wasn\u2019t alone. There were three other teens down in the basement with him, two boys and a girl. The boys weren\u2019t anything special (unlike Eric, who had the <i>prettiest</i> eyes), and she didn\u2019t think the girl was that pretty, either. All four of them turned to look at Darcie when she came in, and she smiled as she said, \u201cHi Eric. Hi Eric\u2019s friends. I\u2019m Darcie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the boys cocked an eyebrow at Eric when she introduced herself and asked, \u201c<i>That</i> Darcie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric\u2019s eyes got really wide as he shook his head, but it seemed like the answer was yes. Darcie felt like a hundred butterflies were fluttering around her stomach. Maybe they were talking about her because Eric had a crush on her too! She smiled, and the other teens introduced themselves to her (Brody, Will, and CJ) then turned on the xbox so they could play video games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcie sat on the couch and curled her feet up underneath her. She would wait until later, when they were alone, to tell Eric about cheer tryouts, but she still wanted to spend as much time as possible with him before the move. CJ and Will sat with her on the couch, and Eric and Brody sat in front of them on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before the sounds of the video game and the chatter of the teens mixed together with the exhaustion of the day, and Darcie\u2019s eyelids began to flutter shut. A few minutes later, she was sound asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she slept, Darcie dreamed about kissing Eric. She had kissed a boy in her class at school last year, and it was nice, but nothing like this. Kissing Eric felt like summer sunshine on her face and warm water on her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcie woke up with a start, disoriented to find herself somewhere other than her bed. The reality of the situation came to her in pieces. First, she realized that she had wet the bed and wasn\u2019t wearing a goodnite. Then she remembered where she was (Eric\u2019s basement!!) and tried to cover her wet crotch with her hands. As she looked down at the giant wet spot that was on the couch underneath her and the basketball sized wet patch on her formerly light gray pants, she realized that there was no way to hide what she\u2019d done. Next, her brain registered the hysterical laughter that surrounded her as all four teenagers cackled at her embarrassment. Only then did she feel the burning heat on her face, her blush such a deep red that it was almost purple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcie closed her eyes and stood up. As she began to walk over to the stairs, a foot crept out and tripped her, sending her sprawling across the carpet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no,\u201d a voice said, \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going <i>anywhere</i>, <b>bedwetter</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone grabbed her arm and rolled her over so she was looking up at the ceiling. She tried to get up, but they held onto her arms and pushed her back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the boys (Brody or Will, Darcie didn\u2019t know which) was kneeling over her with a malicious grin on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, when Eric told us his eleven year old neighbor still wet the bed, I didn\u2019t believe him. I thought he must be joking, because only babies wet the bed, and eleven is way too old to still be a baby. But look at you! You really are a bedwetter, aren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcie felt tears burn in her eyes as he spoke. Eric had told them? Eric knew?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell? That wasn\u2019t a rhetorical question. Are you a bedwetter? Are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scrunched her eyes closed and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay it. Say \u2018I am a baby bedwetter.\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcie swallowed and whispered, \u201cI am a baby bedwetter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLouder! Say \u2018I am a baby bedwetter.\u2019 Say it until I tell you to stop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed again and then said, as loud as she could (which was still quieter than she normally spoke), \u201cI am a baby bedwetter. I am a baby bedwetter. I am a baby-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcie gasped as she felt someone poke her side. She tried to move her arms to cover the vulnerable area, but whoever had grabbed them when she tripped still had control. Her eyes opened as she felt more hands reach under her shirt and start tickling her. She kicked out her legs as she began to giggle uncontrollably, and someone grabbed those too, holding them far enough apart that she couldn\u2019t squeeze them closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcie tried to speak, to tell them to stop tickling her, but she was laughing too hard. She stopped laughing long enough to gasp at the first spurt of pee, but then she was laughing and peeing in equal measure. There was a growing wet patch under her as her pee stained the Richardson\u2019s bleached white carpet yellow. <br>\r\nEven after they stopped tickling her and she stopped laughing, she continued peeing until the yellow area around her reached the bottom of the stairs, nine or ten feet away. Looking at Darcie\u2019s pants, it was no longer possible to tell that they had once been light gray. They were now thoroughly soaked, and so dark they looked almost black. The back of her shirt was wet too, a hot pink in sharp contrast to the pastel color on the front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcie was lying there, soaking wet from her own pee and with tears streaming down her face, thinking that she had never been so embarrassed, so humiliated, when CJ began taking pictures of her with her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSmile for the camera, bedwetter!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcie closed her eyes and covered her face with her hands. Huh, no one was holding her down anymore. Once she realized that she could move, Darcie jumped up and ran up the stairs, then out the door and over to her own house. She opened the back door and raced upstairs before her parents saw her, grabbing a clean sleep shirt and goodnite from her bedroom before heading to the shower. Once she was wearing clean clothes, Darcie breathed a sigh of relief. At least it was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer phone beeped with a text from an unknown number. She opened it and saw a picture of herself completely asleep, with a basketball sized wet patch on her pants and a growing wet patch on the couch beneath her. DARCIE MCCALLISTER: BEDWETTER was written in all caps in the next message. But it was the third message that made Darcie cover her mouth in shock. \u2018Ready to send to [7TH GRADE INCOMING: ALL]?\u2019 it asked. She typed out the message quickly and hit send before she could think of anything to add. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNO!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcie wouldn\u2019t make the cheer squad if the whole seventh grade found out she wet the bed. She wouldn\u2019t make the cheer squad if <i>anyone</i> found out she wet the bed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unknown number typed back: DO WHAT WE SAY AND THIS STAYS BETWEEN US. DISOBEY, OR TELL ANYONE, AND THIS GOES PUBLIC. UNDERSTOOD?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcie worried her lip, thinking. What would they want her to do? But then she realized\u2026 she would do <i>anything</i> to make sure that no one found out about her bedwetting. So she typed back\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nTHE END.</b></span></div></div>",

As she was getting ready the morning of her presentation, she tried to have as typical a day as possible. She ate eggs and bacon with her family, complained about her new school\u2019s uniforms (<i>seriously, who thought khakis and a light blue or yellow shirt looked good on anyone above age seven?</i>), and ran into class just as the bell rang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had gotten comfortable in her seat, Darcie realized one thing that she had completely forgotten about that morning- going to the bathroom. <i>Oh well</i>, she thought, <i>I\u2019ll just go after my presentation</i>. A quick glance around the room revealed that the presentations were in alphabetical order, which planted Darcie smack dab in the middle. She worried her lip, wondering if she would be able to make it that long. With a sigh, she determined that she would have to, because this project was worth fifty percent of her grade and she needed an A in this class if she wanted to fly to Paris with her aunt this summer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Darcie...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wasn't as happy with it as she wanted it to be, but it was as smooth as it was going to get, so she decided to take a break Sunday evening and watch some tv to relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she woke up Monday morning, Darcie made sure she had everything she needed and hopped on the bus, sipping from her water bottle on the way to school. By the time the bus arrived in front of the school, Darcie had drunk almost half the bottle due to her nerves about her presentation. She ducked into the bathroom before classes started, but there was a long line and since she didn't need to go that badly, she left and walked to Mr. Oberlin's room instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she sat down in her seat, Darcie took out her speech and began to recite it quietly to herself, sipping at her water bottle as she did. After what simultaneously felt like forever and no time at all, it was Darcie's turn to present. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcie stood up and walked to the front of the classroom, feeling as she did that it may have been a good idea to have used the bathroom after all, since her need to go increased tenfold with her nerves. As she reached the front of the room, she turned to face her classmates and pasted on a bright smile, then she began her speech. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning. My name is Duh-duh-duh-da-da-da-da Darcie McCallister and today I will be ta-tah talking to you about Prohibition and it's llllllllllllllllahhhsting effects on Nah-nah-nah Nah-North Duh-duh-duh-daaaaaaaaakota.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcie could already feel the flush rising up her neck and onto her face. Her stutter was always worse when she was nervous, and that was only the first sentence in her two page speech. She took a shaky breath and continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Many residents of Nuh-nuh-nuh of Nuh-nuh-nuh of our ssssstate wanted Prohibition to be overturned as ssssssoon as it became la-la-la law.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcie took another sip of water, hoping it would calm her nerves and make it easier to speak. Her face was now a bright burning red, and she could hear snickering from some of her classmates. It had been a long time since her stutter was this noticeable, and the more she thought about it, the more it appeared. Darcie took another sip of water and continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's nuh-nuh-not to sssssssssssssay,\" Darcie broke off suddenly, realizing that some of what she had thought was nerves was actually her bladder telling her to get to the bathroom asap. She turned toward Mr. Oberlin to ask for the bathroom pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I nnnnhhh, I nnnnhhh\" Darcie felt her eye twitch at the same time as she felt the first bit of pee wet her panties. There were more people laughing at her now, for not only was she blushing and stuttering, but she had just grabbed her crotch and began to do the potty dance as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcie opened her mouth to ask for the bathroom pass again, but before she got anything out, she felt her bladder release. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, there was a wet patch on her pants, growing larger and more noticeable by the second, but then whatever control she had left broke and she soaked her pants. There was an audible gasp of shock as people realized what had just happened, followed by a split second of silence, then laughter so loud it shook the clock on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God,\" someone yelled, \"she peed her pants!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She really peed herself!\", someone else cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got the whole thing on video,\" came a third voice, and that's when Darcie realized that this moment, this horrifying, humiliating moment, was never going to end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcie looked down at her soaking wet pants and the puddle beneath her, and then...</span></div></div>",
