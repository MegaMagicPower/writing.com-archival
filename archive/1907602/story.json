Also, Izzy didn't realize a glitch in the program. Normally when a Digimon gets stronger, their attack power increases and they can say in higher forms longer than before.

Izzy and Tentomon decided with the free time they had, they would spend it on gathering data in the digital world. Since Izzy promised he would stay home and clean the house, he sent Tentomon to the digital world with a camera so Izzy could communicate with him at home.<br>\r\n\"All appears peaceful in this part of the digital world. Aside from the abundance of hostile Digimon in the nearby settlements\" Tentomon was reporting to Izzy. He had been fighting hostile Digimon for about a week now.<br>\r\n\"There could be some leftover data from the control spires that could have infected them. But I need more data to confirm. The hostility in these Digimon could also just be in their natural data. We need to make sure it isn't anything serious.\" Izzy said while moving some boxes in his house.

Izzy had picked a huge box with one arm, and if that wasn't impressive enough on it's own, he was taller than Joe and his shirts were tight on his bulging muscles. \"So I was able to install the program into your Digimon last night. I need to discuss some occurrences in the digital world\" he said as he walked into his room with the box.<br>\r\n\"Izzy, what happened to you?\" Matt asked panicked.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" He ask while unpacking the box he was carrying.<br>\r\n\"Izzy, stand up and look at us.\" Matt ask concerned. Izzy stood up to his full height and looked <i>down</i> at his friends.<br>\r\n\"What the?\" Was all Izzy could say. He looked at himself over, at a loss for words on his current appearance. After the shock of Izzy's appearance died down, they discussed what was going on in the digital world.<br>\r\n\"So you want us to go check it out?\" asked TK.<br>\r\n\"No problem, piece of cake!\" Said Davis. Tentomon had already came through the gate before Tai and the others left.<br>\r\n\"You really have no idea what caused your current appearance Izzy?\" Tentomon asked, concern for his partner.

What the hell happened said Tai and how did we get so big. First I wished that I was bigger and I started growing and than i wanted to grow you.</span></div></div>",

He felt he was too young to move on to boxers, and he liked the feel of whitey-tighties anyway. He lazily ate the chips and drank the soda while watching his favorite cartoons. To his surprise, he had already finished the chips and soda. It had only been an hour and TK typically did not eat that much. <br>\r\n      He looked in the mirror to find that he had a tiny potbelly with a few crumbs on it.

Gatomon!\" yelled the four boys as they ran to hug them.<br>\r\n\"How did you find us?\" asked Tai.<br>\r\n\"The smoke coming from the food\" answered Kari.<br>\r\n\"Where are the others\" asked Agumon.<br>\r\n\"We don't know\" said Gatomon. \"Matt, Joe, Mimi, Izzy, and Sora, and their Digimon must be somewhere else.\"<br>\r\n\"What's this food?\" asked Kari.<br>\r\n\"Don't eat that!\" yelled Tai. \"Look what happen to TK.\" She then looked TK over and saw that he was Taller than her now.<br>\r\n\"I'm eating Puggy Apples to get bigger and taller than Matt.\" TK said to her.<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't worry about Kari eating them\" said Gatomon. \"Puggy Apples only effect <u>boy</u> Digimon and Humans. It has no effect on girls other than they taste disgusting to us.\" Kari exhaled in relief.<br>\r\n\"You want to help me eat them Kari?\" asked TK.<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" She said,<br>\r\n\"Just remember\" said Gatomon. \"Normal Puggy Apples with only grow the consumer a little bit, cooked will double that. But soggy apples will shrink the consumer a little, and burnt and rotten apples will shrink a whole lot, but no more than the consumer's original body mass.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm glad there is a way to reverse this if it get's out of hand\" said Tai.<br>\r\n\"You sure do know a lot about Puggy Apples' said Patamon.<br>\r\n\"Sure! When I was working for Myotismon, I was the only girl Digimon, so I had to learn all I could to make sure <u>I</u> would come out on top of guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\nDo they start to feed TK?<br>\r\nOr do we skip to Matt and Joe who are forced to work and a restaurant aross the lake by a Digitamamon because of his tricky co-worker Vegiemon, and Tai, Kari, and (much bigger) TK come to the rescue?</span></div></div>",

He, Joe and their Digimon got stuck working for Digitamamon in his restaurant since Vegiemon keeps messing them up. Burning the food, tripping them, anything to make them look bad. Gabumon was busy serving the custermers, Joe was cooking, and Matt was moving the new shipment of food into the kitchen. Gomamon was lucky enough to escape the work, for now. Every time they try to make a run for it, Digitamamon attacks them, so does Vegiemon. Gomamon had to figure out how to reveal Vegiemon's shenanigans so Digitamamon will let them leave. Gonamon was hiding near the lake, behind the restaurant, in a clearing not too far from it. Looking at his reflection in the water, he saw Tai and the others coming towards him in a swan pedal boat. After the relief of finding his friends, Gomamon explained the situation at the restaurant.<br>\r\n\"So how can we get them out of there?\" asked Tai.<br>\r\n\"Maybe we can ask nicely?\" asked Kari.<br>\r\n\"That was the first thing Joe tried\" answered Gomamon. \"Acually, he was begging.\"<br>\r\n\"Could we sneack them out?\" asked Patamon.<br>\r\n\"No, Vegiemon will know as soon as we try it\" answered Gomamon. TK wasn't part of the conversation since he was eating some Puggy Apples. They had brought them with them, and TK was HUNGRY! He ate only 3, and already a head taller than Tai and a belly exposing his bellybutton.<br>\r\n\"Gah! Wh- What happed to TK?!\" Gomamon asked panicky.<br>\r\n\"He's been eating the Puggy Alpples we got\" answered Gatomon. Tai then had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was Tai's idea?<br>\r\nWas it to send TK in the restaurant to distract Digitamamon his his appetite while the rest take care of Vegiemon?<br>\r\nOr did Tai start rapidly eating the Puggy Apples to grow big enough to rip the roof off of the building and grab Matt, Joe, and Gabumon out of there?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It all started when Davis overheard a conversation between Izzy and Ken. Normally he paid little attention to their technical discussions as they were usually as hard to understand as boring, but that day's topic was way more interesting than usual: <b>How wild digimon could get stronger without a partner.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA human partner could temporally evolve his digimon by sharing his energy and the digivice's, but wild digimon were capable of doing it permanently, or growing strong without evolving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy theorized digimon got stronger by defeating others, but Ken added there were strange energy sources that could increase their strength a lot and instantly, <b>the Data Sources.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were really rare, and usually the digimon who ate one become so strong they became a strong Mega/Supreme. Ken had found only one when he was the Digimon Emperor and used it to create Kimeramon, and probably was used for most evil digimon to become that strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing strong without effort. The idea was appealing for Davis, who was tired of being in Takeru's shadow: He had defeating him again and again in basketball, Kari seemed more interested in the blondie than himself, after battling Kokomon in America his Patamon was now capable of evolving into Seraphimon, matching Imperialdramon's power... he had better marks, perfect hair...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And, of course, those extra ~10cm/4\" in height. Davis hated so much having to look up to his rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, Davis thought in getting a Data Source to make Veemon stronger than Patamon's final form, even without DNA evolution with Ken... but later, started wondering what would happen if he used it on himself, as his body was as digital as a digimon in the DigiWorld. Would it make him stronger, smarter than TK? Taller?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking advantage the genius had a lead to one Source but they were too busy to check it at that moment, Davis raced to the Digiworld alone to get it, as the others wouldn't approve it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found it in the center of the derelict castle of the Dark Master. It was a shining ball irradiating light. He took it, and the orb kept floating between his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I activate it?\" Davis tried everything: shaking it, yelling \"Digiarmor energize\", shaking it again... minutes were wasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a few former servants of Piedmon who hid in the castle attacked the intruder. They were Perfect/Ultimate digimon, so ExVeemon couldn't stop them.. it seemed it was the end... until Mr. Perfect appeared, and his perfect Magnaangemon vanished the bad guys with the perfect Gate of Destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Davis, are you okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis, fallen into the ground, just nodded. He felt too humiliated to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you thinking, going to a dangerous place without telling us? The others were worried sick!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me, Mr. Perfect...\" Davis thought while the blond boy kept scolding him \"Next time I'll be hero who saves you and lectures you, after using the Source... wait, where is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Data Source had fallen on the floor, and slowly rolled towards Takeru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo...!\" Davis saw the magic ball, but before he could stand up and catch it the Source hit Takeru's feet, releasing light as it was absorbed by his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm? What was that?\" Takeru had only noticed the flash of light, but didn't know what had caused it. He also saw his teammate sobbing on the ground and felt a bit confused. \"Sorry for being so harsh on you.\" Takeru tried to comfort him, misunderstanding the reason of his sadness, making Davis felt even worse.</span></div></div>",

Davis started thinking maybe that thing wouldn't work on humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo days later, he changed his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring class, he noticed he was having more trouble than usual seeing the blackboard. The blond big head of his frenemy blocked his view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, TK, can you move? You\u2019re not letting me see the teacher!\"<br>\r\n\"I already did!\" His rival complained, but he slouch a bit more to help his shorter friend to see better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the class Takeru had to stand up and stretch his body, as his back hurt a little after so much crouching. Davis went to him and confirmed his fears: <b>Takeru had grown taller.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a head taller, maybe a bit more than that. His chin rose over his frizzy burgundy hair. Davis stood on tiptoes, in an stupid attempt to deny reality, but even in that pose the height difference was still a bit bigger than before his growth spurt, barely reaching his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs tall as Tai, despite being 3 years younger, and that made him the tallest boy in their school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven worse: After listening Davis' complains, the teacher reorganized the desks, grouping them in pairs... and Davis became the desk-mate of the bigger Takeru, so he couldn't stop thinking in this issue. In the next hours Daisuke \"Davis\" saw firsthand with his new size he had also become more popular, with all the girls going close to him to talk, and seemingly smarter, answering every question or math problem lighting fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Perfect is even more perfect thanks to me. Uggg...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his one-side rivalry, they weren't enemies and being with him wasn't that bad, as TK helped him with some problems and talked about stuff. In one occasion, he complained about having to buy new clothing soon, as his shoes were hurting his feet. Not much later, Davis heard a ripping sound and found out his toes had sticking out of Takeru's trainers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, those were expensive, how can be that low quality and ripping themselves?\" Takeru, oblivious to his strange changes, talked like outgrowing shoes in hours was normal ... and curiously, everyone else didn't see anything wrong with that, like it was perfectly normal.</span></div></div>",

Despite his \"mature and slightly rebel\" attitude, Matt enjoyed them more than he would admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it ended abruptly, when the musician felt something strange with the other, like it wasn't as easy to hug his whole body as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at his brother's eyes, almost aligned with his, then looking down to his broader shoulders in that black t-shirt, long legs and feet... a bit shorter than him, but not as much as he should be. Then, he noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takeru.\" He said dead serious. \"Why are you wearing my clothes?\"<br>\r\n\"Hehe... sorry, Matt, but my clothes shrink or something and I wanted something comfy to wear...\"<br>\r\n\"Don't take my things again... well, ask first...\" Matt's tone softened, as he couldn't get mad as his charming brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind failed to recognize his ongoing supernatural transformation, like the others except Davis. A side effect of the Digital Source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those clothes are a bit loose on you, and aren't your style. Let me choose for you something better.\"<br>\r\n\"Really? Thanks, Matt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two went to his room and Matt started taking clothes from his wardrobe. While he was looking, Takeru felt strange for a moment. He made a sound similar to a hiccup, and his head rose a few inches upwards. It stopped as suddenly as it started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt turned over with a new smaller, more colorful t-shirt, only to see his brother was almost two inches (5cm) taller than himself. All of a sudden, the baggy black t-shirt he had stolen wasn't so loose in him... a bit skin-tight, but it's elasticity made it still comfortable, and emphasize his broader shoulders and the sportsman build he was building. Actually, it looked better on him than in his owner with his slimmer build (for choosing music over sports).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On a second thought, I think you should keep it.\"<br>\r\n\"Aw, thanks bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now bigger brother hugged Matt strongly. \"It feels nice.\" He noticed.</span></div></div>",

Look how big you've gotten!\" He exclaimed with joy, putting his hand on the boy's broad shoulder.<br>\r\n\"Hehe, tallness runs in the family\" Takeru answered a little embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiroaki was a large man, slightly over 190cm (6'3\"). His gene were the reason why Matt and TK were taller than his classmates, even despite that trait was softened by their mom's genetics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Takeru assimilated the Digital Source, they never expected they could catch up his father, who was taller at their age. That wasn't a problem for Matt, who was satisfied with his over-average height, but Takeru always hoped to end up as tall to shine in basketball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Digital Source was going to make that dream come true in a matter of days: The top of his blond head was already over his father's chin, and his bigger frame was noticeably harder to hug, even for a big man like Hiroaki. Yet, his father only felt proud in seeing his kid growing into a man in front of his eyes, like it was absolutely normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had a wonderful dinner, although half was pre-cooked. The only inconvenience of that night happened at the end of the dinner, when Takeru felt a tingle in his toes moments before bursting his lent shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, those were Matt's... he's going to kill me.\" He went discreetly to steal another par this time from his father's wardrobe. Fortunately, neither of them found it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day was tough for Davis. As TK's new desk-mate, he had to witness during school hours how much popular he had become. Several girls came to his desk to confess their sentiments, Takeru politely rejected them in front of the jealous Davis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother issue happened at the third hour: they were writing in their notebooks when suddenly Takeru shivered and grew several inches in a second. His knees hit the bottom of their shared desk noisily, raising and inclining it to Davis' side, whose pencils and papers fell to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TK, look what have you done!\" Davis protested, Takeru apologized.<br>\r\n\"Davis, it's not Takeru's fault that your table is too short for him.\" Their teacher intervened to defend his star student, who couldn't fit his legs under the desk anymore, forcing him into a weird posture. \"I'll make it higher by putting some books under the table legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to use several books to bring the desk to an height Takeru was comfortable with, but as a side effect the other kid who shared the double-desk, Davis, had trouble to reach the now too high table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy, that growth spurt was all of a sudden. I wonder if I'm finally 190cm, like dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis didn't need to hear that. He limited to mumble angrily for the rest of the session. </span></div></div>",

A warning of what it was going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not everything was bad. They had physical education and he soon stood up in every activity, like a professional athlete. Davis had the bad look of being paired with him a few times, and every time TK won with a big difference of points, with the exception of a three legs race in which he couldn't match TK fast and long legs and fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day of school, before the first class started, everyone were startled with a strong \"Ow!\". TK had just arrived and his forehead had hit the frame of the door for the first time (but not the last). He was wearing a blue shirt and jeans, the clothes his father wore in his job. He only lacked a tie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, TK is wearing old men clothes. So lame. \" Davis said to two girls close to him, trying to mock his growing rival.<br>\r\n\"Lame? He's like a supercool teacher.\" They defend him, clearly enchanted by the towering blond. \"You're just jealous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were right. Davis had a chance to look him closer when he sat in their desk and noticed how well the shirt adapted and emphasized his nice figure, with those endless shoulders. The dull colors made his (now longer) blond hair and blue eyes to stand out more. And the first button of the shirt unbuttoned gave him a slightly rebel look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, they're right, he's even more gorgeous with dull clothes!\" He admitted only in his mind. \"How can this get worse?\"<br>\r\n\"Teacher, I need to raise the desk a little more\" Takeru said, as his knees were brushing against the table again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new pair the books under it raised the desk to a more comfortable height for the giant while the 150cm Davis had it harder to reach the books and paper he put itself.

Two days of Takeru overshadowing Davis unintentionally in class and sports, although Davis had his revenge every time his tall rival got hit by a door frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second day Yolei suggested taking advantage of a discount for the new theme park close in the outskirts, but unfortunately Kari and Cody were busy, so only Ken, Davis and TK joined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially they had fun, although Davis ranted about Takeru every time Mr. Perfect broke a highscore or won a price in a stands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should stop that stupid rivalry with TK. He's only been nice with you.\" Ken asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis would like to tell him about how he was cheating, as the digital source was making stronger and smarter, but that would mean admitting he tried to do the same stealing the Source first. He didn't want Ken to get mad, or TK for accidentally altering his body and the reality itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything changed when Davis saw the amazing new rollercoaster, the largest in the country \"Can't wait to get it!\" But he experimented the greatest disappointment when the employee checked his height and told him that at his height (150cm/4'11) he was 5cm (2\") too short for that ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at his friends expecting some support, but Ken and Yolei, who were 5cm taller than that mark, were already in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Davis. I'll tell you all about the ride later!\" Yolei said just before sitting in the wagon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeru said a few kind words to him, like how he'll surely grow those 5 centimeters for the next year, but Davis felt that was too patronizing coming from a guy who had grown a whole foot in a week. Feeling Davis' contained hostility, TK decided to leave him alone and join the others, but when he approached the employees looked at him and started mumbling. Initially thought they were just amazed by his imposing size, a reaction TK had seen a lot lately, but he tried to pass through he was stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse, Sir.\" The male employee started, mistaking TK for an adult. \"We have to check your height.\"<br>\r\n\"But I'm clearly over 155cm (5'1).\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, but all rides has a maximum height too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeru started sweating nervously. He walked to an height rode with a wooden hand marking the maximum allowed height: 193cm, or 6ft 4in.<br>\r\nHe put his tall body below the mark with some difficulty, as the rough wood hand pressed his head. He thought that maybe he was a centimeter (half inch) taller, but the shorter guards weren't going to tell the difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was, until he felt a familiar sensation spreading through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body rose like a compressed spring, gaining 13cm, 5 inches, in seconds, wrecking the wood marker, which flew two meters away accompanied by another button of his more stretched shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" TK said a bit embarrassed.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Mister. It's for your security.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTK and Davis sat in bench nearby while they waited for their friends. The size difference between them was even greater, with the knees of the former at the same height as the latter's chest, taking up more than half space of the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a good thing Cody and Kari didn't come, they wouldn't be able to participate. And I'm sure the rollercoaster is not that fun.\" TK said, trying to stay positive. <br>\r\n\"THIS IS SO MUCH FUN! AND I HOPE IT NEVER ENDS!\" They heard the voice of Yolei screaming with joy. TK's smile weakened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, Davis didn't felt happy for his slip-up...actually felt guilty when he heard the rest of rides have similar limits. Davis could always enter into an infantile ride until he was big enough for the \"big kids rides\", but TK couldn't fit in either. Real life things, like cars, were going to get harder to use too. It was all his fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, TK...\" The shorter boy started talking, without knowing what to say or confess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds of silence. Then Davis noticed his large feet (over two times his) hadn't outgrown his shoes... a pair of white, expensive-looking trainers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you get those?\"<br>\r\n\"From the brand. Their marketing team offered me to participate in their advertising campaign. Besides money, I can keep the sneakers after the photo shoot.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait, a campaign? money...? How the heck did a famous sport brand know about you?\"<br>\r\n\"They must be notice me after I was invited to play in the Tokyo basketball team.\"<br>\r\n\"Play??\"<br>\r\n\"It wasn't a big deal, just a friendly match against Kansai team, but I became pretty popular when I scored the winning point...\"<br>\r\n\"What??\"<br>\r\n\"They asked me if I wanted to join for the next one... although that's a league match.\"<br>\r\n\"F... F...fuuuu...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guilt disappeared and the envy returned bigger than ever. Clearly being a giant had more advantages than disadvantages. Davis spent hours screaming internally, \"The top player with sponsors should be ME!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pity there weren't any Digital Sources left, at least as far as they know.</span></div></div>",

He probably wasn't capable of finding new bigger ones on time, although Davis assumed he just wanted to show off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were having some kind of friendly match, or intensive training... they moved across the field, trying to steal the ball and score. Tai, with his superior technique, managed to take it several times, but he couldn't outrun the giant and many times he lost the ball before he could get close enough to the goal to shoot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis observed how the two teens struggled with each other for 20 minutes, cheering for his hero, but soon noticed how the soccer player became more slowly and sloppy, allowing TK to score more times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time out, please\" Taichi begged between gasps, his t-shirt wet with his sweat. He let his body fall into the ground. \"It's too much intensity for a full hour of game.\"<br>\r\n\"Is it?\" TK could continue all day, but quickly noticed Tai couldn't. \"Okay, enough for today. It was so fun.\" He said smiling while he sat next to his old friend.<br>\r\n\"Hey, guys.\" Davis finally approached \"What are you doing? I thought you weren't interested in football.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, that sportswear brand I signed an contract with, they want me to promote not only basketball equipment, also to do a football ad. I barely know how to play, so I asked Tai to teach me a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barely, he says!\" Tai laughed. \"You don't have experience, but you're an natural and those legs are as fast as they're long. Are you sure you want to focus on basketball instead of football?\"<br>\r\n\"Hehe\" Takeru blushed a little, happy. \"I like football, but I love basketball. And if I keep growing, I'll reach the basket easier, whereas in football the rivals just shot the ball between my legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tai, can you play with me later? I have a match in a few days, training will help me.\"<br>\r\n\"Ufff...\" Tai tried to stand up, but he couldn't. \"Sorry, too tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis knitted his bows. TK's smartphone began ringing and he walked away to answer it.<br>\r\nThe short boy took advantage of his absence and asked Tai about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't irritate you how perfect Takeru is? He hadn't played football before, and yet he scored more points than you without a drop of sweat.\"<br>\r\n\"Nah. I would have liked to win, but playing with him is fun enough.\"<br>\r\n\"Fun? You lost!\"<br>\r\n\"Precisely. It was fun because I faced someone stronger than me, and made me push myself. The opposite, sincerely can be boring.\" He looked briefly at Davis before resting his eyes \"I think you came here for the same reason, don't you?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Davis admitted. \"But I still feel bad, like...\"<br>\r\n\"Envious.\"<br>\r\n\"No!\"<br>\r\n\"So you wouldn't want to be big and strong and famous like TK?\"<br>\r\n\"...maybe.\"<br>\r\n\"Be careful for what you wish for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeru returned with news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Izzy called. He needs a few digidestined for a mission. Something about looking for... Digital sources, I think?\" Davis eyes opened widely. \"He said it will be a short mission, but I'll pass.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll go!!\" Davis exclaimed before starting running towards Izzy's lab. His enthusiasm surprised the other two.<br>\r\n\"Well, I think I'll go too.\" Taichi offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Davis was going, he ran into Kari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Davis, I was given two free tickets for a concert and I was wondering if...\"<br>\r\n\"SorryI'mInAHurryWe'llTalkLater.\" He didn't listen to her. He was too excited by the new chance of becoming a cool giant.<br>\r\n\"But... ok, I'll found someone else\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=============<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ken and I were investigating magical objects called Digital Sources. They can power up digimons permanently, and they were used several times for evil digimon in the past. Ken knew the location of one, but it disappeared before we could retrieve it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy was explaining the details of the mission to the volunteers: Ken, Cody, Tai and Davis.<br>\r\nDavis pretended not to know anything about the topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We detected the signal of another Source in the ruins of Myotismon's Castle. It's vital to get it before whoever stole the first discovers the new one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pass through the Digital Gate and appeared near the mentioned ruins. While they were advancing, Davis' phone vibrated: A social media notification about something Kari had recently posted in her account:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Having a great time in HaWa's concert from the best seat!  #Hikari #Takeru #BFF</b><br>\r\nThe photo was a selfie of Hikari sitting in the shoulders of a blond titan, towering from the public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit!

He wished he didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a gigantic table he hadn't seen somehow, taller than himself (\"2.5m tall? More?\") and he had walked under it. His friends Ken, Tai, Izzy and Cody were sitting around it. They weren't big, they were <b>huge</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow much?

Smiling, he put his small friend on a strange chair, very tall and with some kind of handrail?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a high chair for children!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne very big. TK sat, and even on his seat he was a good head and a half taller than the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to be in a chair for babies.\" Davis protested.<br>\r\n\"You act like a baby, so maybe you are one. You stole the Sources in a childish wimp, to get taller, and changed us instead.\" Ken remarked, irritated.<br>\r\n\"I'm the youngest and, formerly, the shortest, and I would never do that stupidity.\" Cody added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBones cracking sounded as Cody experimented a growth spurt that made him as tall as TK. Davis was shocked by it, and their accusations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I put my foot in it... but being super-big is a good thing for you! Tall, strong and cool!\" <br>\r\n\"is it, Davis?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying that, Ken experimented a big growth spurt that ended quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't type... UNNNGG\" Izzy's head rose until the same height as Cody. When the growing pains subdued, he continued\"...in any computer. My fingers are too big.\"<br>\r\n\"Can't you order a custom size one or something?\" Davis tried to find a solution.<br>\r\n\"No one manufactures keyboards that big. Or clothes for 4m/13' tall people.\" Tai's irritation grew with his body. The first one in surpass TK. The growth was so sudden that his knees cracked the table.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry...\" Davis had no excuses left.<br>\r\n\"That doesn't solve anything!\" Izzy grew more.<br>\r\n\"We're outgrowing the world!\" Tai was becoming a very muscular giant.<br>\r\n\"It's your fault!\" The table fell sideways, pushed by the growing legs.<br>\r\n\"Fix it!\" Cody demanding while becoming not only taller, but also looking as old as the rest of the giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the giants stood up, their heads touching the very high ceilings and surrounding the tiny Davis. Scared, he looked at the only one who wasn't mad, nor had grown: Takeru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was looking at him, a little sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TK?\"<br>\r\n\"I know it was an accident, I'm not angry at you...\" He began talking \"but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body started to shake like the others, inching upward...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"we can't live in this world anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon he was as tall a the ceiling... and then taller than it! He crouched to avoid destroying it, but his growing body pressed more and more in the ceiling , started cracking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giants walked through the front wall like it was made of paper. TK followed them crawling, trying to protect the building as much as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're evolving from Ultimate humans into Mega. It's not stopping.\" Izzy explained outside.<br>\r\n\"Too big for this world, we'll live in the Digital world forever.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait for me!\" Davis begged, but he couldn't get free from the high chair.<br>\r\n\"You're too small and weak for this.\" One of them final words, before the damaged building collapsed on Davis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Davis waked up, sweating like a pig. It had been just a nightmare, and the memory of it vanished quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the anxiety follow him like he went to school. Davis hadn't seen his friends since their adventure three days ago. Then the weekend happened...<br>\r\nThey exchanged some messages, they didn't seem nervous or mad for anything, so if they were growing, they were oblivious to the changes like TK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go see each one of them later after class... about class, I hope my classmate hadn't grown much bigger either.\" That would make the teacher rise their desk even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he went in his classroom, he was shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw TK from behind, wearing his usual colorful clothes and hat... in his normal size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt so relieved. \"That means the growth is only temporal.\" He thought, walking toward TK. \"Everything is going back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, TK\" Davis put his hand on his slightly-taller-than-his shoulder, and he turned around.<br>\r\nDavis freaked out when he saw that wasn't TK, it looked more like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-cody!?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, good morning, Davis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody he was as tall as TK originally was (4\"/10cm taller than Davis), and looked a bit older too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here? And those clothes?\"<br>\r\n\"I got perfect results in my last tests, so the school made me skip some grades and put me into your class. So I'm your new classmate.\"<br>\r\n\"ah...eh..ah...\" Davis was in shock. Again.<br>\r\n\"I have to thank TK for lending me his old clothes... have you seen him?\"<br>\r\n\"TK? No...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment they heard heavy steps growing closer the classroom.</span></div></div>",

Trying to be fair, the teacher choose soccer instead of basketball because with that sport, whatever team picked Takeru would automatically win. Also, to compensate his supernaturally good physical condition, he made two teams: one with TK and only regular students, the other with the smaller giants Ken and Cody and other regular students, also including Davis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe expected the experience of Ken plus his last growth spurt would compensate TK's raw power. The reality was that he underestimated that raw power and Ken's and how they would dominate the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe match between the two teams quickly turned into a game of those two players, the rest were unable to follow the fast giants and when they face them, they were quickly dodged. Even the goalkeepers were irrelevant, even in the rare occasions when they managed to catch the ball, the strength of the shoot pushed them back to the net.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis felt surprised by how well TK played, like he had been playing years, instead of just an afternoon training with Tai. His brain was growing with his body, giving lightspeed reflexes and genius strategies. But that wasn't the only improved, his physical attributes had skyrocketed after the last growth spurt, moving much faster than the last time he saw him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen was more skilled, and improved a lot after absorbing the digital source, but experience couldn't compare against the power levels of a strong Ultimate level human (Ken was more like a powerful Champion at that moment) and TK scored more points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, all the regular players were exhausted and frustrated for following those two, and only Cody had energies to try to get the ball (he managed it one!). Davis tried too, but he couldn't match even Cody's speed, much less the others, and eventually fell to the ground of exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was official: TK was better than him in everything.</span></div></div>",

You tend to go over to his house as soon as the weekend is about to start to hang out.\u201d Ken interjected.

I should probably leave now.\u201d He said before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTai also was hit by a source, I wonder if it has anything to do with age, considering how big Izzy was. It took awhile for TK to get that big\u201d Lost in thought, he didn\u2019t realize that Kari excited her family apartment.<br>\r\n\u201cOh Davis!

Mostly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait to see senpai towering over TK and teaching him who is the real deal in soccer!\" Davis thought, as if he couldn't beat Takeru, the next best thing was his bro Taichi doing it for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for meeting you with his looks.\" Tai said a little embarrassed. His growth had caught him by surprise, without proper clothes. He imitated TK and borrowed his dad's shirt and trousers, but his father was shorter and than TK and Matt's (~175cm vs ~190cm), thinner than his muscular son was now, so Taichi had having problems putting those clothes on.<br>\r\n\"No problem!\" Actually, Davis would love to have the same problem and show off his height with undersized clothing. \"Do you want to get out to talk? I know a good cafe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, TK was discussing the details of his new multimillionaire contract. He had his lawyer and his father sat next to him, but they looked like children next to the 7 footer, muscular boy. He had to sat further from the desk to give his legs space. The last of many complications caused by his size: he had trouble walking under one door of the office, lower than the rests, earlier he had to take the stairs because the elevator couldn't withstand his weight and rang an alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe loved his new size and power, but the boy knew those problems will going to grow in number if he kept growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope I don't grow more, at least for a while...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the blond boy felt a familiar sensation of warm and tingles through his body, as he felt how his shoes and clothes grew tighter. \"Crap, no, don't grow, not now... Don't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs suddenly as it started it stopped, leaving him with <i>merely</i> 5kg (11pounds) gained of muscle and 5cm (2\") in height. TK sighed relieved, thinking he was able to control his growth so he wouldn't turn into a muscle freak and outgrow the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so wrong... The Digital Source's growth power couldn't be blocked by the will of a mortal, only delayed for some time, merging this growth spurt with the next one in a two times more powerful growth explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe might be able to delay that one, but eventually the accumulated growth energy will be too much to be contained, and like a dam during a flood, all it will be released in a devastating explosion of power that will turn him into an actual titan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But, until that happen, lets leave Takeru with the illusion of controling his situation.</i></span></div></div>",

He didn\u2019t eat a lot and kept losing weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTakato, the foods ready.\u201d Rika called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato went into the kitchen and saw a ton of food filling the table and counters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you make all this so fast?\u201d Takato asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I have been cooking for my family for a while now and I had a ton of practice.\u201d Rika said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato sat down and started to eat. Rika watched him and was happy he was eating more than he usually does. When he was full, he looked at Rika and tried to eat more. He didn\u2019t want to disappoint her for all the food she had made. She was happy that he was eating all he can and doesn\u2019t want it to go to waste. When he couldn\u2019t eat anymore, Rika rubbed his belly with one hand and fed him with the other. When his belly started to vibrate under Rika\u2019s hand as it rumbled as it was at its limits. Takato told his friend that he loved her food but couldn\u2019t eat anymore. Rika kissed him and started to put everything away. He looked at Rika and watched her work. He felt something that he didn\u2019t understand.</span></div></div>",

Takato loved him cooking now and got some of it out and continued to eat. He made sure not to wake Rika so she could get some rest for worrying about him all the time. Takato ate as much as he can and felt his belly getting fuller and fuller. He pushed himself to eat all he can before stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, Rika is cute and could cook.\u201d Takato said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika moaned a bit and rolled over on the couch behind her. He checked on her and she was still asleep. Takato kissed her and went back to eating. He loved her food now and felt like his skin was going to come apart if he keeps eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo make Rika happy.\u201d Takato<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTakato, why is all this food still out? I thought I put it all away.\u201d Rika said groggily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato told her why the food was out and she liked it. She put her friend in a cage and tied him down. She didn\u2019t want him to escape while she spoon fed him everything. She called him a piggy the whole time and made sure he ate everything on the spoon. Takato started to cry as his belly rumbled in protest from all the food. He pleaded for her to stop but Rika kept feeding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo matter how much you lead, I will make you a nice, juicy, super fat piggy.\u201d Rika said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed Takato\u2019s belly and felt how taut it was. Takato\u2019s shirt was about to rip off so Rika rolled up off his belly. She kissed her friends drum like belly and started to feed him again. Takato kept crying and struggling to get out but Rika had bound him tight into the cage. When almost all of the food Rika had made him was inside Takato\u2019s packed belly, it rumbled fiercely letting them know if he eats anymore, it will explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that\u2019s a good little piggy. When you\u2019re ready, I\u2019ll come back to feed you the rest.\u201d Rika said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kissed his belly one last time and went home. She didn\u2019t untie Takato from his cage for she plans on returning to do the same thing tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

She saw that the food she made was eaten and Takato was missing. She looked around a bit before she found Takato asleep in his bed. Rika watched his belly slowly raise and lower with every breath. She put her hand onto his belly and rubbed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, wake up. Wake up you smelly PIG!\u201d Rika said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato woke up with a shook and looked at his friend. Rika smiled and dragged him back to the kitchen. Takato was still full from her feeding yesterday. He had one hand on his belly hoping he doesn\u2019t burst. She then tied him up in the cage again. Rika looked at him again and smacked his large belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you ate everything and escaped my cage.\u201d Rika said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t escape and I didn\u2019t eat it all. I fell asleep with it all out and was woken up by you in my bed.\u201d Takato said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore reasons for me to stuff you up to a bigger pig you already are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika started cooking some more food for Takato as he struggled to get out. He didn\u2019t want to move too much so that Rika hears him but he ended up hitting the cage. She looked at him and tightened the ropes on him. Takato gave up trying to escape and accepted his fate. If Rika wanted him to be fat, then he will eat all he can for her. When she finished making all the food, she started to feed him by the spoon full stuffing him more and more. Takato kept eating until his clothes were as tight as they could get on him. Rika wanted to see his shirt and pants burst off him so she pulled his shirt as far down his belly as she could see it happen. She kept feeding Takato until his clothes gave and ripped off. He was left sitting in his cage only in his stretched out underwear. Rika thought he had enough and let her little \u2018pig\u2019 out. Takato struggled to get up but he wasn\u2019t fully adjusted to his new weight yet.</span></div></div>",
