A few days ago she went down to her father study and after she heard something noises down there. She soon found a weird book, it was glowing. Her better judgement told her not to touch it, but her curiosity got the better of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the book and opened it. She found a series of exotic cards, she spoke one of those cards name out loud. <br>\r\nWindy she called out, and suddenly a whirlwind surrounded her and sent the rest of the cards flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a strange creature come out of the book. He said his name of Cerberus the guardian beast of the Clow cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura thought he was cute, he does look likes a stuff animal. <br>\r\nWhen he realized the Clow cards where gone, he started freaking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura calm him down, with pudding. Soon hee told her what the Clow cards where and how dangerous they where. Sakura blushed, she felt horrible letting things that where so dangerous out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe told him it was accident, if their was anything she could do to help him. He grinned, then he summon a key from the book. Sakura touch it and it transformed into a wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe told her, she was the a cardcaptor and it was her responsible to capture the Clow cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Sakura tried to refuse it, but he told her if she opened and release the card. Then it was her job to capture them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura sighed in defeat, he had a point. This was Sakura's fault so it only make sense for her to fix it. Later that night she captured the Fly card and over the next few days she captured a few more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily her best friend Tomoyo figured out what was happening. She was overjoyed to help Sakura with this magical girl adventure she called it. She even started making costumes for her to wear during her adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura blushed thinking about those costumes. They were all sexy and skimpy, she would die of embarrassment if anyone else saw her in one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomoyo arrived in class, she took her seat next to her. They said talked until class started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Class, we're getting a transfer student form Hong Kong today. Please welcome Li Shaoli.\" Said her teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura turned to see the new girl and she blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was gorgeous, with long chocolate color hair and Amber eyes. The school uniform showed off all of her curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura started mentally undressing the new girl. She was snapped out of her daydream when the teacher told Shaoli to take the seat behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura just watched as the new girl took her seat behind her. Shaoli just glared at her, it was like she hated her. That didn't make sense, she never meet Shaoli until today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura had to talk to her later, to find out why she was acting like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happen next ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This being one of Sakura's favorite classes, with her being very athletic and even Captain of the Cheerleaders. She noticed Shaoli took a locker right next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew it was not proper to peek on another girl why changing, but she was curious on what type of body did Shaoli had. Sakura blushed, as she took a peek and what see saw didn't disappoint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaoli had a very voluptuous but still athletic body. Her body was well tone, nice long legs, a very firm ass and she even had perky and firm Double D cup breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were smaller then her own E cup breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls P.E. outfit was just a pair of blue bloomer and a white T-shirt, and they look great on Shaoli. She put her hair in a single ponty Tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls made their way to the field, Sakura had a hard time not staring at Shaoli's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura and Shaoli had a one on one basketball match. Sakura won but barely, Shaoli left in a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen class was finish and the girls were taking their shower. Some how Sakura and Shaoli were alone as they took their.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura had to use all her self control, so not to stare at Shaoli's wet, soap covered naked body. Thoughts of shoving Shaoli against the wall and making out with her filled Sakura's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, she just meet Shaoli and now she wanted to make out with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was so caught up in her own thoughts, she didn't notice Shaoli slipping on some soap and crashing into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sakura opened her eyes, she gulped. She was on top of Shaoli, their large breasts squeezing against each other. Their lips only inch's apart, their legs intertwined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls just looked at each other for a few awkward moments. Then Sakura quickly got up and apologized to Shaoli. Shaoli just huff and grabbed her towel to dry off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happen next ?</span></div></div>",

Have fun and don\u2019t be shy to add. If I or anyone else have a problem, I will deal with it accordingly.</td>",
