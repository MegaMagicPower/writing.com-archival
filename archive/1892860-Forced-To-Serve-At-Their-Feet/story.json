You would have run or something if your head was not still dazed about its surroundings, all you could do was sit on the chair that they placed, and tied, you to and simply tried to figure out what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dave?\" You recognised that smug face anywhere, however, it somehow looked even more smug then previously. Now he looked as if he was about to tell you off for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's <i>Master</i> Dave to you now.\" Looks like his ego finally went out of control, you were not going to humour this. In a normal state of mind, you may have gone along with this but you weren't in the mood for this type of shit and just wanted to know what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" You groggily asked before Adam took over for his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened was that you were enough of an idiot to believe us and fell for our trap.\" He said before laughing at his apparent fortune, leaving Ray to add in his own commentary on the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only had that smile when he was about to do something very stupid. \"Now we own you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike that statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Ash's turn to speak and he looked like one of those professors in movies, about to explain what was happening, you didn't like the sound of this. \"For the past few years, you've been a douche and now we've decided to take you down a notch and we have decided that you will now be our foot slave until we decide otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let the words process while the seven others were just waiting to see how mad you would become and whether you would give them the satisfaction of seeing you pissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious.\" Was all you could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hear that?\" Paul said with a happy tone, suggesting that they were waiting for you to say something like this. \"I don't think he's being respectful enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave looked as if he was considering the other's words. \"You're right.\" He decided before turning to you once more with a grin on his face. \"About ten minutes serving each foot should do the trick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could guess what serving meant and you had no intention of doing such bullshit, you decided that the joke had gone far enough and that you were putting an end to it so that you could move on with your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me out and I'll think about not calling the police.\" You warned them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seven of them laughed in your face at that threat while Dave said he would add five minutes for that, leaving James to walk up to you and inform you of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's two ways this will go.\" He bluntly told you. \"Option one is that we untie you and you cooperate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo way in hell you were doing the latter. \"Option two?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave answered that for them, as if he was waiting for you to ask about it. \"We untie you and go for the fight I said we'd do, you win and we let you go, we win and...I think you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

No one can take on seven people and they wouldn't let you fight 1-1.  Maybe at first but as soon as you started winning all of them would pound you.  You didn't want to serve them but if you put them off their guard maybe you could find an opening to escape.  With that in mind you swallowed your pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right... I'll serve.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave laughed.  \"Say that again, this time properly.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, I'll serve you Master Dave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group laughed and then untied you.  \"On the ground boy and kiss my feet.\"  Dave ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow thickly, this wasn't something you wanted to do!  However there wasn't much choice.  Trying to run now this early would be risky but could you really lower yourself to kiss another guy's feet?  Nervously you looked at the exit and then slowly knelt... could you do this?  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You can. It's humiliating to hear them laugh at you and the taste of kissing his foot is horrible but you can do it. You bring your head down and you press your lips against the tops of Dave's tanned feet. You kiss the left and then the right foot once each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you tried to lift your head, however, you felt Dave put his left foot on top of your head and push it down against the right. Your lips were stuck on the top of his right foot and you ended up giving it a long kiss against your will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said you were done?\" Dave asked arrogantly. He grinded his foot against the back of your head. \"I said fifteen minutes for each foot, didn't I, bitch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't say anything, only for Adam to kick at your head. You swallowed down a wince and wondered when Adam got so tough. He must have been working out ever since that time you beat him up, not just because of the slightly smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Answer him, Mikey.\" Adam commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" You had to force the words out, not just because your lips were stuck to Dave's foot. Paul was the next to kick at your head, much harder than Adam had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Properly.\" He barked. \"Twenty minutes for that.\" He added as the others cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master Dave.\" You replied reluctantly. You were already kneeling and they were obviously just going to gang up on you if you fought back. All you could do was purse your lips and start kissing again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave lifted his foot off your head but presented it to you. You had no choice but to lifted your head up and kiss it as well, the same foot that humiliated you. The only thing you could do was to keep kissing both feet again and again until ordered to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group all laughed at that. Ray and James were taking pictures, Alan was talking about getting other people involved, and Paul and Adam were discussing what ways they could humiliate you next. Only Ash kept quiet and that was almost worst of all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actual worst was how Dave just stood over you and smirked. It was like he simply expected you to do it and that he naturally deserved to bring you down like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when you noticed the giant bowl nearby and what looked like some kind of brush that foot-care products used to soften skin. Just what were they planning?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could think again, Ash spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since it's your first day, maybe we should be nice.\" Ash smirked to Dave and all seven of them looked down on you. \"I've got an idea. Because we're being so kind in letting him serve as our foot-slave, let's give him a special reward from the usual stuff. That sound good? Let's...\"</span></div></div>",

If you give up, you serve us, only with an added five minutes on top of everything, so twenty minutes serving each foot, if you win then you choose another and it all starts over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew you had to win now, anything to escape this bullshit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then.\" Might as well go with their crap, trying to run wouldn't work and you'd just be playing into their hands. \"What's the sign of respect?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think kissing the top of each foot of your opponent should suffice.\" Ray explained while the others agreed with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my sign of respect?!\" You shouted in fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Adam cut in with an evil smile. \"It's ours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're allowing you to kiss our feet.

You just one problem. Seven, to be exact. These seven are a bunch of dicks and you decided, at the last day of school and the start of all your adult lives, to confront them at a place they knew about. The plan was to kick one of their asses to teach them a lesson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened was that they sneak attacked you, knocked you out and dragged you to one of their houses before deciding that you should \"learn your place\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour \"enemies\" are as follow;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid Markin: Barely does enough to pass classes, around 5,8, white but with a tan, darkish blonde hair, not the nicest personality but he holds good parties and is rich enough to have his own house to experiment living alone with along with four friends, who now have you as their foot slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam Smith: Can be smart when he wants to, around 5,9, white, black hair, the guy you managed to beat up once but has been going to the gym since and is a lot tougher then before but you don't know that yet, he also lives in the house and has been planning revenge against you for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay Tanner: Kind of dim, 5,4, long-ish black hair, white, doesn't hold his own in a fight but can work with James to knock a taller guy done, lives in the house and has been hoping to knock you down a peg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames Keller: Average intelligence but knows how to get under people's skins, 5,3 blonde hair, white, pretty good friends with Ray and has also been waiting for the chance to have you at his mercy, also living with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul Conner: Smart in some areas not so in other areas, tanned, 6,2, near-shaven black hair, been learning kickboxing for a while and is damn good at it which you have yet to learn, among other things he intends to teach you, the last of the guys who live in Daniel's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan Jackson: 5,9, red hair, never really liked you and vice versa, white. Doesn't hang out with this crowd but is hoping for revenge and also hopes that his girlfriend and her friends could use you as a way of fulfilling her fantasies, and to make him and the others some cash, but not at the cost of his own power over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh Hacker: 6,0. Brunette, white, smart enough to get by with Bs, pretty handy in a fight and the one who planned your enslavement and has been hoping to take you down for a while. He and Dave plan to humiliate you in front of the other six there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome rules before we go on: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo acts such as toilet, scat, farting, armpit, piss, watersports, public acts of worship, shrinking or foot/hand/blowjobs.<br>\r\nYou can include boys and girls but only in the age range of 17-27.<br>\r\nTry not to kill Mike without a live option, write one or two sentence chapters or do anything unclear or plagiarising or try and use reverse worship.<br>\r\nNo foot-fetish. If he enjoys it, it's because he's broken, and no turning-it-around.<br>\r\nAlways give at least two options when continuing a story and not just one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther then that, have fun.</td>",
