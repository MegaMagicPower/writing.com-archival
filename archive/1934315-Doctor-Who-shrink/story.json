The Doctor was tinkering around with the Tardis, checking all its functions making sure everything was working when he saw a button, he had never see the button before and had no idea what it did, however when the Doctor sees a great big button and he doesn't know what it does the only thing he can think about doing is pressing it, and that is what he does. As soon as he presses the button the Doctor passes out. As the Doctor awakens he looks around and notices something that scared him, he was shrunk. He estimated that he couldn't have been more than 3 inches tall. As the Doctor was examining himself he started to hear a rumbling. The rumbling got louder and louder until finally he saw what was causing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor are you in here?' shouted__________.</span></div></div>",

You think to yourself that if you can just get up to the Tardis control panel, you could activate the Tardis intercom system and get her attention, or better yet you could find out how you got to be this small in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, he must be out somewhere...\" you hear her mutter to herself. Suddenly, she puts a hand on the Tardis dash board and activated the engine! \"Amy why do you never listen...\" You moan as you're thrown about as the Tardis activates it's engines. \"Doctor!\" Amy yells, grabbing onto the railing but loosing her grip as it seems the entire Tardis is flipped on it's side. Amy and you are thrown into a random room on the Tardis, which is it?</span></div></div>",

A fine dining establishment, it resembled the finest of alien cuisine that the Tardis had replicated as with the customs of alien dining, the tables are already lined with all sorts of delicious food. Unfortunately, you've just landed in one of the dishes and Amy had landed face first into a chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy straitens up and takes a seat on her chair, \"Oh! The doctor never mentioned he had a restaurant on here.\" She says. Looking down at the food on the table her stomach suddenly let out a huge growl. \"Amy no, don't you dare.\" You yell, seeing as you where currently standing on top of the hamburger she was looking at so hungrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, seeing as she still can't hear you, you can only watch in horror as she stretches out one arm and picks up the burger with it. \"Amy please, you have to hear me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she hear you?</span></div></div>",
