Sure it was a steady job that paid well enough, and wasn't too difficult. Add that to the raise you earned last month, and you got yourself a nice way to make a living. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept that it's boring. Excruciatingly so. Every day it's the same thing. \"Type this, hand it to Person A\", \"Edit this, hand it to Person B\". You shouldn't be living like this! You're 22 for Christ's sake! You should be out doing something. This time should be spent having adventures, making friends along the way. Not being cooped up in a cubicle typing on a box to make letters show up on a slightly larger box! Of course you've told this to yourself many times, and it changes nothing. Nothing ever changes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe road was dark and empty. It seems nobody else was out this late. You drove past the street lamps that cast a faint yellow glow on the road ahead. In the distance, there was another light. However this one was much brighter than any street lamp. It was almost as bright as the sun itself, except the sun glows in shades of yellow. This light was shining white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light intensified to the point where you could no longer keep your eyes open. You slammed on the brakes, stopping your car and strained to see what was ahead. However once you opened your eyes again, your heard a faint humming and everything went black...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up later in....</span></div></div>",

But first, to make sure it doesn\u2019t wake up while you\u2019re cutting it, you slit it\u2019s throat. The deed done, you start sawing away at the scaled belly of the lamia. <br>\r\nAn hour later, you have finally got the lamia\u2019s would-be prey out of the stomach. The person you freed is not actually a person, but a centaur! This centaur had the upper body of a young woman, about in her late teens. She had a gorgeous face with light blue eyes and elven ears. Her bosom was covered by 2 half-digested leaves. Her lower half, however resembled a deer, light brown and black. Once you pulll her free, she says to you, \u201c Oh, thank you, human, so much, you saved my life!\u201d <br>\r\nYou reply, \u201c Eh, it\u2019s no big deal. It\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re a human, huh? How did you survive the raid on your village?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat attack?\u201d You reply swiftly.<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know?! The attack that wiped out all humans, where they feasted upon you all for days, in the most sadistic way ever? They had competitions to see who could eat the most of you!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cActually, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m from anywhere nearby. You see, I was driving my car-\u201c <br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this car you speak of?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cA car? Really? You don\u2019t know what that is? It\u2019s a thing that you use to travel. They have pedals that you use to stop and go, and...\u201d you explain what a car is to her, and answer all her  questions. <br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d she asks, \u201cyou come from a place with cars, and you were driving one, and you got blinded, which then made you wake up? And, in your world, humans are the only intelligent race?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat about sums it up.\u201d<br>\r\nShe then explains how the lamias were raiding and eating other races. She was taking a walk when she was attacked and eaten by the lamia, but not often a short fight. \u201cYou know what, I\u2019m going to take you to my village. You can live there, and help us fight the lamia, and it\u2019ll be great!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good, but how far away is this village?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cAbout 20 km. We\u2019ll get there in no time!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c20 km! It\u2019ll take us hours to get there, and the sun is already almost set!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou can ride me,\u201d she suggests.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019ll just slow you down.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you know how lamia can swallow things whole? Well so can I!\u201d She says proudly. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a birth defect, but I think it\u2019s a gift.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to eat me!?\u201d You yell, bewildered.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, us centaur have a storage stomach. I\u2019ll put you in there, you\u2019ll be unharmed, and I can go as fast as possible.\u201d <br>\r\nYou think about this. <i>Do I really trust this random person I saved? Should I go off on my own? Should I just ride her?</i> You eventually decide to ride in her stomach. <br>\r\n\u201cYay! Let\u2019s get going then, shall we?\u201d With that, she picks you up and stuffs you into her throat. The throat is tight and compressing. From the outside, you see your feet sliding down the centaur\u2019s gullet. You hope you made the right decision, but you have no way of knowing. Meanwhile, your feet emerge in a larger chamber; her stomach. You wiggle your feet and she giggles. Soon, your entire body is in the tight confines of her throat. She starts to gallop, swaying her bulging belly to and fro. You feel everything moving around you.<br>\r\n\u201cBy the way, I never caught your name,\u201d you say from inside her, not knowing if she can hear you.<br>\r\n\u201cAda,\u201d she responds hastily.<br>\r\nYour future lies in Ada\u2019s hands. What happened?</span></div></div>",

Behind your eyelids, you could tell there was a brilliant light. You briefly wondered where that light could possibly be coming from in your bedroom. After several moments, your foggy memory dredged up that late night drive and the odd light that had appeared in front of you. Holding your hand out in front of your face helped soften the light a bit, though you also felt a sprinkling of dust or something raining down on your face. Cracking your eyelids open, you saw that you weren\u2019t in your car any longer, you weren\u2019t even sitting down. You weren\u2019t sure how, but you were now lying down and facing up into a brilliant blue sky with the sun blazing high overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour slow as molasses mind finally pieced together a thought, <i>Have I really been unconscious all night? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour muscles felt worn and strained, but you managed to turn your head slightly and saw that your car wasn\u2019t even in sight. Instead, a pristine white beach spread out in either direction, bordered by a thick wall of vegetation towards your head and a gently lapping sea opposite the greenery. Sitting up was a chore but you eventually managed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you kept thinking that there was no way you could have ended up a beach. You didn\u2019t even live anywhere near a major body of water, let alone one like what was stretched out before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It has to be a hallucination</i> you kept thinking. <i>Though it\u2019s a really good one at that</i> you had to admit as you picked up a handful of sand and let it slip through your fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took far longer than it should have, but you eventually managed to half crawl down to the water. On hands and knees up to your elbows in the water, you felt how refreshingly cool it was. You hadn\u2019t realized how almost painfully hot you had become lying there in the sun. Again, you were struck by how realistic everything felt in what had to be a hallucination, a dream, or whatever. Splashing some water down across the back of your neck, you watched as the water become almost mirror smooth beneath you.</span></div></div>",

Looking down, you wondered how you could have possibly missed the fur on your arm and hand as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snap of a branch behind you made you spin around, any thoughts about your sudden fur shoved aside. An instant later, you regretted the sudden motion. Your head started to swim and your eyesight went out of focus. You thought you could make out a figure coming out of the greenery beyond the beach, but you couldn\u2019t be sure. Your arms couldn\u2019t support you any longer and you ended up falling back with a splash. The briny water closed around your head but you didn\u2019t have the strength to force yourself back to the surface. A shadowy outline obscured the bright sky and seemed to be reaching down to you, but darkness closed around you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolting upright with a gasp, you fought against the water pushing down on you. It wasn\u2019t for several seconds that you realized that you weren\u2019t in the water anymore. You weren\u2019t even on the beach anymore. Instead you were covered up in a rather luxurious bed, in an equally lavish looking bedroom. In short, it was nothing like your own bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelaxing somewhat again, you took stock of yourself. Your head didn\u2019t ache nearly as bad and your throat and mouth felt just as improved. The fur that had to have been a dream was still there, just as real feeling as the rest of this hallucination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping out of the bed, your legs were a little wobbly, but you were able to brace yourself against the wall. Looking down, you saw that your presumably soaked clothing had been removed, and now you were clad in a fuzzy robe. Forcing yourself on, you came to a mirror attached to the wall and got your first good view of yourself.</span></div></div>",

You were surprised that you could stand with a pair of breasts that was each larger than your head. This may have been due to the counter balancing of a round and plush rump that wrapped into the thick thighs that supported you. Your stomach was a bit softer looking than before as well, but it was nowhere near as great a difference as what had happened above and below. A pair of curving horns rose above your longer ears, splitting the blood red locks that spilled from atop your head and reached almost to your derri\u00e8re. Those waves had never been quite that long or that full looking either. Your attention was drawn away from your hair as you noticed a motion behind you. That\u2019s when you noticed the long whip-like tail that sprouted from above your cheeks. Its tip sported a tuft of hair that was remarkably like that on your head. You also noted that you lacked an udder, and were somewhat thankful for that, though perhaps your much larger breasts made up for that absence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t believe it. This couldn\u2019t be true, not at all. There was no way you were in some unknown location and so completely altered. And yet it felt so real, and nothing you did seemed to dispel any of this. No amount of pinching or slapping made you wake up safe and sound back in your car and in your own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a door easing open behind you drew you from your thoughts. Bright light streamed through the crack, but you could make out a silhouette peeking through the gap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard a voice, \u201cOh, you\u2019re awake already? That\u2019s good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the door was opened fully. You were momentarily blinded as light flooded into the room. You hadn\u2019t realized how dim the light in here was.

Are you feeling alright?\u201d she asked, her voice crisp and clear and almost musical in tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to respond, saying that you were a little woozy and worn out, but fine for the most part. You never got that far though, cut off as your stomach roared like a possessed beast. You put a hand on the wall again, supporting yourself as a wave of pain swept out. How in the world could you be that hungry?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, of course, you must be starving. Please, rest and I\u2019ll be back as soon as I can with some food.\u201d She helped you back into the bed before vanishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite yourself, you found your eyes glued to her curvy rump as she walked away. A rump highlighted by the long flowing tail swishing back and forth in time with her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting back in the bed, you tried to piece together what was happening. First, you encountered that strange light, then you woke up on a beach with no sign of your car or the road or anything, plus you somehow changed into an anthro cow with huge curves, and to cap it all off, you were under the care of an anthro dragoness. Your head swam, there didn\u2019t seem to be any rhyme or reason to what you were experiencing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach growled again. This time, you almost doubled over from the pain. As if summoned by the dreadful noise, the dragoness returned. You had been expecting a sandwich and some crisps or something. She returned with so much more though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead of her came a little cart, both shelves laden with platters of food. You could see a steak with a side of mashed potatoes, a mound of Linguine Alfredo, a steaming bowl filled with tomato soup, and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, this is too much,\u201d you said while shaking your head, feeling the unfamiliar sensation of your ears flopping with the motion. Your voice was unfamiliar as well, and not only due to the dryness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense,\u201d the dragoness said as she pulled the cart up beside the bed. \u201cYou need to eat. But I suppose whatever you don\u2019t have can be kept for latter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t find a hole in that logic, and your body didn\u2019t seem to care either way. The smells drifting off of everything and floating to your nose stoked the fires of your already ravenous appetite. The dragoness sat down on the edge of the bed, her tail curving to lie down alongside your leg. Then she took the platter of pasta from the cart, wound some up on the fork, and presented the gooey mass to you. You bristled a bit at her feeding you like a baby, but relented as the feeling of weakness persisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first taste proved divine, the melding flavors washing over your tongue and down your throat. The second and third proved as wonderful. Before you realized it, the whole bowl was clean except for a few gobs of sauce that remained. In a flash, the dragoness turned to the next plate, and the next, and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned back against the pillow, a burp escaping your lips. You had never eaten like that and felt so embarrassed. You could almost see the swell of your belly beyond the mountains of your breasts. The dragoness didn\u2019t seem to mind at all; in fact the smile on her face said that she was pleased that you had eaten everything. Some worry filled your mind about the steak, was that too close to cannibalism for you? Once the first bit touched your tongue though, you didn\u2019t care, the taste was too fantastic. You even drank down what had to be almost a gallon of some fruity soft drink or something. That one left you with a pleasant tickling in your throat, much better than the sandpaper feeling that you had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness started to take the cart back out, but you caught her hand. You were stunned for a moment about how nice it felt; warm and not at all leathery like you was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused, looking back to you with an arched brow. You paused as well, wondering if you should give word to your question or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment stretched on till you broke it by babbling, \u201cDo you know what happened to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wished you could take it back as soon as you said it. No, it was absurd that she would know what happened to you. That was going to remain a mystery to you, you were sure. Then the dragoness opened her mouth.</span></div></div>",

The dragoness said them as if you should have known them, her brow furrowing a bit in confusion. Then your hand slipped from hers and she was gone, leaving alone with her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind reeled. It was hard enough to understand what had happened to you, but to know that it was on purpose as well, it was the final straw. Your first response was one of anger. Somehow that creature had taken you away from your life and your world, because it was obvious that this was not the world you were used to. And to be changed like this\u2026You stared down at your hand. The fur there was thinner and shorter, but still evident. You growled, balling your first and dropping it from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to fume on this for some time, but before long the steam was petering out. How short a time ago were you complaining about your life, wishing for something different to happen, for something to change? You had never imagined anything like this, but didn\u2019t it fit the bill? And as for the body\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down over yourself, eyes tracing the swell of your bust and the curves of your legs beyond. You lifted your arm again, flexing the long dexterous fingers before running the other hand up and down the arm, feeling the slight tickle of the fur. This body was strange to say the least, but it also resonated with some part of your brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were unwilling to accept all this yet, and you were still more than a little displeased at having no say in the matter. On the other hand though, you had a second chance here, a new life away from the monotony of the old one. You could perhaps learn to enjoy this new form and the life you could make here. The fact that the dragoness was rather pleasing to the eye \u2013 even if as strange and otherworldly as your own body had become \u2013 was another benefit as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness swept back in, her head tipped to one side and chewing on her lip. \u201cYou really didn\u2019t know?\u201d The look of confusion on your face must have been very obvious, as she continued, \u201cYou really didn\u2019t know that I brought you here?\u201d You shook your head. \u201cStrange,\u201d she went on, \u201cit wasn\u2019t supposed to work that way. Perhaps I made a mistake\u2026\u201d she rubbed her face as her voice trailed off. \u201cNo, you\u2019re here, and we can deal with the rest as you get settled.\u201d Then she looked up at you again, \u201cOnce you feel better, we can start getting ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady?\u201d you repeated, \u201cReady for what?\u201d</span></div></div>",

You come across a small camp, and decide to hide behind some tiny trees. You wait, and see that a group of tiny people cooking a tiny woman on a spit arrive. You take action, springing from the trees, and snatching all the tiny men. You hold them over your mouth before dropping them into your stomach. From the outside, it appears nothing is in your stomach. You rub your belly and give it a few pats, before looking back at the woman.<br>\r\nShe was dead before the teeny men arrived, so you add her to the group of people in you.
