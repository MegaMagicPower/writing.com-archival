Just after lunch you got a call from your sister, asking you to meet her at the mall. You found it strange that she'd asked you to the mall and were thinking of not going but since you really didn't have anything planned today, it probably wouldn't hurt to go to the mall and see what your sister wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you found yourself walking to the mall, the sun beating down from the cloudless sky and you wishing you'd worn a hat. Along the way to the mall you passed by your best friend Tom's house. He was overseas visiting his girlfriend Annie and her family in Australia. The two of them had met just over a year ago when she was participating in an exchange program with a local school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approached the mall you spotted Jake, one of your other friends, getting off the bus. Going over to him you greet him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man, what's new?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah-much,\" shrugs Jake, \"You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing really,\" you reply, \"Shelly asked me to come meet her here and as I wasn't doing much I figured I might as well come and see what she wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake nodded and said\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(for choice #3 another character is accidentally reaped and has to live a new life)<br>\r\nP.S. The story is still following Adam no matter what<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On the way you both postulated why your sister would have asked you to come meet her here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought she was hanging out with some of her friends,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she wants to set you up with one of them bro,\" smirks Jake, \"I hear they're pretty hot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that'll be the day won't it?\" you laugh back, \"Besides, it'd be weird going out with any of them. I'd be like me dating your sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right,\" replied Jake, \"Although I can't help but think that you an' Jamie would make a nice couple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you arrive at the fountain and find Shelly\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Paula was the tallest of your sister's friends. She was a good two inches taller than you even but you weren't a particularly tall guy. She was dressed in her usual modest, long sleeved T-shirt and jeans and was standing there staring at you, biting her bottom lip as though she had something she wanted to say but wasn't sure that she should.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll bite,\" you reply brushing past your sister and over to Paula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" greeted Paula nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" you reply, \"I hear you can answer why I'm here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, well\u2026 Uh, you know\u2026 This wasn't really\u2026\" she stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on girl! You can do it!\" prodded Patricia, another of Shelly's friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah!\" bursts Jake from behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and your sister glare at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh I love it when you do that!\" snickers Jake, \"You look just like twins when you do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh put a sock in it,\" Shelly snaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adam,\" begins Paula again, \"I\u2026 They\u2026 Um\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or for Pete's sake Paula, just say it!\" exclaims Linda, yet another of Shelly's friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying!\" returns Paula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adam,\" Linda says to you, \"What Paula here is failing so much at saying is that she has a crush on you. There, it's said now kiss or hug or whatever!\" She then shoves you and paula together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh,\" you mumble, feeling Paula's breasts pressed up against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try and step back but you are just in so much shock that you can't move your feet. Paula's face turns bright red and she resumes biting her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it!\" snickered Jake from the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough her breasts you can feel Paula's heart beating furiously. Her face then turns white and she faints, collapsing into your arms. You set her down carefully on the ground and suddenly feel a twitch in the back of your head. Everything then goes black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~*~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you open your eyes you find yourself seated in a leather chair atop a cloud. Directly in front of you is a desk with what looks like an angel in a business suit seated behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really sorry about the mix up,\" begins the Angel, \"I guess his first mission should have been to someplace less crowded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you ask, perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry,\" replies the male angel, adjusting his tie, \"Allow me to explain. One of our junior reapers was in the mall there to collect a soul and well he just sorta collected your by accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was an elderly couple behind you and uh, when he swung his scythe he kinda grazed you too,\" explains the angel, \"Now we are prepared to send you back to Earth but there are a few little complications.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What complications?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can't put you back into your old body as, well, it's already been dead for a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you mutter, trying to stay calm at everything that is happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we'll instead create a new place for you to go. New body, new life, everything. The only other condition is that you don't get to be part of your old family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story,\" he replies, \"Now we've come up with a list of three new lives for you to take on. Remember, these are completely new identities complete with ret-conned backstories and everything. That means that while they never existed before now, everyone but yourself will believe they have always existed.\" He then takes some papers out of his desk and asks, \"So which one do you choose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then hands you the papers, each with the description of a new person on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1:<br>\r\nFemale, 16, sister to Annie (Tom's girlfriend in Australia), Name: Kayla Bonn<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: <br>\r\nMale, 24, Older brother to Paula, Name: Nick Steam<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3:<br>\r\nFemale, 21, Jake's next door neighbour, Name: Sasha Winters</span></div></div>",

You grin sheepishly and he returns to his paper. You look around the bus and see that aside from the businessman and yourself, two other passengers are present. You then notice the light brushing against the back of your neck of what you could only guess to be hair. You turn and look at the reflection in the window, coming eye to eye with the reflection of an athletic young woman with nicely tanned skin and curly blonde hair. You reach out and touch the reflection and the reflection's hand touches your manicured fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gently lift your right breast, shivering at the sensation. Letting it drop back into place you finally admit that this must be real as you'd never had a dream so vivid as this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd I pick a girl though?\" you postulate out loud in your brand new voice. This prompts the businessman to sigh and turn in his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next stop, Carmichael Street,\" announces a voice on the intercom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognize the name as it is the stop you'd get off at when you were going to visit Jake.

You put the key in the lock and are about to turn it when you spot, out of the corner of your eye, the silhouette of Jake laying on his bed looking out the window at you. You smile nervously and wave which prompts him to jump back off his bed and out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the door and find yourself standing upon the threshold of your new house, your new home. You try to bring yourself to step inside but are afraid to do so. Afraid not because you are expecting danger ahead but because you realize that to cross this threshold is indeed a sign that you have truly crossed the threshold between your old life, as Adam Kent, and the new one laid out for you by that angel as Sasha Williams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou toss the purse across the boundary as a first step but find yourself pushing back against the door frame as though fighting an unknown force. You feel exhausted and just want to sleep but are too afraid to make this one simple step towards your new life as a woman and away from your old as a young man. The wind blows through your hair, bringing to your nostrils the scent of flowery perfume. You brush your hair back into place, still at an impasse with respect to the doorway in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a step back and turn around. You then fling yourself at the door as though in an attempt to surprise your inhibitions and reach the warm bed you hope to find inside. You are surprised with what force you catch the door frame and push back, throwing yourself not inside as you had hoped but onto the grass of the front lawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at the stars you pray that this is all a dream and close your eyes.

The only other condition is that you don't get to be part of your old family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story,\" he replies, \"Now we've come up with a list of three new lives for you to take on. Remember, these are completely new identities complete with ret-conned backstories and everything. That means that while they never existed before now, everyone but yourself will believe they have always existed.\" He then takes some papers out of his desk and asks, \"So which one do you choose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then hands you the papers, each with the description of a new person on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1:<br>\r\nFemale, 14, Phil's younger sister, Name: Tina Button<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2:<br>\r\nMale, 25, Phil's neighbour &amp; friend, Name: Adongo Brown<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3:<br>\r\nFemale, 31, Shelly's wedding planner, Name: Li Wong</span></div></div>",

It seems when a call goes out about an injury at a strip club male paramedics tend to get there faster, go figure. They burst through the door and immediately start working on you. \"Look, I'm fine\", you state waiving your hands. You're not fine, you're stripper, but that's not an injury though seeing that you were male it seems like one. The manager of the club then appears. \"What the hell is going on here\", he shouts. The whole place then erupts into shouting with accusations of unsafe working conditions. Adam is in the middle of it pointing at the broken stripper poll and shouting. \"Get me the fuck out of here\", you say out loud. The paramedics took this as a request and have you loaded on the ambulance before you can blink. You feel they were a little grabby about it. Of course, who can blame them for wanting to touch a nearly naked overly busty stripper. As you're riding in the ambulance the paramedic in the back turns to you, but he's no longer the paramedic that just was there. Instead it's the angel. \"Hello Adam, or should I say Carrie Sue Forester AKA Angel Divine. Rather ironic isn't it? And they say we angels don't have senses of humor\", he states with a smile. \"You made me a stripper\", you shout angrily! He merely smiles and replies, \"You made that choice Angel, free will and all.\" You shake your head and retort with, \"I didn't know you would make me a stripper.\" The angel sighs and says, \"I told you the others were the best choices for getting you back quickly and close to your family. This was the next best choice. It's several months later and closer to the wedding, but we will help you get there. As we said, we will help you. Feeling defeated you let out a huff and lay back. The Angel smiles and says, \"Good, now you're going to the hospital, but you won't be there long. Adam will be there to pick you up.\" Your eyes go wide and you state, \"Adam?\" The angel continues with, \"He took a liking to you back at the club. That is your ticket to your sister's wedding and it may be more.\" The more part sends a shiver up your spine. \"What does he mean by more\", you think to yourself? The angel only smiles reading you mind. \"To help you out and improve Angel's life, now yours, call this number once you get home\", the angel says handing you a card. You look at it and see it's a card more a personal injury lawyer specializing in workplace injuries. \"What's this\", you ask? The paramedic now back to normal looks at you curiously and asks, \"What's what?\" \"Nothing\", you answer.</span></div></div>",

The doctor says you have a slight concussion. He tells you if you had hit your head just a little over more you'd probably be dead right now. Little does he know the real Carrie Sue Forester AKA Angel Divine really is dead. \"Fuck, a stripper! I should have seen this coming. Fuck me\", you mumble several times. Just as the angel promised Jake shows up. Coincidently right after they tell you they're about to discharge you. \"I just came by to check on you\", he says awkwardly. Jake was never good with girls, which is why he lost out with your sister. He didn't move fast enough. \"Thanks, Jake\", you state with a smile glad to see a familiar face. Jake looks surprised. Probably because you remembered his name. You feel a little strange when you look at him, but can't place your finger on the feeling. \"I got your stuff from the club. Sorry, but your boss says you're fired\", he says. You smile and reply with, \"You're such a gentleman, thank you.\" Jake sets a garbage bag full of your stuff on the bed. \"It was all the manager had to put it in\", he states. \"That's ok, he's an asshole\", you reply. You look Jake in the eyes and that weird feeling returns. \"What is that\", you say to yourself? \"Do you need a ride home? The manager said you didn't have a car\", Jake asks. Playing along you tell him, \"Yes.\" The angel did say Jake was your ticket to your sisters wedding, and more. The more part still bothers you. Jake excuses himself from the room as you go through the bag and pull out some regular clothes mixed in with several stripper clothes. For a stripper Angel thankfully dressed in some rather conservative street clothes. The bra gives you a hard time, but everything else is pretty familiar, jeans, panties, and a t-shirt. Angel even has a beat up ball cap, the Los Angeles Angels. \"Very funny\", you say towards the ceiling guessing the angel is listening. You bundle up your hair and put the cap on. Thankful to have something keep all the hair you have on your head under control. You always liked long hair on women, but actually having long hair is a pain. Jake wheelchairs you out to his car. It's a new sports car. \"Nice car\", you remark. \" \"I picked it up a few months ago. My best friend said I needed to do something nice for myself. Crazy SOB named me as a beneficiary on his life insurance\", Jake says nearly crying at the end. You knew you were good friends with Jake, but never knew he felt so strongly about it. The life insurance was a free one from work and figured, what the hell. You didn't intend on dying. \"You almost cry yourself thinking of what Jake went through. As far as he's concerned, you died. \"Oh, I'm so sorry, Jake\", you state and give him a hug. He hugs you back, pulling you close. He then lets go and says, \"I'm sorry, I don't mean to bring you down. It was almost 6 months ago and it just still bugs me. There was nothing wrong with him. One minute he was standing there and the next minute Adam was dead. The coroner could find anything wrong with him. What was even weirder was some old guy behind him dropped dead at the same time of a heart attack.\" You feel a lump in your throat as Jake described the way you died. Also that hug he gave you caused your nipples to tingle. \"What is that\", you think to yourself rubbing them in an attempt to stop the tingling. It only serves to cause your nipples to go erect. \"Damn female tits\", you think. Jake helps you into the car and you leave the hospital. Once on the road Jake asks, \"So, where am I taking you?\" \"What\", you reply? Jake slows and asks, \"Where's home, where do you want me to take you?\" \"Oh shit, where do I live\", you think sitting there looking like an idiot.</span></div></div>",

I feel like I haven't eaten in months\", you answer with a smile. \"Why am I feeling so weird every time Jake talk and I look at him? It must be the concussion\", you think to yourself as the annoying tingling returns to your nipples. Jake uses his GPS to find the nearest Taco Bell. You hope you'll get the chance to check your purse to find out where Carrie lives once you get there. You'd do now, but figure it would look really weird not knowing where you live. The only other option is to tell Jake you're really his dead friend, Adam back from the dead after being accidently reaped. You dismiss that option right away. You'd end up in a mental ward for sure. Jake pulls into the Taco Bell.</span></div></div>",

Can you order me my usual?\" Jake looking confused asks, \"What's your usual?\" You tell him and Jake looks even more confused. \"That was always Adam's go to\", he mumbles. You realize your mistake, but it's to late. You duck into the bathroom. You nearly go into the men's room out of habit, but catch yourself at the last minute. You duck into a stall and start going through Carrie's, now your purse. It feels weird as if you're invading someone's space, like a pervert. Then again you also have her body and life given to you by angels, so you figure you're good. You find it amazing how much shit women can put into a purse.

It's not the worst part of town, but not the best either. Pretty much the type of place a stripper would be staying. You wonder if you're the only one staying there. That thought nearly sends you into a panic. You search your purse, but don't find much more than a phone with a dead battery and a bunch of loose bills, probably pulled from your G-string. You head back out feeling better at least knowing where you're staying, uneasy not knowing if you're alone there. Jake has your food and a table. You start hammering down burritos like a crazy woman. \"Wow, you were hungry. Guess you burn a lot of calories with your job, uh dancing\", he states. You laugh and answer with, \"Yeah, dancing.\" You both then start talking like old times. \"It's weird, usually I have a hard time talking with beautiful women, but with you, you feels, I don't know\", Jake says during the conversation. You blush at him calling you beautiful. That weird feeling returns. Your nipples start tingling and you begin feeling warm. \"Must be the hot sauce\", you think. The workers ask you to leave. You check the time and realize you've been talking for nearly two hours. You finish and Jake walks you back out to his car. \"It's been really nice spending time with you Carrie\", Jake says slowly. \"It has been nice\", you reply. That feeling isn't going away, in fact it's getting stronger. You feel dizzy and start to fall. Jake catches you. As soon as his hand touches yours it's like your body warms up all over. \"I got you\", Jake says looking into your eyes. \"Those eyes\", you think. You feel a strong pull to Jake's beautiful caring eyes. Without thinking you kiss him. Jake kisses you back. The warmth that started when his hand touched yours erupt into a fire.

You reach for it and feel it throbbing through jeans. \"What am I doing\", you think confused. You can't think rationally. The only thing you know for certain is that you need Jake. Jake pulls into his driveway and you're all over him as soon as you're both out of the car. \"I need you\", you repeat over and over between kissing. You make it inside and begin shedding your clothes feeling as if you'll combust if they stay on any longer. You're down to your bra and panties and start helping Jake out of his. Your hands are trembling with desire. \"This is nuts\", you thinking trying to fight against the storm of pure desire that is blowing you towards something your previously male mind cannot even fathom. Jake takes your hand and leads you to his bedroom as you drop your bra and panties along the way. Pausing only briefly for Jake to put on a condom.

You've never cum that hard or as often in your life. You figure it could be worse. Jake is a good guy. There's no telling how things would turned out as a 14 year old girl, a fat man, or a 30 something Chinese wedding planner. \"As the angel said, I am a woman\", you think with a feeling of excitement and regret. As a man you had a different life planned for yourself. You do feel intrigued at the thought of life as a woman though. It's not as if you have a choice. \"I do love Jake\", you think watching him sleep. You always knew that you loved him, but now it's different. \"Whoa, slow down there. Let's not rush this\", you tell yourself. After several minutes you climb back into bed. \"Jake\", you whisper into his ear. Jake's eyes flutter open and he smiles. \"You're still here\", he says? You smile and reply, \"You are my ride home.\" He pulls you down on top of him. The feeling of his naked flesh against yours sends shivers of excitement shooting through your body. After a kiss he asks, \"Are you sure that's the only ride you're looking for. It's not like you have to go to work today.\" Your body finds the offer very tempting, but you have other things to do today.</span></div></div>",

There was just something about you\", You say trying to ease him. Jake smiles and replies with, \"Yeah, I felt something to. It was almost as if we've known each other forever. At the risk of sounding like a line, it was like we have a connection.\" You blush, you've never had anyone say something like this to you. \"Get dressed Romeo, I need to get home\", you state playfully. You go through the house collecting your clothes wondering if you're doing the right thing using Jake to get closer to your old family. Another part of you wonders if your not using him, but have fallen for him. \"Impossible, he's a guy, I'm a guy\", you start to think, but then catch your reflection in a mirror.

Pressing up against the window you feel a lone tear trickle down your cheek. Your chest heaves with each breath, pressing your nightgown covered breasts against the cool glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what to think,\" you say in your female voice, unsure if you are speaking english or chinese at the moment, \"In a way I'm very happy to be alive again but I'm also sad that my old life is over.\"</span></div></div>",
