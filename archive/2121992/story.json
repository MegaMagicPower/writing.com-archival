            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had started out like any other day. It was early March, you had woken up and taken a quick shower. You brush your thin beard, and tie your shoulder-length brown hair into a short ponytail. Throwing on some lighter clothes, you climb into your truck and head to work. You worked in a refinery, forging the molten metal into sheets. It was hard work, the sweltering heat and heavy machinery made sure of that, and you hated every moment of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecently there had been large groups of people protesting the facility, claiming that it was a hazard to the environment. The crowds made it nearly impossible to actually get inside,and they were getting more numerous every day. You could see them as you pulled up, blocking the front doors. You park your car in the front lot and make your way towards the front door. The crowd pulled at your clothes, shouting profanities and insults. You do your best to ignore them and push through. as you open the door however something occurs to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU'RE ALL BREAKING THE LAW\" after a moment of stunned silence the crowd begins to rage at your allegations, \"YOU'RE BLOCKING THE FIRE ESCAPE ROUTE\" you roar over their indignant cries \"IT'S A FEDERAL OFFENSE\" You enter the building and slam the door shut behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HIGGS You're late, and how many times do I have to tell you not to aggravate the protestors?\" your supervisor calls down from one of the balconies \"Get your ass in gear and get to your station,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get my ass in gear when you get your ass in shape\" you mutter to yourself as you grab your protective gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day goes by as any other would, you shape and temper steel into the sheets required by many industries. Your ten hours are over before you realize, and you make your way out of the building, back through the crowd. Several of them seem to recognize you and one holds you back, you twist out of his grip only for something to hit you in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck\" you turn to see a man holding a protest sign like a bat winding up for another swing. The crowd creates a space around the two of you as you duck under his second swing. You do your best to stay out of reach but the small circle makes that easier said than done. He's swinging like a madman, as if he was personally offended by your joke earlier. You just try not to engage, dodge rolling and sidestepping as much as your body will allow, eventually however you can't keep up and the solid wood pole hits you alongside the head,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah!\" you fall to the side clutching your right eye. Another blow hits your shoulder wracking your body with pain, you can hear your aggressor laughing and suggesting you keep your mouth shut in the future. You can barely see him winding up for a final swing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's all too much...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou white out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that comes back to you is the smell, blood. Next is sound, the people murmuring in hushed voices. Then sight, and you see what you've done. Your aggressor now lies crumpled on the ground, bleeding from all over his body, arms and legs twisted at disturbing angles, bones poking out in several places. His face is swollen and bloodied, teeth missing. There is little chance he's still alive. It takes you a moment to realize that you probably killed him. The bloodied sign pole in your hands confirms this. You take a few unsteady steps, and the crowd parts before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRun,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fear fills your head, blocking out all other thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to get away,\" You are much steadier as you reach your truck. Hopping up into the front seat, you start it up and peel out of the lot. You drive quickly, breaking several laws and ignoring speed limits. Your house was on the edge of your small mountain town, bordered on all sides by the forest. you throw the door open and begin to tear through your things looking for your camping supplies. You had gone camping numerous times in the past and you were confident in your survival skills. It doesn't take you long to find it, your hiking bag filled with your supplies. Some rain gear, a cooking pot, survival knife, rope, matches, a single person tent and various other small items. While searching you come across an item you thought you had gotten rid of. A pokeball, nothing special about it other than the M written carefully on it, almost worn away by age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you sling the bag over your shoulder something slams into your front door. \"THIS IS THE POLICE, WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE, COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit they're already here\" You had to hand it to her Jenny worked fast. \"YOU CAN'T RUN ETHAN THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're already moving, grabbing a chair and heaving it through one of your rear windows. Apparently they heard, because your front door explodes in a ball of flame, and an Arcanine leaps through, you throw yourself out the window and make a mad dash for the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woods were a restricted area, enforced by law, it was illegal for anyone to enter, even police. You figure they won't follow you if you get far enough. The woods are restricted because of an unusually high number of deaths and disappearances in recent years. Around thirty percent of people who entered this forest didn't exit. It was deemed an unsafe area. You had been hiking and camping in these woods since you were a child. you had never once felt threatened or gotten lost, so you chalked up the disappearances to peoples stupidity, Your father had been quite a survivalist and taught you everything you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run for as long as you can, and eventually fall to your knees exhausted. As you had hoped, there are no signs of pursuit. You take a moment and catch your breath. you realize that through all this you were still holding onto the pokeball, with a sigh you shove it into your pocket. A quick survey of your surroundings reveals that you are in a decent site for camp, level ground, some open space for a tent, and judging from the sound, a stream nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, I'll just set up here\" It only takes you a few minutes to set up your tent, and just under half an hour to make a fire pit. At this point it was getting dark and wandering around in an unfamiliar environment isn't the best idea, especially at night, so you just crawl into your tent and go to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Very slowly you unzip the door to the tent and step out. It's still somewhat dark, standing on the other side of your camp is something that worries you greatly. A Bisharp. You have no way to defend yourself from the powerful dark-type. If it wanted, it could easily kill you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good you came out on your own, I was about to cut you out,\" you remain silent, it's not impossible for a pokemon to learn english, but it's not exactly common. \"Do you know where you are?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a general idea\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You are in the territory of our pack,\" you gulp, pokemon packs are extremely dangerous, defending their territory fiercely, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright my bad I didn't know, I'll just get my stuff and get out of the area\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm afraid it won't be that simple\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, look I don't want any trouble I can just get out of here, you'll never see me again. I won't tell anyone that you're here\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you, but the Alpha's orders are absolute. You will come with me, Alpha will decide your fate\" You deepen your breaths saturating your blood with oxygen to prepare yourself for exertion. \"Don't try anything, you can't outrun me and you definitely can't fight me,\" Your eyes flick left and right looking for anything that you could use to escape, but there's nothing. You sigh, \"Well, looks like I don't really have a choice, just let me collect my stuff,\" Bisharp nods and waits for you to pack up camp, you hadn't used much so it only took a few minutes to pack everything up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright lets get this over with\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, follow me\" he sets off at a moderate pace, and despite the pit in your stomach you follow. You follow for several hours, until Bisharp stops and begins to speak. \"We are about to enter the main camp, the standing order is to take any outsiders found in our territory straight to Alpha for judgement, most of the time its pokemon so I don't know how Alpha will handle this, but since you couldn't have known you were in our territory I doubt you'll receive a punishment\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why are you telling me all this, I thought wild packs hated humans,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, I'm sure some do, but we don't really have any reason to hate humans. So few of you make it to our territory that it's never been an issue,\" he pauses for a moment \"There are a few of us who have history with humans so they might be somewhat hostile but I doubt they'd try anything in the presence of Alpha,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment, \"You mentioned punishment, do you know what I can expect?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not, most pokemon are offered a choice, join the pack or die\" a shiver runs down your spine. \"But hey like I said you're not a pokemon\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...comforting,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, come with me\" he leads you to a fallen tree and pulls aside a sheet of moss, revealing a tunnel, you drop you bag down and hop in after, followed by Bisharp. He leads you a short distance through a series of twists and turns that would have confounded you by yourself. The tunnels widen into open space, and the sudden brightness forces you to cover your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you open them back up your jaw drops, you seem to be inside an absolutely gigantic tree, it soars hundreds of meters into the sky and seems mostly hollow. The inside is latticed with growths and panels that support various platforms. The more you look the more astounded you become, \"H-how did, how is, wow\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Impressive right? It took years to build all this,\" You just nod and continue to take in the amazing sight. The area is filled with pokemon from multiple regions and of all types, most are moving about with some sort of purpose, several are selling wares off to the sides, and there are even a few that seem to be patrolling. You realize that they are starting to take notice of you and a few are openly staring. Bisharp notices as well and leads you into a hallway away from the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm taking you to Alpha's workroom, she'll allow you to explain your story and then pass judgment\" He continues down the hallway before stopping at a doorway obscured by ivy. He pulls the shroud apart and ushers you inside. The room is small, furnished only with a short table and a few stumps to sit on. Occupying one of these stumps is a Braixen. When it turns to face you it reveals a peculiar birthmark on it's hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" your body starts to shake, you know that birthmark \"Mira\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widen \"Ethan?\"</span></div></div>",

It started out great, she was exceptionally strong and we beat two gyms before she evolved,\" You grit your teeth, \"But everything changed when she evolved. She was much more powerful, but she became conceited and when we finally lost a battle she blamed me. I'll admit it was partially my fault. A few days later, she led me out into the middle of the forest and just dissappeared, abandoning me,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be such a baby, you're fine,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FINE? FINE! YOU THINK I'M FINE!?\" dropping your bag you pull up the front of your shirt revealing the massive x-shaped scar covering the front of your torso. \"A Zangoose hit me with an x-scissor, I WAS LEGALLY DEAD, fortunately a Gardevoir found me and was able to restart my heart, they dropped me off at the closest Poke-center\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-\" you don't let her speak<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's not even the worst of it, I had lost so much blood, I needed an immediate transfusion. Poke-centers don't stock human blood, I got a transfusion of Primape blood. It fucked up my brain, I can't control my anger, I KILLED A MAN YESTERDAY,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I-\" she tries to interrupt \"SHUT THE FUCK UP, you ruined my-,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you can't speak \"Much better\" Mira's eyes are glowing with power, \"Now that I have your attention, listen up\" she pokes you in the chest with her wand, \"I apologize for abandoning you all those years ago, at the time it seemed like the best option,\" her gaze drops, \"I came to regret that decision, I didn't think you would take me back, even if I could find you again, so I didn't even try,\" She sounds surprisingly sincere and you hate that you believe her, \"I didn't know what you had gone through. I apologize\" she releases her control over you \"I'm going to offer you a choice, Stay here with us as part of the pack, or leave, no strings attached\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite having control of your voice back you still find yourself unable to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You don't have to answer now, take some time, think about it. Give me your answer tomorrow. I really hope you stay\" she hugs you quickly and gestures towards Bisharp who ushers you out of the room. Once you are a good distance from the room he starts speaking, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was unbelievable, she killed the last one who yelled at her like that,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure if I'm lucky or not,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lucky for sure, Some of us would kill to be held in such high regard,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"She's just trying to use me,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, after hearing your story I can't really blame you for being suspicious, but Alpha isn't like that, at least not anymore,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach chooses this moment to announce its emptiness and you remember that you haven't eaten anything substantial in two days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in the meantime let's get you some food,\" As you make your way back to the central area you feel a slight twinge in your head, before Mira's voice resonates in your ears, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention all, we have a very special guest in our home today. His name is Ethan and he is a human. He is my friend, so give him the respect you'd give me, that is all,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit. Did she just tell everyone that I'm here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with that?\" Bisharp asks, \"No one will try to mess with you,\" \"Maybe, but they will try to be all buddy-buddy to get closer to her, and that'll just piss me off,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBisharp takes you to one of the stands and grabs some cooked fish. You notice that he hands two small pieces of wood emblazoned with Mira's birthmark to the vendor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Currency? That's almost as surprising as the english,\" Bisharp hands you one of the fish and the two of you sit together at the side of the main hall. While you are eating you can feel the stares of most of the inhabitants as they pass. A few get too close for your tastes, and they receive your most sinister glare. Most back off, but one seems undaunted. To your irritation a Buneary walks right up and sits next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you speak tersely trying to discourage the small rabbit,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Are you Ethan?\" \"Yeah, so why don\"t you just run along and-,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She interrupts you with a slew of questions: where are you from, what are you doing here, how old are you, how do you know Alpha, and finally are you going to stay here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away,\" you don't even entertain the notion of conversing with her, you are tired, hungry, and overwhelmed. You eat in silence hoping she'll get bored but she just sits there watching you intently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you Alpha's mate?\" You choke, and Bisharp whacks your back several times to dislodge the piece of fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what makes you think I'm her mate?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's spring,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mating season,\" Bisharp states, \"I can see why she'd think that. Alpha has never taken a mate, and then here you are, you arrive just before mating season and Alpha calls you her friend. She doesn't call anyone her friend. I'd bet there are many who are thinking along these lines,\" you hang your head, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit,\" you grumble to yourself, \"No, I am not her mate,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a mate?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why not be Alpha's mate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking hell, because I'm a human,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? Pokemon mate outside their species,\" you groan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's different for humans,\" \"How?\" \"Arceus dammit, I don't know it just is,\" She pouts for a moment,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's stupid,\" Apparently bored she runs off, and you sigh in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate kids, they have no restraint,\" Bisharp chuckles \"I love that about them, there's nobody more honest than a child,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sick of everyone staring at me, is there somewhere I can take a nap in peace?\" you get to your feet. Bisharp thinks for a moment,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of us sleep in a communal area, but I bet we could find you an empty room,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I just need my,\" you look around only to realize you dropped your bag when you were yelling at Mira. \"Shit, I left my bag in the workroom,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, lets grab it,\" As you get close to the room you hear several voices arguing, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't allow a human to be wandering about our home, even if he is your friend,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see what you're getting so worked up about, a single human is no threat to us. Also if he's Alpha's friend, then doesn't that make him a friend of everyone here?\" you yank aside the veil <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't go deciding things like that on your own, I'll decide who my friends are,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira has been joined by a pair of pokemon, on the left a wizened Staraptor, and on the right, an aged Quagsire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here, this is a private meeting!\" the Staraptor squawks <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should Keep it down then, half the tree can hear you yelling,\" you fire back immediately. Mira giggles as the Staraptor puffs himself up indignantly, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You insolent cretin, I could kill you where you-\" he doesn't get to finish his threat as Mira pins him to a wall with Psychic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're forgetting something very important,\" her voice drips with malice \"Ethan is here under my protection, if you threaten him again I will not hesitate to break both of your wings and drop you into a ravine. Do I make myself clear?\" he nods so quickly and furiously, you almost feel bad for him, almost. Satisfied, she turns to address you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Ethan, you haven't made your decision already have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here for my bag and I need a quiet place to sleep for a bit,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't changed a bit, get a little food in your belly and it's off to sleep,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been eleven years. I'm not the same person you knew back then,\" She pouts for a second before smiling devilishly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so cold, you must need someone to warm, you, up,\" she saunters up to you as she speaks and punctuates her three final words by walking her fingers up your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's my bag?\" You deadpan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had it moved to where you'll be sleeping,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, where is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, room,\" you pinch the bridge of your nose <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? You know what, no, no I don't want to deal with this right now. I need to sleep. Where is it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take you, our meeting is over anyways. Thank you for your advice as always but I won't be taking it this time,\" Mira thanks the two advisors, and dismisses Bisharp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might as well,\" Mira takes your hand as she leads you towards the back of the tree. You're just tired so you let it happen. You quickly reach a room blocked off by purple ivy, and are led inside. Immediately you notice how nice it smells, it's a warm, comforting aroma that puts your mind at ease. Your bag is sitting next to the entrance, so you just grab your sleeping bag out of it and slide up next to a wall. You're asleep within a minute.</span></div></div>",

You simply float and let go of your troubles for a while. You don't know how much time passes, and it doesn't matter, you are calm, you are at peace. It's a feeling you don't get much of in the waking world. Suddenly you realize you've started falling backwards, slowly at first but getting faster and faster. You roll over so that you are falling forward, only to immediately wish you hadn't. Your falling towards an endless expanse of a darkness so deep you can't even imagine escaping. You wake just before you fall in, sitting up in a cold sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan?\" Mira is kneeling next to you with her paw on your forehead, \"Are you alright?\" you breathe heavily <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was just a nightmare, but it started out really nice,\" you shake your head, \"Usually I just wake up like normal,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm sorry, it was probably me, you looked happy, I wanted to see what was making you so happy,\" she frowns \"What were you dreaming about?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a place where I don't have to worry about losing my cool, where I can really relax,\" you sit there for a minute allowing your heart to slow back down. Her ears flatten out as you explain, and she avoids eye contact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do-do you hate me?\" For the first time since you got here she doesn't have the brazen overconfidence that you remember. If anything, she seems afraid of your answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you care?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begins to tear up \"You were the most important person in my life, leaving you was the biggest mistake I ever made. I wanted to run back to you the very next day, but you would've never taken me back,\" she spills her heart out as she begins crying, exposing all the regret she had been dealing with, \"I missed you so much, and I hated myself for abandoning you. You were my best friend. You only ever did what you thought was best for me, and I betrayed you. I can't fault you for hating me, how could you not hate me. I-I just want things to go back to the way they were,\" she wipes away her tears \"I'm sorry, I'm so selfish, I made you suffer so much and I still want you to not hate me,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of silence \"I did hate you, for a while,\" you tell her, \"But hating someone hurts, the more you hate the more it hurts, and I hated you with every fiber of my being. I realized one day that it hurt a lot more than it helped. So I let it go, little by little. I don't know if I'll ever be able to forgive you for that, but I don't hate you,\" you go silent again \"Things aren't going to be the way they were, it's not possible, we've both changed,\" you pull her into a hug, \"but that doesn't mean we can't be friends again,\" Mira lets out a soft cry and hugs you back with all her strength. You hold her until her sobs stop and she falls asleep. You pick her up and set her in her bed, before crawling back into your sleeping bag for another few hours of rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sleep is disturbed once more by someone calling for Mira, \"Alpha? You're needed in the meeting room, there's been a dispute,\" at some point during the night she had gotten up and lain down using your stomach as a pillow. You gently shake her awake \"Hey, get up they need you\" \"Hmm? Oh, right. Coming,\" she gets up and straightens her fur, \"Help yourself to the fruit, I'll give you a full tour later, and Ethan?\" she turns back to you before leaving, \"Thank you,\" you get to your feet and stretch out your muscles, stiff from sleeping on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a moment to look around the room, having been too tired the night before. The room still smells wonderful and you are now able to place the scent, lavender. There is a small vase of the purple flowers on a wooden stand next to Mira's bed in the back of the room, which is more like a nest than a bed. Circular in shape and concave like a bowl, it's filled with various soft leaves and plants, and actually seems quite comfortable.  Near the front of the room there's a small table with a few stools. In the middle of the table is a bowl of various fruits. Across the room from the door is a large circular window  cut directly out of the tree and overlooking the forest to the east. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow fully awake you're at a loss for what to do. Wandering around the tree would probably draw a lot of attention, and you're sure you'll get lost on your own. On the other hand just sitting around waiting would drive you crazy. Unable to decide you settle for doing some simple exercises, pushups, situps, squats. You finish up a few sets without really breaking a sweat, and decide to slip out of your shirt so it doesn't get soaked as you continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor years you had been using exercize to try to burn through your considerable anger, and as such you were in good shape. As you turn back to the center of the room you hear a quiet gasp from the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-um I was l-looking for Alpha, I-I didn't mean t-to stare,\" a small Whimsicott peeks through the ivy curtain, \"A-are you Ethan?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know where Alpha is?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was called to a meeting a while ago,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-that scar,\" the whimsicott shuffles it's feet \"How did you get it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not the kind of story you'd want to hear,\" you brush off the request \"And I don't feel like telling it either\" just thinking about that day riled you up and you dropped into another set of push-ups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that scar is huge! There has to be a good story behind it,\" Whimsicott insists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said no,\" you growl and continue with your exercises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please?\" You reach the bottom of a push-up, pull your legs up under you, and stand in one fluid motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna know how I got this scar? Fine. My chest was ripped open by an angry Zangoose. Can you even imagine what that felt like? What it felt like to look down and be able to see your organs exposed to the air? No, you can't,\" You practically explode on the small Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone saved me but, sometimes I wish they hadn't. My brain got all fucked up, I can barely control myself. It was the worst thing that ever happened to me, so thanks for making me remember it,\" As you ranted you'd gotten closer and closer to the grass and fairy type until it was backed up against the wall, nearly cowering from your rage. You take a few steps back and pinch the bridge of your nose. \"I'm sorry, it's a sensitive subject,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no I shouldn't have kept asking,\" the small Pok\u00e9mon admits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, weren't you looking for Mira anyways?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh, that's right!\" Whimsicott jumps and dashes out of the room, leaving you alone once again. Your outburst had burnt up some of your anger leaving you relatively calm. You felt bad about yelling at the windveiled Pok\u00e9mon, but there wasn't anything you could do about it now. Pushing those thoughts aside you focus on a more pressing matter, how you'll respond to Mira's offer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was essentially offering you asylum from the world of humans, where you were no longer welcome. You had made plans for this situation, knowing that it was a possibility, but this was a completely unexpected development. You had a lot to consider. They were lead entirely by Mira, who had apparently brought them all together and enforced some kind of government. She had even created currency, something unheard of from wild Pok\u00e9mon. However you also had to consider that you were not a Pok\u00e9mon and the chances of you being accepted without friction were next to none, your encounter with the Staraptor had shown you that much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking hard, you sit down on one of Mira's stools and grab a piece of fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what you had seen they were advanced culturally but not technologically, which made sense, most Pok\u00e9mon had no use for technology. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I could provide a unique service that was useful, that would go a long way towards convincing them to accept me,\" you think aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, some of us really despise humans,\" you jump at the voice that appears right behind you. \"It would take a lot to convince them,\" you steady yourself and turn to see who had snuck up on you, however there appears to be no one there. \"Up here,\" you follow the voice up to see a Noivern hanging from the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you up there?\" You ask, slightly frustrated. \"Because I can be, so why not?\" You don't really have anything to counter that so you move on. \"Okay, why did you scare me like that?\" \"I wasn't trying to scare you, you were just so absorbed in your thoughts you didn't hear me coming,\" the Noivern responds with a small smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grit your teeth, \"Alright you're starting to piss me off, what do you want?\" Instead of answering, the sound wave Pok\u00e9mon flips off the ceiling and grabs a piece of fruit from the bowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alpha's a little busy at the moment, so she asked me to give you the tour,\" Noivern explains between bites of the Nanab berry, \"And of course I had to see the human Alpha is so infatuated with,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arceus, our relationship isn't like that,\" \"Hah, then why did she have your scent on her?\" \"She used me as a pillow,\" you grumble. \"See? That's my point, She's never been close to that intimate with anyone,\" you groan \"Well we're friends and that's it, I still don't know if I should trust her,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoivern finishes its berry and leaps back onto the ceiling, \"Alright, there's a lot to see so we should get started, now where to start?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are lead to the base of the tree, where you find a complex system of caves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We use these caves as storerooms for food and other things. There's also an underground hot spring a little deeper,\" you take a look in one of the caves and see that the walls are covered in a chalky white mineral. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is saltpeter,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saltpeter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, saltpeter or potassium nitrate. It's used in gunpowder and can be used to preserve foods,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's gunpowder?\" You'd forgotten that they probably hadn't ever seen a gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a powder used in special weapons humans developed, it's explosive,\" as you were about to leave you notice one of the caves was formed of a different kind of stone. \"That's iron ore, it's the same as the stuff brought into the refinery,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A refinery is where metals are processed and made usable, I used to work in one,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoivern leads you to very top of the tree, explaining the general structure as you go, \"The tree has two main sections, inner and outer. They're separated by stairways that lead all the way up and down. The inner section is mostly living quarters there's no real restrictions to it, you could sleep wherever you wanted, but I wouldn't recommend you try it. The outer section is workspace. Alpha has teams working on various projects and that's where they do a lot of it. Is this making sense to you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you're only half paying attention. As you head up the tree everyone you pass stares, and it puts you on edge. Fortunately there is only one other Pok\u00e9mon at the top and they leave as you arrive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the birds nest, we usually have a few people posted up here to keep an eye on the area,\" the nest was a small circular platform that gave an almost perfect three hundred and sixty degree view of the area. You can see for miles in every direction. If you look hard enough you can almost see the towers of the refinery where you had worked. As you think about where you had worked you realize what you have that none of the Pok\u00e9mon Mira has gathered could have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Noivern, I need to talk to Mira. Do you know where she is?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me Stella,\" she glances at the sky, \"Right now Alpha should be getting lunch, so she probably went back to her room. What did you want to talk to her about anyways?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How often do you have conflicts with other groups?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few times a lunar cycle, why? And how did you know about that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the stairs down from the nest, \"You live in a natural fortress, keep the entrances hidden, and have lookouts posted. You're either expecting an attack, or insanely paranoid,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but that doesn't answer my first question,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou break out into a grin \"I think I've figured out what I have that no one here does, what I can do that they can't,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's that?\" Stella asks as she matches your pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Metalwork,\" her confusion is apparent so you elaborate, \"Remember the iron ore in the caves? I can use that to make tools, weapons, and all sorts of things, even armor!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Armor? Why would we want armor?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in a fight you have to focus on both defense and offense right? But with armor you don't have to focus as much on protection and you're more free to attack, and weapons give you a means of attack that doesn't rely on your energy like moves do, so you're able to fight for longer,\" by the time you've finished your explanation you're almost at the ground floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, human,\" up until this point you've been mostly left alone, but it had to come to a head eventually, most of the Pok\u00e9mon here probably didn't want you there, and you had no doubt they'd try to intimidate you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" You turn around to see a pair of Lucario on the stairs behind you. You tense up internally, in a fair fight you wouldn't stand a chance against a single Lucario so you didn't favor your odds against the two of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, we aren't going to hurt you,\" one steps forward \"If Alpha trusts you that's good enough for us,\" the other steps forward as well <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But your aura is very weird. Like nothing we've ever seen,\" they position themselves on either side of you forcing you split your attention, \"So what are you exactly?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? I'm a human,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, your aura is too,\" the first one speaks up but pauses, searching for the right word, \"chaotic, it's far more like a pokemons,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, your aura is completely different from a humans. There's no way you're human,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a human. I don't know anything about aura, but I'm a human,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first one narrows his eyes, \"I wonder. Oh well, I can tell you're uncomfortable, so well just leave it at that for now,\" he heads back up the stairs, and the other follows, \"Good luck with your proposal,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stand there processing that exchange, \"Who were they?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're Kara and Koro, twins. They have a strange connection and always know what the other is thinking, so talking to them can be confusing, but they're both nice,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did they mean about my aura?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugs \"I have no idea, aura's kind of a Lucario thing,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimace, \"Let's just move on, which way is Mira's room?\" Stella leads you back through the corridors to the room you slept in. \"Mira?\" You part the veil of vines and step inside, \"I've got my answer,\" Mira's sitting at her table eating some fish, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Out with it, are you staying?\" You can see how tense she is, and how much your answer will mean to her, it almost makes you understand why everyone seems to think she's infatuated with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll stay, and,\" she doesn't let you finish, wrapping you in a fierce hug, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you wouldn't leave me,\" she buries her face in your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay calm down, this is why there are those rumors,\" you pry her off and hold her at arms length. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rumors? What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone seems to think we're mates,\" her jaw drops open and she </span></div></div>",

I mean I'll tease you all day long but, mates? Oh Arceus,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See Stella? What did I tell you?\" The soundwave Pok\u00e9mon crosses her arms and huffs. \"Anyways I wanted to talk about what I'll be doing here,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, have a seat,\" you sit across from her and begin explaining, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been working in a refinery for years now, I can work with metal. You have a decent sized deposit of iron in the cave system, with some help I can use it to make tools, weapons, and armor,\" you pause for a moment, waiting for a response, when she doesn't say anything you continue, \"I'll need a few things from my home and I might have to steal some things from the refinery. It won't be easy and I'll need help to get it started, but it's doable,\" Mira finishes one of her fish and taps the skewer on the table a few times in contemplation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly would you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd need an area to work, someone to help mine the iron, some tools from the refinery, someone to help build the furnace and forge, and possibly someone to help with designing the armor as well as testing,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like the idea of armor,\" Mira admits, \"but you'll have to make so many different types and sizes for everyone here, are you really up to that kind of task?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to start with the simpler pieces, chest plates and helmets, I can work out more complex pieces as I go. It'll take some experimentation and time, but I'm confident in my skill,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long would it take to make a single chest plate?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends, how large does it have to be, who'll be wearing it, should it be heavier or lighter? I can't say without that kind of information,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, how long would it take to make one for me?\" You stroke your chin for a moment,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A day? Maybe two? Metalworking can't be rushed, if you go too quickly the metal will become brittle,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, we'll give it a test run, make me some armor and we'll see how effective it is. If it holds up then you'll make more,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A challenge huh? Alright I'm game. First things first, I need to head back into town and grab a few things, it'll take a day to get there, so I need to get going now,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to hike back to a town that's probably looking for you everywhere? No, you'll be teleporting, I'll have Nanuk get you there, he's been close to the town so there shouldn't be any issues, just meet back up with him after you get what you need,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll have to be very early if I don't want to get caught by the refinery workers,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do they have that you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heat resistant clothes, and tools for shaping the metal,\" you step from the table to your bag, and start taking everything out. You stack all of your supplies in a neat pile on your sleeping bag. \"Alright I'm ready,\" you sling the empty bag on your back, Mira nods looking off into space for a moment,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nanuk is here,\" she states before taking a sip from an earthenware mug. Sure enough a green wing parts the ivy curtain and a Xatu steps through. His gaze immediately focuses on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite troubling,\" he mumbles as he stares, clearly unhappy with something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got a problem?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to make peace with your past,\" he says as he nods sagely \"only then will you be truly happy,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gave up on being happy a long time ago,\" you reply bitterly, \"I'd just ruin it,\" you look down for a moment, \"Whatever, fuck that, let's just get going. I need to get into my house and then the refinery,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" Nanuk presses his wings together before him and spreads them wide. Your mind is assailed by a violent lurch and strange patterns of light. The complete absence of sound is almost painful. Fortunately it only lasts for a moment but you still have to fight to keep from puking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can be quite jarring the first time, however one becomes accustomed after a time,\" Nanuk offers his sage advice as you lean against a tree, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the heads-up,\" you manage to spit out between dry heaves. After your stomach settles you take a look around. You're not far from your house, a few hundred meters at most. So you slowly approach.

There's only about ten yards of open space between you and the window you broke, it would only takes few seconds to get there, but you'd be completely exposed. The sun was still out, making it a gamble. You weren't about to trust your luck, so you wait until the sun is well below the horizon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's dark enough, I'm going now,\" you whisper to your companion, \"If I'm lucky we won't need an emergency teleport, but I'm not a lucky person,\" you admit as you stretch. You take a deep breath and sprint across what was your back yard. You slide into a crouch as you near the wall and peek through the busted window. It looks largely as you left it, but several items are arranged on your table as if under inspection. You reach through the empty pane and slide the frame up and out of your way before crawling in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the lights off you take two duffle bags from your closet and fill one partially with clothes and a small solar charger. Leaving the empty bag by the window you grab a few books from a shelf, where you find an old file of medical records. You shove the books in the bag and are about throw away the files when you hear the telltale click of a pistol behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put your hands up. Then turn around, slowly,\" you comply and are greeted by none other than Officer Jenny. \"Ethan? You're still alive?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you could call it that,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you come back?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug nonchalantly, \"Forgot a few things. So who called me in? It was Sharon wasn't it? She always was a bitch,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you do it Ethan? It'd been so long, you were doing so well,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know full well I can't control it,\" you respond \"It's completely involuntary,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why don't you just come quietly, we can get the charges dismissed on insanity,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I've got somewhere to be,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? You've been in the forest for two days, who could you have possibly made a commitment with?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't believe me if I told you,\" you smirk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay enough bullshit, you're under arrest,\" she takes a slow step towards you. \"You have the right to remain silent,\" Jenny is extremely cautious as she approaches, she saw the results of most of your assault cases so she knows what you're capable of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a quick step towards her making her flinch and raise her gun. \"Nanuk,\" you suddenly find yourself back in the forest and hear two gunshots from your house. \"She tried to shoot me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You practically threatened her, I can't say I'm surprised,\" Nanuk voices his thoughts as you struggle not to vomit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you're right, anyways the next place I need to hit is the refinery on the south side of town,\" you slip the medical files you'd been holding into your bag, it wouldn't be good to leave information about yourself just lying around after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the sickening sensation you agree that teleportation would be the safest mode of transportation, especially now that the police are probably combing the area, so you steel yourself and give Nanuk the go ahead. Once again the universe moves around you, and you find yourself on the roof of the refinery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure but it seemed less severe than the previous time, maybe you're getting accustomed to it? Regardless you still feel sick and take a moment to shake it off. Once you're feeling better, you locate the roof access hatch and heave it open. It only gets checked once a month, so it's practically rusted shut and groans loudly. Setting the latch so it won't close by itself, you climb down the rickety ladder into the facility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's strikingly dark without the glow of molten metal, but you've been working here for years, you know where you're going. Your fist stop is the equipment storage room, where you grab a fireproof suit, gloves, and a face mask. Cramming the suit and gloves into your already packed bag you settle for just wearing the mask. You move on to the actual smithing area and strap on a tool belt. You slip as many of the tools as you can into its loops, but you have no choice but to simply carry a few. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to only take the essential ones and make any others you might need later. With your load lightened, you make your way back to the rooftop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get everything you need?\" Nanuk asks as you climb through the hatch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's too much to carry without that second bag, I'll just have to make a few of them once the forge is operational,\" you adjust the strap of your duffel bag \"Let's head back, the police are probably out in force by now,\" you take one last look at the town you grew up in before the two of you disappear into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the street laying in a ditch a man leans away from the scope of his rifle, \"He's escaped, teleported away,\" he speaks into the radio strapped to his vest. \"Copy that, returning to command,\" taking a pokeball from his waist he calls out a Pidgeot and is swept up into the sky.</span></div></div>",

It's still dark, and there are only a few Pok\u00e9mon moving about. You relish the feeling of not being the center of attention for a moment before adjusting the bag hanging from your shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Mira's probably expecting me back in her room. Thanks for helping me out Nanuk,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was my pleasure,\" the psychic type responds with a slight bow. \"I hope we get the chance to work together again in the future,\" you nod and part ways, heading back to Mira's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou part the purple vines, and announce your presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mira? I'm back,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan?\" A sleepy mumble comes from the bed across the room, followed by a yawn. \"How'd it go?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too bad, ran into a little trouble at my house but nothing Nanuk and I couldn't handle,\" you drop your spoils on your sleeping bag and take a seat next to it leaning against the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, trouble? What kind of trouble,\" Mira questions, now wide awake and leaning over the edge of her bowl-like nest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone must've seen me sneak inside, and called the police. They sent someone who knows me. Long story short, they know I'm still alive. But that's all they know. Where I am, what I'm doing, and who's helping me are all still a mystery,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's not too bad I suppose,\" Mira says slowly, \"It could've been much worse, and you got what you needed right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" you pat the bag \"clothes, tools, books for reference, and this,\" you pull out the solar charger. \"A charger for my phone. I didn't want to lose any of my music,\" you explain. \"Now I just need a forge and I have a few ideas we'll need to talk about, but we can do that tomorrow, I need some sleep,\" You pull your shirt over your head and slip out of your jeans before curling up in your sleeping bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you don't want to sleep in the bed? It's way more comfy than the floor,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure,\" you reply quickly, not wanting to get caught up in her word games. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww that's too bad, I was hoping for some company,\" you can almost hear her mischievous smile as she teases. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to sleep, leave me alone,\" fortunately you're quite tired after the days adventure and you drift off quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke slowly to a rich herbal scent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning,\" Mira says brightly as you sit up, \"tea?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, tea would be great thanks,\" you reply as you pull on some clean clothes. Your back pops loudly as you stand up getting Mira's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you're sleeping in the bed tonight,\" she states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you please just stop, it's not funny,\" you groan as you take a seat across from her, accepting the cup of tea she pours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not joking, your back is going to hurt if you keep sleeping on the floor, and there's plenty of room,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sleeping bag-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't lie to someone who can read your mind,\" Mira interrupts you with a flat tone, \"Your back hurts. Now I don't like searching through your head so just tell me why you're so against sleeping in my bed,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to draw as little attention  to myself as possible, walking around smelling like you is only going to draw more attention to me and add fuel to the rumors,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? Who cares about the rumors?\" Mira counters<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care about the rumors, I care that they make it harder for me to just live and work quietly,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't work at all if you're tired and in pain,\" she sighs and rubs her forehead, \"I didn't want to do this but you're so stubborn. As the alpha, I'm ordering you to sleep in the bed tonight,\" she folds her arms and glares at you with all the authority she has. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grind your teeth, there's no way for you to wriggle your way out of it now, \"Fine,\" you growl, glowering at the table. As much as you hate it, you can't ignore a direct order. This is her pack and you are her subordinate now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I didn't want to do it, but you wouldn't be able to work like that,\" she leans close to you, \"I am glad to hear that your issues weren't that you were opposed to sleeping with me,\" your head snaps up to meet her gaze. She's smiling, obviously trying to defuse the situation, but it just adds fuel to the fire. Gritting your teeth even harder you feel your grip tighten on your cup until it shatters, flinging small pieces of ceramic everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira yelps and falls back off her stool. You remain sitting and focus on the pain in your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't lose control,\" you repeat in your head until you feel the rage subside. \"Mira, please stop making jokes like that. I can't handle it anymore,\" you don't wait for a response, instead beginning to pull the shards of ceramic from your palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! You're just going to make them worse!\" Mira intervenes and begins pulling the pieces out with telekinesis, once she has most of the shards out she speaks again, \"I'm sorry, I was just trying to lighten the mood. I didn't think you'd react like that,\" you twitch as she pulls out a particularly deep fragment, \"I'll ease up on the teasing, but you're still sleeping in the bed,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah,\" once your hand is free of the ceramic you wrap it in some gauze from your first-aid kit, making sure it can still move freely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure you keep it clean, an infection would be really bad. Now about your workspace, what will you need?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll need a small room, definitely not in the tree, and a forge,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not in the tree?\" Mira mumbles \"Is the risk of a fire really that high?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, there'll be open flame and sparks, so I think in the caves would be best. If we can flatten out the floor of one of the chambers and create a few vents it'd be perfect,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you would need help with that,\" she taps her chin with her wand a few times. \"There are a few ground types who would be able to help, but I can only spare one at the moment,\" she closes her eyes for a moment. \"Alright I've called them. They'll be here in a moment, I'll let you pick who you think is best suited for the job,\" Sure enough it's only a few minutes before two Pokemon enter the room. The first is tall and imposing with thick grey skin and a large spiral patterned horn. The second is shorter with thick brown and red fur and metal claws. A Rhydon and an Excadrill. You were about to choose the Excadrill, when you noticed its expression: disdain. It would appear that Excadrill severely dislikes you. While Excadrill is definitely better suited for the task, it's clear hostility makes you hesitant. In contrast Rhydon seems to be largely indifferent to your humanity. Excadrill would be able to complete the task in less time but there would likely be a good deal of friction between the two of you. While it would take longer with Rhydon but probably be easier overall.</span></div></div>",

If you want them to accept you, or at least tolerate you, you'll have to prove your worth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excadrill, you're better suited to this,\" the ground and steel type glowers at you, clearly against helping you in any way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oho, an interesting choice Ethan,\" You're not sure if Mira is praising you or not so you just ignore it. \"Gurren, you'll assist Ethan in creating an adequate space for him to work,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well Alpha,\" the voice is gruff but feminine, answering one of your unspoken questions. You grab your tool-belt, a hammer, and a heavy wedge. Slipping the tools into the belt you cinch it securely around your waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready whenever,\" Gurren grumbles but accompanies you to the caves. You take a few minutes to select an appropriately sized chamber and describe what you need to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm only helping you because Alpha asked me to,\" she states firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine,\" you respond calmly \"As long as you're helping,\" you pull  out the wedge and hammer and start chipping away at the stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" She asks with an incredulous tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting started,\" you respond dryly as pieces of the iron rich stone fall to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't make any progress like that,\" she points out with a tone of superiority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not just going to sit around doing nothing. You're here to help, not do it for me,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be better for you to do nothing than get in the way,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you work on that side I won't be in the way,\" you respond calmly, hiding your irritation. The only response you get is a hideous scraping sound. Gurren has started smoothing out the opposite wall, but seems to be making as much noise as possible. You grit your teeth and endure it, you can't allow yourself to be bothered so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Gurren's help it doesn't take long to get the room to the appropriate size, and you start on the floor. It's going well enough until you ask her to create a small pit in the center of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me what to do,\" came the instant response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not telling you to do anything, I'm asking,\" you pinch the bridge of your nose, \"Fine, I don't need any more help, you can go,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I leave who's going to dig your little pit,\" she asks with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will,\" you reply simply driving your wedge into the ground to mark the center. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll take you days by yourself,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll dig for days,\" you say simply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with you?\" Gurren shouts, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with me? What's wrong with you?\" You snap, \"I've done nothing to you or anyone here  so why do you hate me? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're trying to take Alpha away, we won't let you,\" she states with a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if I could force her to come with me, and there's no way I could force her to do anything, where would I go?\" You throw out your arms, \"I'm wanted, for murder. If I went back I'd probably be executed, and even if I wasn't they'd take Mira away, so it'd be a waste of time,\" you pause, \"Your hate is groundless, and it'll consume you slowly. You should let go of it,\" you turn back to the hole and resume chipping away at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you know? What could you know about hate, living a comfortable life in your city. Everything made easy and peaceful while we struggle out here to survive. Alpha is the only reason we're able to live as well as we do. We won't let you ruin our home,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You actually think that my life was easy just because I lived in a town? I've been suffering for a decade, sure I had food and shelter, but I lived in constant fear,\" you jab a finger in her face, \"You've got no idea what it's like to know that you could go off the rails at any time and seriously hurt or even kill innocent people around you. I had to live like that for eleven years, and three days ago it happened, I killed a man in my rage,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate you because you humans are the source of everything wrong with the world,\" Gurren states with a venomous tone. You lift the front of your shirt to expose the massive scars on your torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got these because of Mira. She led me out into the woods and left me for dead. I was almost ripped in half, nobody could blame me for hating her. I had to get an immediate transfusion of Primape blood, it fucked up my brain. She is the cause of everything wrong with my life, but I stopped hating her years ago,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcadrill recoils at the sight of your scars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could you survive wounds like that? How could you forgive someone for causing that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't survive, I died and was resuscitated, and I haven't forgiven Mira. I've just stopped hating her. Hate is like poison, it kills you from the inside,\" you turn back to the shallow pit you're trying to dig only for Gurren to push you aside and clear the space out in just a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get the wrong idea, I haven't accepted you yet, it's just that Alpha wouldn't be happy if I left before the job was done,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you return to the task of building the forge. A small circular pit with short walks erected around it, to be filled with charcoal. You had Gurren leave a small hole in the side to allow for a set of bellows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are bellows?\" She asks as you take a break, she <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bellows are a kind of air pump. They force more air into the fire so it burns hotter. It'd be much harder to keep a forge at the right heat without one,\" you plan to make a simple foot operated bellows, so your hands wouldn't be too occupied to work the forge itself, and you could still regulate the temperature. \"Need some leather,\" you mumble to yourself as you plan. With a shake of your head, you redirect your focus onto the forge, the short walls are cemented with clay and would harden after being heated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with the forge you move onto the next task: making charcoal. It's pretty simple, you just need to burn wood until it's completely carbon. Charcoal burns hotter than wood, allowing the forge to reach temperatures that can soften metals enough to be worked with. First things first though, you'll need wood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's it Gurren. Now I just need some wood and I can get started,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you need ore?\" The steel and ground type asks amicably. In the past few hours the two of you had come to better terms with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already have it. Most of the stone we cut away is iron ore, so I've got plenty for now,\" Gurren nods in understanding, stands up, and dusts herself off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you'll need my help again, so don't be afraid to ask,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I will,\" you offer your hand and after a moment she shakes it, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a hard worker, that'll be enough for most of us to accept you, so just keep it up and you'll be part of the pack in no time,\" she gives you an unexpected grin and heads out of the cave. After taking a final look at the room, you do the same, and head back to Mira's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira is sitting at her table sipping from a cup of tea when you walk in, \"How much of that do you drink?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not THAT much,\" she says defensively, pulling the cup closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, anyway the room is ready, I just need a bellows and charcoal,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bellows? What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a tool to keep the fire burning at the right temperature, it's essentially a bag between two wooden planks that gets squeezed together to force air into the forge. The issue is going to be finding an airtight bag,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not just have a fire type regulate it for you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd probably be too exhausting for a normal fire type. They'd need to be constantly monitoring and adjusting the temp, possibly for hours,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why wouldn't you get tired doing that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't be using nearly as much energy, I'd just be pressing down with my foot,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if it was an extraordinary fire type?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they want to try I'd welcome the help,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, starting tomorrow I'll be helping you personally,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you have things you need to take care of?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do both,\" she says confidently, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it's a good idea,\" you voice your concerns, \"You're already practically bending over backwards for me, any more would be too much. I know you don't think so, but I'm sure the pack will. I can't get preferential treatment, it'd seem like I was exploiting you,\" She almost seems to pout for a moment, before acknowledging that you're correct. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't show favoritism, alright, but I'll at least be stopping by to check on you,\" she asserts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, probably,\" you submit to her demands, knowing she wouldn't back down any further. Seeming satisfied Mira returns to her tea, taking a short sip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you been to the spring yet?\" Mira asks, \"You should go today, you're covered in dirt and you smell,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I've been working all day, it's normal to smell,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but I'd prefer you bathe before we share a bed,\" you don't respond, you had nearly forgotten the events of that morning after all the progress you had made. \"Let's go together,\" Mira gets off her stool and grabs your hand.</span></div></div>",

It's fairly spacious and the center is filled with circular pools, the largest of which could fit twenty people comfortably while the smallest wouldn't even hold a child. Several of the pools are occupied so you head over to one of the smaller pools and pull off your shirt, but before you can remove your pants something gives you a shove. You tumble into the pool, luckily it's not deep but you bash your knee on the bottom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt of pain, you stand up, the water reaching your stomach. At the edge are two Pok\u00e9mon: a Vigoroth and a Dewott, both laughing madly. Your blood boils but you keep an even tone, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you push me?\" You cross your arms and remain in the pool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a warning human, get out of here,\" the Vigoroth threatens, \"Or you'll regret it,\" with a final laugh, the two leave and you allow yourself to calm down. You can see Mira near the entrance to the chamber, her fur bristling. She's clearly about to confront the two troublemakers, you gave her a wave and signal for her to stop. Still enraged she makes her way over to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you stop me?\" She snarls, \"They hurt you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, it's just a bruise, and I'm not just going to hide behind you. If they have a problem with me I'll deal with it personally, they'll never respect me if you fight my battles,\" you lean over the edge of the pool, allowing the hot water to soothe your body. \"This feels nice,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you relax, a soft touch on your shoulder jolts you out of your calm and you practically throw yourself away from the contact. Unfortunately being half submerged in the pool greatly limits your mobility and you don't really manage to put any space between you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your chagrin, once you get a look at the invader of your personal space, it's one of the Lucario twins you'd encountered the day before, but which one?</span></div></div>",

You should relax,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return to your position against the edge of the pool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not gonna happen, at least not until nobody wants to hurt me,\" You  turn and slide into a sitting position, leaving only the top half of your head above the water. It's almost painfully hot, but it succeeds in relieving some tension from your muscles. As you allow the heat to soothe your body Mira slips into the water next to you, but due to her height the water is just a little too deep for her to stand. When you make a move to help her she holds herself up with Psychic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" she holds out a clump of what looks like wax, \"Soap, made from Combee wax and herbs,\" once again you're impressed by how civilized Mira's pack is. You take the soap and clean the exposed parts of your body. As you move to rinse yourself off Kara gets a good look at your chest,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Arceus,\" she covers her muzzle, \"Th-those wounds!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got them a long time ago, don't worry about it,\" you dismiss her reaction, after all it's a pretty normal response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" She asks stepping closer to see the full extent of the damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zangoose,\" you reply simply, trying to avoid the topic. You slip out of your shorts, making sure your lower body is concealed underwater, and quickly clean the rest of your body. When you finish you pull your soaked shorts back on, still underwater, and just allow yourself to soak in the hot water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan, let me rub your shoulders, it'll help you relax,\" Kara offers after a minute or two. You're still slightly wary of the Lucario, but she's been amicable and with Mira right here trying anything would be foolish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" you turn to show her your back. She wastes no time, starting to knead out the knots and considerable stress you've built up recently. Kara begins to use more pressure as she goes on, so much that it almost hurts but still feels good. Her touch softens after a moment but becomes burning hot. Hotter even than the water in the spring, and she's pressing into your skin. You tense up and grit your teeth, only to get a soft smack on the back of your head,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Loosen up, this won't work if your this tense,\" grudgingly you allow your muscles to relax, and Kara continues her touch is still burning hot but it doesn't hurt, it just spreads through your body easing your aches and relieving stress you didn't know you had. When she finishes you're so relaxed you almost fall asleep right there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara gives your shoulder a shake to make sure you don't and leans against the edge of the pool beside you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't fall asleep, we wouldn't want you to drown,\" she's joking but you know it's a real risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay,\" you assure her, \"just haven't been relaxed like this in a long time,\" you admit with a grin. Mira isn't in the pool so you assume she went back to her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you mind returning the favor?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-sure, but I have no idea what I'm doing,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll do fine,\" Kara assures you as she sits in your lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you-? Shouldn't you just lean against the wall?\" You try to lift her up but she's far heavier than you'd have thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is fine, it'll be easier for both of us,\" you can't see her face but you know she's smirking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mira put you up to this, didn't she,\" it wasn't a question, you had no doubts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No,\" she said in the most sarcastic voice she could muster. You grumble but start rubbing the Lucario's shoulders. Starting with just circular rubbing you slowly begin kneading the firm muscle that comes from constant training. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continue to work her shoulders over, Kara groans appreciatively and leans into your touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you didn't know what you were doing,\" she says, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't,\" you tell her, \"I've never done anything like this before,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liar,\" she grunts as you hit a sensitive spot, \"This feels so good,\" after another minute of your ministrations she's practically putty in your hands, unable to hold herself up she leans back onto your chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's enough,\" she pants, \"You don't need to make armor and weapons, just do that. Everyone will accept you real quick,\" She's breathless and has a hazy look in her eyes accompanied by a small smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, right as if most of them would even let me touch them,\" you slip an arm under her arms and the other under her legs. With a heave you're able to lift her up out of the water in a princess carry. She lets out a small yelp in surprise and blushes heavily. You set her on the edge of the pool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get some sleep, I've got a lot of work to do tomorrow,\" you climb out of the steaming water. You grab your shirt from where you'd dropped it and head back to Mira's room. When you get out of the caves you see it's already dark, so you pick up your pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira's room is lit by a few candles and Mira is propped up in her bed reading one of the books you had brought from your home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" she waves you over, \"Can you do stuff like this?\" She points out an image of a crown, \"It's so beautiful,\" it is beautiful, solid gold with seven peaks and studded with rubies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I could make one, but it would be made of iron, and that one is made of gold. It wouldn't be very pretty, and we don't have any rubies,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" she thinks for a moment, \"Why would anyone use iron when you could use gold?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gold is a pretty weak metal, it melts easily and it'll bend. It's no good for armor or weapons. It looks good and it conducts electricity really well, but that's it, plus it's really heavy. That crown probably weighs like thirty pounds,\" as you explain the demerits of gold you grab a dry pair of shorts from your bag and slip out of your still dripping pair. You've slipped on one of the legs when you hear a stifled giggle. You hastily finish getting dressed and turn back to Mira. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's holding the book up so you can't see her face. You grab the book by its spine and snap it shut. Mira's cheeks are bright red and she can't seem to meet your gaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" You ask with a sinister tone, \"Satisfy your curiosity?\" Her blush deepens and she nods almost imperceptibly, \"Good, don't do it again,\" she nods again and you drop the book on the stack with the others. You squat to grab your sleeping bag and a small object rolls out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Mira asks as you pick it up,\"  you hesitate but answer,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your pok\u00e9ball,\" you stare at it for a second \"I should break it,\" you pop it open and prepare to tear it apart at the hinge, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Mira interrupts you,</span></div></div>",

She cringes at your warning, but smiles warmly as she holds the ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you still had it,\" she mumbles, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me either. I doubt it even works anymore,\" you drop the sleeping bag in Mira's bed and climb in,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Mira deadpans, raising an eyebrow, \"you're bringing that into the bed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes really, I told you, having your scent all over me is gonna cause me no end of problems.

I am a fire type after all,\" with a snap of her fingers the candles all go out and she curls up to sleep. You roll over as well and the two of you quickly fall asleep back to back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up Mira has somehow managed to drape herself over you in her sleep. Through the window you can see the sun rising over the horizon, so you gently shake her awake. With a yawn she sits up and stretches, allowing you to do the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stretch is interrupted by a pulse of pain in your knee. You slip out of the sleeping bag and frown at the sight. It's an ugly purple and slightly swollen. You gingerly put some weight on it before standing up fully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain persists as a dull throb, but it's very manageable, barely a distraction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That looks like it hurts, do you want to get it checked out?\" Mira pokes at it with her wand, \"and how's your hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do that,\" you swat the stick away, \"It's fine. Just a bruise,\" you pull away the bandages on your hand, the small cuts have all stopped bleeding and started to scab, \"and my hand will heal,\" as you re-wrap it, Mira sets out a few cups and some fruit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let you use another cup, just don't break it,\" she giggles at your expense. You grab the cup, which Mira fills with tea, and a Razz berry. The spicy berry goes well with the earthy tea, but you're still hungry. As if on cue a Medicham parts the curtain of vines, carrying a wooden plate stacked with slices of steaming fish. After placing the plates between you and Mira, Medicham bows and exits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly take a couple of pieces for yourself to sate your hunger. You hadn't had any real protein in days. It was confounding that many wild Pok\u00e9mon could survive off of berries alone. You put these thoughts aside as you dig into the flaky flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you doing today?\" Mira asks as you finish your meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to make some things for the forge, a grindstone, an anvil, and some bellows.

I'll also need the help of a specific Pok\u00e9mon, I saw a Leavanny my first day here. I need their help to make this work,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What even are bellows?\" Mira asks as she takes another piece of fish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bellows force air into the forge, you use it to control the heat of the fire. Originally they were a pair of wooden paddles with a leather pouch in between that has a nozzle somewhere. Thats how I'll have to make them. When the paddles are compressed air is forced out of the nozzle. I'll fit the nozzle to a hole I had Gurren leave in the fire pit and I'll operate it with my foot,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's going to be pretty hard isn't it?\" Mira asks as she finishes off her fish, \"and why do you need a Leavanny specifically?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not as bad as it sounds,\" you reassure her. \"Leavanny make clothes out of their thread right?

I'd really like to avoid all that,\" having eaten your fill you step away from the table and stretch your shoulders, eliciting a sharp pop. \"Let's get started,\" you grab your survival knife from the backpack and pull it out if the sheath. The blade is slightly more dull than you'd have liked but it would have to do. You re-sheath the blade and tuck it into your waistband. \"I need a few sturdy pieces of wood, do you have any in storage?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure we do, I'll have Bishop take you to the storerooms,\" she closes her eyes to summon them telepathically, \"What did you think of him?

Yeah, he seems reliable,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, he'll probably end up helping you quite a bit,\" Mira smiles, \"I'm glad you're finding your place here, I just wish the rest could see you the way I do,\" she leans on her paws a slight pout on her muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how do you see me?\" A strange expression crosses her face momentarily, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you as, </span></div></div>",

I'm ready, so let's get moving, I'll see you later Mira,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a nice day!\" She calls as you head out, waving happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBishop leads you down into the caves below the tree, past your forge and to a small unassuming passage. He makes sure the two of you are alone and pulls you into a small side room. Facing away from you he begins speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to talk, Ethan. It's about Alpha. She'll be going into heat soon and there's a few things you should know,\" he paces as he speaks, clearly uncomfortable \"Female Pok\u00e9mon emit powerful pheromones while they're in heat, I don't know if they'll affect you or not but it's possible. Secondly she'll probably seek a lot of physical contact,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait wait, why are you telling me this?\" You interrupt, \"I'm not interested in her. Her being in heat shouldn't change anything,\" he sighs and rubs his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You spend more time with her than anyone else. Not to mention she clearly cares for you, and I saw the way she was looking at you when I walked in. I think she's already feeling it's effects,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want me to do,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't hurt her,\" he grabs your shoulder in an iron grip, his eyes narrow, \"If you hurt her, I'll hurt you,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a growl you drive your elbow into Bishops chest, knocking him off balance. You grab his neck with your free hand and shove him against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've made it clear to her that we are just friends, alright?\" You punctuate your statement with repeated pressure to his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright,\" he lets out a chuckle. \"You're lucky you aren't strong enough to hurt me,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you're lucky I didn't really lose it,\" you pull away \"you'd have to kill me, and I don't think your dark type would protect you from Mira's wrath,\" silence hangs in the room as you point dramatically at the sword blade Pok\u00e9mon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh..ha...Hahaha,\" bishop starts laughing and after a moment you join in, \"You're insane, you're probably right, but you're still insane,\" he forces out through the laughter as you lean against the wall,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess I am,\" the two of you allow your laughing to wind down, \"I guess we should get started,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure. You needed wood right?\" Bishop leads you up a few levels to an expansive room full of clay pots, barrels, and shelves. \"This is where we keep most of our supplies: wood, water, herbs, it's probably here,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, is there a saw?\" Bishop extends the blades on his gauntlets with a smirk, \"Oh,\" you heft a section of log from a shelf, \"Then cut here, here, and here,\" you direct the dark type to carve two planks of wood. Shaped like spades both sport a handle and half of a hinge, the only difference being the hole in the center of one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you need these for anyway?\"  Bishop asks, examining one of the boards as you pick up some of the excess wood and start carving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These will be a set of bellows for the forge,\" you explain as you whittle away at the piece you picked up. \"It's an essential piece of equipment. Now we just need the pouch,\" you trail off, focusing on the carving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's all this!\" You flinch as a voice erupts behind you, nearly dropping your knife. \"Look at this mess! Wood chips, everywhere!\" You turn to see a fuming Alakazam, \"What are you doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm carving,\" you're somewhat at a loss for words, too surprised to get angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well why are you doing it here? Do you have any idea how hard it is to keep this place clean and organized?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Archie, we'll clean it up,\" Bishop intervenes. Grumbling to himself, Archie walks off around a corner and returns with a broom, \"I'd better not find even a splinter when you're done,\" shoving the broom into your hands he stalks back off between the shelves and out of earshot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Archibald, he can be a bit irritable, but there's no one better at keeping inventory,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" you shake your head and hand your carving to Bishop, \"Finish this for me would ya? It needs to be a straight rod,\" you sheath your knife and begin sweeping up the wood chips. As you're finishing up, a voice draws your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bishop, are you here?

I can say without doubt that this is, in my opinion, the best I've ever written. Thank you for reading my story, and especially thank you to those who have reviewed my works, your kind words have been a blessing in a difficult time. Without any more sappy nonsense from me the next chapter:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We warned you,\" the Dewott states, \"You didn't listen,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBishop steps forward, placing himself between you and the pair of aggressors. While Taylor hurries out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now I'm warning you,\" he says calmly, \"leave,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" Vigoroth cuts in, \"not while he's still here. He's a threat to the entire pack. He's just waiting for a chance to call other humans to enslave us. Well I see through you! And I won't let you!\" he works himself into a frenzy as he speaks, spittle flying from his mouth, paws slamming on the stone floor to punctuate his words, before bodily hurling himself at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBishop has no trouble simply slapping him out of the air as he gets close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're actually protecting him? Traitor!\" Bishop quivers with rage at that remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Traitor? You're the traitors, defying  Alphas' orders like this,\" he thunders, gesturing imperiously, \"Ethan is a close friend of Alpha, and a part of this pack,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is a human, I will never ever accept him as one of us,\" he glares at you, \"Coward, you're just hiding behind him,\" you respond with a single raised finger. The meaning is lost on him however and he continues his ranting, \"too scared to fight. I guess that's to be expected from a human,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have anything else to say?\" You ignore the Vigoroths taunts and address the Dewott who has remained silent after his initial declaration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you leave now we won't hurt you,\" he offers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leaving isn't really an option for me at this point,\" you stroke your chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I gave you a chance,\" he sighs and draws one of his two scalchops, water flowing from the edge, forming a blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a second he closed the distance between you and was swinging for your neck. Fortunately for you Bishop was able to intercept the attack, deflecting it up and away from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't even have a chance to draw your knife as Vigoroth charges you from the side. Claws meant for your eyes slice through your hair as you stumble away, heart pounding. The second strike hits home in your stomach, driving the air from your lungs and you to your knees. You had thought you'd been hit hard, you'd fought Pok\u00e9mon before, but never like this, with your life on the line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel it coming on, the rage. Your blood boiling, the air you breathe frozen. The pounding of your heart made it hard to think and so easy to let go. With a primal roar you black out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBishop had never seen anything like it. A human fighting like that? Before he would've said it was impossible, but Ethan was full of surprises. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scream that pierced his ears was nothing short of hideous, like pure hate made sound, and the way he fought? Merciless. Any human would surely have fallen under the force of such blows. Vigoroth however, was putting up an admirable resistance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarsh punches and brutal kicks thrown by the berserk human had only minor effect on the normal-type. Ignoring defense completely Ethan threw himself into the fight with a disturbing vigor, yelling and screaming. The multitude of cuts and bruises he received seemed only to drive him further into his rage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll present had stopped to watch the brutal melee. Too horrified to allow it to continue Bishop moves to separate the two, receiving a heavy punch to the face and the full attention of the bloodied human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That actually hurt,\" Bishop states incredulously as he rubs his jaw. Ethan snarls and clenches his now bleeding and skinned fist tighter, before taking another wild swing at his friend. \"You've got good power, but no control,\" the dark type continues as he neatly sidesteps the punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreaming furiously the man pulls back for another massive swing only for his legs to be swept cleanly out from under him. Grasping his arm and twisting it behind his back Kara immobilizes the raging human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could hear you all the way upstairs, what are you doing?\" She asks, practically shouting in the prone mans ear. The only response is another yell, just as angry, but clearly pained. \"What's gotten into you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He went wild when these guys attacked us,\" Bishop informs her \"He did mention that he could lose control when he gets angry. Ugh, he hits really hard for a human,\" he continued, rubbing his jaw. Squatting down he takes a closer look at the struggling human. Now that he wasn't trying to kill him he could see the raised veins on the side of his forehead and the dialation of his eyes. Those same eyes were constantly flicking back and forth searching for a way out, but focused on Bishop as he came closer. A feral snarl warned him to stay back but pinned down as he was there was nothing he could do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's completely out of it, he doesn't recognize me at all,\" Bishop gets back onto his feet, \"What should we do with him?\" Kara pulls Ethan slightly off the ground and he starts thrashing trying to free himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's have Alpha come take a look at him,\" Kara pushes him back into the ground. \"No hurry, he won't be able to get away from me,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea, but first,\" he turns to Vigoroth and Dewott with a dark look on his face, \"You two. If you attack Ethan again I promise you will regret it. Now get out of here,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not gonna turn them over to Alpha?\" Kara asks, surprised, as the two made their escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not this time, it's more important that we get him back to normal. I'm going to get Alpha, at the very least she should be able to calm him down,\" He ran off leaving Kara to hold the raging human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you huh?\" The Lucario mumbles, mostly to herself, \"Why are you like this? Is it related to that huge scar on your chest?\" His only response is to keep growling, apparently unable to understand, much less explain himself. \"Yeah that's what I thought you'd say,\" leaning back slightly the fighting type shifts her weight to a more comfortable position and lets out a sigh, only to have to throw her weight back onto Ethan as he began to thrash anew. \"Stop struggling, Arceus!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one hand behind his back in a very restrictive position Ethan's movements were severely limited, but not completely stopped. Moving his free hand under his chest, the human shoves himself up off the ground with a feral scream. The huge push takes Kara off guard and throws her off Ethan's back allowing him to roll to his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara is knocked off her feet and similarly rolls into a ready stance. Ethan charges in but gets thrown easily to the ground. Pressing her paws together and drawing them apart with a flourish Kara creates a bone staff and swipes at Ethan's legs as he attempts to rise again, sending him crashing back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he can get to his feet Kara presses the end of her staff into his neck,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay down,\" she growls, \"you're being very annoying,\" Ethan lashes out with his leg striking the Lucario on hers. Snarling and at the limit of her patience, Kara swings the staff at the offending appendage, receiving a pained yelp from the downed human. \"Oh Arceus, I'm sor-,\" she began only for Ethan to tackle her and try to slam her head into the stone floor. \"That's ENOUGH!\" With a yell Kara drives her palm into Ethan's stomach and fires off a Force Palm. The shockwave throws him clear across the room, where he slumps to the ground, unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down next to the injured human Kara gently moves him so his head is resting on her lap. \"I'm sorry you had to go through that. It must really hurt, I had to hit you seriously there at the end,\" she wiped a bit of blood from his face as she spoke, \"I can't imagine living the way you do, constantly afraid you might get set off, you're truly strong,\" she brushes a bit of stray hair from his face and leans in slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ETHAN!?\" Startled Kara jerks back from the unconscious man as Mira rushes into the room in a panic. \"WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?\" The small fire type practically blazed with power, fully prepared to annihilate the fighting type. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He got free and he just wouldn't stay down so I had to knock him out,\" Mira seethes for another few moments before speaking,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll discus your methods later, is he alright?\" The fire fox kneels down beside the sleeping man and wrings her paws nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara rubs the side of your head smiling gently \"He's asleep now, we'll have wait for him to wake up,\" however her smile doesn't go unnoticed by Mira. \"What are you smiling about? You could have seriously hurt him,\" Mira fumes,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-i don't really know, I like having him here like this, it feels,\" she pauses, \"it feels right,\" she finishes with a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScowling, Mira floats Ethan into the air and towards the door, \"Get someone to clean up in here, then come see me in my room, we need to talk in private,\" </span></div></div>",

No matter how ferocious or tenacious, he was still only human, and humans are fragile. She had to make sure he was safe. Safe from the two who had attacked him and safe from that harlot Kara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re together again after all this time, I won\u2019t let her get in between us,\u201d she declares under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to come between you,\u201d Mira jerks in her seat almost falling, \u201cI can have a relationship with him that doesn\u2019t jeopardize yours,\u201d the aura Pok\u00e9mon steps into the room. \u201cI just want to be friends,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saw the way you were looking at him,\u201d Mira sneers, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the look of a friend,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould it matter if it wasn\u2019t? Your relationship with him isn\u2019t romantic either, so what would be the problem?\u201d Kara knew what the problem would be, she could feel Mira\u2019s anger reach the boiling point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is mine,\u201d Mira declares through clenched teeth. Her eyes blaze with power as she stands before the larger canine, \u201cWith my authority as Alpha you are forbidden from seeing him again,\u201d Kara stands before her, unimpressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you plan on enforcing that? Are you going to spend every waking moment with him? How would you get anything done? How would he? Besides if you made such an order you would lose the respect of most of the pack,\u201d Kara crosses her arms, we follow you because we respect you. If that respect was gone who knows what would happen,\u201d Even as angry as she was Mira knew she was right, a selfish and ridiculous declaration like that would be very damaging. Her grip tightens on her wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you expect me to just let you take him from me?\u201d Mira\u2019s voice cracks, \u201cMy best friend? The one who means more to me than anyone? No, I won\u2019t let you,\u201d Kara leans down and pulls her into a hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to take him from you, I just want to be his friend,\u201d she pulls back paws on Mira\u2019s shoulders, \u201cFor now,\u201d she adds silently. \u201cOkay?\u201d After contemplating for a moment Mira reluctantly concedes,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, but just his friend,\u201d she wipes the moisture from her eyes, \u201cAnd we still need to talk about how you handled the situation in there,\u201d Mira gets back into her seat, \u201cYou could\u2019ve killed him,\u201d Kara clicks her tongue in an annoyed fashion, she\u2019d hoped Mira would forget about that,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not so weak that that would\u2019ve killed him,\u201d she says dismissively, \u201cHe\u2019s strong enough to fight a Vigoroth to a standstill,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was out of control and took Vigoroth by surprise, in a normal fight he\u2019d have lost,\u201d Mira insists, \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to blast him into the wall,\u201d Kara smirks, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re underestimating him Alpha, you didn\u2019t see him in action. If I hadn\u2019t knocked him out he might have actually been able to hurt me,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStrength aside he\u2019s still a human, they cant take real blows from Pok\u00e9mon like that. As punishment for your rash actions and endangering one of our own, I\u2019m assigning you to protect Ethan from now on,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you I didn-. W-what?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s now your responsibility to protect him from the members of our pack that want him gone. I can\u2019t be with him at all times, and as long as you don\u2019t hit him,\u201d Mira glares pointedly, \u201cYou\u2019re one of the best suited to protecting him,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wont let anyone hurt him,\u201d Kara promises,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll hold you to that,\u201d She says, \u201cNow come with me, let\u2019s see how he\u2019s doing,\u201d</span></div></div>",

Opening your eyes proves to be a mistake as you\u2019re blinded by a harsh light. Shielding your eyes you try to sit up but are gently pushed back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere am I?\u201d You finally ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re in the infirmary, you got beaten pretty badly.\u201d as your eyes adjust you can make out the shape of a small pink and cream colored Pok\u00e9mon, \u201cMy name is Joy and I\u2019ve been patching you up,\u201d the Audino claims happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour name is Joy?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, is something the matter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, just reminded me of someone,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, well sit still, I\u2019m almost finished,\u201d you comply as Joy applies a blue paste to a leaf and places it over a cut on your leg. \u201cThis is an Oran berry paste, normally I\u2019d just heal you with Heal Pulse, but I\u2019m afraid it doesn\u2019t work on humans,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d you pause, \u201cWhat exactly happened? I don\u2019t remember anything after I was attacked,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t really know the details, you were brought in here a few hours ago covered in cuts and bruises, and a particularly large one in the middle of your stomach. If it had been higher it might\u2019ve broken some ribs, so that\u2019s fortunate,\u201d She explains as she double checks the paste, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to take it easy for a few days, and try not to get in any more fights, I can\u2019t guarantee I\u2019ll be able to patch you up,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d you respond as you look around the room, it\u2019s not very large, and is mostly occupied by the table you\u2019ve been laid out on. There\u2019s a hole in the ceiling, presumably for light, and shelves across all the walls filled with earthenware pots and jars. The door, like most in the tree, is blocked by a curtain of vines which draw your attention as they\u2019re thrown aside revealing Mira and Kara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can even greet them Mira has thrown herself at you knocking you back onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re okay, I was so worried,\u201d she holds you tightly, but all you can do is yelp as she collides with your battered body, \u201cOh Arceus I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d hastily letting go, she settles for leaning over you and inspecting your wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry too,\u201d Kara stands next to the table, head bowed, paws clasped in front of her, \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting you to resist so much,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat exactly happened? I don\u2019t-\u201c  you hiss as Mira touches a particularly sensitive spot and push her paw away, \u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I wasn\u2019t there for all of it, but from what I saw, and felt,\u201d she grins, \u201cyou\u2019re exceptionally strong for a human. You were able to fight that Vigoroth to a standstill,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is not what happened,\u201d Mira interjects with a glare, \u201cYou were hurting yourself almost as much as him,\u201d she grabs your hand, \u201clook at your knuckles you nearly broke them,\u201d as she said your knuckles are skinned and swollen, with more of the Oran berry paste applied. \u201cYou can\u2019t get in another fight like that, if Bishop and Kara hadn\u2019t been there you would have died,\u201d she presses her head into your shoulder, \u201cPlease promise me you won\u2019t fight again, please?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try not to fight,\u201d you reassure her wrapping your arms around her shoulders, \u201cI don\u2019t want to get hurt either,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d she shoves your arms off and locks eyes with you, she\u2019s beginning to cry, \u201cPromise me you won\u2019t fight again,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if I get attacked? You can\u2019t just expect me to let someone just beat me up,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t need to do anything, as of today Kara will be protecting you,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d the Lucario puffs out her chest proudly, \u201cI\u2019ll be watching over you so you don\u2019t need to worry about a thing,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-you can\u2019t just expect her to drop everything and devote all her time to me, that\u2019s completely unreasonable. Besides, I thought you weren\u2019t going to be giving me any special treatment,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hardly think giving someone who has been assaulted a bodyguard is special treatment, especially since you\u2019re incapable of properly defending yourself,\u201d she adds pointedly, squeezing one of your battered hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t respond, simply because you can\u2019t. Her reasoning is sound, you don\u2019t remember but based on how your body feels, you were nearly torn to pieces in that fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, I\u2019ll be in your care Kara,\u201d when you finally respond, it\u2019s quiet and reserved, \u201cI\u2019m still in pain and exhausted, I\u2019d like to get some rest,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, alright,\u201d Mira\u2019s ears flatten and she releases her grip on your hand, \u201cThank you for treating him, Joy,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d the Audino responds and bows slightly,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKara, if he gets a single new scratch on him I\u2019ll be holding you responsible,\u201d The Lucario simply nods, \u201cand Ethan?\u201d After a moment of hesitation, Mira pulls you into a quick hug, kisses your cheek, and hurries out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, there is something between the two of you,\u201d Joy muses aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo-no there isn\u2019t, she\u2019s just not thinking clearly,\u201d you attempt to deny \u201ctell her Kara,\u201d but Kara doesn\u2019t respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aura Pok\u00e9mon is too busy glowering at the doorway to even hear what you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKara?\u201d You cautiously shake her shoulder, and she snaps out of her thoughts,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just telling Joy that there\u2019s nothing going on between Mira and I, what are you looking at?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh-um, I was looking at, uh, Alpha\u2019s aura. It\u2019s very, uh, agitated,\u201d You can tell she\u2019s lying, but if she has an issue with Mira that\u2019s none of your business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, well I\u2019m going to take a nap and then I\u2019ll probably head down to the forge,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-alright,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay back down and Kara makes herself comfortable in the corner, settling down to meditate while you rest. As you drift off you can see her sensory organs shift unnaturally, as if blown by the wind. </span></div></div>",
