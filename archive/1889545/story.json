Is he just shy or is he hiding something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four boys have been good friends with each other since high school and they're very close. You can decide whether the boys are alone on the island or whether the boys find people. Everything on the island is completely made of food. It even rains food there! You decide which boys are able to hold out and which ones eat as much food as they can!  No killing, no gore, no bursting, popping, or anything of the sort. No magic weight gain and no \"he gained 500 pounds in a day\". The food can have an addictive quality if you want it to. Please stick to the rules and the character types and most of all have fun! <br>\r\n </td>",
