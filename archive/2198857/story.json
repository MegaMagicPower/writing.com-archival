There are only a few.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Strange Object - He could have encountered a strange object that transformed him into a girl. Whether he encountered it on his own, or perhaps someone like Cinder and her team, or even Jaune's own family set him up to find it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis True Self - Unlocking his aura had a surprising effect on him. During his time in initiation or not long after his body starts to go through some changes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin's Revenge - After the events of the Emerald Forest, Cardin had done nothing to Jaune and his friends, the leader of Team JNPR thinking that he finally learned his lesson, but in reality, he was biding his time as he waited for the perfect means of getting his revenge on the blonde for messing with him, and making it so that the Arc would do whatever he wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang's fellow Partygoer - Yang wants to go out and have some fun out on the town, but sadly none of her friends are up for her kind of fun. She decides that Jaune could be fun to party with, with a few adjustments of course. Whether she decides to change him back or are there some unexpected consequences that remains to be seen.</span></div></div>",
