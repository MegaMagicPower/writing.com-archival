He needed to stay hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he began to head to the dining hall for breakfast, he heard the now familiar chime of a school bell and the voice of Monokuma \"attention students. Come down to the gym for a beary special announcement\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto knew that he had no choice but to listen, he saw the rest of the students leave the dining hall and begin to head to the gym, none of them seemed to be looking forward to this, any announcement from Monokuma was bound to be a bad one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they all arrived in the Gym, Monokuma was waiting for them all \"Ah! You're all here!\" The robot bear said happily. \"You haven't been killing each other nearly fast enough, so I prepared a new motive for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone got a nervous look on their faces, the last motive they had been given could easily force anyone into committing murder. They all braced themselves for the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will all.....swap bodies with each other!\" Monokuma said with a laugh, but everyone was silent. Not the reaction he was expecting \"well, aren't you all surprised?\" He asked, wanting some kind of response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this some kind of joke?\" Togami was the first one to speak up, clearly annoyed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Aoi spoke up after him \"Something like that is completely impossible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Khufufufufu\" Monokuma chuckled. \"Or is it? Bam!\" He shouted and suddenly everyone was blinded by a bright light. When it cleared, nothing appeared to have changed. Until they heard a girlish squeal......coming from Togami<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What dis you do to me?!' Togami's body asked, looking down at itself in shock<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoi's body on the other hand stayed calm as the current occupant assessed the situation \"How were you able to do this?\" Togami asked, Aoi's voice sounding extremely strange with his harsh tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hooooow? Who knows. Maybe it was maaagic, maybe I got a scientific remote in the mail, maaaaybe I was born with this ability. Who cares about the how! What matters is that it happened to you two, and is about to happen to all of you! Hahaha!\" Monokuma laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But wait, how would this get us to kill each other?\" Makoto asked, not fully understanding the motive<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whyyyyyy? Man, you haven't really thought ahead, have You? For 1 thing, if you kill someone while in another body, the class will have to vote for the mind that did it, not the body. So if you keep who you really are a secret....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be even harder to find the blackened!\" Makoto finished Monokuma's sentence<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well That's simple, we'll just have to announce what bodies we're in after we switch!\" Ishimaru shouted out a possible solution<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kuhuhuhu\"  Monokuma giggled again. \"Are you suuuuure that all of you would do that? What if one of you beefier people ended up in the body of weak little Chihiro, would you want to announce that to potential killers looking to get rid of you? What if someone really likes your body and wants to stay in it, would you want to tell them what body you're currently in so they can kill you and keep you from going back?\" Monokuma began to say reasons for them to not tell anyone why bodies they're in, hoping to depress everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! No fair! You already got me and Byakuya to say we were swapped by swapping us first!\" Aoi said from Togami's body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll shuffle you two back around too!\" Monokuma said before another bright light engulfed the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light cleared, Makoto could already tell that things were different. He was standing in a completely different area of the gym and his whole body felt different. He looked down to see he was in the body of..... </span></div></div>",

He did a quick check over himself, and seeing that he was wearing a dark, purple coat, boots, and most uncomfortably, a skirt, he confirmed that he was indeed in Kyoko's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced around, trying to ignore the awkwardness he felt in his new body, and saw that everyone else in the room was doing the same as him, inspecting themselves all over and looking around in confusion. He even spotted his own body, staring at its hands with an indignant expression on its face. He was about to approach it to find out who was in it before a harsh voice spoke out from the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone, calm down and listen up!\" Celeste's body gave a shout which sounded out of place coming in her voice. \"I am Kiyotaka Ishimaru, the Ultimate Moral Compass. I reccommend everyone else in this room identify themselves one by one!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if we don't?\" Hifumi, or whoever was in his body, asked with a raised eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't, then...well...\" Taka seemed to be struggling to find a good reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then not only will you be a top suspect if another murder occurs, you'll also be deemed untrustworthy by the rest of us who do decide to reveal our true identites,\" Byakuya's body said, crossing its arms. \"I'm Kyoko Kirigi, just to be clear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would imply I would ever want to spend time with any of you,\" 'Hifumi' replied sharply, before turning and trudging out of the Gym without another word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing that was the real Byakuya,\" Hina's body said. \"I'm Yasuhiro, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Hiro is in my body,\" Chihiro's voice came from behind him, presumably the real Asahina. \"Well, at least I know who is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Makoto Naegi,\" Makoto finally spoke up, somewhat nervously. He spared a glance over at Kyoko, who was giving him an odd look from behind Byakuya's glasses that he couldn't quite put his finger on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I'm Chihiro Fujisaki,\" Chihiro said weakly from Sakura's large frame. It was a surprise to see Sakura acting so timidly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright!\" Monokuma exclaimed. The ultimate students spun around to face him; in the confusion, most had forgotten he was even there. \"That's enough chit-chat for now. You can all catch up after you leave the Gym. See you soon, and don't forget to make the most of your new bodies!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he left them, cackling as he disappeared behind the desk. The students began to file out of the hall, most going their separate ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn.\" Makoto heard Taka scowl. \"Now we won't be able to get everyone to distinguish themselves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like the only way to find out who everyone else had become was to approach those who hadn't revealed themselves yet, and Makoto realised now was the perfect chance for him to do so. But, he could also spend time with someone who had identified themselves, and he would at least know who he was speaking to that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should he do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Makoto couldn't help but feel a little lost as he paced through the halls of the school. So many things that had seemed unbelievable had happened while he was here at Hope's Peak Academy, but this had to be at the top of the list. Every step reminded him that he was no longer himself, with how different Kyoko's body was from his own. He wanted to believe this was just a dream, that there was no way something like this could actually happen, but it all felt far too real for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he felt somewhat uneasy about the fact that he didn't know who everyone currently was, thanks to Monokuma forcing them out before everyone could reveal themselves, there was something else he was curious about. While he, and many others, didn't know who was in their body, thanks to him revealing himself, Kyoko knew exactly who was in her's. He couldn't help but wonder how she felt about him being in her body. Hina also knew who was in hers, but her only reaction seemed to be that she was glad to know who it was. On the other hand, when he'd revealed himself, Kyoko had just given him an odd look from across the room. What exactly was she thinking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs luck would have it, Makoto just so happened to run into Kyoko outside the dorm rooms. She appeared to be speaking with whoever was in Toko's body, but he didn't get a chance to hear what was being said before \"Toko\" retreated back into her room. Kyoko appeared to be deep in though as Makoto approached, and though he didn't really want to interrupt her train of thought, he did still want to talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hey Kyoko,\" Makoto greeted. It felt strange to hear Kyoko's voice coming out of his mouth, but he supposed it was something he'd need to get used to for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing up at him, Kyoko gave a look at appeared only slightly friendlier than the real Byakuya. \"Makoto,\" she responded with a nod. \"Did you need something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just, y'know, wanted to talk... if that's okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. If you insist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto was finding it incredibly difficult to ready Kyoko's emotions. Despite what he wanted to ask her, he decided it might be better to make a little small talk first. \"So, who was that you were talking to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have some ideas about who they might be, but not enough to say for certain. In fact, I've yet to discern who anyone else is other than those who revealed themselves in the gym.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, they're hiding who they really are?\" While Byakuya hadn't admitted who he really was, although it was still fairly obvious, Makoto had thought that everyone else was only unknown because of Monokuma ushering them out. Were some of the others really going to keep their identity a secret?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. Whoever it was just now wasn't acting like Toko, but they weren't admitting who they were either. It seems some people have taken Monokuma's words to heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Makoto let out, almost involuntarily. It couldn't be true. They weren't really hiding their identity to make it harder to find them when they killed, were they? They must have some other reason for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko frowned, likely at they way Makoto was acting. \"Was there anything else you wanted to ask me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto did his best to calm down. He supposed now was as good a time as any to ask Kyoko what she thought about all this. \"Well, um... I was just wondering, how you felt about... y'know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was somewhat awkward to say, but Kyoko didn't mince words. \"How I feel about you being in my body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko gave pause, seemingly considering what the best way to respond would be. \"Well, admittedly, it's somewhat strange seeing my body so... emotive, and unsure of itself. At the very least, you're fairly harmless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What's that supposed to mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't expect you of all people to be committing murder in my body, and you seem too timid to violate my privacy any more than Monokuma has already forced you to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?! I-I...\" Makoto's face went as red as a tomato. He hadn't even really considered that side of being inside someone else's body. He was suddenly feeling much more anxious about not knowing who was in his body, and what they might be doing with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko let out a small smirk. Makoto's reaction was somewhat amusing, even if it was coming from her own body. \"While I would have preferred one of the girls be in my body, I suspect I have nothing to worry about from you. Just...\" Kyoko hesitated for a moment, as if wondering whether she should even bring up what she was about to say, but ultimately, she followed through. \"Don't take off my gloves. I'd rather people not see what's underneath them, and that includes you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I promise.\" Admittedly, Makoto was a little curious about what lay underneath them now that she'd brought it up, but he respected her wishes. The gloves would stay on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Now, is that all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, I guess.\" While there was more he probably could have asked, Kyoko seemed somewhat busy, so he decided it could wait until later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. I'll see you around, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you,\" Makoto mumbled as Kyoko begun to walk off, most likely heading off to try and figure out who everyone was. It had been a bit weird conversing with Kyoko about this, with Kyoko looking like Byakuya and Kyoko's voice coming out of his own mouth, but he could only imagine how much stranger it must have been for Kyoko herself. The idea of conversing with his own body while someone else was inside of it seemed incredibly strange to him, and yet, he'd just made Kyoko go through with it. At the very least, she didn't seem to take issue with him being in her body, not that she had much of a say in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a little exhausted from the events of the morning, Makoto decided to return to his room to rest for a bit. There was still much to do, and so many people who's identities were still a mystery, but he needed a break for now. He reached into his pocket to pull out his room key, only to realise his mistake. He wasn't in his own body, he was in Kyoko's and her skirt lacked the pockets his own pants had had. After a little searching, he managed to find a room key inside Kyoko's jacket, but naturally, it was for Kyoko's room rather than his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto knew he'd need to go in there eventually, considering they were only allowed to sleep in the dorm rooms, and this was the only room key he owned now, but that didn't stop it from feeling like an invasion of privacy. What if there was something in her room she didn't want people seeing, but hadn't had a chance to hide it away before everyone swapped? Perhaps it would be better to leave it for now. He could have a look and see who else was around to talk to. There was still time left in the day, and although putting it off might not make it less awkward, at the very least, he could avoid it until it was necessary.</span></div></div>",

He gazed at his new hand with her long black nails in fascination. He could feel Celeste's large hair pulling on his head. It was clear that whatever Monokuma did worked, he was now in another body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around and saw that everyone else was similarly panicking and examining their new bodies. Some of them were trying to calm everyone down, but with no success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was until, the body of got on the gym stage and began talking loudly at the podium. \"Everyone, we all need to calm down and focus. Panicking won't get us anywhere. Monokuma wants us all to distrust each other. We should all say the bodies we are now in so there would be no secrets kept between us. I'll start, I am Kiyotaka Ishimaru!\" Taka said in Toko's voice. The way he command the situation and tried to calm everyone down left no doubt that he truly was the Ultimate Moral Compass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class was silent, most of them clearly considering whther or not they should speak up, Makoto broke the silence and spoke \"I'm Makoto Naegi. I don't have any real way of proving that I am though.\" Makoto said in Celeste's voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next to speak up was the body of Byakuya \"I'm Yasohiro Hagakure. If you want any proof of who I am, I can make a prediction of your future.\" Yasohiro's laid back way of speaking sounded really foreign with Byakuya's voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up was the body of Hifumi \"I'm Kyoko Kirigi, unfortunately, like Makoto, I have no real way of proving it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final person to speak up was Mondo's body \"I'm Aoi Asahina. I guess if I had to prove who I was, we could all go swimming and I can show off my techniques, but I don't know how good Mondo's body would be for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was silent as everyone waited for someone else to speak up, but unfortunately everyone stayed silent. Kiyotaka spoke up again \"Do you really want to keep who you are a secret? If you do, you won't be trusted by anyone around you. Isn't it better if we all trust each other not to keep a major secret?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you'll find that some of us kept major secrets this whole time.\" The body of Chihiro spoke up, but no one could tell who was in it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiyotaka was about to speak up again about how everyone should reveal who they are, but before he could. Kyoko in Hifumi's body spoke up. \"Alright. Everyone who hasn't revealed who they are, leave the gym. Those of us who have will stay and discuss what to do next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone complied with what Kyoko said and most left the gym. Leaving only Makoto in Celeste'a body, Kiyotaka in Toko's body, Aoi in Mondo's body, Yasohiro in Byakuya's body, and Kyoko in Hifumi's body.</span></div></div>",

Makoto thought it was a bit strange to see Hifumi's body acting so serious, but then, none of them were really acting like who they appeared to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do we do now, then?\" Makoto asked. Kyoko had asked everyone who hadn't stated their identity to leave, but he wasn't really sure how they could progress from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, obviously our first priority should be getting used to the bodies we're currently in, seeing as we'll be stuck like this until at least the next class trial.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what do mean \"at least\"?\" Hina interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monokuma is using this body swap as the motive for the next murder, but he never said he'd swap us back once it was all over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think he'd just leave us all like this?\" Taka asked. Despite him speaking with Toko's voice, her trademark stutter was nowhere to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After everything else he's put us through, it wouldn't surprise me,\" Makoto mumbled, fidgeting a little awkwardly. He wasn't exactly comfortable being in Celeste's body, seeing as he was a boy and she was a girl, but he supposed the others must all be going through something similar too. Even those who'd ended up in the body of someone the same gender as them, like Hiro, would still have differences between their usual body and the one Monokuma had put them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" Kyoko said, trying to steer the conversation back on track. \"Regardless of how long Monokuma decides to keep us like this, it's particularly important for us that we get used to this quickly. As much as I'm sure we'd love to think that another murder won't occur, I think the fact that over half of us didn't reveal our identity is enough to show that it's a definite possibility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko's words seemed to put everyone on edge, as if their circumstances hadn't done that already. After everything that had happened, Makoto wanted to stay positive, he wanted to believe that they'd all work together to try and get out of here, but Kyoko's words did ring true. If people didn't divulge their identity, it would make it more difficult to find the culprit if a murder occurred, so that fact that so many chose to hide who they were made him uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the group's unrest, Kyoko continued. \"And, if someone does decide to murder, we may be a larger target than anyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because of what Monokuma said, right?\" Hina asked. \"If someone likes our body, they might come after us so they can keep it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we've just gotta get used to these bodies and keep an eye on our old selves. Doesn't sound too bad,\" Hiro said, seemingly taking this the best of group, in line with his laid-back attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy for you to say,\" Hina grumbled. \"You got swapped with Byakuya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you got swapped with him too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I'm a girl. You and Byakuya are both boys. It'd be different if I swapped with Sakura or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I have a question,\" Makoto said, interrupting the ensuing argument. \"What are we supposed to do about our rooms?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, are we supposed to stay in our old rooms, or the rooms of who's bodies we're in now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko was the one to answer. \"I don't think it'll be possible to stay in our own rooms. You need a key to enter the dorm rooms, but the key to your room will be with whoever has your body now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right.\" Makoto hadn't really thought about all this from that angle. This wasn't just a matter of him being in someone else's body; someone else was currently walking around in his. Someone who refused to say who they were, for that matter. It was almost more unnerving than being in someone else's body himself. Almost. \"So then, we probably have the key to the room of whoever's body we're in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, the group began checking to make sure they did in fact have the key they needed. In Makoto's case, it took a while to locate, due to the lack of obvious pockets on Celeste's outfit. He eventually located it inside her jacket, alongside her e-Handbook. The others seemed to have found their's as well. Just as Kyoko had said, they all had the keys of the bodies they were stuck in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so it looks like we'll be staying in the room of whoever's body we're in,\" Taka said, trying to take charge of the discussion again. \"Now, is there anything else that needs to be discussed before we rejoin the rest of the group?\"</span></div></div>",

It seemed that every movement he took only highlighted a new difference in his body. He felt the small bounce of his chest every step along the way. However, if he had to choose between being stuck in this body forever or having another murder happen, he would choose to stay like this without a thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring his walk around the school, he noticed that very few people of the group who left the gym earlier were hanging out with other people. It seemed like everyone was paranoid that someone would take advantage of the current situation and commit murder<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fret not. No one here has enough fortitude to keep who they are a secret for more than a day\" Makoto heard the familiar voice of Chihiro say from behind him. Of course, Makoto knew that wasn't Chihiro, but someone else in their body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could tell I'm that worried, huh?\" Makoto said with a slight grin and rubbed the back of Celeste's head<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person in Chihiro's body sighed and put a hand on their hip. \"Anyone can tell from just a glance of you walking around. Hopefully a murder happens soon so that awful bear can return me to my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last sentence set Makoto off \"That won't happen! We can't let this motive drive us to murder again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChihiro's body seemed to get noticeably angry \"Simple for you to say, your body was talentless and you had no goals you were close to achieving. Whereas I have been forced out of my future by the whim of a robot bear and into this body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nListening to 'Chihiro's' tone of voice and that context clue of having a bright future, Makoto took a guess as to who was talking to him \"Byakuya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChihiro's body smirked \"Seems like even someone like you can put two and two together\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto tried a ease the tension \"heh, guess we both got stuck in girl's bodies\" he said with a chuckle<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByakuya was silent for a few seconds, as if thinking of what he should say next. \"Being in Chihiro's body has been.....enlightening to say the least\" before Makoto could speak again, Byakuya made a request \"Makoto, don't tell anyone I'm in this body. If someone found out that I was in the weakest body here....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, your secret is safe with me!\" Makoto said sternly \"but are you sure you're okay with me knowing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You? The world would sooner end than have you hurt someone\" Byakuya said with a chuckle before walking off. Makoto felt something in his last sentence, he felt trust<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto looked at a nearby clock on the wall. He still had free time before the school curfew. He wondered how he should spend it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had two options, spend time with a body whose current owner had already revealed their identity or go spend time with someone who hadn't revealed their identity yet. The person who had his attention the most was his own body, not knowing who was currently wearing his face was almost frightening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end Makoto decided to...</span></div></div>",

If he spoke to them for a bit, he might be able to figure out who they really were, like he had with Byakuya, which would be useful moving forward if they decided not to reveal it themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive out of the twelve students had revealed who they were already, namely himself, Taka, Hiro, Kyoko, and Hina. Along with that, he'd managed to figure out that Byakuya was in Chihiro's body, even if he didn't want to reveal himself to the group. That left six students still unaccounted for; Toko, Sakura, Mondo, Hifumi, Chihiro, and Celeste. The six of them were in the bodies of Taka, Hiro, Kyoko, Hina, Sakura, and himself, although he didn't yet know who was who. He'd initially considered that it might have just been one-to-one swaps, like Monokuma had done to Byakuya and Hina in his demonstration, but considering Byakuya was in Chihiro's body instead of Hiro's, that theory proved to be false.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto wondered whether he was really cut out for this task or not. Sure, he'd managed to figure out who Byakuya was, but he didn't seem to be putting in too much of an effort to hide his usual attitude. Although, considering his reasons for not revealing himself, perhaps he was simply lowering his guard around Makoto, and would hide it better in front of the others. For the others, though, he had no idea why they'd choose not to reveal themselves. Were they also afraid of becoming a target? Did they like their current body better than their old one? Or did they simply want the upper hand in this messed up game Monokuma had forced them into? He simply couldn't tell. If they had a stronger reason to hide their identity, or didn't trust him like Byakuya seemed to, then they'd probably do a better job of hiding who they really were, making it more difficult for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued to walk around the school, trying to decide which of the remaining bodies he should try to talk to, Celeste's body proved to be an ever-present distraction. He wasn't exactly sure what Byakuya had meant when he said that being in Chihiro's body had been \"enlightening\", but as far as he was concerned, every little difference between his own body and Celeste's simply served to make him feel even more uncomfortable. He knew he'd need to get used to it, though; like Kyoko had said, they were stuck like this for the foreseeable future. The others must be feeling this too, right? Perhaps he could use that to help him figure out who was who. Then again, aside from Hina, the others he'd spoken to already seemed to mask any discomfort they were feeling fairly well. Maybe the others had adapted faster than he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of his discomfort, Makoto was determined to not simply waste this time before night fell, and thus, went off in search of one of the students who had yet to reveal who they were, eventually locating the body of...</span></div></div>",

He was going to talk to his own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found his own body sitting alone in the dining hall. \"Oh, hi Makoto\" his own body greeted him. Makoto sat parallel to his own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto couldn't think of a subtle way to ease into the conversation, so he just came out and asked \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto's body just smiled \"I'm Makoto Naegi, the ultimate lucky student\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto sighed, he figured it wouldn't be as simple as just asking. Eyeing his own body,  he noticed that they didn't seem uncomfortable at all, unlike how he was feeling in Celeste's. Either they were a girl who was good at hiding how uncomfortable they were or....\"Your original body is one of the guys, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto's body only nodded in response. However, just that confirmation made Makoto's job much easier. He only knew of two guys unaccounted for. Mondo and Hifumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto asked another question, hoping that the response to this one would at least give him a hint as to which guy was in his body \"If another murder were to happen and I was the victim. Would you keep my body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto's body had a face of fear when the idea of another murder was mentioned \"I don't want anyone else to die!\" They suddenly got very meek \"but, if no one dies and Monokuma kept us like this, I wouldn't mind\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto rubbed the back of Celeste's head. The person in his body didn't seem like either Mondo nor Hifumi with that response. Neither of them were particularly meek people. Did his body lie about being one of the guys?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you be okay with keeping my body? Wouldn't you want to go back to being yourself again?\" Makoto asked, he couldn't understand why someone would want to keep his body. He could understand if it was an athletic body like Sakura or Hina's, or if it was a body with a bright future like Togami's, but why would someone want to stay as him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto's body shook their head in denial \"Your body is so much more comfortable than mine. I feel so confident, I don't need to worry about being inferior or keeping a secret!\" They expressed their joy about being Makoto<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto didn't understand, but after seeing whoever was in his own body express that much joy about being him, Makoto dropped the subject. He speant the next while talking to his own body about subject's unrelated to their new bodies. None of what they talked about led to any more clues as to who they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Makoto stood up and left the dining hall. \"Bye......Makoto\" he said, not sure as to any other way to currently refer to his own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Makoto in Celeste's body left. Chihiro in Makoto's body looked down at the table, tears visable in his eyes \"I'm sorry Makoto. I don't want to steal your life, but I feel so much better like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough upset that he couldn't figure out who was in his body, Makoto didn't give up hope. Maybe he could figure out who someone of the others were. Makoto looked at the clock to see if he still had more free time or if it was time for all the students to go to bed</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking at the clock, Makoto saw there were only a few minutes left until night time. Not enough time to talk to anyone else, if we was to abide by their self-imposed curfew. A lot of time in the day had been wasted just wandering around trying to get used to Celeste's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I should head back to my... uh, Celeste's room,\" Makoto thought aloud, remembering that he'd have to stay in Celeste's room for now, since whoever was in his body had the key to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit worrying that he couldn't figure out who was in his body, but at the very least, whoever it was didn't seem to have any malicious intentions. They didn't want anyone else to die, they just liked his body more than their own, apparently. At least, if they were telling the truth, that is. He couldn't imagine why any of the Ultimate students he'd been locked in here with would prefer his body over their's, and they'd claimed they were one of the boys originally despite not acting like either Hifumi or Mondo. For the time being, though, he decided to trust them. So long as they didn't try to kill anyone, there shouldn't be a problem with them enjoying his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the dorm rooms, Makoto approached the door to Celeste's room and unlocked it. It felt like a breach of privacy, but he didn't really have any other option. He opened the door, and was somewhat caught off guard by what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Where did she get all of this?\" he mumbled, looking at the way Celeste's room was decorated. While his room was mostly empty, with only the furniture that had been there when he first arrived at the school, Celeste's room was fully decked out in gothic lolita style. He'd never seen any of this sort of thing around the school, so had it just been here already when they arrived? Was everyone's room decorated like this, and his was just plain because he lacked a talent besides luck? He made a mental note to ask the others later, because if not, then he really wondered where Celeste had found everything being used to decorate her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he wasn't too fond of the style himself, it didn't bother him for the most part, save for the coffin sitting next to the bathroom door. He did his best to ignore it, and stepped into the bathroom. Unlike the rest of the room, the bathroom seemed more or less the same as his, albeit with a lock on the door. He stood in front of the sink, staring into the mirror above it. Even though he'd been walking around in Celeste's body all day, hearing her voice when he spoke, it was still disconcerting to see Celeste's reflection instead of his own, mimicking his every movement. After everything that had happened today, it no longer surprised him, but it still made him uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to get used to it, though. He was determined to not let another murder happen, so unless Monokuma got bored and decided this wasn't a good enough motive, he'd be seeing this face every time he looked in the mirror. He did have to admit, thought, that there was a certain amount of irony in him being stuck in Celeste's body. The Ultimate Lucky Student, in the body of the Ultimate Gambler. It'd make for a killer combination, if not for the fact that Celeste's talent wasn't physically linked to her body, and he knew rather little of gambling himself. It made him wonder how exactly Monokuma had decided who got put in whose body. Was it all just random? Did he specifically pick out swaps he thought would be amusing? And for that matter, how was any of this even possible? Everything up until now had been crazy, to say the least, but as far as he'd known, body swapping wasn't a real thing that could happen. And yet, here he was, evidence to the contrary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe briefly glanced back at the toilet and the shower, before leaving the room. He didn't have to go that badly, and he wasn't about to try and take a shower in someone else's body. As he exited, he heard the familiar sound of the school bell, and the monitor in the room displayed Monokuma's usual night time announcement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should try and get some rest,\" Makoto said to himself, looking over at the bed. Tomorrow was a new day, and hopefully they'd be able to sort things out then. Celeste's outfit didn't exactly seem appropriate for sleeping in, but he didn't know whether she had any pyjamas around here or not, and he wouldn't feel comfortable getting changed with her body anyway. He did, however, take off her shoes, suddenly realising that he'd somehow been walking around in high heels all day without even noticing. With a sigh, he flicked off the light, and climbed into bed, doing his best to get to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night was anything but restful. Makoto had managed to get to sleep, but he still woke up feeling a little tired. He half hoped it was all a dream, and he'd wake up in his own room, in his own body. That was unfortunately not the case, as he woke up to the same sensations he'd been experiencing the previous day. He was still in Celeste's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could even crawl out of bed, Monokuma appeared on the monitor for the morning announcement. With a groan, Makoto slowly sat up, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. He was not looking forward to another day of being in Celeste's body. But then, he supposed the alternative was even worse. For him to be back in his own body, for the motive to be over, someone would have to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head, Celeste's hair swinging back and forth, as he tried to clear his thoughts. He couldn't let himself think like that. He had to stay hopeful. With that in mind, he pulled himself out of bed and slipped Celeste's shoes back on. Her outfit was a bit wrinkled from him sleeping in it, but he still wasn't ready to get changed. Hopefully Celeste would forgive him for not taking proper care of her body once they all switched back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with everyone swapped like this, Makoto figured it would be best to head to the dining hall, since they had agreed to all have breakfast together. He wasn't sure how many of the others would still be keeping that promise under the current motive, but he decided that he still would be. He just hoped that nothing bad had happened during the night, like the last time he'd slept in someone else's room.</span></div></div>",

Looking around, it seemed that he wasn't the only one who would have been uncomfortable changing clothes in a different body, half of the other students clearly also didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took note of where everyone was sitting, it seemed that half of those who hadn't revealed who they were tried their hardest to sit away from other people. Probably to avoid giving away who they were by talking to the group. Half of the other people who hadn't revealed who they were sat together and seemed to be acting like the bodies they were in, Makoto noticed his own body among those people<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhereas the people who did reveal who they were sat together and were currently having a conversation, Makoto sat with them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Makoto!\" Hina in Mondo's body said with her usual cheerfulness before eyeing Makoto up and down \"Looks like you didn't get a good night's sleep either\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto shook his head \"it's this body, all of the.....differences made it hard to sleep\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh, i hear ya. I couldn't lay down in Mondo's body without feeling his......\" Hina's face turned red as she didn't finish her sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto's eyes turned to Taka in Toko's body. Unlike the others in their current group, his clothes weren't wrinkled at all and he smelled...nice. Makoto realized what the must have meant \"Taka did you.....shower in Toko's body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Taka said with confidence \"Proper hygiene is important to starting your school day. To forgo it for a reason as trivial such as this would be the path of a delinquent!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Taka went off on a speech about why hygiene was important, Makoto felt Kyoko in Hifumi's body tap his shoulder. She pointed at Hiro's body before beginning to speak \"Call it a hunch, but I'm certain that Toko is in Yasohiro's body.\" She whispered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you tell? Makoto whispered back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just watch while Taka talks\" Kyoko said. Makoto kept an eye on Hiro's body. Hiro's body kept giving an occasional glance their direction and anytime Taka said something they didn't particularly agree with, they would clench their fists \"Toko may not be talking to anyone in order to hide the stutter in her speech, but she can't hide her anger over someone as bold as Kiyotaka being in her body\" Kyoko explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto made a mental note of that. He was amazed that Kyoko could figure that out so fast and only from body movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTired of Taka's speech, Hina changed the subject \"So, did any of you try talking to your own bodies?\" She asked the others \"I tried talking to mine, and I think a guy is in it, gross\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Kyoko was the first to respond \"Unfortunately I wasn't able to figure out who was in it\" she seemed a bit embarrassed that she couldn't figure it out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiro and Taka admitted that they hadn't even talked to their own bodies. Makoto explained to the others that although be did talk to his own body, he wasn't able to figure out who it was<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHina stood up \"well, sitting around here won't solve anything\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where you going?\" Makoto asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the pool. I haven't been able to swim at all since we got to this school, and I'm not going to let being stuck in this body stop me from swimming\" Hina explained. Makoto could understand how she felt, swimming was her ultimate talent, not being able to do the thing she loved for so long must have taken it's toll on her. \"Wanna come too?\" Hina asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto blushed, Hina probably didn't understand the implications of asking him to come swim. He'd have to change Celeste into a swimsuit. Before he could answer, Hiro stood up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to go sit around in the gift shop, there's some really neat stuff there, anyone want to come with?\" Hiro asked. Makoto chuckled a bit, imaging the body of Byakuya digging through junk<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto supposed that he could spend a little free time hanging out with them instead of trying to figure out who was in what body. Most people were already accounted for, and they could probably figure out the others through context clues later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, Makoto chose to hang out with<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While Hiro had just generally asked if anyone wanted to accompany him, Hina had specifically been addressing him when she'd asked if he wanted to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure. I'll come,\" Makoto replied, a little nervously. While he was already feeling embarassed just thinking about what he'd need to do before he could go swimming, sitting around in the gift shop with Hiro didn't sound particularly fun. He didn't really visit the gift shop unless he had some Monokuma tokens to turn in, and said tokens were now with his old body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, cool. Let's go.\" Makoto quickly finished having his breakfast, said his goodbyes to the rest of the group, and then he and Hina left the dining hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we, um...\" Makoto mumbled, pointing towards the dorm rooms. He was too embarrassed to say it, but he was trying to ask whether they should get changed before heading to the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHina rubbed the back of Mondo's head. \"I found some spare swimsuits in the locker rooms when we were all searching the second floor after the last trial. I figured it'd be better to just use those. I don't really wanna go searching through Mondo's stuff to see if he has a swimsuit somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto nodded. He wasn't particularly eager to go searching through Celeste's belongings either. As the walked through the school, he couldn't help but think they seemed like a rather odd pair, under normal circumstances, he wouldn't think Mondo and Celeste to really hang out with each other. Although in reality, it wasn't Mondo and Celeste, it was Hina and himself in their bodies. These swaps had turned the whole school on its head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how have you been handling all this?\" Makoto asked, trying to make small talk to take his mind off of what awaited him once they got to the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been trying to ignore it, mostly,\" Hina said with a sigh. \"It's just... so WEIRD being stuck in a boy's body. I don't know if I'd ever be able to get used to it. You know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I spent a most of yesterday trying to get used to this, but I still feel uncomfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... when you say \"trying to get used to this\", you don't mean...\" Hina didn't finish her question, but from the look she was giving him, Makoto could tell what she was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonononono!\" Makoto said frantically, waving his arms back and forth. His face flushed red out of embarrassment. \"Nothing like that! I just walked around the school trying to get used to how it felt to be in Celeste's body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh. Okay, sorry about that. I guess I'm just a bit on edge now that I know one of the guys in my body. I don't know what he's doing with it, but I don't like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, I get it.\" Even though Hina now understood what he meant, Makoto's blush refused to die down. She'd put the thought into his head, and he was still embarrassed about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about your body? You said you talked to them, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto nodded. \"Yeah, but I couldn't figure out who it was. They said their original body was one of the boys, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHina sighed at hearing that. \"Lucky,\" she whined. Makoto supposed that Hina must be more worried about whoever was in her body doing something innappropriate, rather than what Monokuma had intended them to worry about, so even though he didn't know who exactly was in his body, the fact that it was someone of the same gender would be considered \"lucky\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the conversation had reached that point, the pair had reached the locker rooms. \"Alright, I'll see you in there, I guess?\" Hina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Hina pulled out Mondo's e-Handbook, and opened the door to the boy's locker room, before heading inside. Once the door closed behind her, Makoto stepped towards the girl's locker room. It wasn't a place he'd normally be allowed, but now that he had Celeste's body, he supposed he was technically a girl. Monokuma had imposed new school regulations regarding the e-Handbooks specifically because of the locker rooms, but considering no one had been punished yet, he supposed that having the handbook of the person whose body you were in wasn't against the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore putting Celeste's handbook in front of the card reader, Makoto decided to boot it up. There was something he was curious about. As the screen lit up, a small smirk graced his face as he read the name displayed on screen. The name \"Taeko Yasuhiro\" was written.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I knew that wasn't her real name,\" Makoto mumbled, remembering his doubts the first day he met Celeste. He'd have to remember this for later, just in case it was important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis curiosity sated, Makoto placed the handbook in front of the card reader to unlock the door, and entered the girl's locker room.</span></div></div>",

He was about to have a very awkward experiance, the last thing he needed was to have someone watch him as he did it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through the locker room, Makoto found where the spare school swimsuits were. Never in his life would he have ever imagined he'd have to wear a girl's swimsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto let out a deep breath. \"Just get it over with quickly\" he told himself as he took off Celeste's jacket and tie. With each article of clothing he removed, he felt his face grow redder and redder. When he was in just underwear, he closed his eyes. He was already violating Celeste's privacy enough by changing, he wasn't going to violate it even more by looking at her naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his eyes closed, he felt around for the swimsuit he grabbed. Somehow putting it on felt even more awkward than taking off Celeste's clothes. Perhaps because he could feel every movement he made with her body without the barrier of clothes to distract him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had finished changing into the swimsuit, he looked in a mirror. He couldn't believe he had just done that. Although he wished he wouldn't have to go through an experiance like that again, he knew very well that he would have to once they were done swimming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put Celeste's clothes in a locker and exited to the pool. Hina was already swimming around doing laps in Mondo's body when he got there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Makoto entered the pool, he felt a sudden shiver go up his whole body. The sudden temperature change and the feeling of water touching his new body was uncomfortable to say the least,  but he quickly got used to it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swam to the middle and just treaded water as he watched Asahina do laps for a while. He was impressed with how fast she was swimming, even with a new body, she still had her technique and swam faster than Makoto could ever hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few laps, Asahina swam toward Makoto. Makoto gave a little clap over her swimming so fast. Asahina seemed pleased with herself. She looked down at Mondo's body while she spoke \"Well, I guess I was slightly lucky with this swap. Mondo's body is in great shape.\" She admired the muscles she now possessed. \"If I got stuck in Hifumi's out of shape body, I don't know what I'd do\" she shivered at the thought, causing Makoto to chuckle a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto and Hina spent their time swimming around and having fun. Although swimming around in a girl's body was distracting at first, Makoto got over it much faster than he was expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole time they swam was very relaxing, which was very much needed after not only the trial they had all gone through not more than a week ago, but also the paranoia they had all been feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto and Hina quickly lost track of time. However, their fun was so interrupted by...</span></div></div>",

The familiar image of Monokuma filled their eyes \"A body has been discovered. After a certain amount of time, which you may use however you like. A class trial will begin\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto's vision got blurry. It had happened again. One of their friends had just been murdered. They would have to go through another one of those trials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto nearly fainted from the shock and Asahina had to help him out of the pool. Once they were out, however. Things only got worse. Monokuma appeared in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ta-Da! It's the Monokuma file! Looks like one of your <i>friends</i> really wanted this body switching to end. Or maybe they didn't want it to end. Whatever it was, it got them to commit murder!\" Monokuma laughed, as if to mock Makoto<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsahina spoke up \"hey! Since a murder happened, can we go back to our own bodies now?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonokuma shook his whole body to say no, a result of him having no neck \"Not quite yet. See, the person inside the body may have commuted murder, but the body commuted murder too. So until the trial is done. Everyone will stay all mixed up! And before you ask, no, the person whose body died with the victim won't be getting their body back\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto couldn't believe it. Not only was one of their friends dead and they were about to have a trial to find and indirectly execute the killer, but because of this switch two others would permantly be stuck in different bodies<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Monokuma disappeared, Makoto opened the Monokuma file. It had a picture of the body and a full autopsy of the murder. However, it was the name that was most important. The name didn't match the body, so that must have been who was in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto felt puke rise in his throat and he held onto Asahina for support. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was the victim's name?</span></div></div>",

That was Celeste's real name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh.\" Hina fell silent, unsure of what to really say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeleste had always been cloaked in an air of mystery, to the point of not even telling her friends her real name. From the beginning, she'd been telling everyone they needed to adapt and get used to living here, and adapt she did, as she seemed to have given no clear indication of whose body she was in. But now it was all over. She was dead, and someone here at the school was the one that killed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto felt like he was going to be sick. Not only was another of his friends dead, but until the case was solved, he was stuck in the body of the deceased. Until they trial was over, he'd be hearing her voice whenever he spoke. It had been awkward and uncomfortable before, but now that Celeste was dead, it disgusted him. Despite that, however, he knew he couldn't turn a blind eye to her death. He needed to help figure out who had killed her, because if they couldn't find the murderer, they'd all be dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Makoto wasn't the only one negatively affected by Celeste's death. He might be stuck in her body until the trial was over, but someone else had had their body killed along with Celeste's mind. They'd never get their body back, and would have to investigate a case in which their own body was the victim. They'd forever be stuck in the body of one of their deceased friends. In a sense, Makoto was lucky that his body wasn't the one who'd died, but any sense of relief that might have come from that didn't register with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with the details of the crime and the victim, the Monokuma File also provided a photo of the body.

She helped Makoto stand up straight as he began to get over the inital shock. \"We need to hurry up and meet with the others.\" She told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hina rushed toward the boy's locker room, Makoto did the same with the girl's lockeroom. He didn't have time to worry about changing, he threw on Celeste's blouse and skirt over the swimsuit. He forewent extra things like her jacket and tie, he had much larger things to worry about than looking nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he left the girl's locker room, he caught sight of his current reflection again. However, while he felt awkward about seeing it before. He now felt like tearing up, seeing her still move around despite now being deceased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto and Hina (who had also thrown Mondo's clothes on) ran through the school and eventually made their way toward the supply room, where everyone was waiting for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, you two are here\" Kyoko in Hifumi's body was the first to speak up. She seemed to be examining the shelves instead of the body itself for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else didn't talk to Makoto and Hina, they just talked among themselves about their investigative progress. One question did seem to be spread among the others \"Who is Taeko Yasuhiro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto pulled out Celeste's E-handbook and turned it on. He had a feeling what he was about to do would raise suspicion upon him, but it was better to have the truth be out than to conceal it. \"Celeste's real name was Taeko Tasuhiro she......she's the victim\" he paused at the end, saying that with her voice felt wrong, but it needed to be said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone except Kyoko in Hifumi's body stared silently at Makoto, until Kyoko's body began to stomp toward him, an aura of anger around her. \"You're the only who did this, didn't you?\" Kyoko's body said in a harsh tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Sakura.\" Kyoko in Hifumi's body said as she seemed to have finished examining the shelves. \"Makoto and Hina were together at the pool since breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto wondered how Kyoko knew it was Sakura in her body, but he supposed that was mearly a result of him arriving late. He couldn't imagine anyone looking at their own body without giving away who they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyoko's right! Me and Makoto were together all day! He couldn't have done this!\" Hina defended Makoto<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura kept an expression of anger on her face, but soon backed off. Makoto stared at Sakura's dead body in the middle of the room.

The shelves on the other side of the room were extremely cluttered.

I've swam enough for today.\" He said, to Hina's shock and climbed out of the pool<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked past whoever was in Hina's body, there eyes locked for a second.

He still managed to push them into the water, but he ended up going in right with them, he hurt Celeste's leg kicking them too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the unplanned dive, Makoto was quick to adapt.

I've just been trying to get used to all the new feelings, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMondo nodded. \"This fuckin' hair keeps getting in my face. Why doesn't Kyoko just cut it short or somethin'?\" He let out an irritated sigh as he brushed Kyoko's hair out of his eyes. \"Anyway, I'm gonna go...adjust to this body.

Someone other than the twelve remaining students had wound up in one of their bodies. However, there were certainly clues there if anyone dared to pay attention. After the flash that had swapped them, Monokuma had simply disappeared like he often did. No staying to gloat about how powerful he was to have done this to all of them, no reminders about how it'd only end if one of them committed murder, not even a goodbye. The reason behind his sudden disappearance was rather simple, actually; no one was controlling him at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, the mastermind was mentally cursing up a storm inside their borrowed head. They really should have known better than to use this motive without properly testing it first. Whatever it was they'd used to swap everyone's bodies had apparently slipped from their control, and had involved them in the swaps as well. Of course, they could be in control regardless of whose body they were in. What was really bothersome about this, however, was the fact that someone was now in their body. Someone now knew the true identity of the mastermind, and that wasn't something they couldn't have happen quite yet in their little game. Something would need to be done to deal with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the mastermind's involvement in the swap had left one very confused student sitting in the Monokuma control room. While they knew the swap was going to happen, they had no idea where they were, how exactly they got here, or why the body they were in was even still alive.

He could already tell he felt different the moment the light faded, but that did little to prepare him for looking down and seeing the cleavage he now possessed. Between the red jacket and white tank top he found himself wearing, and the... figure of his new body, it didn't take him long to figure out who's body he was in. He was standing in the same shoes Byakuya had stood in moments earlier; he had become Aoi Asahina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blush gracing his face, Makoto diverted his attention away from Hina's body, and looked up at the rest of his classmates. For the most part, they seemed to have reacted in a similar manner to him, shocked by their new forms, and examining themselves to figure out who they'd become. Makoto even say his own body amongst the crowd. It was most unsettling to see his own form under someone else's control, though he assumed that practically everyone else must be feeling the same way. At least, that's what he told himself. He could only hope no one was enjoying this enough to considering murdering the body's original owner over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how are you all feeling?\" Monokuma called out, interrupting everyone's self-examination. \"Anyone feel like murdering yet? Puhuhuhu!\" As usual, Monokuma was the only one laughing. In fact, Monokuma was the only one saying anything. No one else seemed to be speaking up, a fact which Monokuma seemed to be very aware of. \"So, that \"announcing what bodies you're in\" plan you guys came up with, you gonna do that now or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto nervously eyed the rest of the crowd, waiting for someone to speak up. He knew he it was important that everyone knew who was who, just in case they did have another trial, but he also didn't want to be the first to call out, and potentially be left as the only one who's identity was known.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Much to Makoto's surprise, not a single person in the room spoke up. Everyone just eyed each other suspiciously, waiting for someone else to make the first move. Were they just like him, waiting for someone else to go first so they wouldn't be the only one, or were they deliberately hiding who they were, either out of fear or malice? Even Taka, who was normally so bold and had suggested the plan in the first place, seemed to have been shut up, wherever and whoever he was right now. Makoto began to think maybe he should start it off. If no one else was going to do it, perhaps he should be the one to get the ball rolling, so everyone else could follow. But what if they didn't?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could make a decision, Monokuma's laughter filled the gym once more. \"Guess I really spooked you with this one, huh? Well, don't worry. If you want your body back, all you've gotta do is kill! And if you wanna keep the body you're in, then hey, you can kill as well! Just kill and kill to your heart's content! Puhuhuhu!\" With that, Monokuma fell back behind the little podium he sat on on the stage, and disappeared, leaving a very quiet, jumbled group of students standing in the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite not speaking up beforehand, Makoto still felt the need to address the elephant in the room. \"S-So, are we, um, really not going to reveal ourselves?\" Makoto asked, internally cringing at hearing Hina's voice instead of his own when he spoke. He had a feeling he'd never get used to that. Or any of this, really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Makoto had even finished the question, a few of the other students were already leaving the gym, and those that hadn't yet seemed to be just as anxious about the idea of revealing themselves as Makoto felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's for the best that way,\" whoever was in Chihiro's body said nervously, glancing around at the others in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it'll all make itself clear in time, anyway,\" Mondo's body added. Makoto had to agree with that sentiment. Aside from those who metaphorically kept their cards close to their chest, like Kyoko or Celeste, he doubted anyone could really hide their true self for too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I-I guess.\" Feeling a bit dejected, Makoto slowly joined the group in leaving the gym. He decided he'd back to his room for now, to gather his thoughts and think about his next course of action. No one seemed to be speaking to each other much, besides a small amount of small talk. This motive had truly put everyone on edge, now that no one knew who was who. By the time Makoto made it back to the dorm rooms, he was alone. Everyone else had either split off in another direction, or they'd gotten here before him and had already gone into their own rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the walk over wasn't particularly long, it really highlighted the differences between Makoto's body and Hina's. For lack of a better term that Makoto was comfortable using in the current situation, Hina was probably the curviest of the girls remaining in the group, and he, an average boy, just happened to be the one to land in her body. He didn't know whether to call himself lucky or unlucky for that, but right now, he felt incredibly uncomfortable. He could feel Hina's ample chest bounce a little with every step, her hips sway as he walked, and even the emptiness between his legs under Hina's somewhat tight shorts, all serving to throw him off as he walked. At the very least, Hina's outfit was a bit manageable. While most of the other girls wore skirts, and a couple even wore high heels, Hina wore shorts and sneakers. He was thankful for that at least, even if her shorts were a bit too short for his liking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only after Makoto had searched for his room key, finding in Hina's jacket rather than the small pockets of her shorts, that he realised he couldn't use his own room anymore. He no longer had the key, and even then, no one knew he was Makoto. He'd have to use Hina instead. It felt like a bit of an invasion of privacy, but he justified it by telling himself that everyone would be doing it. Upon entering, he found the room to be a bit less sparsely decorated than his, various exercise equipment strewn across the room. Perhaps he should consider keeping up Hina's training regimen, so her body was still in top condition when she got it back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a thought for another time, though, for now, Makoto headed over to the bathroom. He knew what he'd see if he looked in the mirror, but he still felt a need to see his reflection. Just as expected, staring back at him above the sink was Aoi Asahina, the Ultimate Swimming Pro. Every movement he made, his reflection mirrored. There was no denying what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so surreal,\" Makoto mumbled, trying to force himself to become accustomed to hearing Hina's voice. He needed to grow used to all of this. He needed to grow used to seeing Hina's reflection, because it was his reflection now, until Monokuma got bored or... for the foreseeable future. There was one hope left, though. Pulling up one of Hina's sleeves a bit, Makoto pinched his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Guess it's not a dream, huh?\" He should have known. That would have been far too easy. This all felt too real to be a dream, or at least, he assumed so. He'd never been a girl in real life before, so he didn't know whether being one in a dream would feel any different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what now?\" Makoto asked himself, leaning against the sink as he stared into his reflection's eyes. He needed to find some way to fill his time. The motive had been imposed onto them fairly early, so it wasn't as if he could just go back to bed and wait for all of this to be over. Perhaps he should go and find someone to talk to, like he usually did when nothing was happening. He might be able to figure out who people were, and if he could gain someone's trust, then he wouldn't have to go through this all alone. Of course, when just the walk over to the dorm rooms had made Makoto uncomfortable, he wasn't exactly excited about the idea of walking all over the school searching for someone to talk to. Maybe he could just waste time in his room for now. Perhaps he could find a way to get himself more used to Hina's body, preferably without violating her privacy more than was already necessary.</span></div></div>",

Whether some of them viewed it this way or not, these people were his friends, and he wasn't about to let some silly motive get in the way of that. Sure, said motive may have scrambled their bodies and left him not knowing who anyone was, but he wasn't going to let him stop it. While there was still time in the day, he should go out there and reconnect with his friends, and maybe figure out who some of them actually were on the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you can do this Makoto,\" Makoto told himself as he looked in the mirror, still doing his best to get used to the body he'd landed in. \"Or... Hina, I guess?\" Though Makoto knew who he really was, he realised that with everyone keeping their identity a secret, to make things simpler, it would probably make the most sense for everyone to refer to each other by the names of thee bodies they were in. He supposed that was another thing he'd need to get used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sigh escaped his mouth. \"I'm never gonna get used to this, am I?\" At least for now, this was all too weird for Makoto to even consider that this could ever be normal to him. It didn't help that his unfamiliarity with her body would result in, in all likelihood, a less than convincing impression of her around others. If he was really going to keep himself hidden like everyone else seemed to be doing, then really all he could hope for was that his hopelessly average self would be so average that no one could tell who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to channel some of Hina's usual positivity, Makoto all but shouted, \"Alright, enough of that, let's go!\" Wasting no more time in front of the mirror, he quickly headed over to the door to the room... before quickly slowing his pace once he realised that more speed resulted in more movement in his chest. Of course, as Makoto headed out the door, he realised that along with not knowing who anyone was, he also didn't know where anyone was, seeing as everyone had scattered after Monokuma had finished swapping them. Deciding to just pick a destination and see who was there, Makoto headed off towards the...</span></div></div>",

Long hair tied into braids rested on his shoulders. Her fingernails were sprinkled with various bite marks from Toko's nervous little habit. There was no doubt now. He was in Toko Fukawa's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people around him were in a panic, screaming about body parts and clothes and hair and every other bizarre transformation they had been dealt with. They were almost at each other's throats already! Eventually, a loud whistle screeched from the middle of the crowd. The crowd turned to see Chihiro Fujisaki standing confidently, a stern look cemented on her features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My fellow classmates. We cannot allow these manipulations to affect our trust as a group. That is exactly what that bear aims to shatter. I am Sakura Ogami. I hope you will all trust me enough with your identities as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tense silence enveloped the crowd, everyone daring the other to speak up. Matoko swallowed, stepping forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Makoto Naegi. I... don't know if I can prove it, but that's who I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHifumi stepped forward, saluting the crowd. \"My name is Kiyotaka Ishimaru! Test me all you require: I've studied everything I might need to know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one felt the need to take him up on his offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHagekure spoke up next. \"I'm uh, Aoi Asashina. Somehow I don't think I'll be able to prove it with my swimming techniques with this body... Maybe a donut eating contest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the crowd remained in their own positions, eyeing the others curiously. Sakura-in-Chihiro sighed, disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that is all who wish to speak up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have a chance to finish, the other classmates quickly leaving the room.

It would be good to stick together. And to be honest... he had to ask some of them for assistance. Aoi in particular. Being in this body gave him this complete feeling of discomfort. He tried his best to respect Toko's privacy but it was hard to keep things discrete when his days were spent as someone else!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps the strangest discovery of all was the pair of scissors Toko had strapped to her leg. What was up with that? Did Toko have some extreme scrap-booking hobby? They were a little painful, so Makoto decided it was best to just leave it in Toko's room. Oh yeah, that was especially great: whoever was in his body wouldn't let him back into his room to get his things!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my room now. Your presence is unnecessary.\" That cold demeanor could be a couple people, although Makoto assumed Byakuya would be a little more rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was the odd compliment he had received the other day from whoever was in Kyoko's body. Someone definitely perkier than Kyoko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Makoto, you smell great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... huh? Where did that come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko's body shrugged casually. \"Toko always kind of had that grody smell following her around. Whatever you're doing, it's certainly more hygienic than what she had going on. You're looking pretty good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was weird, now that he thought about it. \"Now that you mention it... I haven't been able to smell much of anything lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, just keep it up. Your hair is oooking great too! She's much more appealing like this, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Makoto was pretty sure he could guess at least what the gender of the Kyoko's occupant was. Mondo or Hagakure maybe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, his focus shifted as he went about his day, drifting to the kitchen. Maybe there was something wrong with Toko's nose? That could explain why she didn't seem bothered by her own particular... smells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Makoto pulled some spices from a shelf, sniffing in it casually, searching for a scent. He only had a few seconds before his nose suddenly reared up towards the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh.... ahhhh\" He covered his face in preparation, embarrassed already.

Before Makoto opened the door he noticed that his actual body wasn't tired at all even if it was a long run from the room he was. Then Makoto watched the breasts he now had again and was frustrated about how he would introduce himself to the others, nothing he could think was giving a good feeling, he has just been accused for killing Sayaka and now he was in the body of a woman who was not with the others on the GYM, everything seemed to be against him, but he still had hope for his friends to believe in him and after thinking that Makoto opened the door.<br>\r\nInside everyone turned to where he was standing and heard the voice of Togami shouting \"Junko?!\".<br>\r\nEveryone seemed surprised and he was even more and after hearing that Makoto said<br>\r\n\"I am Junko?\"<br>\r\nThen Toko walked towards him and said \"I suppose that you are affected too\" and she started to analyze the shape Makoto now had \"This is wonderful, even the Master mind ended up tangled in all of this\" Makoto were stood there thinking \"I am in the body of the Master mind? This could not be possible\" He couldn't think straight but didn't have the opportunity, soon Makoto's body also walk in his direction \"Everything points that indeed you are the Master mind... Or at least his body\".<br>\r\n\"Who are you? Explain yourself!\" shouted the body of Toko, but in all the chaos the room was Makoto could finally understood something, it wasn't much but it felt like a progress \"Togami?\" Makoto said just to see how the body of Toko was glaring him the way Togami always did. \"A-ah s-sorry an explanation right?\" still confused by listening the voice of a woman... or the voice of Junko out of his mouth every time he talked distracted Makoto.<br>\r\n\"Umm to start with I'm actually Makoto Naegi and...\" \"Naegi?\" interrupted who he think was Togami \"Y-yes Makoto Naegi\" \"Interesting... So what do you know about this and where the hell you were when this happened?\" asked togami \"Where to start...\"</span></div></div>",

Purple hair fell into his line of sight, and he could feel something on top of his head, presumably a nurse's cap by the theme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up and saw 11 other people he had never seen before reacting pretty much the same way, looking over their bodies in shock and confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall woman with blond hair in an ornate style and a kimono turned to Monokuma. \"What is the meaning of this?!\" she asked angrily.

Since none of these bodies are recognizable, there is no point in keeping our identities hidden.\" She stepped forward. \"I'll start: I am Kyouko Kirigiri.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaegi spoke up, cringing slightly at his feminine voice. \"Um, I'm Makoto Naegi. I don't really have much in the way of proof for that, though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There should be no need for that as of right now,\" spoke another voice, this one an average-looking high school girl with red hair and a camera bag. \"I am Sakura Ogami.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately after this, another girl with long silver hair and a gray suit piped up, right after buttoning up some exposed cleavage. \"I'm Aoi Asahina!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait-wait-wait!\" Monokuma yelled out, desperate-sounding. \"Don't any of you want to keep your identities secret?

There, a pair of purple eyes stared back at him. He looked himself up and down, and found nothing that looked familiar in any way.

A white nurse's cap now stood where his ahoge once was.

He then proceeded to take off the white shoes, the stocking, and the glove, before starting on unwrapping the bandages encasing the other arm and leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...That is, until he saw a collection of bruises and cuts right under the bandages on his right arm. Grimacing, he decided to leave those particular bandages on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, he walked over to his dresser and pulled out his spare outfit. Unfortunately, he only had that one jacket, so he couldn't put on an equivalent for that. But he pulled out a spare hoodie, one that his mom had got him because she was worried his old one would fall apart while he was at school. Unlike his dark green one, this new hoodie was a simple gray. Originally, it was too big for him, as his mother said she wanted him to grow into it. But now, without this different body of his, it fit perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, he took out an extra pair of black pants. After an... incident in 8th grade, he always made sure he had an extra pair of dress pants for formal events, and they looked close enough to his jeans that he felt comfortable wearing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, he took out a pair of socks, put them on, then slipped back on that pair of shoes (unfortunately, an extra pair was the only thing Naegi didn't have).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked back into the bathroom to check his new appearance. When he saw himself, he smiled a bit, looking far more like his old self than he did before. Now all he was missing was his ahoge...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled a bit (though it sounded more like a giggle), pulling up a small strand of hair with his left hand and turning it 90 degrees with his other.

During this short span of time however, Makoto got to witness first-hand one of the strangest things he had ever seen. A highly advanced mechanical bear calling itself \"Monokuma\" has trapped Makoto and 14 other students inside Hope's Peak Academy. Monokuma requested that the students build him spares based on the topics he provides if they want a chance to escape. Monokuma had only just finished his explanation to the group, when he added yet another strange twist. \"Oh, and by the way, I decided to add a little \"challenge\" into the mix. Variety is the spice of life after all!\" The students had no choice but to listen to anything Monokuma said. Byakuya, however, was getting tired of listening to Monokuma's lecture. \"Get to the point.\" His stern request seemed to spring Monokuma into action. \"Alrighty then! I see you eager beavers are excited to hear what I have to say! Now, hear me out.\" Monokuma took the chalkboard that he was using to write the themes to be incorporated in his spares and erased everything written on it. He immediately started to draw a picture. \"Come on, this isn't the time for some fuckin' art class!\" Mondo was ready to leave. He'd had enough of being ordered around by Monokuma. On the board was a crudely drawn picture of some students gathering materials. Monokuma immediately got to work explaining the pictures. \"As you can see, each of you excel at different tasks. The combination of your physical strength, as well as your Ultimate abilities mean that some of you are more suited for certain chores. Naturally, this means that eventually a sense of harmony will be established among the group. Once this harmony has been created, all of you will have no problem at getting tasks done whatsoever. On one hand, this is good. You'll be creating my spares and working towards your escape. On the other hand, it's boring as heck! Watching the hope and coordination between you all would be like watching paint splatter in the exact same pattern every single time. Besides, I need at least a *little* entertainment value out of this!\" Hiro was getting impatient and called out to Monokuma. \"Yo, man, you've talking for so long now, but I still have, like, *no* idea what you're talking about!\" \"Ugh, fine! I'll just get straight to the point. In order to spice up the gathering process, I will be... swapping your bodies with each other!\" Silence followed. Everyone stared blankly at Monokuma, as if waiting for him to stop joking around and tell them the truth. \"Huh, this isn't quite the reaction I expected. Do none of you understand what's about to happen? You're all going to be put in the bodies of your classmates. You'll no longer be able to rely on the strengths you had before, which will make resource gathering much more difficult!\" Sayaka was the first to speak up. \"Um, are you being serious? That kind of thing isn't really possible, right?\" Chihiro added his own opinion. \"As far as I know, that kind of technology is still at least a few years away from being developed.\" \"Oh? You don't believe me? Bears never lie you know. As a matter of fact, an old friend of mine made it. They were known as the Ultimate Neurologist. Oh, uh, they don't go here anymore though.\" A rather annoyed looking Byakuya butted into the conversation. \"This is preposterous. There is no reason for any of us to participate in your pseudoscience experiments.\" \"Oh yeah, that's right. I almost forgot to mention that participation is mandatory if you wanna trigger that escape flag I mentioned earlier. Besides, knowing each others weakness will help you in what happens after we finish the spares, puhuhuhuhuhu!\" Taka took control of the situation and tried to lead the group. \"Attention everyone! I feel like participation in Monokuma's body-swapped resource gathering activity is the best course of action available to us. However, in the name of fairness, we cannot  continue until the group has given unanimous consent! Will everybody please state your opinions on the matter?\" Kyoko was the first to answer. \"As ridiculous as it may sound, I don't think we should give up this opportunity. I was under the impression that all of you wanted to get out of this school. Keep in mind that refusing to participate could result in us living a communal live on these grounds for the rest of our lives.\" Makoto spoke up next. \"Kyoko's right. We can't just give up here! We have to move forward and face whatever Monokuma throws at us. What does everyone else think?\" One after another, the students voiced their opinions on the matter. \"Adaptability is survivability. We have no choice but to accept it.\" \"If I ended up in the body of one of the females, I'd have a perfect model for my art!\" \"This is bullshit anyway, so do whatever the fuck you want.\" \"Um, I think it might be a good idea as well.\" \"Yeah, sure, whatever. I don't believe this stuff anyway. The occult is bullcrap!\" \"I am perfect no matter what form I take. Do as you wish.\" \"Yo, what the heck? We have to do this to escape? What a pain! Fine, I'm in.\" \"The only option is to move forward. Keep your mind and body strong and you can overcome any challenge.\" \"I can swim and eat donuts in anyone's body, so I guess it's fine?\" \"Ugh, fine. If there's no other option, then, like, do what we have to.\" \"You know, this could even end up being a fun experience in the end!\" \"I'm not going to be t-the only one who says no, so just g-get it over with already.\" Monokuma seemed pleased. \"I knew you'd come around eventually! Without further ado, let's get rolling!\" Suddenly the room filled with a bright light. The world began twisting and turning, just like what happened when Makoto first stepped foot into Hope's Peak Academy. When his vision finally came back, Makoto was standing in a different part of the gym than before. Sensing something wrong, Makoto looked down at his body. What he saw was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the shocking turn of events of the first murder of Byakuya. He was killed by one of their 'friend's' Terureru. This act was actually done to stop the now discovered twisted Nagito Komaeda. Hajime Hinata once classed Nagito as a kind boy but during the class trial his true colours were revealed. After Teruteru's twisted execution. The twelve remaining students resolved to promise that such a turn of events would never happen again. This was excluding the insane Nagito, who was chained up in the place of the murder. As his own 'special punishment'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been five days since the last execution. Everyone was trying to settle into their new lives on the island. And hoping to forget about the existence of the sick Nagito. Since the trial,  the Monobeasts guarding the bridge to the next island now disappeared. Allowing the students free entry to the next island. The students were making the most of Chandler beach, a private tropical beach equipped with a beach house in close proximity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile most of the students started to feel safe once again, as long as they did not commit murder the killing game would not continue. While they traded their chance of escape from this island they were ensuring everyone's safety and most importantly their lives. Everyone but Nagito made this agreement. Nagito could not be trusted. The trial proved this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Hajime Hinata the ultimate ??? Not knowing what his talent was due to memory loss Was still on edge. He despised the robotic bear Monokuma, the same thing which killed two of his friends. Which left him and his friends stuck on this strange island and forced them to partake in the killing school trip. He was already broken by the betrayal of Nagito and only felt disgust towards him. Hajime was worried that the bear would not simply allow him and his friends to live the rest of their lives on the island. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonokuma was set on one thing. And one thing only, Despair. No way Monokuma would allow such hope to breed in his killing field trip, Hajime thought. Hajime was always on guard. Especially considering that monokuma and Usami or the now created Monomi have not been seen in person since the trial. Of course Monokuma was seen during the morning and nighttime announcements. But not any other time. This concerned Hajime. \"What are you planning monokuma?\" He thought deeply. Hajime was intent on making monokuma pay and escape the killing school trip. However he would never kill someone in order to do so. Hajime was stronger than that. Hajime could smell something off. He didn't like the smell of it either it was the smell of despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day started as usual. Hajime like all the students woke up at the sound of monokuma's morning announcement. \"Gooooood morning, everyone! Looks like today is gonna be another perfect, tropical day!\" Hajime despised the announcement, it reminded everyone of the situation they had been placed in. Hajime thought it was a psychological motive for murder. Always reminding them if they want to escape they must kill to do so. Hajime wanted to smash the screen so badly in his island cabin. But was reminded that it would count as excessive force and could result in him receiving 'punishment'.  This sent chills down his spine. And once again followed the ritual of getting ready to meet his friends at the Hotel restaurant of hotel Mirai. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hajime arrived at the Hotel restaurant everyone was already there. Was he late? Hajime pondered. \"Ah. So you finally arrived? About time. It's not good to leave a girl waiting you know?\" Mahiro snapped. \"Ah... sorry guys I guess I was a bit preoccupied...\" Hajime replied sincerely. A deadly silence filled the room. Reminding them of the situation they had been placed in. A moment passed and the group then began discussing if they had found any clues to get off the island. But as usual nothing new had been discovered. \"Aw man! Again? Nothing new!\" Kazuichi whined. \"Unfortunately not\" mahiro repplied. \"What about Nagito?\" Akane questioned. \"He's still held up in the old school building\" Mahiro responded. \"Well, if you ask me that freak should like totally stay there forever!\" Hiyoko snapped back. No one disagreed with her for once. Everyone agreed that Nagito is a problem and should be forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile in thought. The group were suddenly shocked at the sudden appearance of the robotic bear Monokuma. \"Long time no see guys\" the robotic bear said gleefully. \"Monokuma!\" The group shouted in unison. \"Well i'm glad your as excited to see me! Aw you guys are soooo kind!\" Monokuma bragged. The students looked with distain. \"Why are you here?\" Hajime exclaimed. \"Oh Hajime me boy. Why else it's Time for the motive!\" Monokuma fiendishly spoke. \"WHAT!\" the class shouted with fear. \"We shall not partake in your cruel games!\" Sonia spoke, \"Yeah! what miss Sonia said!\" Kazuichi said in agreement. \"Monokuma, Its over. We refuse to play your game anymore.\" Hajime exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? You won't? So all of you have each agreed. Not to kill? You are all willing to give up on escaping have you?\" Monokuma devilishly questioned. \"We will never give up on escaping but we will not kill to do so\" hajime retorted. Everyone else nodded In agreement. \"Well... you know how much I hate this Hope. I just can't except it! The only thing you should feel here is DESPAIR!\" Monokuma relplied in rage. \"You've lost Monokuma! Give up.\" Hajime said filled with hope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Upupupupu you think that you've won? Silly Hajime. The despair is yet to have begun! Monokuma chuckled. \"WHAT!\" the group let out in shock. \"Yes. Yes. You haven't even seen the motive this time. Monokuma grimaced. The group froze in fear. Knowing that twisted bear would surely try to think of something to get them killing once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! The motive this time will be your bodies!\" Monokuma chuckled. \"What the hell are you talking about!\" Fuyuhiko snarled. Normally the others would not agree with Fuyuhiko's volatile nature. But on this occasion all students shared the same sentiment. \"Upupupupu I'm gonna switch your bodies!\" \"How the hell is that possible?\" Kazuichi screamed. \"I think I've seen it happen in a few games before\" Chiaki added. \"That may be so. But it's not possible in real life right?\" Hajime added.<br>\r\n\"Who do you think you are talking to! I'm Monokuma! And when I'm involved anything is possible!\" Monokuma chuckled. Hajime could not argue with that. Monokuma himself was a mystery. None of the students knew how or what he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What purpose does this serve?\" Hajime questioned. \"Well if you wish to get back to your original bodies you will need to Kill! KILL! KILL! To your hearts content! That's the only way you will get your bodies back\" Monokuma chuckled with glee. The students looked with despair forming in their eyes. \"Righty-Ho! Let's get this show on the road! Monokuma said while he pulled out a button that he was hiding behind his back. \"3,2,1 LET'S GO!\" Monokuma cheered as he pressed the button. A flash of blinding light filled the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I CAN'T SEE!\" Hajime shouted in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHajime blacked out. And so did all the others simultaneously...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hajime came to, he realised that his body felt different. That he was no longer in his body he was in somebody else's...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I doubt Usami is going to switch us back  sooner rather then later.\" Hajimie merely nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next person to speak up was Sonia's body, \"Oh hoh this is such a beautiful body.\" The tone of voice clearly indicated it was Teruteru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next person to speak up was Fyuhiko's body though he could just barely make out what they said, \"To think I am in my master's body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeko's body approached Fyuhiko's body and said quietly, \"Be quiet Peko I told you not to act like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMahiru spoke up, \"Alright who is who right now?\"<br>\r\nAs they went through the group they learned who was who.<br>\r\nChiaki was in Fyuhiko's body.<br>\r\nNagito was in  Ibuki's body.<br>\r\nIbuki was in Tanaka's body.<br>\r\nSouda was in Akane's body.<br>\r\nAkane was in Nagito's body.<br>\r\nTeruteru was in Sonia's body.<br>\r\nHajime was in Hiyoko's body.<br>\r\nNekomaru was in Mikan's body.<br>\r\nFyuhiko was in Peko's body.<br>\r\nPeko was in Fyuhiko's body.<br>\r\nMahiru was in Hajime's body.<br>\r\nHiyoko was in Souda's body.<br>\r\nTanaka was in Chiaki's body.<br>\r\nSonia was in Togami's body.<br>\r\nTogami was in Nekomaru's body.<br>\r\n(If I missed anyone you can add it in the next part.)<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hajime felt an oddly constricting clasp materialise around his left arm. Quickly looking down to examine it, he recognised it immediately - these were the bandages Mikan always wrapped around her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bitch! Look what you fuckin' did!\" The voice of Hiyoko called out from her body. Did she not swap bodies like the rest of them? She seemed to be acting the exact same, honestly.<br>\r\n\"I'm stuck in this tiny broad's body!\" 'Hiyoko' added. Ah, Hajime understood now: it was Fuyuhiko in Hiyoko's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiny?! Watch what you're saying, baby face!\" Nekomaru's voice responded in an oddly high-pitched whine. Ugh... Hajime could only imagine what tricks Hiyoko could get up to in Nekomaru's athletic body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then Hajime looked fully down ay himself, his new chest bouncing slightly - he felt particularly unimposing with his newly frail frame. Would Hiyoko still try to bully Mikan's body, instead of Mikan herself? As bad as he felt to admit it, Hajime sincerely hoped not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young Master, are you unharmed in there?\" Byakuya's body walked over, clearly inhabited by Peko. Her new frame obviously caught her off-guard, almost tripping several times while on the way to check on Fuyuhiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Oh-Oh-Oh! Now this is a <i>pleasant</i> surprise!\" Akane muttered out in a fake-sounding accent. Of course Teruteru ended up as her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking up from the back was the voice of Mahiru, in an oddly flippant and casual manner. \"Aw man... It's not the best, buuuut not the worst either, I guess!\" Despite looking like Mahiru, Hajime only knew one person who could have a grin that toothy - yep, that was Kazuichi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the worst?! Jeez, that's not only rude, but taking it for granted! I mean... Look what I got!\" 'Teruteru' (clearly Mahiru) responded sourly, poking the side of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHOAAAAA!! This body is BURSTING with raw energy! Even more than my normal body..! I, Nekomaru Nidai, promise that I'll improve your body's shape, Ibuki!\" Ibuki's body made it abundantly clear who was inhabiting it, as they seemed to bounce and jump around, yelling at the top of their lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding to the side was Sonia, an annoyed glare worked across her face, as she stood with her arms neatly folded. \"Hmph... How irritating. You said we stay like this until we are 'better friends'? What absolute garbage.\" The almost monotone (and yet biting contemptful) voice could only be the source of the real Byakuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot too far from Sonia's body was Peko's, now swinging an unsheathed sword wildly from left to right. \"Hya! Haaaahahaaaa! I, the Immortal Gundham Tanaka, have not only mastered the dark art of otherworldly possession, but continued to tutor myself under the illustrious art of the sword! With such agile reflexes... I shall be invincible! Haaaahahahahaa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGundham's body's head suddenly flicked up, a childlike gaze across his face. \"Cool! Does that mean I get to do all the wacky, crazy magic stuff Gundham's always talking about?! Like if I yell out... 'INFERNO FIRE HELL'... Hey, nothing's happening?!\" That naive nature? Oh yeah, that was definitely Ibuku in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? I must ask whose body this is, and why it has such an aroma of... Gasoline, is it?\" Kazuichi's body asked, before Mahiru's body (with Kazuichi inhabiting it) quickly responded, <br>\r\n\"C'mon, Lady Sonia, you know that's my body...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuyuhiko's body, meanwhile, seemed to be in the middle of going nude while awkwardly attempting to climb the nearest tree. They yelled out, \"Aghh! This suit and tie is way too stuffy - no way I'm wearing this!\" Once again, just by the energetic tone and attempts at acrobatics, it was easy to tell it was Akane in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that meant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiaki and Nagito sat next to each other, all the way to the side of the beach, already engaged in conversation. Chiaki's body spoke,<br>\r\n\"That trash like me gets to feel even a glimmer of the hope that you guys feel every day... It's a truly amazing opportunity, Chiaki.\"<br>\r\nIn a slow, almost tired-sounding fashion, Nagito's body responded,<br>\r\n\"...Your hands don't have great dexterity. Playing games might be harder in your body...\"<br>\r\n\"Of course! I'm sorry my flaws are tying down your hope..!\"<br>\r\n\"...But that means I can teach you how to play. In my body, you could still have some of my muscle memory. Maybe I might finally be challenged in a game..?\"<br>\r\n\"Ah! Such an opportunity... That would be absolutely amazing! Thank you so, so much Chiaki!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at least they were hitting it off, Hajime thought.<br>\r\nBut... If this was the current lineup, then where was his body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraning his neck around, Mikan's hair frequently covering his vision, Hajime soon caught vision of his body - quivering on the ground, clearly after having tripped on a nearby rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course... That only leaves Mikan herself...\" Hajime breathed out in his unmaturally unconfident sounding voice. Being Mikan felt so... Demeaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh! I-I'm sorry Hajime! I d-didn't mean to make your body look so v-vulnerable like that! You can d-draw on me, if it'll m-make you hate me less..! O-Or, um... D-Draw on yourself..? Wait, no..!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHajime turned away, deeply embarassed to be watching himself act like that. He wasn't sure which was worse; the prospect of living as Mikan, or the potential damage Mikan would do to Hajime's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsami suddenly spoke up from her perch on a nearby tree. \"So! With that, you all have a break from cleaning and gathering for the next few days, and you can do whatever you want! I'll see you all again in a week or so!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A week?! You gotta be-\" Fuyuhiko in Hiyoko's body started, before Usami vanished in a beam of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some more grumblings and protests, every student eventually walked away from the meeting point, trying to get used to their new position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap...\" Hajime mumbled to himself. He had finally found the courage to search through Mikan's pockets, overwhelmingly curious as to what was inside, and stabbed himself on a needle. \"...I better not get Mikan killed while I'm still in her body. Either way, I don't have the key to my room - just Mikan's, so my room's a no-go. I guess... I either try to find Mikan, and try to figure something out with her, or go straight to Mikan's dorm. Hm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Taking a few bandages from his apron pocket and wrapping them around the syringe wound, he held the key to Mikan's dorm in his other hand. With a surprising amount of dexterity, he clamped the bandages swiftly around the wound, securing it in seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn... I guess Mikan's body kept some of the nerve muscle memory, or something...\" He spoke in a soft, high-pitched tone, entirely unfamiliar to his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHajime figured he should probably apply a disinfectant or something, but despite his unexpected skill in wrapping a wound, he had no idea how to treat it on an actually detailed level, and quickly gave up. It's not like Mikan would have anything bad on a syringe she was carrying so casually, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking his way to Mikan's dorm, he slipped the key in and opened the door, a breeze flowing past his exposed legs, causing him to uncomfortably quiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quickly as the door was opened, he slammed it shut. Damn, did Mikan always feel this exposed? He almost wanted to wrap his whole body in bandages, just as an excuse to cover himself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing deeply to himself, Hajime looked around Mikan's room. It was oddly impressive! A large observation table was set up in the back, with rows of nurse's aprons hanging to the side. At the front and centre, there was a circular table holding all of Mikan's various medical equipment: extra bandages, disinfectants, syringes of vague substance, cleaning pads, and a bunch of other stuff Hajime didn't even recognise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, he wondered - was this what it was like to have a talent? Something you adore doing so much, that you wholeheartedly devote yourself to it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly shirked those thoughts from his mind, walking in front of the closest mirror to get a better look at himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was certainly... Surreal. Seeing Mikan's face move identically in reponse to Hajime's movements was something Hajime hadn't even considered. Even in the mirror, Mikan's face seemed so... Anxious. No matter how Hajime contorted his face, or changed his look, it felt like Mikan's face muscles were somehow genetically designed to appear as whimpering and frightened as possible. It certainly didn't help Hajime's confidence, while he was stuck like this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe few times Hajime pulled off a smile, it was almost like a ray of hope emanating in front of him, before quickly dropping it from over-exertion. Mikan clearly didn't exercise that particular face muscle much, huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing to wander, Hajime got a look at Mikan's bathroom and shower. Of course, he immediately knew he couldn't take a shower while borrowing Mikan's body - surely there were privacy laws or something against it? But, upon feeling Mikan's face, he did feel a bit of sweat from all the wandering he had been doing. Washing his face wouldn't hurt anyone, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a little more refreshed, Hajime continued to examine Mikan's body a tiny bit more. Her hair was so oddly <i>uneven</i>. Every time Hajime tilted his head, he felt like his centre of gravity was entirely shifting based on where the largest chunks of hair were falling from. Surely this had happened by some kind of accident, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring it for now, Hajime went back to the main room. Looking out the window, he noticed the distinct aesthetic of the sun beginning to set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curfew...\" Hajime whimpered unbecomingly. He had already realised what this meant - he had to go to sleep, either in Mikan's stuffy, tight apron and clothes, or touch Mikan's body to remove those clothes and go snooping through her stuff to find some kind of sleeping clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHajime groaned lightly, not happy with either option. Nonetheless, he knew it was an option he still had to pick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ugh... No way. We're only like this for a week - I just have to persevere, is all,\" Hajime reassured himself, mumbling in a squeaky voice. \"I probably can't get away with not taking a shower for the week, but I can at least put it off until I'm at least a little bit more... Comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite saying that, Hajime was relatively convinced he'd never be any more comfortable with the situation. Still, he inwardly promised he'd make sure Mikan's body was kept hygienic. For Mikan's sake, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying down on Mikan's bed, Hajime stretched out his legs, suddenly taking note of how tense Mikan's body seemed to feel. Seriously, he thought, it was like she was in a constant state of stress and fear, causing her bones to seize up and work against themselves. Meanwhile, her purple hair spread out on the pillow, making it difficult for Hajime to rest on his side without getting a mouthful of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResisting the urge to immediately find a pair of scissors and cut Mikan's hair (inwardly thinking he would probably do a better job than whoever cut it last), Hajime eventually found a resting space where his hair was out of the way, and where he felt his clothes pushing against him as minimally as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after wriggling uncomfortably in that position for another few minutes, Hajime found the force of sleep catching up to him - exhaustion from his previous walking counteracting his sheer level of discomfort - and his mind faded into the abyss of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight from a nearby window blared into Hajime's eyes as his eyes blinked, perplexed.<br>\r\n\"What the hell..?\" Hajime began to speak, confused as to why the light directly hit his eyes. That had never happened before, had it..? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he suddenly realised, after hearing his voice once again, that this was still Mikan's dorm. Apparently, due to the way her dorm was positioned, she awoke to the sun directly in her eyes every single morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does she deal with this..?\" Hajime wondered aloud in an agitated manner. Between her clumsiness and the circumstances naturally given to her, Hajime was beginning to think that Mikan had to be one of the most unfortunate people on Earth in terms of raw luck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up, Hajime took his surroundings into consideration once again. For a moment, he pondered - should he at least swap into a different set of Mikan's normal outfit? He had no idea how long she had been wearing the current one on her body, but based on some of the scuffs of dirt along her skirt (presumably from tripping over), it had been on for at least two days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, now that he thought about it, how long had Mikan been wearing these bandages for..? Reaching his hand out, the curiosity becoming too overwhelming, Hajime slowly began to remove the bandages along his left arm -- before freezing, as a group of bruises and cuts made themselves visible from underneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... What the hell is this, Mikan..?\" Hajime mumbled in disbelief, before quickly wrapping the bandages back up. Looking out the window, he quickly resolved,<br>\r\n\"I'll have to ask her later. Or... Maybe just ignore it, if it's uncomfortable for her. For now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the window, he took note of the sun. It seemed to be a bit further in the sky than whenever Hajime usually woke up. Obviously, Mikan's internal clock wasn't too impressive. Knowing her, she would probably frantically scramble every day just to be ready for morning meetings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWashing his face and brushing his teeth, Hajime left the bathroom, deciding to stay in the same clothes. For a moment, he wondered if it would be worthwhile to just stay inside and wait out until Usami reversed the swap.<br>\r\n\"No...\" He backpedalled quickly, \"Usami's doing this to make us better friends. If she knows I stayed inside for seven days, she'll probably just have it go on for another week. Ugh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling to himself, Hajime opened the door, looking around at the bright new day before him. <br>\r\n\"Well, if I'm meant to talk to people, I better start by finding someone to talk with, I guess... Normally, people are at either the cafeteria or the beach. Which should I check first?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hajime shook his head in an irritated manner, feeling his hair covering his face again as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does Mikan deal with this..?\" He wondered for a moment, brushing the hair back out of the way with his hand. \"While I'm stuck like this, maybe I could tie it up, or... Something. Anything to make this a little more normal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing those thoughts away, Hajime focused back on what he was setting out to do - he supposed that there might be too many people at the cafeteria, given how many are normally there. As sad as it sounded, Hajime didn't entirely feel ready to face most of the group with how he currently was, especially if Hiyoko was doing anything akin to her normal tricks. At least at the beach, there'd probably be fewer people, and he could hopefully work toward becoming a little less uncomfortable with his current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking towards the beach, Hajime couldn't help but occasionally itch at his arm, still wondering about those wounds on Mikan's arm. He supposed she <i>was</i> quite clumsy, it was very possible her tripping, or even a medical application mistake, had caused the wounds. Hopefully it wasn't a cause for concern, or anything...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally arriving at the beach, Hajime could hear the crashing of the nearby waves, causing him to look curiously out towards the nearby water. He'd never thought about it before, but the ocean was... Surprisingly calming to look at, during times of stress. It was almost as if some of his anxiety was washing away in front of him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mikan! How's it going?\" Chiaki's voice rung out, causing Hajime to turn around confusedly - Chiaki was looking directly at him, while Nagito stood next to them. If he remembered correctly from yesterday, Chiaki and Nagito had swapped, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Nagito, you know I'm not Mikan. It's me, Hajime, remember?\" Hajime spoke out, an unavoidable timidness spreading into his voice. Nagito's body also turned around, slowly, and gave a silent wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, right! I almost forgot about the swapping thing, haha... Me and Chiaki have just been having fun here!\" Nagito (from Chiaki's body) spoke nonchalantly, motioning his hand to the space behind him. Taking a peak beyond the two, Hajime could see a television set up, with a full video game console and multiple controllers wired to it. How did they even get all this stuff wired up on the beach, of all places?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did..? Wait, what do you mean you forgot? How can you just forget about all this?\" Hajime looked between Nagito and Chiaki, while indicating his arms towards himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that hard, really. Besides, me and Chiaki are more alike than I thought! Well, that's insulting, considering Chiaki is still an Ultimate, without her body or not, while I'm just lowly trash, but... Still, you get used to it!\" Nagito stretched out his arms, as if presenting himself to Hajime. Even for Hajime, seeing Chiaki's body doing something like that felt odd - but Chiaki herself barely seemed to care, continuing to play the game on the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I wish I could agree. Mikan's body just feels... Off. Not to mention her hair keeps getting in my face. Honestly, I kind of admire how well you've both taken to this whole thing. Have you both just been hanging out here this entire time?\" Hajime asked curiously, continuing to brush his hair out of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Nagito's body quietly spoke up, not looking away from the screen, \"We started in my room, but Nagito convinced me to go outside... Usami helped set up the console.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! I've listened to enough of Nekomaru's advice to know how important sunlight is for the body. And I wouldn't want my own bad luck to cause your body to come to harm, Chiaki!\" Nagito's stated in an oddly reassuring manner - even Hajime felt how considerate he was being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I usually prefer to game inside, but this... Isn't so bad.\" Chiaki spoke softly, keeping her eyes on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagito turned back from looking at Chiaki, facing Hajime once again. \"See? There's a lot we can learn from each other. I've been trying to beat Chiaki at Supreme Shatter Bros., but I'm on a losing streak, hahaha...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHajime looked at the screen a little closer - Chiaki was performing a lengthy combo on a black sandbag, her male fingers moving with surprising dexterity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At first,\" Chiaki explained, pointing one of her fingers into the air while continuing the combo flawlessly with her other hand. \"The sets were nearly even - Nagito's fingers are longer and bonier than mine,\" Hajime raised an eyebrow at the term 'bonier', but Nagito didn't seem to mind. \"...But I eventually adapted. If I was more used to it... Nagito's hands might give me more of an advantage, in theory. It makes it easier to reach the back of the controller, and I can keep my hands a little looser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagito chuckled softly, moving back towards the TV. \"Hahahaha! You don't need to compliment me or anything, Chiaki. As it is now, I'm taking at least one stock each set - I bet if you had your original body, I wouldn't even get in a hit!\" Nagito rotated his head around, Chiaki's hair slightly moving in front of his eyes - yet, strangely, Nagito didn't seem at all bothered by the inconvenience. His original body did have pretty long hair, maybe he was used to it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mi-- Sorry, sorry! Hajime, how about you come play some games with us? Usami wants us to socialise, after all. Maybe this'll be what you need to break out that shell you're in?\" Nagito spoke as he sat down, working Chiaki's fingers around the game controller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to join in..? Well...\" Hajime wondered, placing his arm through his hair and on the back of his neck. Playing a game didn't seem so bad right about now, but he did still need to find Mikan. If Nagito and Chiaki had gotten so comfortable just by talking and being friendly, maybe Hajime could do the same by talking to Mikan? It would alleviate some of the anxiety he was sure they were both feeling, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich should he do?</span></div></div>",

Just a few games though, alright?\" Hajime responded, attempting to be as stern as he could with his unimpressive voice - he knew how wrapped up some people got into games, and while he did want to relax for a while, he still had some important things to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine with me! C'mon, Hajime, take a seat next to me, here!\" Nagito offered in a jovial manner. As much as Hajime didn't want to notice it, seeing Chiaki's body acting in such a carefree, joyful manner was... Oddly endearing, especially considering how restricted she normally was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do you main?\" Chiaki asked as Hajime slowly began to walk into the area they were all sitting in, \"Or... Who are you going to play?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiddling with the bandage around his arm slightly, Hajime wondered the same thing as Chiaki. He'd only played the game a few times at friend's houses - and he remembered winning only a couple times in total. That being said, he at least knew some stuff about the characters... Kind of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through the roster on-screen, he could see quite a few characters he recognised, as well as some he didn't. Was this a newer version, or was his memory just bad? Either way, he took the third controller sitting on one of the lounge chairs they'd brought with them (it seemed at least one of them had been waiting for other people to arrive) and began moving the cursor around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Did Mikan's hands always shake this much..?</i> Hajime noted to himself mentally, noticing his own unsteady grip that he couldn't seem to stabilise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... Who do you recommend, Chiaki? I've played a little bit of the game before, but not very well.\" Hajime asked Chiaki, ignoring his own thoughts. Chiaki also looked at the roster with some deep concentration, taking an occasional glance at Hajime's face. Was she... Trying to compare him to a specific character? Does that work for picking video game characters to play?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Usually, I just tell people to play whatever looks good to them, since it's good to learn the characters before picking one, but...\" Given it was Nagito's expressionless face that Chiaki was using for her staring and explanation, Hajime found the whole circumstance mildly uncomfortable, but let it go on anyway. After all, it would be rude to ask her to stop, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should try Lady Talupena. She's a good all-rounder: strong, but she's also not hard to understand. Her nair and bair are both safe options, so you can just use those when you're being pressured, and...\" Chiaki began explaining, before very quickly noticing Hajime's confused expression - probably amplified by Mikan's naturally scared expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha! Don't worry Hajime, you'll pick up on the terminology as we go! Let's start the game, alright guys?\" Nagito interrupted, picking his own character - Viper. As little as Hajime had played the game, he actually recognised that one, and remembered having an insanely difficult time against his friend who played the same character when he was younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Chiaki already had her character picked out in preparation: a white-donned, red-masked, alternate skin for a character Hajime didn't entirely recognise, called 'Jester'. Given Chiaki was playing them, he naturally assumed that they were a good character. Either way, Hajime was fairly sure he was in for a hard time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the game began to load in (once Nagito and Chiaki had finished their back-and-forth over which stage to play on), Hajime tightened his grip around the controller. It was... Surprisingly difficult to get a solid grasp with Mikan's frail hands, he had to admit. That being said, he realised he had to very quickly figure it out, as a missile began hurtling towards him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think fast, Hajime!\" Nagito called out, the missile clearly having come from his character as it smashed into Hajime's character, knocking him away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damnit...</i> Hajime thought, glancing over to Nagito. Chiaki's face looking so joyfully smug was something he didn't entirely expect, but he didn't have time to think about that. <i>I'm gonna have to adapt soon if I'm not gonna come dead last!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeleporting back on stage, Hajime retorted against Nagito's attack. While he was still in endlag from his previous attack, Hajime dashed forward and hit Nagito with a dash attack, comboing it quickly by jumping into the air and pressing the A button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, Hajime. That wasn't a bad combo, for your first game of the day.\" Chiaki spoke up in a calm, passive manner. Clearly, she wasn't breaking a sweat - she still didn't have any damage taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just kind of mashed the buttons, really...\" Hajime stated, a little unsure. Still, if he was lucky with his button-mashing, maybe he could at least beat out Nagito? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hajime hunched forward, getting more focused into the game, Nagito yelled out, \"That's the spirit, Hajime! Just forget about all this real-life stuff and focus on having fun, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then something clicked in Hajime - an odd wave of anxiety wrapping him, questions surrounding his mind;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was he doing playing games when he was stuck as Mikan?<br>\r\nHad Mikan hurt his original body at all?<br>\r\nHow could he win the game while stuck in Mikan's body? There's no way he can keep up!<br>\r\n<i>Chiaki and Nagito are probably going easy, to make me feel better...</i><br>\r\n<i>I can't do anything at all! Not while I'm like this!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden wave of negative thought enrapturing him, he momentarily freezed up, allowing Nagito to get in a Forward Shatter Attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Are you alright, Hajime? That was an easy dodge!\" Hajime looked up, slightly dazed, to see Nagito's concerned expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What..? N-No, I'm fine, really.\" Hajime rubbed his head as he spawned back in, refocusing on what was happen. Still, the rogue thoughts seemed to wrap around his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd have to try and ignore them, for now... But would he be able to? Every time he tried to ignore the thoughts, they just seemed to come back, with twice the force... What could he do? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So, if I was Mikan...\" Hajime trailed off, looking down at his chest once again, his hair descending in front of him. \"Uh, right... If I was Mikan's mind inside of my body, where would I be right now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking for a few seconds, Hajime got hit with a bout of inspiration, and in a sudden reflex he smacked his left hand against his open right palm. Pain stinging him as he did so, he yelped out, \"Ah! That hurt more than it should've... I guess Mikan's body is pretty sensitive. I better be careful...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing his injured hand, Hajime slowly began making his way over to the place he knew Mikan would probably be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I know anything about Mikan, it's that she's probably feeling anxious and self-conscious - more so than usual, at least. If that's the case, I bet she'd be trying to get somewhere safe and quiet, where she can focus for a little bit. There's only one place like that.\" Hajime muttered to himself, making his way over to his own dorm room. Closing in, he saw almost exactly what he expected just outside of the door to his dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Why won't it work? Ah, I'm s-so stupid, I can't even o-open a door right, wahhhh!\" Hajime could see his own flustered body trying (and horrifically failing) to turn a key inside the door lock. In fact, they just seemed to continuously miss the hole completely, hitting every other area of the metal lock instead. Placing his face into his palm, Hajime slowly walked up to Mikan - he could feel his knees trembling in sheer embarrassment for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mikan...\" Hajime spoke, his own manner sounding apprehensive in response to seeing the pathetic state his body was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh! Mik-- I mean, Hajime! I'm Mikan, obviously, I'm sorry! I d-didn't mean to say that! Please forgive meeeee..!\" Mikan's terrified attitude certainly did not mix with Hajime's relatively average voice. Sighing tiredly, Hajime placed his frail arms on Mikan's new, comparatively sturdy, shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikan. Get ahold of yourself, and listen.\" Hajime's gaze pierced Mikan, as she slowly nodded and stifled a whimper, Hajime's ahoge bouncing as she did so.<br>\r\n\"We need to figure something out. You're clearly desperate to get inside, but you have my dorm key, while I have yours. Do you want to swap keys, so we can keep sleeping in our original dorms?\" Hajime gave the most reassuring smile he could in his stressed state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikan looked at the key in her hand. \"U-Um... Are you sure? Y-Your clothes probably won't fit on you properly now, a-and, um...\" She trailed off, but it was clear what she was saying. If they swapped dorms, they'd have their original clothes and tools, but it might be harder to use them in their current bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-And...\" Mikan spoke up again, sounding more anxious than before. \"Usami is doing this s-so we know what it's like to be each other, r-right? Isn't it, ah, in the spirit if we get into our roles as each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHajime looked at Mikan, an almost incredulous look on his face - what was she suggesting? That they embrace it, and try to fully live the life of the other? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikan, do you know what you're..?\" Hajime began speaking before Mikan threw her arms up suddenly in front of her face, and she squealed out,<br>\r\n\"Ahh! I-I'm sorry, I shouldn't h-have said that! It's just that, um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she mumbled for a moment, Hajime moved his hand over to his shoulder. Damn! Mikan didn't know her new strength yet - normally whenever she threw her arms up in reflex, it would weakly slap off of whoever was there, but this time she directly hit Hajime's frail shoulder, causing a stinging moment of pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that...\" Mikan started again, adding a pitifully high-pitched inflection to Hajime's normal voice, \"...All my life, I've been weak, a-and bullied by other people. I want to... I want to know what it's like to be normal, t-to not feel pressured around other people! I, um... Really don't like myself, Hajime: even here, Hiyoko insults me, a-and everyone else feels so much more competent than me... Even if only for a week, I-I feel like I have a chance to not be myself, for once. I-I'm so, so sorry if it's a bother Hajime, but I want to know what that's like. Um... As an apology, I'll let you pick whichever option you want...\" And she loosened her grip on the keys, displaying them in front of Hajime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, Hajime was completely shocked - he was almost sure his feminine mouth was wide open at the moment, as he looked at Mikan. Mikan... Really had had a rough life, huh? He didn't know how, but it must've been something. As much as he still wanted to be in the comfort of his own clothes (rather than the stuffy nurse uniform Mikan always wore), Hajime understood Mikan's plight. Maybe... It wouldn't hurt to go along with it? At least for the week?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the keys, Hajime knew he had an option; demand the keys and enter his room, or let Mikan keep the keys, and help her have the opportunity to feel a little better, for once.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Mikan, I...\" Hajime barely squeaked out, before shortly trailing off. Going silent for a moment, his shoulders relaxed (for what felt like the first time in a while) as he deeply sighed, \"I can't believe I'm going with this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out the keys he'd found in Mikan's pockets earlier, Hajime gripped them tightly, and spoke in a confident inflection - one that sounded strange with Mikan's shaky voice, \"Okay... So, we'll use each other's rooms and clothes, they'll work better for us right now anyway. We each have free reign to try and live the other's live as best as we can using our new circumstances, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikan lightly nodded, staying silent. Hajime hoped he was coming off as helpful, and not too creepy or demanding. After all, Mikan deserved someone to help her out, especially in a time like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we can try to teach each other how our lives work, in turn. For example...\" Hajime moved forward, wrapping his dainty hand around Mikan's wrist. With some difficulty (Mikan's body seemed to have constantly trembling hands), he guided Mikan's hand over to the lock, and clasped her fingers around the key to the door, \"This door has a problem where you need to almost... Flick the key up after you've put it in. Like this! See?\" Hajime demonstrated the proper way to open the door to Mikan, then grabbing the handle and opening the door slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I see... So is that why I couldn't get it to o-open?\" Mikan asked curiously, seemingly warming up to Hajime a little more now that she had calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHajime decided to spare her feelings, momentarily ignoring the fact that Mikan had never actually gotten the key into the lock to begin with. \"Yeah, you just need to know the trick, is all. Come on, I can show you around, if you'd like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Mikan began to take a step inside, and Hajime quickly followed behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Hajime was actually quite impressed with Mikan - she'd successfully gotten inside without tripping, or anything of the like. Looking around, he subconsciously said goodbye to the room, and at the same time wondered to himself what Mikan's dorm looked like, and how it differed to his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking awkwardly forward, Mikan placed her hand on Hajime's bed: the sensation felt oddly familiar to the touch, as if the body was used to the texture. \"S-So, um... Thanks again, Hajime. I-I really appreciate it... Ah, being in a boy's room does feel a little weird, but I g-guess it isn't that different... That's where your bathroom is, and that's where your clothes are, r-right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHajime looked at where Mikan was pointing, nodding with a polite smile. \"Yeah, that's right. They'll probably be in the same place in your dorm, since the building's designed the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It is a little weird, eheh... My room's a lot more, um... Flashier, in a way? N-Not to say your room is bad, i-in fact it's a lot better than mine!\" Mikan started again, before Hajime soon walked over and set next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure your room is fine - I'll have to be staying in it, after all. For now, is there anything you need to tell me about yourself? Anything important that I'd rather not find out about until it's too late, or anything?\" Hajime conversed calmly, his calm demeanour appearing especially weird on Mikan's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I-I think... I should probably say you have permission to do whatever you like to my body, whether it's for hygiene, fun, or anything else. I'm usually used to saying that to people anyway, eheheh... Ah! But, not if you don't want to, o-of course! I-I'm sorry if that's implying s-something bad about you, Hajime!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHajime's smile faltered, as he worriedly looked at his own face, wrinkled in concern. \"Mikan... You don't need to feel afraid. If you're scared of who you are and how you act - don't be, because you're not you right now. Just look at me - right now, I'm you, so if it makes you feel better, try thinking about what I would say, and what I would do. Would that make you feel better?\" And, Hajime hoped, it would make his body look a little less embarrassing in front of anyone else who saw it. \"And, ah, maybe you can get over the whole apologising thing? And maybe stutter a little less? Just as a... Stretch goal, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikan looked at Hajime. For once, her stare was clear, unwavering. Very slowly, she put her arms around Hajime, pulling him into a deep hug - Crap! It was like she had a stranglehold on him! Hajime could barely feel himself as he got squeezed half-to-death and felt his chest press closely against Mikan's. He couldn't quite see Mikan's face, given their heads were now interlocked to the sides each other, but he could feel that she was obviously quite warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Nobody's ever...\" Mikan stopped herself, loudly clearing her throat, before speaking in a (somewhat) direct, semi-confident manner, \"You're really kind, Hajime. I appreciate it a lot. Please, in return, let me show you my dorm as well! You don't need to act like me, of course, but it's good to be prepared, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatting Mikan on the back, Hajime motioned as if to stand up, but was kept firmly in place by Mikan's grasp. In a hoarse, high-pitched voice, he spluttered, \"Y-Yeah... Um... Could you please let go of me, first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quickly as she latched on, Mikan dropped her arms, shuffling backwards, \"S-Sorry! I really should be paying more attention - I'm not used to your arms, Hajime. They're a lot stronger than mine were...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at his fragile skin, Hajime sighed, \"Yeah, I noticed. I'll live with it though, I'm not the pinnacle of human health either. Nekomaru's the type of guy you want to look to for that type of stuff. But I guess his body has Hiyoko in it, now...\" Mikan seemed to flush at the mention of Hiyoko's name, and Hajime quickly moved on, \"A-Anyway, you said you wanted to show me your dorm, right? You want to do that now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikan's face lit up, an energised smile coming to her face - Hajime had never seen his own face like that before. Was he really normally so emotionless?<br>\r\n\"Yes! That would be amazing! Oh, but, um...\" She looked out the window wistfully, \"The sun will be setting in a few hours... I get if this has been really tiring for you - my body isn't that energetic, either. M-Maybe you'd rather go to sleep in my dorm, and I'll come see you some time tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Hajime mumbled to himself, wondering for a moment. Should he go to sleep for now, and follow up with Mikan on the next day, or simply just get the tour finished now, so that they both knew exactly what to do in the future?</span></div></div>",

Standing up, he motioned towards the door and stretched his arm out towards it - again, his eyes focused momentarily on the bandages wrapped across him. By sheer instinct, he almost reached his other arm out to tend to that arm, but stopped himself, turning back to Mikan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should get it done before it's too late, I think. For all I know, we might not get the chance to do it tomorrow.\" Standing next to the door, he moved himself deliberately out of the way, \"You want to lead the way, Mikan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Yes, of course! Um...\" Very warily and slowly, she arose from the bed, moving towards the door in front of Hajime, \"This way, Hajime!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking them both outside, Mikan began to walk away - but, suddenly, turned around to the door once again.<br>\r\n\"Mikan..?\" Hajime started, but tapered off as he watched what she was doing. Unveiling the key Hajime had handed her, she locked the door in an uncharacteristically quick motion, and then looked back to Hajime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured it made sense to lock the door, in case anyone decides to go in, eheh...\" She rubbed the back of her head, wiping her hand over Hajime's ahoge, momentarily flattening it before it sprung back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha... Good job, Mikan. I almost forgot, myself. Guess that makes you more reliable than me, huh?\" Hajime responded with his token patience. Admittedly, he did feel somewhat foolish about forgetting about the door: as much as he didn't think anyone would actually trespass in his dorm, it was just common sense to keep it locked while outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now that that's done, I'll um... Lead the way!\" Mikan exclaimed, emphasizing a manly growl in Hajime's voice. Laughing slightly to himself, Hajime began to follow behind his body, thinking curiously to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe this won't be so bad..? For some reason, seeing Mikan happy... Is a bit infectious. It just makes me want to help her out when I can. I guess, even if I don't have 'fun', or anything, I can at least help Mikan feel a bit better about herself. Maybe--</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh!\" Hajime suddenly squeaked out, his thoughts being interrupted as he tripped forward between the floorboards of the wooden pier connecting the dorms together. Loudly clattering his arms on to the floor, he yelped out in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hajime!\" Mikan quickly turned around, reaching her hands down to help him back up, \"Are you okay? Not hurt, or anything? I should have some more bandages in my apron pocket if you need them, one second...\" She went to reach into one of the pockets on Hajime's clothing, before pulling back, realising her mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's alright, Mikan, I'm fine. Damn... That hurt more than I thought it would. What type of wood is this?\" Slowly getting back up, he brushed his arms, noticing a new bruise scarring his right arm. It seemed Mikan really did injure easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Sorry, that's probably my body's fault - I always had two left feet. Sorry if it's a bother...\" Slumping her shoulders, Hajime rested his palm on Mikan's arm, trying to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's fine. It's not like it's your fault or anything. Gotta have some confidence, okay?\" He winced as a mild flicker of discomfort passed through him, still feeling a bit sore from the fall, \"Besides, you still have to show me around your dorm, right? There's no time to be feeling sorry for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, I understand! I need to respect that you can handle yourself, without blaming myself, or anything.\" Hajime inwardly sighed in mild frustration towards himself as she said that - admittedly, right now, he actually wouldn't have minded the medical help. But, at the same time, he didn't want Mikan to worry too much, so he let it slide. Hopefully Mikan's dorm had some things to help numb the sensation, even if only slightly. As he wondered to himself, Mikan continued, \"So, to the dorm, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry for keeping you waiting. I'll be more careful from now on; let's go.\" Moving behind her, Hajime began towards Mikan's dorm once again, this time keeping an eye on his feet to ensure he didn't trip again. Admittedly, seeing the long, white socks and shoes Mikan always seemed to wear was slightly jarring for Hajime - he'd never worn anything like it, and it still felt strange to see it every now and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching the door, Hajime spoke suddenly, \"Oh! I have the key right now, don't I? Here, let me get it again...\" Reaching into his apron pocket, he unveiled the key he'd been previously searching for - and, as he did so, happened to brush his hand over the syringe he previously poked himself with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's right, that syringe... Should I ask Mikan about it? It might be something important. But, then... Would Mikan really just carry something like that around? I don't want to seem like I'm anxious over nothing, or anything. Especially after that fall: it'd just be embarrassing. And if it's something personal, it might be awkward for her to talk about, which I'd rather avoid right now... Should I really even bother asking?</i></span></div></div>",

Reaching out his other arm, he amicably gestured to the inside, only taking a short glance into the indoors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I almost want to say that you should go in first, since it's your dorm, but... Ladies first, right?\" Hajime joked, as he watched his original body's mouth curl into a light smile, and lightly chuckle: instead of her normal, effeminate, awkward giggle, Mikan really did sound and look almost identical to Hajime. Her mannerisms were still slightly off, as she rose her hand to her mouth, but she was certainly making progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to not pressure her anymore, Hajime stepped inside the dorm, pulling at the end of the bandage wrapping around his arm. While Hajime didn't find himself too personally interested in the equipment inside the dorm, it was certainly to look at! A wide observation table stretched along the back, while rows of Mikan's identical nurse uniforms lined the sides. Medical equipment was scattered (in what appeared to be a form of controlled chaos) across various tables. Admittedly, Hajime had no idea what any of it was, but it was certainly amazing to look at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... You wouldn't mind staying in here?\" Mikan approached from behind Hajime, almost making Hajime jump from surprise. He'd simply been so focused on the room, he must not have noticed her walk in! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I wouldn't mind! It's... Actually pretty nice, I'd say,\" Hajime spoke kindly as he looked at some of the medical apparatus. \"You'll have to show me around. That's the bathroom over there, right?\" Pointing to the same direction that corresponded to the bathroom in his original dorm, Mikan nodded in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Over there is my wardrobe with all my underclothes, so you can use them whenever you need to!\" Hajime was surprised at how confidently chipper Mikan was when talking about a subject like that -- it even made Hajime a little nervous thinking about it. Honestly, he hadn't actually considered the idea that he'd have to bathe and dress as Mikan. Wasn't that kind of an invasion of privacy? But, he supposed, if it made her more comfortable in her new position, then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I make sure to bathe and put on a new set of clothes every day - it's good for your hygiene and health, after all. And if there's one thing I know about, it's health! Ahahah...\" Mikan continued, later trailing off into a small bit of laughter to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, of course. I'll make sure to take care of your body for you, Mikan, don't worry.\" Hearing the words come from his mouth, Hajime realised how creepy that would probably sound in any other context. Continuing to fiddle with the bandage wrap on his arm, he continued half-jokingly, gesturing to the medical equipment strewn across the room, \"But, y'know, I don't think I'll ever learn what any of this stuff does. Seriously, Mikan, you're impressive. You and everyone else here, I feel like I couldn't even imagine being so dedicated to your Ultimate talent. I even forgot what mine was, so I guess I couldn't have been that dedicated to it, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikan raised an eyebrow, showing legitimate concern. Was... Was Mikan worrying about Hajime now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't say that about yourself, Hajime! Whatever your talent is, I'm sure it's just as good as anyone else here. Hey! Um...\" She momentarily raised her arm, but stopped herself, clearly thinking about what she was going to say next. While she still wasn't the most sparkling conversationalist, she was certainly improving, Hajime noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't, ah...\" Raising her arm again, she continued, a newfound confidence within her. \"Since I'm trying to act more like you, given the opportunity, w-why don't you try and act more like me?\" Quickly waving her hands in the air (almost hitting Hajime in the process, as he barely moved out of the way, his hair flowing behind him), realising what she was implying, she went on to explain in further detail, \"What I mean is, uh... You're a lot more 'normal' than I am, and I want to know what that's like. Since you don't remember what it's like being an Ultimate... Maybe, if you try to learn a skill or talent, your own might come back to you? And my body has a knack for healthcare and nursing, in a way! I'm sure it wouldn't be that hard to teach you a thing or two - after all, you're really smart, Hajime!\" Lightly rubbing her neck - she almost seemed surprised that she could feel it without much hair getting in the way. \"And, ah, when you think about it... Most Ultimates are... A l-little eccentric? Maybe reliving that passion and unique way of life might help you remember your past a little more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHajime merely listened, thinking on what Mikan was saying. In any other circumstance, it would honestly be insane. While it didn't sound entirely likely that it would work... Maybe she was right? He thought to himself, this was, quite literally, a once in a lifetime opportunity. Despite the minor chance of it actually working, he considered it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Slowly speaking, Hajime's face almost seemed to naturally crease into a meek, innocent look, \"What you're saying is, you'd teach me about nursing and that kind of stuff, right? I can't say I've ever had an interest, but...\" His gaze went over to the medical equipment. Again, he found himself oddly curious as to what it all was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine if you don't want to, of course! Sorry if it's a little sudden, it's just...\" Mikan's face dropped slightly as she looked directly down at the ground. \"Having someone who <i>understands</i> me, even if just a little bit... Understands what it feels like to <i>be</i> me... I-It really does comfort me a lot, even if it's a little selfish to say... Having you around like this is so, so helpful, Hajime. It's really all I could ever ask for, so it's entirely your choice if you want to do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back up with a passive smile, staring directly at Hajime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Hajime almost wasn't entirely sure how to respond. Could he even say no to that? It was such an honest, well-intentioned request. Although... Was Hajime really comfortable with spending his time on it? He didn't want to disappoint Mikan. What if he just didn't like anything to do with nursing? If she went through all the effort to teach him, and he failed her, then what? Would they not just be better off with walking around as normal, and talking to the others around the island to try and build confidence? He was fairly certain that learning about nursing would take awhile, but if it made Mikan feel more comfortable... That was essentially his main goal right now, after all. What should he do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       </span></div></div>",

The body of Sonia hugging herself and just saying \"Miss Sonia~\" was an obvious giveaway<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?!\" The voice of Mikan said in a very un-Mikan way \"That dumb rabbit turned me into the clumsy broad!\" The foul language gave away that the one in the nurse's body was Fuyuhiko<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHajime looked over to the body of Peko, who had a very creepy look on her face \"To think that worthless trash like me would be blessed to have the body of an Ultimate, even if it's only for a short while\" Nagito said in the body of Peko<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha!\" The body of Chiaki gave a very bold and hearty laugh \"Being this small reminds of before I trained hard every day, Chiaki I'll train your body while I'm you to give you a body that can be called Ultimate!\" Nekomaru said as Chiaki<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body of Hajime walked over to Nekomaru in Chiaki's body and picked up a handheld gaming device that Nekomaru had dropped. \"Okay.\" Hajime's body said and just played the game. Hajime blushed at the thought of Chiaki being in his body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. I feel disgusting\" Maiharu in the body of Togami said. \"How can you stand being this fat?! Don't you do anything to work out?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogami, in Hiyoko's body spoke up \"My body fat is important! How someone can live being this small and thin is something I cannot comprehend\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't insult my body like that!\" Hiyoko yelled from the body of Fuyuhiko<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next person to speak up was Peko in the body of Gundham \"Has anyone else noticed something in particular about this group of swaps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonia, in the body of Nekomaru, finished for Peko \"It would seem that Usami put all of the boys in girl's bodies and all the girls in boy's bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell did you do that for?!\" Akane as Souda yelled at Usami<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I thought that the best kind of first swap would be to mix up the genders, that way you're all used to a different gender in case you end up in one the next swap!\" Usami tried to make an excuse for herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well, I do say that I am quite happy with this\" Teruteru said in his usual tone from the body of Akane<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-can we switch back now?!\" Mikan cried from the body of Nagito<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not yet! Like I said, you'll all spend a few days in every body\" Usami said. She noticed a few people of both genders giving her angry glares \"um, that's all for now!\" She said before vanishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHajime looked down at himself again, he would really have to spend a few days as Ibuki.

While the other four were talking about where they would be \"demon hunting\" Monaca was smiling silent, thinking about how her true plan was bound to work perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four kids were interuppted by the sound of Kurokuma waking up \"Hey Hey! If you guys want to have sum real killa fun, then habe I got a fucking surprise for you!\" He said in his usual vulgar fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caught the kids attention and they all turned to Kurokuma. \"Okay! I probably shouldn't be telling ya about dis, but why the he'll not, when else will I be able to use this! I have a way that yous kids can find a whole bunch o'f adults to kill!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! How?\" Masaru asked, excited by the idea of finding  many adults<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, this is gonna some crazy, but, aw hell, you'll believe me no matta what I say, this whole town is crazy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hurry up and tell us.\" Nagisa said, not having any patience for Kurokuma<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can put some of ya into the bodies of some demons and you can find out where they are hiding, and maybe use your new bodies to lure a bunch of demons into a trap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we take their bodies and do whatever we want with them?\" Kotoko asked, the idea of using and abusing someone else's body appealed to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Yeah! So, whadya say? I can have you 4 be in those bodies for around a day and then habe you switch back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four looked at each other, before turning to Kurokuma again and nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, here we fucking go!\" Kurokuma said and a white light engulfed the four kids. Monaca was not included in the swap as she watched and smiled at the sight in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the light engulfed Masaru, he was happy about the swap. He could be as tall and strong as a demon without getting the old attitude of one. Once the light left his vision, he looked around and could tell that it must have worked. Not only was he now in the middle of town, but he was a lot taller now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw yeah, I bet I became....a big......strong man\" Masaru's sentence slowed down as he heard his voice, that voice was not a man's. He looked down and saw a very female body wearing a white shirt and a blue skirt. \"That stupid bear! He made me a girl!\" He stomped his foot. He recognized his current body as the girl they had recently thrown into the city<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Masaru could do anything else, he heard someone walking nearby. It was another girl with long purple hair and a dress. \"Demon!\" He said in Komaru's voice, he got ready to hit her if she got too close<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeeeey....I'm not a deeeeemon.\" The girl said, some of her words said very slow \"ooooooh wait. I guess I am now\" she said and gave an empty chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasaru recognized that way of talking \"Jataro?\" He asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's meeee\" Jataro said from the body of Toko<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagisa was not enjoying his situation at all. He was currently in a place with many demons, however there was  no way for him to do anything to them. Not to mention that he was very uncomfortable with his new body. He had ended up in the body of an adult women with pink hair. \"This is all Kurokuma's fault. I should have just stayed with our original plan.\" He said angrily in the body of Hiroko Hagakure<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotoko was completely disgusted with the body she had been put into. She had become a man. \"This isn't adorbs at all!\" She yelled in the voice of Taichi Fujisaki. However, as she yelled she began to hear a familiar sound, approaching Monokumas<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the Warriors of Hope home base, Kurokuma was laughing while the confused bodies of the kids were being taken by Monkuma kids to a cell \"I probably shoulda gone over the details before I swapped them! Not only are they now adults, but Da adults are now on their bodies! Oh, and I hope they don't get too comfortable. Now that they're demons, the Monokumas will be trying to kill them. This will be Bella interesting to watch, That's for sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonaca laughed, although the other kids had been put into random bodies right now. She knew that if she asked Kurokuma, she could easily have him pull off a certain swap so she could progress her plan for a war</span></div></div>",

I have something perfect to give you that desire!\" Monokuma exclaimed. Shuichi placed his hand on his chin in thought. <i>A motive? What possible motive could it be?</i> He was snapped out of his thoughts by Monokuma's reveal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to give you a time limit but I received something that could create an even more interesting motive, upupupupu. Instead of dealing with a time limit, You'll all switch bodies!\" Everyone stood in silence, unable to process what Monokuma just said. \"What? No reaction? Are you all speechless at the mere idea of my motive? upupupupu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Switch...bodies. You're joking, right? You got a screw lose in that piece of shit you call a brain?!\" Miu exclaimed, furious. \"EVen if it was true, like hell I'd let someone else parade in my beautiful body. Especially not these shit-for-brains.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have a choice, I'm afraid. If you want to undo it, you'll have to kill someone!\" Monokuma replied, laughing. \"Oh, and before you ask, the swaps are random, not even I know who'll be who until the swap happens.\" <i>Until the swap happens? so he'll know after it then? wait...what am I thinking, this is ludicrous!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if we switch bodies, Gonta no can protect everyone!\" Gonta yelled, panicking.<br>\r\n\"Oh, come one. This'll be fun! What a great way to kick off the killing game.

The gym looked bigger than it did before but no by much. He frowned he didn't like where this led his mind to. He looked down and saw he was wearing a red school girl's uniform and a white bow. Now he knew Monkuma wasn't joking about switching bodies. He was in the body of Maki Harukawa the Ultimate Child Caregiver. He gulped in worry. How was this possible no one should be able switch people's bodies at will it wasn't logical! He shook his head he needed to calm everyone down before anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around the gym and saw that most of the other student were in a similar panicked state. He heard Monkuma laughing and turned toward his voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Upupupu. Hope you enjoy your new bodies because you won't be switching back without a murder.\" Monokuma laughed before vanishing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe called out hoping to restore order, \"Please everyone calm down!\" He flinched at bit at hearing Maki's voice come out. It was strange it sounded like it had a lot more emotion behind it then Maki's usually did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard Kaito's voice call out as well, \"Yeah everyone we need to stay calm. Monokuma wants us to panic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoichi's voice called out in anger, \"What the hell do you suppose we do whoever the heck you two are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi said, \"The first thing we should do is reveal who we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaito nodded in agreement, \"Yeah they're right. I'll go first I'm Kaede.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi then spoke up, \"And I'm....Shuichi.\" He swore he saw a bit of a glance come from Gonta's body, but didn't say anything. Just as it looked liked someone else was about to speak The Monokubs popped out from practically underneath Shuichi causing a bit of breeze. He quickly pushed down the skirt he was now wearing in order to hide his or... hers current panties. Gonta's body looked like it was about squash the Monkubs but held back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Monokubs greeted, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRISE AND SHINE, URSINE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you want to do that?\" inquired Monotaro<br>\r\n\"Revealing who you are could....end horribly for you.\" stated Monophanie, shaking uncontrollably.<br>\r\n\"YEAH!
