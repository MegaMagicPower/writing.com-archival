During the summer; it was hotter, it rained less, people spent more time outside, and the sun rose early... Too early in Cassidy's opinion. He groaned as the light pierced the gap in his curtains, rolling over, then covered his head with a pillow. He didn't care what day it was, it wasn't starting <i>yet</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had spent the majority of last night as Sarah's pen, through a late-night cram session. She spent most of her time writing with him, tapping him on the table, and biting him when she was stuck. She even, almost forgot to turn him back afterwards. All he did was ask her to keep it down. So after a sleepless night, there was no way he was going to get up yet. \"Ca~ass! Mom told me to wake you u~up!\" Except, maybe that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'That'</i> was Cassidy's younger sister. She was a pain. Forget about the amount of times she transforms him. Forget about the constant teasing she deals out. She's the reason he has dirty blonde hair, and not just blonde. He heard Emily running up the stairs, and, he could only imagine, towards his door. This... was not going to be a good day.</span></div></div>",

Maybe it wasn't the <i>best</i> place to hide, but you could hardly expect a well thought out plan so soon after waking up. Still, she was only ten. She probably wouldn't even think to look there... Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door swung open and the little witch quickly skipped over to the bed and pulled the sheets off. \"Rise and shine, Cass!\" She was keen to start her brother's day by waking him up and turning him into her socks or something. Hopefully her mom would believe her when she told him he wasn't there. She might even think Sarah still had him. Looking down at the empty bed, she was confused. Where was he? She was certain Sarah had said she turned him back. Was she lying? Why would she-? Ooohhh... Is he hiding? A huge smile crawled across her face as she slyly scanned the room from where she stood. \"Oh? It looks like he's not here... Oh well. I guess I'll go back downstairs now.\" The game is on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack under the bed, Cassidy watched as his sister approached the bed. She was barefoot. Of course she was barefoot, the only time she wasn't was when she was told to put her shoes and socks on, or when she'd transformed him. He watched with bated breath as her dirty soles and stinking digits came closer. Once at the side of the bed, they were almost touching him. The smell of corn invaded his nostrils as he hoped, with all his might, that she'd leave. Hearing her bad acting, he knew he was in trouble. She was clearly going to look for him. All he could hope for now is that she doesn't find him, or he finds a chance to escape.</span></div></div>",

She checked in the closet, tearing through his clothes and chucking them on the floor; behind his curtains, and even in his drawers. Finally, after an hour or so, a shout came from below. \"Emily! Hurry up! You're going to be late!\" Their mother shouted out to them. \"Coming Mom!\" Emily span on her heels and ran out your door, shutting it on the way out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nListening to the footsteps as she went down stairs, Cassidy relaxed and took a sigh of relief. \"Finally, she left...\" A few seconds later, he heard the front door shut. \"Wait. They left without me?\" Cassidy crawled out from under his bed and looked out his window. \"Yeah, they've gone.\" It was unlikely he'd be able to get to sleep after his little scare but, he thought about staying home from school. He rarely went a whole day without transforming, and he's always punished for playing hooky anyway. Heck, it might even be a relaxing day for once. The problem was, if his Mom found him when she got back... Probably best not to think about it. There's always going to school himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter considering his options for a bit, Cassidy decided to...</span></div></div>",

Emily wasn't the best at hide and sneak. She usually didn't have to try that hard to find her victims, and if she couldn't find them she'd get Sarah or Mom. Sadly, what she lacks in seeking skills, she more than makes up for with determination. She'd keep searching for hours on end 'till she found him. He'd have to escape as soon as he can. Throwing his clothes onto the floor Emily was still rummaging through his closet. She's too close to the door, he'd have to wait a bit longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minuets of trashing his room, Emily walks up to his curtains. Now was his chance. Rolling out from under his bed, he jumped to his feet and dashed out the door, almost tripping over his clothes, strewn around his room. Emily turned around just in time to see her brother escape from his room. \"Damnit Cass!\" She stomped her foot in frustration. A fun morning, ruined by her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPractically jumping from his room Cassidy bounded through the hallway and down the stairs. This was great, he almost believed he wouldn't get out with his body unchanged. He was pretty happy that he'd tricked his little sister. Distracted by his own success, he ran straight into... </span></div></div>",

For Sarah, she made Eggs Florentine, and Emily got a PB&amp;J toasted sandwich and fruit juice. And unlike other days, she still had time to spare... Oh crap! Cassidy! Umm... well he can have... Cereal! Yes, everyone likes cereal, right?... Well he should have gotten up earlier if he wanted something better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEscaping his younger sister, Cassidy was celebrating much too soon. His mother walking into his path, carrying his breakfast to the table, he crashed into her before he could stop. Liandra stumbled back as the bowl of cereal shot up into the air and landed on her son, splattering all over him and the floor. Emily giggled from the top of the stairs, while Cassidy starts to wipe milk off his pyjamas. \"What were you doing!?\" His mom was clearly annoyed. Not only had he ran into her, he was now standing in a puddle of milk and cereal. \"S-sorry Mom.\" Cassidy apologised to her. She sighed, and looked down at the mess her clumsy son had made. \"Well.

Cassidy wiped the milk from his eyes \"I-it wasn't my fa-\" throwing a towel over his face his mom continued to talk \" Wasn't your fault? Let me guess, It was your sisters'...\" Cassidy stayed silent as Liandra stared at him expectantly. \"Look, I know having siblings can be hard, but if they weren't here you'd miss them, so can we skip the blame game?\" Cassidy glared at the floor while drying himself off. Getting one last point in as she mopped the floor around him \"Besides, you shouldn't be rushing down the stairs like that anyway. What would you do if you tripped and broke your head open.\" After cleaning up, as best he could, Cassidy got ready and grabbed a slice of toast before heading out to school.</span></div></div>",

Sarah was drinking her morning coffee and reading over her notes from last night. With all of her exams in school and her mother breathing down her neck about her magic studies, honestly, she was a little up-tight. A lot had to be done, and she was the one who had to do it. Still, at least she finished up last night. All her revision notes done, pretty much, overnight. Cassidy slammed into his sister, knocking her cup and splashing coffee into the papers she was reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the last straw. First; he had the nerve to tell her to keep quiet; then, she had to listen to him moan and complain all night, while she was studying; and finally, he had just ruined all of her hard work, making the entirety of last night completely useless. He was going to pay dearly for this. Noticing Sarah's swiftly increasing rage, Cassidy edged back. \"Uuh... S-sorry?\" She stared daggers into his eyes. \"Yes. You will be.\"</span></div></div>",

Or was she just playing with him? A cruel and twisted game, a Lion playing with it's prey, before the kill... a 30kg Lion \u007fthat still needed help reaching shelves in the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made a move towards the wardrobe, Cassidy's heart raced; her back was momentarily turned, should he go? No, she might see it in her periphery. She stopped in front of his wardrobe, giving a little giggle as she proclaimed \"Well, I guess I'll go now...\" Then suddenly, she grabbed the handles in both hands, and in one motion, threw the doors open. They momentarily obscured her vision, this was his chance! He rolled out from under the bed, and jumped up to his feet, sprinting across the room as fast as he could. He heard a clack behind him, but didn't look back, couldn't look back, his heart was working faster than it had every done before. Not today, please not today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he made it out of the room and onto the landing, he suddenly froze in place, unable to move. The momentum of his run carried him over, and he fell face-first into the floor, like a statue. \"You fell over!\" Emily cried as she ran from his room \"Are you okay?\" In truth, he would much rather experience physical pain than what she had in store for him. \"You shouldn't have run away! Bad Cass!!\" She stood over him now, a look of excitement drawing across her face. \"Don't worry, I'll put you somewhere safe!\" Oh, please no. He knew where this was leading. Perhaps he could cry out to Liandra, their mother? She would put a stop to this if she thought they were late for school, or Emily would do whatever twisted thing she had planned for Cassidy.     </span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Cassidy Childs is a sixteen year-old boy, with blue eyes and dirty blonde hair. He lives with his two sisters; Sarah and Emily, and mother, Liandra. Oh, and they're witches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving no magical potential, Cassidy is mostly overlooked by his mother in favour of his siblings. Through their training he often gets used for target practice and experiments. His sisters also like to play with him; by shrinking him, immobilising him, turning him into bugs or animals, objects or food. However, it's all in the name of fun, and they usually turn him back after a while. He has had curses placed on him before, so that he would transform when someone touched him, and then sent to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to his many, unavoidable absences, Cassidy is looked at as a troublemaker by the school and is punished for his truancy when he can be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Characters:</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Sarah Childs:</b> Sarah is nineteen years old. She has long straight blonde hair and emerald green eyes. Sarah can be quite aloof and cold. She doesn't like people in her way and is ruthless at times. Though she cares about her brother, she often finds him annoying or frustrating just to be around, and will transform him to get him out of her hair. Unlike her younger sister, Sarah seems to care little about teasing or torturing people she transforms, rather she'll tend to ignore them unless they truly angered her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Emily Childs:</b> Emily is a ten year-old aspiring witch who would rather mess around and play than actually study. She looks up to her older sister as a role-model and mentor but they can get into arguments quite easily. Emily absolutely loves her brother, like how one would love their favourite toy, and would never want to lose him. However rough she treats him she wouldn't want him to break, others however will be shown no such care as she would always be able to replace them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Liandra Childs:</b> Sarah, Emily, and Cassidy's mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Regina Hawks:</b> The Headmistress at Cassidy's school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ashley Sterling:</b> Sarah's arch-enemy. Ashley is nineteen and is a skilled witch. She is popular, smart, and strangely athletic. She is used to being the centre of attention and expects to be waited on, hand and foot by others. If anyone tries to undermine her they are swiftly dealt with. She is not beneath using others to get at people, and loves to use rumours and gossip to hurt them. To date, almost everyone who has irritated or annoyed her have been defeated... Almost everyone. Sarah is the only one who has stood against her without submitting to her later. Unable to transform another witch without them surrendering (Circle rules) has stopped Ashley from getting revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Rules:</b></u><br>\r\n<b>1.</b> Please, no one sentence chapters. I won't ask for over 200 words or anything, but try and keep it at least a paragraph long.<br>\r\n<b>2.</b> If Cassidy is killed, the story is over. A few paragraphs or so, explaining what happened after at the most.<br>\r\n<b>3.</b> Try to have at least two options every chapter, it keeps the story open for more.<br>\r\n<b>4.</b> No romanticized smells or tastes. A fart is not about to smell like roses, no matter how many roses you eat, and licking a foot is just going to taste like licking a foot.<br>\r\n<b>5.</b> Cassidy can not be transformed back, unless his whole form is still there. (E.g. Turn him into a glass of milk, you can turn him back. Have a sip, he's stuck.)<br>\r\n<b>6.</b> I really don't want to put this as a rule (It seems so cheesy) but, have fun.</td>",
