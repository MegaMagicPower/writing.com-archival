            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Knight Arthur is a hero. A strong and courageous man, he is 28 years old but looks older thanks to his thick full beard and often grim-set expression. He is muscular, with a broad chest and a strong nose, has fairly short brown hair, and cool blue eyes. He is typically seen in his full suit of <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/0gsthip.png\">steel plate armour</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/0gsthip.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a> with an open helmet. His favoured undergarment is a pair of <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/0Fcg6rV.png\">white strawberry-print boxer shorts</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/0Fcg6rV.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>. He has also been known to wear a large gold circlet studded with jewels beneath his helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Arthur is known as the strongest and bravest warrior in the kingdom of Camelot. In the past, the terrifying world of demons - the Ghoul Realm, sometimes also called \"Makai\" or simply \"Hell\" - has launched attacks on the human world, but each time, Arthur has fought and defeated them. The evil power of the Ghoul Realm causes the dead to rise as zombies and ghosts, and gives birth to many strange and dangerous creatures, from fire imps and poisonous plants to huge werewolves and ice golems. Even the weakest of these creatures is powerful enough to shatter the strongest human armour with a single blow, yet Arthur has braved them all. He has fought through the towers, fire caves, icy mountains and even the stomach of a giant beast in the Ghoul Realm and defeated Hell's strongest leaders, among them Astaroth, Lucifer, Sardius, Azrael and Hades. Even the occasional embarrassment of actually having his armour shattered and having to continue in his aforementioned undergarments was never enough to stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the time of our story, it had been quite a while since Sir Arthur's last victory against the Ghoul Realm and its minions. After plenty of well-deserved rest and relaxation time spent with his frequently-captured love, the beautiful blue-haired <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/18BH7Tr.png\">Princess Prin-Prin</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/18BH7Tr.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>, Arthur decided to embark on journeys around the kingdom every now and then, dealing with monster infestations and exploring uncharted areas. There could be no telling when the Ghoul Realm might attack once again, so he could hardly afford to let his skills get rusty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story finds Arthur on one such minor quest, in the ruins of an old town that seemed to have been built many decades ago. Leftover monsters from Ghoul Realm invasions would often take root in such places, and even if people hardly ever went that way, it was still dangerous to let them just do whatever they wanted. Who knew if some such creatures could find their way into an actual inhabited area one day? Thus, Arthur had taken to clearing out such 'nests' as part of his efforts to keep himself in fighting form. This old town, as well as the cave and thick forest nearby, were reportedly home to a particularly large infestation of monsters - not that it would be any problem for Arthur. He had faced far deadlier foes and worse odds many times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... not even the best can win perfectly every time. Just as Arthur was beginning to clear out the town, he stumbled upon an old treasure chest inside one of the many ruined stone buildings. He'd seen plenty of these in his travels, and was quite used to it. Such chests usually contained weapons, armour or other valuables that he could recover and put to good use. He thought nothing of breaking this one open immediately, as he had done so many times before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is where the trouble started for Sir Arthur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it happened, treasure chests like this could often be found in the Ghoul Realm as well. There, they mostly had the same contents, but also had some more unsavoury additions to the selection. A particularly nasty one was an armed bear trap that would spill out of the chest upon opening it. But that wasn't all. For whatever reason, devilish magicians would sometimes hide in treasure chests in the Ghoul Realm, and would cast a curse on any greedy adventurer who opened it. Strangely, although they lived in the Ghoul Realm, these magicians weren't actually aligned with the forces of Hell that Arthur had tangled with so many times, though they were hardly the friends of humans either. They seemed to be intent on mischief rather than outright evil, thus the lying in wait to surprise treasure hunters. As for the actual curses cast by these magicians? These would transform their victims into any number of different forms, though always something mostly or completely helpless. Fortunately the spell would only last for around five seconds, though in the depths of the Ghoul Realm's most dangerous reaches it might as well be five hours sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you beginning to see where this is going? Sure enough, thanks to the particularly high Ghoul Realm infestation in this place, one such magician was hiding within the very chest that Sir Arthur had just opened so carelessly. His fear of becoming too complacent had come true. Completely taken by surprise, he was unable to slay the magician before he could cast his nefarious jinx, nor dodge the spherical magic blast that flew towards him. The hex struck Arthur square in the chest, and he was enveloped in a sudden poof of smoke as the magician swirled his cloak and vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow this was all a real stroke of bad luck for Arthur, but it wouldn't be so bad, right? After all, there were no other monsters right here and the transformations only lasted for five seconds or so. He could just wait it out here and be fine apart from a bit of momentary, private embarrassment. Ordinarily, that would be a fine plan, but there was a big problem... you see, this particular magician and his spell were a bit... \"abnormal\", you could say. While it transformed just like usual, it also lasted longer than five seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA <i>lot</i> longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><div align=\"center\"><b><u>But just what had Arthur been transformed into?</u></b><br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Transformation pictures: <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/tJYWanp.png\">[1]</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/tJYWanp.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a> <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/uJHyTAo.png\">[2]</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/uJHyTAo.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a> <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/VDDp4yJ.png\">[3]</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/VDDp4yJ.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a></font></div></font></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the smoke cleared from around Arthur and his vision returned, he immediately noticed by sight that his height had drastically decreased. He also became aware straight away that his body was possessed of a very different structure and mechanism. He could therefore easily intuit that this was one of the non-humanoid transformations, which he particularly hated due to the immensely alien feeling of them, as well as the dehumanising aspect of being unable to speak or express emotion, or use objects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the senses of his body shape and muscles - though possibly more from the loud croak of annoyance that escaped his throat - he realised that he was in the form of the first transformation he had ever encountered: that of a giant, fat green frog, standing some half the height of a man. He noticed the sudden attractiveness of the thought of eating various insects and felt no small measure of disgust; the mental changes of these transformations were always relatively minor, but very offputting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInwardly cursing his carelessness, he hopped slowly around with feigned amusement. Perhaps this embarrassment was what he deserved for such an inexcusable lack of vigilance, he thought wryly, expecting the imminent return to normal. As the seconds ticked by, he began to notice that this transformation was lasting longer than usual. <i>Perhaps I'm merely misremembering the length of time it took,</i> he thought. <i>After all, it's been a long time since I last fell for this trick.</i> He sat and waited patiently, trying to ignore his growing worry.<br>\r\nMore seconds passed. Then the seconds turned into minutes, and any light-hearted thoughts were now completely out of Arthur's mind. He realised now that this magician had looked rather different than usual, with different colours and a more ornate cloak, as well as a more ominously shadowed face. Could it have been a more powerful individual than those he had encountered before? The minutes continued to stretch on as he waited, his amphibian throat bulging and shrinking as he breathed nervously, now wishing fervently for the curse to end quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly, he heard scuffling from the doorway, of some monsters that had worked out where he had gone and begun to follow him into the old building. He would have no choice but to run, back into the old village where many more hostile creatures still lurked. What could he possibly do in this form? His only choice would be to try to flee back to safer regions, while still in the ungainly form he currently occupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the fanged snout and glowing red eyes of some undead beast thrust its way menacingly into the room, Arthur was forced to make his decision. With a powerful flex of his back legs, the frogged knight leapt up and out through a crumbled wall, back into the pale moonlight of the little former town. Evil eyes and ears without immediately fixed upon the movement as he burst from the hole; those twisted minions that had been so easily dispatched just moments ago now presented a huge threat. And yet, with his newly acquired jumping power, Arthur was able to rapidly leap back and forth, weaving between encroaching foes and leaving them swiping and clawing at nothing but empty air. He sprang back and forth, his bulky form easily carried by the proportionate strength of his legs, feeling thankful that at least the transformations always granted immediate instinctual familiarity with how to use their new forms. Though he zig-zagged, his direction was broadly focussed on the overgrown trail leading out of the town to relative safety. There he would have time to properly consider his situation and find a cure for this curse. Even as he thought it, he remembered hearing that the curse of a frog's form could be cured by the kiss of a maiden. And what better maiden was there than his own fair Prin Prin?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if it was merely an old wives' tale, Prin Prin would surely be able to help him anyway. Strength and courage welled anew in his heart as he thought of her. He could never be stopped by mere magic trickery! His next course of action affirmed, Arthur the Giant Frog hopped swiftly through the minor horde of monsters, in search of safety.</span></div></div>",
