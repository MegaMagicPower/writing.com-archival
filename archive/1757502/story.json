Then again being a pokemon he doesn't wear clothes himself so probably doesn't realize why suddenly being naked would be a bit of an awkward ordeal for you. Thankfully being alone with your pokemon the embarrassment is not as bad as it could be, and is largely outweighed by the shock that you're only a foot tall. Pikachu is now a few inches taller than you and doesn't seem that concerned about the shrinking. Well, he was the one who did it! You're not sure how he did it but somehow he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the shrinking over your pikachu tackles you quite happily to give you an affectionate hug. Being a little bigger than you he easily knocks you off your feet as you tumble backwards onto the ground with him nuzzling his head against you. Luckily, neither one of you are very heavy so neither the tackle or fall hurts you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle a bit to get him off, but pokemon are quite strong for their size and while you seem to be quite a bit weaker after being shrunk. After about a minute you give up and just rub his ears with one hand and wait for him to finish and let you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes alright you've had your fun.\" You respond. \"Now change me back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chu?\" Pikachu tilts his head and looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was a one way thing wasn't it?\" You ask have grumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika pi!\" Pikachu replies with a goofy smile. He doesn't seem to radiate any malice or ill intent. He looked so innocent in the situation you find it hard to actually be mad at him. Still if this doesn't wear off it's certainly going to make general living more difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika pi!\"Pikachu seems to be trying to get your attention. You wonder if it had any plans for what to do now that he's shrunken you. Either way he quickly runs over to the front door. Pikachu nimbly jumps up and grabs onto the door handle pulling it down and letting the door swing open. \"Chu pi pika chu!\" He gestures to you then runs outside, then pokes his head back through the door and stares at you. It appears he wants you to go outside with him. It's not as if you can spend the rest of your life hiding in your house, you'll need food eventually so maybe you should follow him. On the other hand, you're feeling rather vulnerable being only a foot tall and naked so maybe heading outdoors isn't the greatest idea right now.</span></div></div>",

His massive toes twitched and shuffled a little as the massive, yellow behemoth decided what he would do with you.

His giant form looked even more imposing from this angle, and you have to crane your head back as far as it would go before you're able to see the giant mouse's face looking down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to get abit unnerved by the cocksure grin your enormous buddy was wearing, when you saw \u2013 and felt \u2013 the furry mountain move. Your pikachu was merely sitting down, but in your tiny state it was like watching a jumbo jet land withing arms reach. Just the impact of his fluffy butt crashing into your sofa cushions had enough force to nearly knock you off your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you felt confident you were not about to topple over, you notice your pokemon had propped his feet up. The giant paws are as wide as you were tall, and loomed over you at nearly twice your size. Your giant friend happily chirps at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika Pi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have always had a knack for understanding your partner even though he only ever could say his own name, but this time your comprehension of your pet's babbling fails you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika!

Are you trying to tell me how to get back to normal?\", you hopefully guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chuuu\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seems disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry pikachu, but I don't understand what you want. Are you hungry? I think we have...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get cut off by your partner standing up again and gently knocking you on your back with his foot. Gently to him atleast, you felt like you just got hit by a fluffy truck and were left gasping for air,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can recover, you find him casually placing his massive paw ontop of your prone form. The pressure isn't near enough to hurt you, but still makes you appreciate the many tons of pokemon currently suspended above. Still reeling from the impact, you cough uncontrollably into the thick yellow blanket covering you. Your face feels damp when the fit subsides, and your next breath carries with it the scent of dirt and wet grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chuuuu....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtleast your friend seems to be enjoying himself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't really understand what has gotten into your pikachu to make him act like this, but you needed him to take his foot off of you and help you find a way to get back to your normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing trapped like this heavily limits your options, and you doubt he'll be able to even hear your voice through his thick paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You could hardly believe this was really working!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piiiii!\", you heard you friend gleefully exclaim, before letting his massive foot bear down on you harder then ever before. It took every ounce of strength to keep your arms from buckling under the extreme weight. Was your giant pet trying to kill you? Fortunately, the pressure did let up a bit, though not enough for you to feel comfortable just yet. You felt the fluffy ceiling above you shift again, sideways this time instead of down. Your pikachu was letting his paw trace circles over your helpless body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel the slightly matted fur flow over and through your outstretched fingers. The tips pushing deeper into the scented skin of the yellow mouse's sole. You could also hear your fluffy companion coo softly high above you, apparently taking great pleasure in tormenting you like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were racking your brain over any clue that might cause your pet to be angry with you. Had you hurt him somehow? Neglected him? Nothing really springs to mind, especially since he seemed to stay friendly enough at first. He only started punishing you when you were unable to figure out what he was trying to say, and even then he didn't really seem to have any malicious... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt suddenly clicks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had frequently played around with pikachu while lazing on the couch. Scratching him behind his ears, his back, tummy, chin. You had noticed he tended to get very energetic and playful whenever you gave any attention to his paws. Sometimes you'd indulge him. Running a thumb along his sole and letting your fingers play with his toes, usually when you'd be reading a book or watching a movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems your companion decided that his feet deserved your full attention for once, and was asking you for a footrub earlier. When you didn't listen to him, well, he was easily large enough to take whatever he wanted from you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy at the realization that your mountainous pet atleast isn't actively trying to hurt you, you...</span></div></div>",

The silly sight of his tiny owner making himself even smaller caused the mouse to softly chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before you found yourself submerged in the shadow of his fluffy feet, coming face-to-face with his rough heel. You stood up and started by hugging the furry wall, nuzzling your face deeper into the center of his sole. You'd always taken good care of your pet's hygiene, so the smell wasn't too bad. Earthy, with hints of wet grass. Like walking through a forest after a downpour. Of course this particular forest was yellow. And it met your hug with soft fur, supple skin and overpowering muscles underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike our hypothetical forest, this one too was humid. The small beads of sweat that collected on your pet's fur leaving their roost to adhere to your skin at the earliest opportunity. Their cool touch was actually soothing, helping to combat the constant heat radiating from the bottom of his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly began your service, showering the foot with kisses. You let your hands roam over the yellow sea, pressing your fingers deeper into the skin underneath. You find several tense knots underneath the hairy plain, slowly but surely coaxing them loose. You keep this up until you had tended to every part of the foot within your reach, being constantly encouraged by your pets happy sighs whenever you manage to deal with a particularly stubborn patch of tense muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't heard anything from the massive mouse for a while now though, and you long to see the goofy look he must currently wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sneakily poke your head out around the paw, and see your furred friend is..</span></div></div>",

Shining with slickness in the sunlight breaking through your windows. One of his front-paws firmly wrapped around it, gently moving along the length of the shaft. The other paw is clenched tightly into the back support of your couch. His little nails already having pierced the cloth several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face, far in the distance, is one of pure bliss. Mouth partly agape, and his brow occasionally furrowing as he increases his rhythm. Soft, shallow pants make his chest rise and fall rapidly as he inches closer to the edge,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou duck back into the shadow of his paw. This could not be happening. Your pet was not getting off by you tending to his foot. You try to physically shake the image from your head, but it seems to be seared into your memory. Though, he looked so happy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNO!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou throw yourself into his sole.Trying to hide from your own mind. Clenching your eyes shut in a vain attempt to unsee. This had the exact opposite effect. Without outside input, images of his paw sliding along his shaft, and his ecstatic expression keep bubbling through the front of your mind's eye. You also start picking up sounds that had been previously relegated as background noise. His rough pawpads sliding smoothly across slick flesh. The occasional gasps of pleasure. You could feel the thick toes above you clench through foot as he approaches climax. The previously acceptable smell of his paws now smothered you like a heavy blanket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all became too much for you, and your hips started grinding against his rugged heel unwittingly. All the while you were desperately trying to disappear into his footfur. Wishing it would just swallow you up and take you far away from this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn ear shattering squeak announced your pet's release to the world. The sound of your lifelong partner achieving sexual gratification was enough to send you over the edge as well not long after. You were dimly aware of what was happening, but are helpless to stop it. Thrust after thrust, you pour your semen in the mouse pokemon's footfluff. All your energy seems to vanish with it, as if the mighty paw was devouring your very life force. You weakly clung to the fur to keep yourself upright, capable of doing nothing but breathe his foot scent as you bask in the afterglow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt eventually subsides. Though your knees still wobble weakly, you can stand on your own strength once more. You start to think clearly again, the pleasure induced fog in your mind slowly dissipating,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a step back from the towering foot, and you find yourself going beet red when you discover pikachu had been staring at you for some time now, grinning mischievously. You try to come up with something, anything, to explain how what just happened hadn't actually happened, but any coherent idea immediately disintegrates as you stare into those knowing eyes. Your mouth opens and closes, but produces no sound. Like a fish on dry land desperate for water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant rodent giggles adorably, and gently lowers a massive finger to pat you on the head in approval. Like he was proud of you for giving yourself to his feet. You felt even smaller than you already were. A tiny, insignificant speck standing before an  all-powerful titan. Somehow lucky enough to not get its existence utterly erased. You somehow knew the balance of power in your relationship with pikachu had just irreversibly shifted away from you. You weren't sure returning to your original size could restore it. You weren't even sure you cared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu had realized it too. He giggled in excitement thinking about what he could taunt you with next. Pets need rules after all, and he was coming up with the very first one he would have you learn to obey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...</span></div></div>",

Tender as you were from the mind-warping sexual experience you just had, you still found yourself growing stiff. It wasn't even a conscious effort; its potent musk, combined with the slight humidity of the air and the remains of the climax it gently coaxed out of you, was simply too alluring for you to resist. The little resistance left in your body was unable to overcome this foot-induced stupor; in fact, you firmed even faster when he scrunched his sole to entice you... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pikapika!\" Pikachu yipped, shaking his foot in front of you. You were knocked out of your trance when he actually touched it against your body. Did he want something from you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at your Pokemon, waiting for further instruction like a well-trained pet. He gives you a sultry smile that heats you up as much as that little headpat from before. Lifting a paw up to his face, he pretends to lick up his palm, then points to you excitedly with a sharp-nailed finger. A hot rush spreads through your body as you realize what he wants you to do, and how much power your trusted partner has over you right now. If things continued like this, you weren't sure if you'd ever leave his sight again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith less reluctance than your self from a few moments ago would hope, you lower your face closer to where you left your guilty emissions. Even though the thought of sampling your own spooge disgusted you, something about the heady odor and damp, pleasant touch of Pikachu's soles made it hard to care. After a bit of preparation (and a few deep breaths of your partner's peds), you stick your tongue out, and lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, the bitter taste of spunky hits you, soon dampened by the strong, salty flavors of the excited paw in front of you. Hints of grass and dirt work their way into your mouth, but they hardly fazed you, entranced as you were with the bright yellow paw. Over and over, you stroke your Pokemon's foot with your tiny tongue, getting more into it with each loving sweep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could already hear Pikachu going at it again; his muffled squeaks were like music to your ears. His unrepentant enjoyment of your worship spurred your lust forth, and you couldn't help but buck into his wet footfluff, set to dirty it all over again. It's not a problem, really. After all, it just means you have more paw to worship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you've finished cleaning up your mess, you hear your partner fire off again, squealing in glee at your sign of complete submission. Once again, you feel your own release rev up in tandem with his. Images of his ecstatic pumping and overjoyed moaning flood back into your mind. Overcome with pleasure, you hug yourself tightly against the sweaty appendage, bite into a tuft of fine, dampened hair, and suck as you ride out your heavenly climax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't nearly as awkward as your first; any semblance of regret you had was mostly suppressed by how accustomed you've become to being beneath your Pokemon's peds. For a while, you two just sit there, taking in the addicting feeling of touching each other and cumming in unison. It was a very unequal embrace, but for some reason, that didn't really bother you anymore. It felt...natural, just wrapping your arms around Pikachu's foot. Like it was your calling to be here, underfoot, servicing your partner with not an ounce of hesitation in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you both relax, slumping against your respective rests. Pikachu's eyes were closed, and a look of utter bliss was on his cute, blushing cheeks. You were sporting a similar expression as you nuzzled deeper into the tender hug you were giving to his foot. Somehow, you regain enough cognizance to understand you weren't yet done with your task. Though your arms and loins were weak with contentment, you still managed to slip down the steep slope of his arch, rearing your head back just enough to avoid smearing your new load all over your face. Gently, you licked up the mess, sending pleasant tingles through your partner's limp form and extending his afterglow. The taste was still somewhat unpleasant, but that hardly mattered to you now. His needs came first--as these past two orgasms have shown you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the fog in your brain wears off, you briefly rest your head upon the plush instep in front of you. Indecision floods your puny mind; you want to get some rest, but you <i>need</i> to see what Pikachu wants to do with you next. Eventually, you peek your head out and glance at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Pikachu...are you still awake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, you heard...</span></div></div>",

Your Pikachu, however, hops onto your lap and stays there, not moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her in confusion, and see that she's staring at you with an odd expression. As you watch her, you realize that her cheeks seem to be glowing, and giving off bizarre purple sparks. You've never seen your Pikachu emit sparks of that color before.

You black out just about instantly, and wake up with a headache. You glance around, and realize to your shock that everything seems way bigger than it should.

And finally notice the shadow looming over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you see your Pikachu standing over you on her hind legs. She's frighteningly huge now, and her big dark eyes are staring down at you intently. You stare back, awed by the size of your once little friend. So awed that you can't react to what happens next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Pikachu leans over and reaches out with both arms, and you realize she's about to grab you. Her paws come around either side of you and clamp you between them, the soft undersides countering the tightness with which she holds you. Having secured a grip on you, your Pikachu lifts you off the couch and up to her face, now about as tall as you are, and continues to stare at you. You can't tell what she's thinking, but you hope that she's not planning anything bad. You're in her grasp, and you can't escape. You just have to sit and see what she does to you...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your name is Jackson Bivolt, but everyone just calls you Jack. You are a dedicated young pokemon trainer who has a preference for electric types, and you have captured many powerful ones so far. You were always a fairly unorthodox trainer, as you never wanted to evolve any of your pokemon. Your motto was to make them as powerful as you possibly could without changing them, and all of your pokemon seemed to like you more for not forcing evolution on them like some other trainers might. You were currently training with a special pokemon in the middle of the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecently, you had received an egg from the pokemon daycare center. It had hatched only a few days ago, and to your surprise, the pokemon inside of it was a shiny Pichu. From the moment you looked each other in the eye, you felt a special bond had formed between the two of you. In the time after she had hatched, you had started training vigorously together. By now, she was proving to be amazingly strong. To your amazement, she was now capable of defeating many opponents that not even your Raichu back home was able to defeat. Her electrical attacks were as dangerous as she was adorable. You were in awe at how powerful she had become in just those few days of training, and you enjoyed the fact that Pichu was always by your side. Seeing the immense amount of raw voltage that she was capable of producing so soon after hatching, you could tell that there was clearly something special about this Pichu. You had eventually decided that she would be your partner for the remainder of your journeys as a trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter wrapping up another day of intense training, you and Pichu sat down next to each other to watch the sunset and relax. You reached out and rubbed her head, and she smiled up at you in joy. As the sun set, you decided that it would be best to go to bed now so that you could get up early in the morning. Crawling into your sleeping bag, you cuddle up with Pichu next to you and fall asleep. Little did you know that moments after you fell asleep, Pichu got up out of the sack and wandered off into the woods by herself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you woke up, Pichu had already returned. She was now standing on top of your stomach and holding a strange looking berry in her hands. Seeing you awake, she set the berry down on top of you and smiled. You didn't think anything of it, as Pichu had often brought back oran berries and the like for you to eat for breakfast in the past. You trusted that she would be able to tell the difference between a safe berry and a poisonous one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, thanks Pichu... You brought me breakfast again... That's sure nice of you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu simply smiled at you and responded with a typical \"Pichu!\" cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach out and pluck the berry off of your chest and toss it into your mouth. It tastes absolutely delicious, but moments later, you feel yourself loosing consciousness. When you wake up again, you are startled to see that everything around you is much bigger than before. What's more, your 1 foot tall Pichu is now towering over you! At your current size, she looks like she's at least 50 feet tall! You begin to panic, but suddenly you hear a soothing feminine (if not a bit childish) voice calling out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Jack, I won't let anything hurt you... Please calm down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your state of shock, you look around the immediate area for the source of this voice. You soon realize that the only one around was Pichu, but she couldn't have said that, could she? You decide that there's no harm in trying to talk to her and find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pichu? Did you say something just now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your shock, she actually answered you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Daddy Jack, I did. I'm sorry if I scared you earlier...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?! How did you just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was the berry I gave you! It shrank you and gave you the ability to speak pokemon language! Isn't it awesome, daddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm... I guess that it's kinda cool... But why would you do this to me, Pichu?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Because I love you, daddy! I thought that if I shrunk you like this, then I would be able to take care of you and protect you the way that you always did with me! Don't you think that it'll be fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but what about being a pokemon trainer? I can't really go on my journey at this size, can I? Don't you want to face all of the region's gym leaders with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I do daddy! Don't worry though, the berry only lasts for about a day or two. Unless you eat another one, you'll turn back to normal by that time. Unfortunately, you won't be able to talk with me anymore unless you do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as much as I want to get back to normal and continue with my journey, I think that this could actually be a lot of fun. Pichu, do you think that you could take me to where you found that berry? I think that we should stockpile them to use during our time off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean that you aren't mad at me, Daddy Jack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, Pichu! We're partners, and I trust you. I honestly wouldn't mind doing this whole 'shrink and hang out with you' thing whenever I have free time. I actually kinda like it. Mostly the being able to talk to you part, but I must say that seeing things from this angle is quite interesting as well. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! Thanks daddy, I love you so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPichu then picks you up off of the ground and cuddles you into her big red cheek. Feeling Pichu's body heat from this size is surprisingly calming, and you can't help but reach out and hug her cheek. Pichu simply giggles and holds you out in front of her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Daddy Jack, what do you want to do now? We can always go get some more of those berries for later if you want, or we could play a game together for now and do that later! What do you think, daddy?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For six years, ever since coming of age as a Trainer at ten, you have played and explored and travelled with him. He started off as a Pikachu, often climbing up on your shoulder when you went anywhere. Through sheer willpower, you managed your way through beating Brock, the first gym leader, and the Water Gym Leader Misty had been no problem. After you fought and made a close victory over Lt. Surge, he'd offered you a Thunder Stone, saying that the decision to evolve should be made between Pokemon and Trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you and Pikachu had decided to use it, and he evolved into the Raichu he is now. Shortly after, you returned to Pallet Town, having come to an unfortunate loss at the fourth Gym. Now experienced, the two of you spend your days relaxing and training to become stronger, in hopes to eventually take the Gym Challenge again and maybe get into the Indigo League someday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, though, you're taking a short break, sitting out in the backyard with the tall white fence. Looking over, you see Raichu panting softly; he looks over at you and smiles, then reaches out and hugs you as much as he can; after all, he's only two and a half feet, and his arms are a little stubby. Suddenly, you feel very strange, as if the world is wobbling around you.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, a odor surrounds your nostrils. You and Raichu were so focused on training that you haven't bathed him for a while. That, as well as your location near Raichu's ass, created the stench that hovering over you right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnough sitting around. You quickly stand up and assess the situation.

It takes a few minutes for you to regain your senses, and he first thing you notice is that you are in a tight, warm and furry place. You opened your eyes to find yourself staring directly into your partner's tight asshole. Your Raichu had sat on you, and now your tiny body was imprisoned between his enormous buttcheeks, lodged deep into his crack. You hear Raichu sigh with relief as he relaxes, having no idea his trainer was lodged firmly into his behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to get his attention, but how? You try squirming around, try squirming free, but his cheeks clenched together, only drawing you closer to your Raichu's rancid hole. The stench you had detected back when his rump was merely above you had increased one hundredfold, and you were having trouble staying conscious. The clenching of Raichu's ass eventually brought you close to his anus, your face being pressed against his firm pucker.

You can just taste the static electricity that fills the air all around you, drawing your hair toward the ceiling.  You're probably not in immediate danger, but this isn't a great place to stay, what with the thick musky aroma hanging in the air.  This miasma is strong enough that it may as well be visible, radiating off Raichu like a smelly aura...  Not that you can see it, or anything else in the completely black void you find yourself in.  It is lucky that this part of Raichu was soft enough that you could sink into it, instead of being crushed.  But, what would be that soft?  Not his rear, he's sat on your shoulder enough times to prove that.  The furry roof then trembles and slides around with a loud scraping sound, dragging you with it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaichu gives his itchy sack a few more scratches before settling back and looking around once more.  This is where his trainer was, but... where'd they go now?  \"Chuuu...\"  He worriedly proclaims.  He knows that they wasn't feeling so good before, so they've probably gone inside.  All the same, the electric mouse has a bad feeling about this, like something terrible has happened to his beloved trainer.  With the intention of going inside the house, he pushes himself off the ground, not noticing his extra baggage.  You, meanwhile, are wedged in the cleft of your Raichu's ballsack, rubbed between the sweaty testicles as he rises.  You struggle to get free, but this only makes things worse for you as you feel the confining walls tighten and hear the blood pumping into the rapidly forming tower high above you...    Raichu purrs as he feels his pink tip peaking from the white sheath, slowly growing higher.  Or...  he thinks to himself, a light blush coming to his cheeks, he could find a way to take care of this first.  He decides to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Charmander suddenly appears from over the edge of the couch, her two clawed hands grasping the edge and pulling herr body up so that you can see her head. Her large blue eyes--even larger now--are aimed right at you, and a grin appears on her face as she lets out a happy cry. You stare in shock, unable to react as one of her hands shoots forward and grabs you.

However after a few minutes of trying to find something to watch you quickly give up and turn the television off. Sighing in boredom you glance out the window. It's pouring out. Once again you sigh, you really wanted to go outside and play a little with your pokemon but there was no chance of that happening with the rain. As your wondering what to do your beloved Chameleon walks up to you. He also looks out the window and you reach out and pat his head. \"I know buddy\", you say. \"I want to play too.\" Just then it looks like your pokemon gets an idea and walks off. He comes back with a paw full of berries<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've never seen this type before. They look like oran berries but have green dots on them. Wondering if there even eatable, your pokemon excidely shoves them in your face. You look at your Chameleon. His tail is wagging excidely and he's staring at you with hopeful eyes as your pokemon continues to push the berries he has closer to you. He obviously wants you to eat them. But your not sure if you want to. Just then you notice that Chameleon is covered in dirt and mud and there's a leaf poking through his stubby horn. Your pokemon obviously went to alot of trouble to get these berries for you. He must have gone out before the rain started and picked them for you. Touched by your pokemon's generosity you reach down and pick one up. Then you pop the berry into your mouth and chew,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fruit taste sweet and you pat your pokemon's head as you continue to chew then swallow. You then happily eat the other berries until their gone. \"Thanks buddy that was really...\", you trail off as you start to feel lightheaded. You stand up only to feel dizzy. The whole house seems to be spinning. Were those berries poisonous you wonder. No your pokemon would never do anything to hurt you. You look down at Charmeleon but your vision's starts to blur until you can only see a red blob standing below you. Feeling sick you start to sit down and close your eyes hoping the feeling will stop. You think yo feel your clothes getting looser but are to disoriented to confirm. Little by little you start to feel better but suddenly feel very cold. You reach above your head for the blanket but grasp nothing. You wait for the feeling to go away as you continue to try and reach the blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you feel something warm touch your belly and can feel your self being lifted in the air before being set down on something equally warm. Still feeling cold you open your eyes and look around. Your still in your living room but everything seems to be farther away. The bookshelf and front door seem to be much more then a few steps away. Turning around you notice that your sofa is much bigger then before and a giant t-shirt is resting on the couch. Looking down you nearly jump. Not only are you butt naked but you appear to be on a red surface. Tapping it gently it feels hard but warm at the same time. Turning around you shriek in surprise as your Charmeleon's build board size face smiles down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing your standing in the palm of your pokemon's giant hand you attempt to back away. But are stopped as you pokemon uses his free hand to gently pick your body off the ground and hold you delicately between two fingers. You struggle violently to escape your pokemon's grip. But no matter how much you struggle your Charmeleon holds you with ease. After a while you give up and look up at your pokemon again. Taking in to account just how big he seems you wager you must be only an inch tall to him. This scares you as your unsure what your pokemon wants with you this size. Just then your pokemon gives off a near loud call \"Char\", while continue to smile happily down at you, tail wagging. Realizing that your pokemon only wants to play you slowly calm down and eventually grin up somewhat uneasily at your large friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just want to play, huh.\" You say somewhat timidly. Your pokemon barks out excitedly \"Char\", only to cover his mouth when he realizes that his voice hurts your ears. Your pokemon sets you down gently on the sofa and stares at you for sometime. You now know that your pokemon only wants to play with you. Walking up slowly you pat his now massive snout as he watches you carefully. \"Still did you have to shrink me to want to play?\" You ask your now giant pokemon. In actuality you don't really mind being shrunk. Well okay you mind a little, but you've had Charmeleon since he was an egg. Your pokemon would never want to hurt you, so as long as he's the one who shrunk you, you know you'll be safe. So you'll go along with it for now. \"Okay big guy, we'll play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pokemon is so happy that he gives you a massive lick coating your tiny body in saliva. You laugh a bit as you barely avoid being knocked on your butt by the massive muscle. Charmeleon then begins to shower your body with massive kisses as your helpless to do anything but laugh and try to push the massive tongue off you. After a while Charmeleon stops and picks up your now saliva drenched body and places you in his palm. \"Okay big guy what do you want to do first?\" Charmeleon thinks for a few seconds before placing you on the soft carpet and...</span></div></div>",

You see him working through that he nearly sat on you and see shock and fear in his eyes. Your Pokemon gently yet firmly grips you between two digits and places you safely in his palm. Looking you over carefully. And very very gently pushing and probing your body to make sure you aren't hurt. You slap away his fingers slightly miffed at the big Pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charizard\", you start. \"Do you have any idea what I've been through. You nearly sat on me. I had to climb you to get your attention. you nearly ate me, and to top it all off I nearly fell to my death because of your careless actions.\" Charizard stares at you miserably. You continue ranting and raving at your Pokemon until you notice that the big Zard is on the verge of tears.  You realize he didn't mean to do any of that stuff and that maybe if you had been more patient Charizard would have realized where you were and helped you out. Plus almost being eaten was your idea. You sigh and calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look big guy\", you say. \"I don't mind being small. I really don't. I like that your taking care of me and all. But you've got be more careful around me.

Charizard has nearly crushed and eaten you, and you feel somewhat on edge as you are now dodging your massive Pokemon's stomping feet. But because Charizard still wants to play you reluctantly keep going. However as the game went on you began to notice little things. At first the stomps seem random. But as time went on you began to notice Charizard stomping a little out of reach of you every time. Even if you tripped or fell, his paws would land right in front of you. Your Pokemon was keeping a lose eye on you and strategically placing his steps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever once Charizard realized that you knew he wasn't going to stomp you he started changing the game up. Due to the massive size difference between you and your former pet, your Pokemon begins stomping in front of you, cutting off your means of escape and forcing you to change directions. This happens more and more as your Pokemon begins leading you somewhere by placing random objects as barricade's to block your path. Your so busy paying attention to where the barricade's are being placed and Charizard's massive stomps that you don't even realize that your being backed into a corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you do figure out what happens, you immediately try to get away. Only for Charizard to crash his rump into the ground setting off a small earthquake to knock you off your feet. He spreads his legs apart and places on on either side of you. Your Pokemon's massive body now completely blocks your escape route. Once Charizard sees that you realize that your trapped he reaches over and grabs the bowl of berries from the nearby couch. He takes a pecha berry out the bowl and opens it up. Before you can ask what he's going to do he takes one half of the berry places it over your head and squeezes it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately close your eyes and worry for a second that berry juice was going to get in them. When you open your eyes your safe, but now covered in pecha berry juice, You see Charizard lick his lips as he reaches down to pick you up. There's nowhere to go and begin to panic before your Pokemon gives you a reassuring wink. You don't know why but that makes you believe you'll be okay. Charizard gently grips your berry drenched form and brings you up to his mouth. You can feel his hot breath roll over you, it smells like the berries he's been munching on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he sets you down gently in an open palm and casually pins your feet under one of his digits. His tongue, a massive reddish-pink  muscle extends and carefully licks over your tiny form. His saliva sticks to your skin as Charizard's tongue works it's way over your form drenching you and you clothes. When he's done, Charizard grabs another berry and repeats the process several more times. You consider telling him to stop, but you quickly figure out he probably won't listen to you. Your not Charizard's owner anymore, your his pet and you are strangely okay with that. When Charizard is finished you start to ask him if he's had enough, but are interrupted by the Pokemon casually tossing you into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you panic thinking Charizard has decided to eat you after all, but then after several seconds nothing happens. Your in Charizard's mouth in total darkness but he isn't doing anything. \"Your not gonna eat me, are you big guy?\" Charizard slowly shakes his head no and you relax a bit. Your jolted out of your relaxation as your Pokemon's massive tongue pushes you softly against the roof of his mouth. He then moves you towards his gums and gently beings to suck on you, like a peice of candy. Despite this strange and scary senario you find yourself in, you soon come to the conclusion that Charizard just like the way you taste. He's not going to eat you, or squish you. His only intentions are to play with you and protect you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour  finally moved out of Charizard's mouth and on to his waiting palm, where he looks you over carefully. You pat his snout reassuringly and he beams a smile down at you. You know now that Charizard has no intention of hurting you and you'll admit your starting to like the idea of being Charizard's pet more and more. \"Okay big guy, what do you want to do next?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You have to admit this has been an exhilarating and scary experience for you. But you can't help but feel that maybe Charizard is being a bit too selfish. Because he was bigger then you, your Pokemon decided what to do and when to do it. And you being too small or weak to argue with the big Zard went along with it for two reasons. Number one saying no to a Pokemon to who you is more the size of Godzilla then close to your own height doesn't seem like a smart thing to do. Number two despite this is all against your own will you really don't mind that much. But you also want to have some fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of butts, you glance over to Charizard's house size (to you) cheeks . You cautiously approach it, watching your massive Pokemon carefully to see if he really is asleep. Then quick as you can quickly scale Charizard's tail and are now in front of the glorious mounds of orange flesh. You reach out to touch one and it feels both soft and squishy. You squeeze and shake the flesh testing to see if Charizard notices. When he gives no indication that he can feel you, you push yourself between the mounds before vanishing from sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to your small size the massive flabby walls that make up your Pokemon's cheeks don't bother you, or threaten to squish the air or life out of you. You move deeper and deeper in until you find what your looking for. Charizard's twitching tail hole. This could be tricky. This was definitely a sensitive spot for the big Pokemon. There was a very good chance Charizard would notice what you were doing and wake up. There's no telling what the big Zard would do if he found out what you were doing. Maybe he'd discipline you, maybe he'd reward you, maybe he'd use you as some kind of sex toy. You know he had do intention of hurting you, but you couldn't help but slightly worry about the discipline part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut one look at that twitching pucker told you it was worth it. You gently trace your fingers around the outer rim and wait for a reaction. Nothing happens so you continually test Charizard's reaction by pushing more and more of your body onto it. You have to admit despite Charizard being a Pokemon, and not human it is remarkably clean. You cold eat off it if you wanted. You wouldn't of course. It didn't smell clean though. The scent of musk filled your nostrils. It overpowered you so much that the longer you were around your Pokemon's tail hole the more attractive it looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTill finally you just couldn't take it anymore and jumped head first in. You probably shouldn't have done that but it was too hard to hold yourself back. You feel our world shift for a second as if your moving.

Your Pokemon however knows full well what's going on when he can't find you or any trace of you on his body. Charizard smiles and his pucker begins pulling you further in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try and wiggle your way out, but your Pokemon's ass muscles are just so much stronger and you are soon pulled into a hot, musky, sweaty darkness. You try to escape but only make it so far when you realize something heavy is in the way. It's Charizard's tail. Charizard has trapped you in his ass. Thankfully there's plenty of air so your not in any danger of suffacationg or dying but you wonder what Charizard want's you to do, you find out very quickly when...</span></div></div>",

All at once the ground, walls and ceiling start shaking and squirming. Your small form is tossed to and fro as though your in the middle of a stormy sea. You quickly close your mouth not wanting to have the taste of Charizard's ass in your mouth. You hear loud moan from outside as your world once again begins to settle. This doesn't last long though as your Pokemon gives another firm smack to his large booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continues for several minutes as Charizard grows more and more horny as you, his little toy is tossed this way and that. Finally you can't take it anymore and you call out to your big Pokemon in hopes of making this stop. \"Charizard, I'm sorry just please tell me how I can make this up to you. Please I'll do anything.\" You immediately regret those words but it's too late to take them back. You feel the ground move beneath you as it's pushing you out of Charizard's rear and back once again into the light of the world. You can see light pouring in from between Charizard's mounds of ass and you continued to be pushed out until you fall straight down to the carpeted floors with small oof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't even have time to adjust as you are suddenly scooped into the air and and pushed down into a room temperature glass of water. You struggle a bit before you are pulled out and dropped carefully back onto the carpet. You hear a loud boom but are still trying to get your bearings as you cough and sputter, as your eyes adjust to the light. When you finally feel well enough to stand you test your eyes a few times before opening them. You wonder why it still smells musky. But the instant you open your eyes you immediately understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust in front of your face is the biggest pair of balls and to you monumental cock you'd ever seen, You back away a bit. You crane your neck upwards. Past the cream colored stomach and all the way up to the grinning face of Charizard. His tongue halfway out the corner of his mouth and lust in his eyes. He points to you and then to his cock. You get what Charizard wants. Your careless and reckless exploration of your Pokemon's rear has led to Charizard's discovery that you make a great sex toy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp and look nervously up at the monstrosity that's before you. You've always fancied yourself to be more attracted to boys then girls. And you have to admit that since being shrunken down you've developed some albeit small lustful feelings towards the big Zard. But this, this just too much. Your very close to the couch. You could risk running  away, but Charizard would probably catch you instantly. Or you could just suck up and please the big Pokemon your obviously not getting away. What to do?</span></div></div>",

Too late do you realize what's about to happen as your owner points his rod directly at you. Before you can say anything gallons of war white liquid hit you square in the chest like a fire hose. Your knocked on your butt as your new master decides that you make such an appealing target. Your eyes are screwed shut and mouth clamped tight as you raise your arms over your face in a desperate attempt to shield you from the blast. You can feel yourself being pushed both back and under the flow of cum threatens to wash you away. Finally after what seems like an eternity the torrent relents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you no longer feel yourself being pushed around you cautiously try to push yourself to the surface. it's slow going as Charizard's cum clings to your body but eventually you break the surface and give a big gasp of air. You sputter and cough as you try to keep yourself a float. After a few tries you feel something push under you and you grab hold tight and don't let go. after a few more seconds you slowly open your eyes to see that the object you grabbed on to was one of the giant's digits. You look around you to see that Charizard' load is more a kin to a small lake at your height. Though it's only two inches deep it's still twice your size. How could anyone have such large a load? Finally though you look up to see the toothy and not at all sorry looking grin of your master looking down at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour about to say something when Charizard suddenly flicks you into his open palm and looks at you with mock sympathy and mischief in his eyes as if to say, \"oh did my little toy not like his bath.\" You slowly got to your feet, breathing heavily and trying to gain back your composure. After a few more seconds of recovery you look up defiantly at your owner, who simply stares at you with amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charizard\", you start. \"That was too far. I could have drowned. I didn't but I could have. What happened to being more careful with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire Pokemon merely shrugged and pointed to you then to his rump. As if to say, \"you started it by being frisky.\" Then pointed to his now limp 'tower' and the pool of cum he had so graciously pulled you out of. \"I finished it\", he seemed to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don- don't do that again\", you say shakily. \"And stop with the whole charades bit. I've been your trainer since I was ten. I can understand you just fine in the Pokemon language. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snorted and replied \"Char\" (Fine)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you won't use me like that again\", you say hopefully coming to and understanding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave a short laugh. \"Char, Char Charizard\" (No way. Your my new favorite toy. I'll do as I please with you.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you could really hurt me\", you protest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Char. Char.

Whatever the reason Charizard scooped you up being as gentle with you as he could before placing you on a nearby table, then sure that you were completely out of harm's way Charizard turned his complete attention to his cock and began pumping. You had certainly helped quite a bit but he had decided to do the last bit by himself. It didn't take long before the 'tower' was at full mast and with a mighty roar of pleasure that knocked you off your feet and left your ears ringing the Zard blasted his load all over the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGallons and gallons of cum (to you) blanketed the carpet. It seemed to go on for ages but then it stopped. Charizard gave a heavenly sigh before collapsing back on to the carpet with a mighty boom. Breathing heavily with dulled eyes and panting tongue the Pokemon rested a bit. Charizard's vast bulk blocked most of your view before the great fire type turned his head to you, looking a little embarrassed but completely content. Before you could ask how he was, he plucked you from the table and placed you in front of his now limp rod. getting your bearings you looked out towards a massive white and slightly steaming lake. You just stand there dumb struck for a minute before looking back up at our Pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, gu-guess you needed more attention then I thought\", you say awkwardly before laughing nervously. You were unsure where to go from here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharizard blushed before turning back to you with a toothy grin mischief dancing in his eyes. You froze nervously and possibly just a little curious as to what your Poke- No, your owner was going to do next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharizard thought for awhile, your new size, had changed your entire relationship. You were no longer his trainer. Charizard doubted you could ever be his trainer ever again. Didn't matter how many badges you had now, there was no point obeying someone smaller then a Joltik.  Your voice just didn't carry the same weight or certainty anymore. Charizard wasn't yours, you were his. But what exactly were you to him? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA friend? No that wasn't quite right. You were very dear to him and he'd be crushed if anything happened to you and he'd crush anyone that would ever dare to hurt you. A mate? No that wasn't it either. He loved and lusted for you, but you weren't really equals anymore. he could do whatever he wanted to you and you'd just be to small to stop him.   Then it dawned on the big Zard. You were his pet and toy, and he was your master <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Charizard came to this realization everything became clearer. Now how to go about this. He'd still have to be careful with you but he could work with that. The Zard's mind swarmed with ideas but where would be a good place to start. You did a great job pleasuring him, even if it had taken you awhile. So a reward of the same sexual nature would be appropriate. Maybe he could suck you off, at you size it wouldn't be hard. Plus if the big Pokemon did a good enough job you might be more willing in the future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at the same time the only reason he found out you were a good toy is because he played with him in his sleep. Perheps a firmer hand was needed to drive home the fact that you were his. He'd never hurt you but he could still punish you.. Maybe by forcing you to clean up the mess you made, or putting you in timeout. Like in a jar or better yet back in his butt. Decisions, decisions.

As you kneaded the flesh, Charizard\u2019s strong foot odor surrounded you. The heat coming off of the feet made you sweat, making everything even more musky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou became lost in the massage, rubbing Charizard\u2019s sweaty paws as you breathed in the odor that came off of them.

This would cause your face to be covered in the sweat and stench of your pet Charizard\u2019s gigantic feet. <br>\r\nYou faceplanted once again as you finished massaging the massive paws. You accidentally swallowed some of the sweat and began gagging at the horrible taste. Charizard didn\u2019t care. In fact, he saw you gagging and laughed.

You smell heavily of the big Zard's feet and sweat and mention offhandedly of wanting a shower or bath. Before you can even stand up, something big and pink pushes against your small body forcing you on your back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you a moment to realize Charizard is licking you. Warm saliva sticks to your skin and practically glues you to the floor as all you can do is shout up at you big Pokemon to stop. Charizard for his part ignores you and continues to lick your small form. It quickly dawns on you that Charizard decides to accept your request to take a bath on his terms. This continues for awhile the fire type making sure that every inch of you is \"clean.\" When he finally lets up, you get up with some difficulty. Falling a time or two why Charizard snickers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally on your feet you look up at the big Pokemon's toothy grin and prepare to scold him. Before you can even get a word out though Charizard pushes you back down with a digit. You get up again only for the same thing to happen. This happens a few more times before you see the mischievous glint in Charizard's eyes and know what you need to do. You sigh heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charizard\", you begin. \"He looks at you still smiling a little. \"Can I please get up?\" The big Pokemon nods. You stand up and this time Charizard doesn't push you back down. You know now what this means. Your Pokemon is no longer your Pokemon. He's your master. And you, you are just his pet or toy. You've known this for awhile but now it's starting to sink in. Your Charizard. Your mischievous, naughty, somewhat demanding Charizard, is your master. This makes you a little worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charizard\", you say to him. \"What if you accidentally step on me, or sit on me, or eat me\", you ask a little fearfully. The big Pokemon merely stands up and you watch him a bit before he brings his foot down on you. You don't even have time to react as Charizard puts hundred's of pounds of weight on your body. To your surprise you feel fine. You were pinned hopelessly against a smelly foot and all you could see was orange but you were fine. Charizard lifted his foot back up with you sticking to it a bit before falling on to the ground. Before you could say anything Charizard's rear hurtled towards you and collided with a boom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSame thing happened. You felt fine. When Charizard got up he picked you off one of his cheeks and you rested in his palm. You still look a little shocked so your Pokemon rolls his eyes and points at his pokeball. Then it comes back to you. Before you went off on your journey with your Pokemon. You remember reading that when a Pokemon is captured any and all fatal injuries become null and void so long as the Pokemon is registered to belong to you. You give a sigh of relief when you remember this. That relief lasts for all but two seconds when you see Charizard sporting a toothy grin. Charizard couldn't kill you or severaly injure you, but you really couldn't fight back against him as he is. So what does you Mischievous master have planned for you.</span></div></div>",

Not liking where this was going you try and run away from the big Pokemon only for Charizard lift his foot in the air and slam it back down. At your normal height this wouldn't be a problem but at your current size the single stomp sends shock waves that knock you off your feet. You try to stand again but the fire type just stomps his foot each time you try to get up. After a few more attempts you realize it's pointless as you stare up at the big Zard in defeat. He gives you a triumphant smile before reaching down to pick you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first thought is to wiggle out of your Pokemon's fingers but when Charizard hold you in a fist you realize that's impossible. You wiggle a bit, but when he holds you with just two fingers, you gulp as you look down at the massive and fatal fall you could take. Finally you decide to give up and see what the big guy has in store for you. You give a surprised yelp when he licks you. His massive tongue coating you in sticky saliva. \"Just wanted to give a kiss big guy\", you ask hopefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharizard snorts at this and makes his intentions very clear when he begins lowering you towards your destination. You gasp in surprise as you see your Pokemon's massive butt cheeks. Each one this size of your house. \"Want me to give them a massage big guy\", you joke slightly. When Charizard's tail lift revealing the small almost impossible to see pucker you quickly know this isn't the case. You struggle frantically but Charizard's grip is iron clad and the saliva is to sticky for you to do little more then weakly struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch in horror as your small body is wedged between those cheeks. Your feet touch the ring of flesh and slowly you get pulled in. \"Charizard, come on, big guy! You don't want do this.\" You try to talk the massive Zard out of this as your body slowly becomes consumed by you former pet's pucker. Charizard let's go when your body is halfway in and you try desperately to grab anything to keep you from slipping in further. But soon only your head is sticking out and you see a massive digit come towards you and gently push you in. With a satisfying squelch you disappear from sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharizard slowly get's into a standing position as he can feel your weak struggles from within. The big Pokemon wasn't worried you had plenty of air and his insides were clean as whistle. Still what to do now?</span></div></div>",

You chuckle with glee as you can hardly believe you learned this new ability. Taking a small step you test to see how much your movement affects your little trainer. You snorted at that word. \"Trainer.\" As if now he can train you to do anything. If anything you were his trainer. But what did that make him. A pet, a toy? Well whatever he was, he was yours and that was all that mattered. After feeling his small body move as you walk. You figured he wasn't in any danger as he didn't seem to be trying to escape or go deeper in. Your little toy was just trying to stay in one place as the vibrations from your steps tossed him around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more tests you decide to g for walk. The reason you wanted to put your \"trainer\" in your butt was more of an act of revenge for all the times he kept you in a small ball. You walk for bit before deciding to head home. After all you wanted to spend some quality time with your new little pet and helping him get use to his new size. You weren't going to hurt him or anything. You just wanted to play with a little bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive back at your trainer's house only to find a van parked out front. A huge black van with an R on one side stood in the driveway. Your pet lived in the forest and didn't get many visitors. But you and him had experiences with these types of people before. they were not good humans. You listen carefully to what their saying behind a tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look all  I know is that this guy has been a huge pain in the bosses side for awhile.\", said one of them,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know\", said another. \"If this guy is good maybe we should wait until- there's no time for that interrupted a third. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" said the one in the diver's seat. \"After all there's six of us and only one of him. We may not have been given Pokemon yet but we can take this one guy out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard all you needed. Now you just had to decide to deal with them. You could scare them away. Even if there were six of them they were still no match for you. Still just because they didn't have pokemon didn't mean they weren't...you were cut off mid thought as a forth one said, \"Look all we have to do is go in and shoot the guy. Come on you guys what do say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat settled it you couldn't take them if they had weapons. Unless. You smile as if yu suddenly had a great idea. You didn't want to hurt your new toy but you didn't care what happened to these guys. You could practice playing with them, they were criminals anyway who cares what happens to them. The van opened and you could see six guys in total. Acting fast you quickly shrunk them and their van down to your trainer's size. It happaned so fast they barely had anytime to react as you walked up towards them, eager to play. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken criminals saw you approach and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your the proud trainer of a female Charizard. Your Pokemon is very strong and has helped you out more times then you can count. She is however a tad overprotective and likes to keep a close eye on you. Charizard doesn't like leaving you alone or not being by your side every second of the day. So naturally when you got back home, your Pokemon was ecstatic and gave you a big hug. As you laid down on the couch she sat down next to you. You noticed a strange glint in her eyes and wondered what that was about. Before you can ask she slathers your face with saliva giving you rapid fire kisses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh at first and tell her to stop but she doesn't. Closing your eyes you wait for your loving Pokemon to finish. The saliva sticks to your skin and feels both warm and sticky. After a few minutes you start to feel your Pokemon's tongue over your clothes, arms and legs. \"Come on Charizard, if you keep that up I'll have to get a shower.\" You joke but your Pokemon doesn't stop. She keeps licking you. You try and push her head away but instead of feeling the somewhat rough, somewhat soft scales of your loving Pokemon, your hand connects with something soft and wet. Curiously you open your eyes to make a startling discovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you had kept your eyes opened you would have realized that with each passing lick your body and clothes were getting smaller and smaller. You were once taller then your Charizard but now she towered over you. Her massive tongue easily slathered your entire body and kept you pinned to the couch cushion. Her warm sticky spit made it difficult to move. You tried to talk peacefully at first but couldn't get a word out. Realizing you were still shrinking you needed to stop Charizard before she made you too small to see. At the top of your lungs you shouted, \"Charizard enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Pokemon immediately stopped and leaned back. She looked down at you with concerned eyes. You tried to get to your feet, but the saliva made it difficult to stand, when Charizard attempted to help you up, you shouted at her to not touch you. She quietly obeyed and waited patiently for you to stand. As overprotective and strong as she was your Charizard was a gentle Pokemon who knew when to obey her trainer. When you finally got to your feet you looked up at your massive Pokemon. She looked back with sad eyes. Despite what she did without warning you, you felt guilty for yelling at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm sorry that I yelled, but you understand why I'm mad right?\" Charizard nodded sadly, making you feel even worse. \"You can't just shrink me like that. How small am I even?\" You look around the room and judge your height to be around two inches. Charizard looks massive to you. But for as big as she was, she was still your Pokemon, she knew and you knew that you were still in charge, you also knew why she did this. she always did want protect and care for you, now she's made it impossible for you to live without her. You should be mad at her, you could be furious but you're surprisingly calm in fact you find that your okay with this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lived out in the mountains away from civilization. A simple life surrounded by books, yes you had to make the occasional grocery trip but Your Charizard could easily do that for you, it's wasn't illegal or anything Pokemon could be trained to do just about anything. It might take a bit of effort to get her to do it but that was fine. As for financial stability you made plenty of money when you went on your journey with Charizard you were set for life. Honestly weighing the facts this wasn't that bad. You could probably live like this just fine. You take a long breath before facing your giant Pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charizard can you unshrink me?\" Your Pokemon still feeling sad slowly shakes her head. \"Can you make me any smaller then this? She nods quietly. \"Don't do that I don't want to be any smaller then this unless you can make be bigger. Do you think you can figure out how to do that someday?\" She nods again really not wanting you to ever be big again. \"Okay... pick me up big girl.\" Charizard gently with two careful digits picks you up and places you in her massive palm. It's softer then you remember. She looks down at you sheepishly. Charizard watches you get up and walk over to her snout, she closes her eyes not wanting to be punished then opens them in surprise as she feels you pat her snout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay big girl\", you tell her reassuringly. \"I weighed my options and this really isn't that bad. I'm gonna have to teach you somethings but if your willing to put in the work then I won't ask you to unshrink me. You can keep me safe and protected like you always wanted.\" Charizard leans in about to kiss you but stops as she hears your voice. \"No kissing! You can't make any smaller then this, not until you figure out how to unshrink me.\" Charizard carefully nudges you with her snout. \"And I'm still in charge. I am your trainer after all. She nuzzles you gently. \"Okay, Charizard now why don't we...</span></div></div>",

Here, let me help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervousness built in your gut as her hand loosens its hold on you, wobbling slightly as she shifted her forepaw. In response, your hands tightened around her middle digit in a death grip. Your heart leaps in your throat; you were practically a hundred meters in the air! Couldn't she be a bit more careful?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, the moving stops, and Buizel's face is closer than ever to you. Before you could even shout a complaint, she opened up her mouth, stuck her tongue ever-so-slightly towards you, and slowly breathed out. The warm, damp gale of her breath washed over you, flooding your nose with the powerful, yet pleasant scent of Cheri berries, one of her favorite snacks. Her natural heat was a far cry from the temperature of the cool floor you were on earlier. It would almost be relaxing, if it weren't for the fact that, in this new position, your member was completely exposed, allowing the hot breath to stimulate you. The force of the air actually left the top of your shaft pinned against her digit, arousing you further. In a moment or two, the pleasurable sensation actually got you to a half-chub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Buizel, please...\" you beg, not comfortable with nudity around her at all, much less with being indirectly pleasured by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe, just relaaax. You're always so nervous. Just let me help you, like you help me...\" she drawls, giving you a look unnervingly close to bedroom eyes. What did she mean by 'help'--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--wait...no...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true. The way she had deliberately pressed her finger against your groin, the way she held you in just the right position so that your bare cock would be buffeted by her stuffy breath and pinned against her...prickles shot up through your entire body at the notion that your Pokemon was attracted to you. The worst part was, you didn't really know if you hated it because you didn't want it, or if it was just the taboo drilled into your mind by society that made you appalled. If she was intelligent enough to speak to you, to tease you, and everything else she's done...is it really so wrong to reciprocate?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel giggled at you, sensing how weakened your resolve was. \"Hmm...if you don't want to do this, all you have to do is tell me. Just let me give you a sample before you shut me down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her mouth again, this time letting her tongue dangle out, giving you a clearer view of the insides. Another wave of her soothing breath blew over you, and your legs shuddered as a few pleasant tingles were eked out of your member. You were unable to resist, too distracted by the enticing view to really give your shame any thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you were plopped onto Buizel's tongue, warm spittle coating your backside. You were unceremoniously dragged into her mouth as it snapped shut, and left in the humid cavern of her massive maw.

What may have just been a slow, careful consideration of her tounge's every movement came across a bit like a taunt. Like she was drinking in the moments before you were pressed between her palate and her tongue: the last few moments you were given before whatever dignity you had left was robbed from you by your gigantic Buizel's oral appendage<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at this point, you couldn't even really tell what it truly <i>was</i> between the two - a tease or show of tactfulness... Maybe it was a bit of both...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever tact she may have been showing instantly flew out the window the moment she jammed the tounge-tip you rested on into the roof of her mouth, though, soaking any part of your form that hadn't already been thoroughly saturated in warm saliva. Disgustingly, that even applied to the inside of your own comparatively quaint and non-domineering little mouth, as the yelp you gave at the sudden sandwiching earned you a full mouthful of the Pokemon's spittle. You tried to cough it out, but not only was it nigh impossible to distinguish her saliva from yours, but every time you opened your mouth for a hack was an invitation for even more goblets of the stuff to find their way in. You had no choice but swallow to expel your Buizel's vicious spittle from your mouth, and that was a reality you supposed you just had to live with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to <i>literally</i> rub in the troubling onset of this new reality, you suddenly found yourself getting dragged this way and that way across the roof of her mouth, completely and utterly <i>smushed</i> against the slimy ceiling with every slide back and forth. And in your desperate struggles, you soon found that being back-to-palette was no less humiliating, though it did offer the front of your body a somewhat different, squishier feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't exactly something you were thrilled to learn - how the roof of your Buizel's mouth felt against the entire front of your frame in comparison to her tongue - but without a shred of light to illuminate the disorientating ride you were being sent on, there was really nothing to focus on <i>but</i> the feeling of it all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that and the smell of her breath, which was still as sickly sweet with the scent of berries, but mostly the <i>feeling.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as all-encompassing as the sensations you were experiencing were, there was one feeling in particular that you felt stronger than anything else. A member as overwhelmed as it was completely pinned flat to your body by Buizel's unyielding tongue. Every trip you took across the roof of her mouth prickled it with unfathomable pleasure,  and even in the moments where her tongue took a pause, there was always her thick breath to edge it even closer to what would perhaps be the most humiliating yet powerful climax you would ever experience in your life. It was inevitable that such a climax would come, at least as long as she continued to be so careless with your feeble form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you couldn't quite say <i>careless</i>, as had your Buizel truly not being showing any restraint you felt as though your life would've been long snuffed out by now. But still, <i>this was too much</i>, and were about ready to put a stop to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just didn't know exactly how to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if you could open your mouth without downing another portion of Buziel's saliva, you're not so sure you could realistically manage to muster up words loud enough to escape the confines of her sealed-shut mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if she had read your mind, and wanted to further familiarize you with said seal of carnivorous fangs, you found yourself flung to the front of her mouth, back now resting right at the base of her gums. With newfound leverage, her tongue's movements started to take on a more.. methodical approach. Rather than smush itself against your entire form, it seemed to hone in on one specific part of you in particular, following up on an attack of stimuli you could no longer ignore. Whether it had been teased by her berry-scented breath, or rubbed against her tongue/palette, your member had undeniably already gotten some attention, but it was attention you could at least chalk up to being an unintentional product of her other, completely unrelated fixation with drenching every solitary aspect of your form with her sticky spit or... breathing on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She was just tasting you...</i> was the subconscious thought you desperately clung to. Even before when the sultriness was undeniable, you still clung to some vague idea that what any feelings <i>down there</i> weren't deliberate on her part, because, after all, there was no <i>proof</i> she was <i>intentionally</i> using her oppressive breath to awaken your member... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now that her tongue's tip was focused precisely <i>down there</i>,you could no longer lie to yourself. The terrifyingly tingly sensation brought on by merely her breath before was <i>nothing</i> in comparison to the encouragement it was receiving now, tongue slowly picking up the pace as it rammed itself continuously into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough all this, though, came a chance to possibly escape from it, though you weren't exactly <i>thrilled</i> by what it implicated - a small moan that opened Buizel's maw for only the briefest of moments, reminding you that there was a potentially visible mouth making you experience this sightless cyclone of sensations. If you could elicit a moan big enough from her, and find a voice loud enough and a mouth clear of another's spit enough, you might just be able to get her attention and put an end to this... It was just a matter of electing such a moan... <i>How am I gonna get her to moan...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Maybe it was the pleasure that was beginning to cloud your mind as the pace of the pink appendage gradually picked up, but you suddenly got the strong sense that you were overthinking things. Buizel wasn't going to keep you in here forever, she was making it very clear that she wanted something <i>very specific</i> from you, and after you give her that she would almost certainly spit you out. Maybe you'd be better of taking the path of least resistance. The path that leads to what would certainly be a very pleasant ending, in a certain sense...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill though, some amount of dignity somehow managed to remain as you were inched ever closer to climax by your own Pokemon's tongue, manifesting as a voice begging in your head to not let feeling your jizz spurt out in her mouth to be what gets her to fish you out! Find some other way! <i>Any</i> other way!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sudden spike of pleasure caused by a particularly powerful pump, and a moan  big enough to open her maw wide, you found it was now or never to make a decision...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Though the desperate plea that the last vestiges of your pride and squeamishness made was heard, it was just as soon overwhelmed and washed away by your other thoughts. No longer could you resist the siren song of Buizel's teasing tongue, telling you to relent. No longer could you push down the mind-blowing pleasure that it coaxed out of you, its rough surface grinding lustfully against your loins. And no longer could you deny what you truly wanted, deep down inside: to give yourself up to your partner, and <i>release...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you accept the unforgiving truth, you stop fighting back. The words you wanted to say melted away, replaced by a long, shameless, ecstatic moan; one that let more of the spittle, now warm and soothing, into your mouth. Buizel heard your cry of defeat, and knew, right at that moment, that you had given up. If she weren't so preoccupied with brushing her tongue against your eager rod, you know she would've given you a knowing smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time. The wet, slippery, invasive appendage reeled back, then shoved its fleshy bulk right between your thighs, eyes on the prize. You moan again, stretching your legs wider, letting the hot flesh utterly consume your twitching member. You can hear Buizel's panting, too, the sound playing like music in your ears as you are forced against her pearly whites and straddled mercilessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sopping, sweetly-scented muscle does not shy away from your head; in fact, it pushes itself firmly into your face, slathering you with more of your partner's soaking saliva. You don't shy away, either. Instead, you slip your tongue out, joining it with the same fleshy mass that far outscales your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taste seems different now; while it still retains the same viscous, mouthy quality as before, there's also a hint of the Cheri berries that Buizel loves to scarf down. It was...pleasant. Much more than it ought to be. But you were beyond that line of thinking now. No shame, no embarrassment, no regrets, just sweet bliss as you were worked over lovingly by your Pokemon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were practically on auto-pilot now, attempting a french kiss that was way too sloppy and totally out of your control, wrapping your arms around the powerful tongue that was dominating your whole world, bucking as hard as you could into its soft, malleable touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Buizel wasn't <i>selfish</i>--well, maybe a <i>bit</i> as a partner, considering how she nabbed back a good deal of the berries she 'shared' with you, but not as...whatever you two were now. Either way, she rewarded your compliance by renewing her stroking with greater (though still intimately careful) force. You were essentially nailed to the back of her incisors, smothered deeply into her moist, curling muscle, being jerked to blissful oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take long before you get right to the edge of climax. Grunting, humping, shifting, you manage an impossible feat: you actually <i>lift</i> your partner's tongue, even the slightest bit, so that you could hug yourself tighter into it. You were close, <i>so close,</i> and finally, with your frantic thrusting, her forceful tonguing, and the two-prong assault of the fruity fragrance on your nose and mouth, you let go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was impossible to fully describe the euphoria that washed over you as you came onto Buizel's wanting tongue. You shook uncontrollably as you shot your load directly onto her taste buds, letting her get an undiluted sample of your release. Her maw opened wider than it ever had during this lurid little escapade, and her breath billowed out, brushing your drenched hair back and giving you a last enticing gulp of Buizel's personal mouth scent. As the rest of the contents of your orgasm spill out over her restless appendage, you shudder weakly and lie back against her teeth, awash with incandescent sexual satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour partner laps lightly at your spent crotch, then curls her tongue over itself, trying to eke out any last drop of your seed as she hit her own high. You felt your surroundings shake slightly, and the sheer lewdness of the moan she makes nearly makes you perk up again. The spit that you were practically bathing in sunk down to the back of her throat as she made a show of gulping down your minuscule load. You shiver at the prospect of cumming a second time; you weren't even sure if you could arouse yourself for a solid week after this... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, though, she doesn't pester you for more. Instead, she softly envelops your body in her mostly-clean appendage, brushing the tiniest bit against your groin before lolling out and depositing you into her relatively cool hand. With your head as cloudy and unresponsive as it was, you don't even try to move when you flop belly-up in an uncomfortable position. You just...need some rest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel beams at you warmly, taking in the sight of your limp form and the utter contentment you felt. She delicately shifted your limbs so that you'd be in a comfier position when you came to. Sighing pleasantly, she leaned against the wall, ignoring the sticky, sickly-sweet stain she left on the carpet when getting herself off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, there. Isn't that better? You finally let go of that silly taboo, and look at how <i>good</i> it feels to be mine...\" she murmurs, tracing your chest intimately with a finger. It was slightly sticky with her juices, but you probably didn't even notice it, what with all the saliva coating your body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile slowly morphed into a concerned frown as she noticed something off about you. Even amidst the spit that covered your face, she could see something subtly trailing down it...you were crying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'O-oh no, did I go overboard?' she thought, a seed of worry now blooming in her mind. The onset of guilty panic was just barely held back by the fact that she hasn't heard your reaction just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body lays flat on Buizel's fuzzy palm. You wheeze, still feeling completely exhausted from the intense jacking you just received from your own Pokemon. Absentmindedly, you reach your hands up to your face, wiping some saliva from your cheeks. It was then that you yourself caught the tears running down your face. It was hard to think during your afterglow, but as you felt your emotions become more clear, you could tell they were from...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A moment of clarity came to you through the clouds veiling your mind, shining light on what exact emotion was spilling tears down your face only to dissolve into the spotty puddles of spittle you were lying in: pure, unadulterated <i>joy.</i> Not the artificial kind that comes as a reward for satisfying your desires, but the genuine, heart-heavying kind. The kind that maybe was a little hard to read in someone, especially when your visage was no bigger than a marble, as Buizel's own expression plainly conveyed a sense of worry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I totally went too far didn't I? I...\" The furry digit at your chest started to reflexively reel back, but you didn't let it get far, lunging forward and wrapping yourself around it in an equally emotionally-driven move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buizel, that was <i>amazing!! </i>\" you shrilly shouted out, your weak voice cracking under the passion you had put into those words. You nuzzled your face into the surprisingly sweet-smelling fur of her digit, finding that it not only did a good job of clearing your face of its slimy coating, but also that it's warmth abated the house's chilly-feeling room temperature, even nippier now that you had just experienced an unprecedented degree of warmth both inside and out. Compared to the sauna of her mouth, the house felt like a refrigerator, and her finger like the most <i>needed</i> heated blanket ever. It nearly sprung more tears it was so needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... really liked it? Like <i>liked it</i>, liked it...? Like you're completely okay with everything that just happened?\" she murmured with a tilt of her head, eyes nearly pinched shut in a wave of lingering shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was one of the best things I've ever experienced in my life. I'm sorry that I ever doubted you.\" you reassured, tightening your hug around the furry mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel went silent for a moment, then let out a dry little chuckle. \"Wow, I...didn't think you'd be the one apologizing first,\" she said, quite flabbergasted, but also surprisingly contented.  I mean, how could she not be? She had just taken the boldest leap in their relationship ever possible, smashing down wall after wall in one fell tongue-induced orgasm, and rather that collapse their bond in on itself like it so easily could've, it had turned out to one of the 'best things he'd ever experienced in his life', in his own words!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill though, there remained a definite pang of guilt in her chest, one that she needed to alleviate not just for her own sake, but possibly for her shrunken partner's sake as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry too. I was way too forward with things, and should've respected your boundaries more,\" she said, bringing the hand you were seated on up nearer to her face, an apologetic look clear as crystal in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first instinct was to parry those softly-spoken words, finding the idea of such a transcendental experience being something she needed to <i>apologize for</i> wholly ridiculous... until something, maybe the loaded legacy of feeling her breath blow across your form, brought you back to how this all began: those initial moments of intense discomfort both in and out of her mouth, the merciless-feeling treatment her tongue gave you at first, the fact that you were trying to figure out how to <i>escape</i> from it all before you gave in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't deny those moments, or the fact that there were things she could've done to make you more comfortable with the experience, but still... it all seemed fairly superfluous now. After all, if she had primed you more for what was to come, in all likelihood you would've come to your senses and firmly put your foot down, and you were certain if you <i>had</i> given her a definitive 'no' she would've stopped things before you even fully got the word out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd something about that concept - that theoretical idea that you could've so easily opted out of everything - genuinely struck you deep in your core. Not because you regret not taking such a chance, but because it was legitimately disturbing to you that such a wonderful, life-changing beat in you and your Buizel's relationship even had the capacity to pass you by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgive you, Buizel... And thank you...\" were the only words you could muster up in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small smirk formed on her muzzle. \"Mm, is that a 'thank you for the apology' thank you, or a 'thank you for bringing me to glorious climax with just your tongue' thank you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but chuckle at that, face warming a tad. \"Ah... a bit of both...\" you mumbled, burying your face in her finger's dense fur in order to hide your blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chuckle of her own resounded around you as she brought her hand now mere inches from her face, a familiarly heady Cheri berry-scented aroma coming to you with every breath. \"You're getting real intimate with my finger, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is my only beacon of warmth in these frigid lands...\" you said with a mockingly dramatic tone, though you weren't exactly being entirely facetious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can be more than just that, y'know...\" she returned without missing a beat, save through the little laugh she trilled her words through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, you felt a stiffness in your lower regions, a sharp tingle running up your spine and forcing you to swallow the nothing in your mouth. What you thought wouldn't be achievable until you were <i>at least </i> out of the afterglow of the previous orgasm suddenly felt very much in reach; you were already ready for round 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel brought her head back, audibly scoffing. \"Pssh, I'm <i>tryiiing</i> to lead into my secret interest in finger painting here, get your mind out of the gutter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your heart drop, blush burning on your face. \"W- Wuh?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you felt the hand you were sitting on compress and your form get maneuvered to Buizel's whims, an orange pillar at your back keeping you in place, and another at your front forcing your legs apart. You were still reeling from having the rugged pulled out from under you to truly process what was happening, until a familiarly teasy voice rang out in your close proximity. \"Just kidding~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour already speedy heartrate spiked, face feeling as though it was actively on fire. Your whole body was hot in fact, surrounded by the lovely warmth of your Pokemon's hand-paws, yet the heat you perhaps felt most prominently was just a bit down from your waist, right where the tip of Buizel's finger in front of you was looming over. Ever so close to a tip of your own...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just say the word if you want me to stop, okay?\" she assured, eyes meeting your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave her a clear nod in response, a sense of genuine happiness washing over you, soon to be utterly overwhelmed with an even greater wave of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd overwhelmed it was - and <i>you</i> were - mere seconds after your Buizel began to lightly stroke your member. Your back slouched down as your mind went alight with pleasure, each full stroke making you slip even farther and farther down and flicking on a new light. She was slow at first, and almost seemed to purposely forgo any sense of rhythm, as if she was merely just testing to waters. What may have just been tests were certainly enough to hit your mind and body with wave after wave of bliss, though, so you could only imagine what it would feel like once she started picking up the pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have to imagine long though, as the moment your rod reached full-mast it was joined by another orange mass, your member gently pinched between two of her giant fingers... Was that all she was doing so far? Coaxing your member to its full-length just so she could get a better grip on it for the <i>actual</i> event to begin?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly seemed that way, as she suddenly increased the vigor of her fingers tenfold, using both to rub down each side of your shaft simultaneously. On top of even just that, there was also the fine fibers of her fingertips' fur that subtly stimulated your groin with every stroke as well, just as did their entire bulk, making for a mind-blowing, multifaceted breadth of pleasure. You soon found yourself almost completely flat on your back, both hands taking a firm grasp of the fur below in a subconscious response to the unfathomable bliss you were experiencing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes fluttering, you found you could still catch a glimpse of Buizel's visage through the pair of rapidly bounding masses, her eyes half-lidded and tongue slightly stuck out. There was something about looking into your Pokemon's eyes through all this. Something somehow more intimate-feeling than her pleasuring you with a pair of fingers as you laid in the palm of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression soon shifted a bit however; coincidentally, you were focused in on her face right as her lust took over, coloring her features with a clear-as-day <i>yearn</i> for something... <i>She needed release too!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly found sent to a much vaster plane of orange fur: your Buizel's tummy, to be specific. With the free hand your relocation granted her, she began to pleasure herself alongside you, letting out a bellowing moan you felt like far-reaching rumble below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were <i>so</i> close to climax that going cold turkey for even a few moments, and her slightly slower pace working on you now that she was having to multitask, was <i>maddening!</i> Not unlike your earlier lunge to embrace her finger before, you jolted forwards, forcefully and speedily humping into the furry valley her fingers created to faster reach a climax that would certainly rival even the one spurred on by her tongue...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did you know that your Buizel was getting desperate too, utterly itching for release, and had found herself stuck on a specific, <i>quite audacious</i> way of getting her there. She wasn't sure exactly how her shrunken companion would feel about it though, but with such a clouded mind, there was no guarantee that would stop her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one big surge of your waste, you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

White-hot bliss spurts out of you, giving some of the fine orange fur of her paw and belly a shiny new luster. You hear the breath hitch in her throat, and her torso rises up to meet you as she thrusts into her own hand, burying it deeper in her needy snatch.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nA sense of pride welled up within you, and for the third time today, your exhausted member springs right back up, ready for action. And just in time: Buizel's paw lifts you up from your place on her lower chest, and brings you inches from her panting, bright-red face. Her breath washed over you, almost matching the ecstatic heat still blazing inside of you, and her eyes, though often closing shut in pleasure, still bore into you, asking a question to which you already knew the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, I <i>need</i> this,\" she groans, still getting off, but pained by the lack of your body within her cunt. She didn't need to <i>say</i> a thing, though it was surprisingly arousing to hear her beg you for something so intimate. Despite the weakness in your limbs from the climax you just hit, your mind was already set on one thing, and one thing only: making this the best orgasm Buizel's ever had!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod silently, give a firm thumbs up, and the paw holding you quickly shifts your form to where it's needed most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, the sight from her hand and torso wasn't too enticing, your vision impeded as it was by fingers and a slope of fuzzy flesh. Now, though, everything was clear as crystal. Seeing her so brazenly, so <i>lewdly </i>pleasure herself made your eyes glaze over. It was such a private, intimate, vulnerable sight. It was something that would make her die from embarrassment if anyone caught her doing it. But here she was, fingering herself desperately, moaning needily, and it was all because of <i>you!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, she stops the rhythmic pumping of her fingers around and past her clit, and lets her arm rest against her waist. The hand keeping you in its soft, warm embrace lowers down, giving you a perfect, up-close view of her sopping wet pussy. You wordlessly trail down her clit, taking note of the small puddle already appearing on the floor. Even though you expected it, you balked; just a few hours ago, you'd have never even thought about Buizel's vagina, much less hope to see it, but now you were utterly mesmerized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further ado, your partner pushes you through her lower lips and into the deep dark of her cunt. You can feel the fleshy walls around you contract as your form is slipped into their tough, moist, blindingly hot grasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hits you now, the brunt of the intoxicating scent of your jail cell. At this size, just a measly whiff of Buizel's arousal outside would have you standing at attention in no time; in here, though, the miasma of her musky arousal encompassed your entire world. Whether it was purely from your newfound infatuation with your Pokemon and your size, or the pheromones that flooded this tight chamber held some sway in your mind, your dick was positively <i>painfully</i> erect, harder than it's ever been. In no time at all, Buizel had managed to send you into a lustful frenzy yet again, and this one, you intended to repay... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaken to your core, you begin to thrash around in the enticingly humid folds that surrounded you. They squeeze back, just as eager to have you inside, as you can tell from the violent, panting, muffled moans coming from outside. You slam and push and twist in their embrace, and your cock pounds up against the shivering pink all the while. In response, they only come down harder on you as their owner shudders in bliss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh! Th-that's right....hngh! Sq-squirm for me...\" Buizel grunts, unable to breathe out a single sentence without moaning in delight. She always dreamed of doing this to you, but she never, <i>ever</i> thought she could get this far! It was honestly pretty amazing that you not only went along with this, but put all the effort into it every step of the way. Because of her plan, and because of that fruit, you finally know how she felt, and you're willing and able to reciprocate. She actually <i>pinched</i> herself, just to make sure this wasn't all some kind of fever dream. And thank Arceus, it wasn't. It was...<i>real...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to inhale the mind-numbing, hair-singeing smell of your partner's sex as you ram energetically into her, stretching out the walls and jerking yourself against one. Nothing could compare to the complete horniness that pervades every corner of your mind, telling you to hump her. Viscous, sweetly-savory fluid flows rich like honey as you stimulate her like nothing else. As you huff from the exertion, you let some of Buizel's ambrosia into your mouth, savoring it like you'd never taste it again. Taken by desire, reinvigorated by the results of your efforts, you extend your assault relentlessly to every inch of strong, yet sensitive flesh you can reach. Soon, it's all you can do to prevent yourself from being crushed as a wave of sticky, pungent liquid erupts from her snatch like a geyser, and you erupt as well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel screamed as she squirted, sending her love juices flying a short distance, once again making an utter mess of things. Even amidst the paralyzing euphoria of the most intense climax she's felt in her life, she instinctively reaches down and cautiously pulls you out. It was easier than expected due to just how wet you had made her, but if she left you in there, she didn't know if you'd <i>survive,</i> much less be able to get out. She stares as intensely as she can at your form, eyes searching for a sign of consciousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dangle a bit from her fingers, which is enough to make you keenly aware that you are no longer in her vagina, and are in fact, way above the ground. You pat her hand to let you know you're still alive, and she sighs with relief, actually letting you lay in her hand this time. Her grip is shaky from her own exertion, so you just let the both of you rest for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you can feel her arm steady, you raise your head to look at your partner. She's also looking down at you, a shaky, happy smile on her lips. This time, she's the one who's crying. Or at least, she <i>was...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Buizel,\" you gasp, still catching your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer brow furrowed; she was both curious and hesitant, simultaneously wanting to know your thoughts and reluctant to hear of another relationship hurdle she potentially tripped over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah?\" She waited with bated breath for your answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...we have <i>got</i> to find more of those berries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel blinks, then <i>guffaws,</i> nearly knocking you out of her paw with the gust of air that was sent your way. You let out a tired, yet hearty laugh of your own, partly out of amusement, but also out of...<i>joy,</i> again. Almost greater this time. There wasn't an ounce of shame or reluctance that dampened the wonderful experience you had, or the moments you had leaning up to it. It was just you and your partner, or friend, or lover, or whatever the hell you two were. Partner, partner is good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're...lucky I'm so pooped here...if you were a bit taller, I'd knock ya-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right in the kissah!\" you drunkenly finish. She chuckles again, tracing your tired body in her paw. \"<i>Arceus,</i> you're so cute when you're small...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flush, the praise from your partner making you red as a tomato. Something about being so tiny in her hands filled you with--well, not only desire, but...warmth. One different from the lusty heat that clouded your mind just before. It felt <i>really damn good</i> to just be loved, knowing that Buizel was going to protect you, knowing it was all going to be okay with her around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs tiredness spreads through you like a wildfire, compounding over the last 3 or 4 orgasms you've just had, it dawns on you that you've lost any sense of time while being toyed with by your teasing partner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, we should probably hit the hay, Buizel,\" you suggest, yawning loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scoffs amusedly, turning to the window. \"What are you talking about, we couldn't have <i>possibly</i> spent the <i>entire day</i> doing this. I think'd I'd noti--oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggle as she holds you up to see with her. The sun has long since set, and you're currently staring into pitch-black darkness. The only light comes from some meager front-porch and street lamps that occasionally pop up around your neighborhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't even <i>want</i> to know what time it is, so why don't we just...lie down on the couch for now,\" Buizel mutters, lack of sleep catching up to her, too. She carries you over and lays you softly against her chest as she slumps down over the black pleather cushions of your loveseat. <i>That's a pretty apt name,</i> you muse, thoughts coming back to what just happened. As great as the afterglow was, it's nice to just have some time to think clearly. This whole day was utterly bizarre, and there's no telling what would happen tomorrow, or the other days to come, but you knew deep in your heart that your partner had your best interests in mind. With that, you two silently cuddle together while she holds you close to her like a Teddiursa doll, sweet dreams of your future together washing over you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...When you wake up, you notice that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're awoken by a lack of breath; Buizel's been hugging you to her chest all night, her fur keeping you warm and toasty like a child's favorite blanket, but she's also inadvertently blocked both your mouth and your nose. Even the panic you felt was delayed by the loving hug she was giving you. Nonetheless, you quickly begin to struggle, attempting to force your head sideways just for a little bit of fresh air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, <i>please</i>...don't leave...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour squirming is almost stop in its tracks. The way she said that...it was like she thought you were trying to escape from her! Was she having a nightmare about you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour tiny body is smushed between her paw and tummy as she starts to move in her sleep. \"I'm sorry...! I didn't mean to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no...did she really still think you distrusted her? But you thought that you made it clear to her, with how okay you were being put...<i>inside her.</i> Even as you push against her fuzzy navel, you can't help but feel a pang of guilt yourself. Though you know that your concerns about being in her mouth were at least a teensy bit justified (not that you'd ever think she'd hurt you now), it hurts knowing that your reluctance has caused her so much grief. This was really weighing down on her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...know that isn't...an excuse, but...I never wanted you to get hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel was almost thrashing around on the loveseat now, eyes clenched shut, and the beginnings of tears dripping down her face. You feel sick to your stomach, frustration overcoming you; you'd probably punch your dream self if he were here right now. In a newfound burst of strength brewed by your conviction, you flip your body around in your partners grasp, hug yourself tightly into her paw, and plant your lips harshly into her fur. Over and over again, you press peck after peck across her fuzzy fingers, keeping them close to your form as you gasp in breaths, getting your blood flowing again. Already, she's calming down; her tossing and turning weaken with each calming kiss you lay. You even start stroking her hand with your arms, slowly, yet firmly, letting her know that you're okay now, everything is <i>okay...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that your actions might not be enough, you lean up and firmly speak. \"There's nothing to be sorry for, Buizel. I trust you. I always have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe comforting tone of your voice, though distant, was enough to rouse her from the troubled sleep she was in.\"Mmph! Mmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she loosens her grip on you, returning to the gentle, cuddling hold you were in before. This time you could breath well and good, facing her paws instead of the expanse of fine fuzz beneath you. You nuzzle yourself into the soft, cream-colored fur, letting the gentle, secure warmth of Buizel's belly soak into you. She responds by massaging you further into her coat, trapping you in an embrace you'd never want to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue stroking your arms into her plush palm, returning the same gentle, soothing rubbing that lulled you to sleep. A deep exhaustion that you hadn't noticed before spread across your form, and you relax. She's calm. You're calm. Soon, rest comes for the both of you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you wake up on your own time, last night's happenings still foggy in your mind. Not-so-coincidentally, your partner wakes up right after; you two had always started the day together, so it makes sense that your internal clocks were set the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel casually nudges a finger into your stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you awake yet?\" she whispers, snickering a bit. You lie there for a moment, then suddenly wrap your arms and legs around her poking paw, blowing a raspberry into her fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hehe, k-knock that off! You're tickling me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause for only a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a chance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you resumed your blowing. Buizel laughed, a pleasant nostalgia filling her. You used to do that to her when you woke up first, only you did it into her belly, like a normal raspberry. Although you were still tiny, and the minuteness of the sensation made that more than obvious, it was still reassuring to know that things weren't too different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, this is getting a <i>bit</i> old now,\" she huffs, a little smile still beaming through her lips as she plucks you away from her fingers with her other paw. You think about doing it again, but you decide against it. She was right; the joke ran its course a while ago. Still, it was pretty nice to do that, even at your size. Maybe things really won't be so different...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, your partner noticed the slight stickiness of your body. She blinks, then smirks, remembering the details of last night. \"Oh, jeez. I see I forgot to give you a little washdown after, uh, your little <i>escapade</i> downstairs. Lemme fix that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paw holding you slowly lifts upwards, bringing you closer to Buizel's mouth.Her tongue lolls out alluringly, letting you get an intimate view of her open maw. An electric tingle shoots down your spine and pinpoints right on your crotch; even if you had amnesia, your body would likely respond the same way. You're not sure you'd ever forget what that tongue did to you...at least, not anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of just dumping you into her mouth, your partner gives you a teasing lick. The both of you realize just how bad of an idea that was near-instantly; Buizel almost immediately jerks her head aside and brings an arm up to her face, pressing her tongue against it to get rid of the rather unpleasant taste of all her (and partially your) bodily fluids that had dried off during the cool of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Blech,</i>\" she gags, clearly not feeling like the smartest Pokemon around. \"Man, why did I not see that coming...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at her, struggling not to laugh. You felt kind of bad for her, but again, what did she expect? As you sniff your body, though, you admit that it's probably a good idea to get you to some clean water ASAP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you had to milk this a <i>little bit more.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahaha! Now you know how it feels when I eat one of those mystery berries you give me. It's like playing Wheel of Misfortune with my taste buds sometimes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel grumbles, minor annoyance shining through her disgust. \"Hey! It's not like I got you poisoned or anything. I'm seriously gonna have to wash my mouth out! What kind of Water-Type has to do that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently one that finally taste-tests her own food for once,\" you snicker back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour partner puffs up her cheeks. \"Alright, that's it! You just earned yourself a good ol' watergunnin', mister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle nervously, not eager to get supersoaker'd just yet. \"W-wait! Wait! It was just a joke-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stream of cool water hits you in the face; or rather, it hits your entire body at once, but it would've hit you in the face if you were normal-size. This wasn't your first time getting hit with that move when Buizel was miffed; fortunately enough, she decided to go easy on you, only letting out a small squirt of cool liquid. Whatever vestiges of sleep were still clouding your mind were thoroughly washed away, unlike the gunk on your body. At this, the two of you flush hotly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wow. We...really got wild last night, didn't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp, recalling how lustful, yet at peace you felt while you were in her pussy. You could practically feel her heartbeat when you were giving her the massage of her lifetime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn awkward moment passes. Buizel's blushing profusely, staring down at you in thought. She opens her mouth to speak, then closes it again, not really sure what to say; after a while, she just shakes her head and talks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we...get back into it, we should probably get you cleaned up first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she holds you to her chest and walks to the bathroom. A strong, cool breeze buffets you, a stark contrast to your partner's soothing body heat. The bobbing movement caused by her gait is making you slightly dizzy. You guess she never really took more than a couple of steps with you in hand until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment, your partner steps into the bathroom with you in tow. Instead of bringing you to the sink, though, she turns and stares at the bath tub. It was larger than normal, and came pre-installed into the house. It made the leg space of the room a bit cramped, but its pros far outweighed its cons. Both you and Buizel could play together comfortably--and now, there was even more room to spare! Not to mention all the sorts of toys and <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel turned the hot water on, and you were both left to wait for the tub to slowwwly fill up. That's one of the cons; or at least, it <i>would</i> be if you and your partner ever ran out of ways to entertain each other. There were a variety of topics you wanted to speak to her about. The weird berry she made you eat, what the two of you were going to do today, her paranoia-induced nightmare... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure if you want to bring up that last one so soon. It'd probably put a damper on things. Well, even if it would be easier to ignore it, your better judgement tells you that isn't the best idea. That was...a pretty troubling dream she had. Anyhoo, it'd be good to break the silence. It wasn't awkward, but it wasn't soothing, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Buizel,\" you blurt out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glances down at you, a. \"Hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you wanna talk about...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Buizel perked up, a smile growing on her face as the countless possibilities for what the day may hold ran through her mind. It wasn't often that you and her had had a day completely to yourselves, let alone a full-on foreseeable future where you had no choice but to be inseparable. It brought her back to the time a blizzard left the two of you snowed-in, and together you lazed the chilly days and nights away sharing the same heavy blanket, and watching the same cheesy action shows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the ever-changing condition of the weather though, what was keeping you two close now was something she had some amount of control over now, she just wasn't sure, yet, how much control she <i>wanted</i> to have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... yeah! After our bath, we can do pretty much whatever we want for the whole day!...Er, after our bath and a hearty breakfast that is, I can imagine you're as peckish as I am.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were indeed, stomach growling at the idea that it may soon be filled with actual food. \"<i>Literally.</i> I feel like just few little bites of something would be enough to sate me at this size,\" you said with a giggle, finding the image of you nibbling at an oversized breakfast food, specifically an oversized stack of freezer pancakes that you often made the main part of your 'balanced' breakfast, to be just as humorous as it was humbling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel shared in your giggle for a moment, before getting latched onto a certain thought. \"Hm, I wonder... Would the flavor of food be stronger or more subtle to you with you so small? Your tastebuds are <i>teeny</i> now, but how much does that really heighten the flavor of crumbs, I wonder...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought back to the flavors you had already gotten a sampling of at your size, recalling their surprising sharpness even as they were diluted in spittle or detectable only via a, <i>admittedly incredibly potent</i>, aroma. \"When there's something to taste, it's... very strong,\" you said simply, feeling as though you could detect the sickly sweet hint of Cheri berries on your tongue for just a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Pokemon raised an eyebrow. \"How would you know? You haven't ate something at this size, have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't... <i>ate</i> anything, but when I was in your mouth yesterday, I.... uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel blinked, before sending her free paw straight to her forehead. \"O- Oh right. Totally spaced on the whole you having no choice but to swallow ounces of my saliva thing,\" she said like it was a perfectly normal sentence, glancing over to the nearly-full tub. \"Bet you're glad we're about to take this bath. You can cleanse your body <i>and</i> your soul...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it was still better than some of those berries you've made me taste... Like <i>way better</i>... It's almost tragic how much better it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh c'moooon, how long are you gonna keep bringing that up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forever until you apologize profusely,\" you sent back jokingly, making a dramatic show out of you crossing your arms and turning your head off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a chance! Exposing yourself to new and exotic flavors helps to expand one's palate~!\" she chirped like she'd become the host of a cooking show, slightly patronizing tone to her voice and all. And given how many of those kinds of shows she liked to watch, there was a good chance she had borrowed that notion wholesale from one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It certainly was... exotic,\" you murmured, finding the topic of berries had led you down a certain train of thought. \"H- Hey Buizel, before we hop in... Uhm... Can you maybe give me a lowdown on what that shrinking berry's all about. On how it works and... how you found out about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel paused for a moment, expression noticeably shifting. \"Yeah, I first heard about that particular type of berry from an old tome I found in an ancient library, the book itself enchanted with a ghostly aura. As I flipped through the pages, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're lying, and I'm <i>not</i> gonna let you pull the rug out from under me this time,\" you interrupted, probably more proud of yourself than you really should've been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious,\" she sent back without a drop of sarcasm, eyes boring into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tensed up, feeling a chill run down your spine. \"Y- You're.... <i>serious?</i>\" you stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a blink, her peepers went back to being lazy and half-lidded, smile becoming equally as smug-looking, \"...No, I read up on it using your PC, and found one in the bushes over by the river.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just <i>had</i> to find a way to pull the rug out from under you anyways, not to mention reveal that she sometimes uses your home PC without you even knowing. \"Oh <i>haha</i>, you're so funny Buizel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...\" she returned as her cocky smirk only grew, setting you on the outer edge of the tub. This let the warmth radiating of the hot water wash over you with wave after goosebump-inducing wave, yet it was the look Buizel had started giving you that created the most truly pleasant feeling of warmth. That of the inward variety - a kind you were very familiar with as of late. \"S- Seriously though, the berry's only meant to shrink those that ingest it for, like, two days tops. It should leave your system before the days up, and then, well... you'll grow back... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel reached over and turned off the water, returning her focus to you with eyes as soft as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's up to you once we're done with this bath, if, y'know... you want to just have breakfast with the fruit we already have here at home, or... go out and do a little bit of berry scavenging beforehand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that wording, you found yourself reminiscing on the times you and her went out berry-hunting. There was a decent while where you didn't quite understand what she got out spending hours on end searching for potentially terrible-tasting fruit, but when you finally decided to go out and share in her seemingly strange interest, and became privy to its charms, you made it a weekly habit to go foraging with her from then on. Just exploring the great outdoors with her was wonderful enough, but it was also surprisingly fun finding rare variants of berries growing in the wild on top of that. At least as long as she wasn't making you taste-test each and every one, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt warmed your heart to know, though, that from here on out she wasn't going be pushy, or even remotely pressuring trying to get you to taste more of the latest berry you had sampled. She wouldn't dare be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But let's have this bath, huh?\" she piped, suddenly jumping into the tub at speed great enough that it created a sizable splash, causing you to get drenched before you could even dip a toe in the water. Though you supposed that was the wrong way at looking at it, since you couldn't really 'dip your toe in the water' at this size anyways. The only way you were going to get clean<i>was</i> through splashes, and maybe the briefest dips below the surface cradled safely in a paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uh... how are we gonna do this?\" you inquired, wondering if she had a plan for how to go about bathing with someone who had the capacity to drown in the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel maneuvered over to the edge, before letting her natural buoyancy let her easily float on her back. \"Hop on...\" she encourage warmly, drifting upwards so that her base was just a small jump away for you. \"...C'mon, don't be shy~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure how you could be at this point, but there was still something oddly daunting about the idea of using Buizel as your life raft. Admittedly, though, there was also something <i>thrilling</i> about it; the idea of having your treasured companion be the only thing keeping you above what was a considerably deep tub of water for you, even amongst all the deeply sensual acts the two of you had partaken in, felt special in its own, almost silly sort of way. And eventually, with a somewhat surprising amount of patience on her part, that thrill did win out in the end, getting you to leap forward onto Buizel's form like you were embracing a bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome aboard the S.S. Buizel,\" she chimed as you found your footing, bright beam forming on her muzzle, before twinging just a bit. \"You may have come aboard at a bad time though, we've currently found ourselves trapped between four giant icebergs. There's no where to go...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked across the wide range of the bathtub, supposing that equating its walls to towering icebergs was a decent enough comparison to make if she was really going for the whole 'S. S. Buizel' thing. \"What's the protocol?\" you sounded back with her same mockingly no-nonsense tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The protocol is...  to panic! Not only are we surrounded by impassable icebergs, but we were hit by one right on our port-bow! This ship'll be at the bottom of the ocean in less than a minute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I literally just boarded... and there's no way a single iceberg would sink an entire ship... Your story-telling leaves a lot to be desired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't a story, this is <i>real life!</i> Now get on the lifeboat before you're swimming with the Magikarp!\" she hollered, floating a rubber Ducklett by her form for you to jump to. Rolling your eyes, you played along, hopping on and clinging to it's light blue neck for dear life as it aimlessly spun around with you atop it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it finally came to a stop, and you found your bearings, you were able to get a good view of Buizel slowly submerging herself underneath the bathwater, clearly having far too much fun playing the role of a sinking ship. And for what felt like almost a full thirty seconds, you waited for her to reemerge, until she finally did with a dramatic slowness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you now, like a ghost ship or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled in response, wiping her eyes. \"Uh... I'm not really sure... I guess I didn't think this far down the roleplay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you could start playing the role of a giant Buizel helping her tiny human get clean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel brought a paw to her muzzle and tilted her head to the side, eventually answering...</span></div></div>",

I've already got an idea of where that whole sea monster thing was going,\" you pause, thinking about what happened earlier. \"Do you really want me in your mouth again, after what happened when we woke up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel blinks, paw still resting on her muzzle. \"Huh...I think I could find some way to make it work,\" she turns her eyes up, lost in thought, then glances back down at you. \"And judging from last time, you didn't mind being in there, either~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush furiously at the lewd thoughts those simple words and teasing tone conjured in your mind.

She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehee, I guess you really did love it. Don't worry, you'll get some alone time with my tongue later. For now, though, we should get you cleaned up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mumble out a 'thank you', still not entirely relieved of the memories you had, being pinned down and coaxed to completion by Buizel's tongue...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she props herself up against one of the 'icebergs' and leans back, placing you front-side up on her cute, cream-furred belly. The warm water splashing softly against your legs works alongside the body heat of her torso and digits in soothing your tension, and you can almost feel your eyelids drooping; that is, until Buizel starts talking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ancient sea-faring Pokemon, name lost to time, spots a survivor fleeing from the wreckage of the ship. Unused to seeing other life, she assumed the passenger was a kindred spirit. He, too, was alone in the world...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crack a cheeky grin. \"Oh, we're still doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"C'mon, at least play along a little!\"</i> she whispers angrily, trying and failing to hide her amusement at your usual banter. Her angry face is just <i>adorable,</i> so even though you were contemplating being a stick in the mud, you decided to relent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, I'll shut up until it's my turn to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You promise?\" Buizel squints her eyes at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinky promise?\" she wiggles a finger against your torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou huff exasperatedly. \"<i>Yes,</i> I pinky promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not sticking out your pinky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You couldn't see it even if I did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair point.\" she concludes, an amused smile on her face. \"Now, where was I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! The mysterious Pokemon from the depths of the ocean has found the stranded sailor far offshore. She rescued him from floating helplessly across the ocean, plucking his figure from the meager vessel. Then, she gently lifts him to her maw, placing him inside, giving him a momentary rest. There, he wouldn't have to hold his breath, or be put under the crushing pressure of the deep...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's really hard not to quip throughout that entire cheesy story, but you find yourself grinning anyway. Buizel's vocabulary was pretty impressive! Though that brings up the question of whether or not that's what she's actually saying, or if that's the berry translating her feelings instead of her prose, and lots of other things that you quickly decide you shouldn't think about, lest this whole situation get even more confusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ancient Pokemon dives deep into the ocean floor, holding her breath for many minutes while she returns to her underwater home. She softly lapped at her new tiny, curious friend, keeping him warm and...hydrated,\" she stops, then shakes her head, flushing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, she happens upon her retreat: a shallow sea-cavern, filled with an unnatural bubble of air that kept the brine from flooding the chambers. Pulling herself out of the water, she gasps for breath, letting the man in her maw get some fresh air, too. The sour tang of debris and other filth was constant on her tongue; the panic of the shipwreck must have dirtied him somehow! Compassion filling her breast, the massive beast carried her companion to another pool, this one tinted a soothing pink...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down, noticing that the bathtub was, indeed, filled with pink water! How did she manage to sneak one of your bath bombs into the water without alerting you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...she lays him down, resting him against her soft, beautiful belly, then reassures him of her intentions with powerful telepathy. 'I see you've dealt with a lot in the past few hours. Perhaps you'd like to freshen up in my bathing pool?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile fondly, still amazed by your partner's prose. \"Y-yes, I would rather like that. I must thank you for your help in saving me from that shipwreck, Ma'am. I was in grave danger of wasting away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel beams down at you, loving how much you were getting into character. \"Then let us begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually, she began to nudge at your body, dipping you further beneath the surface of the colored water. Delicately scrubbing at your limp legs, submerged as they were, she began to remove the dried muck that covered your body. Her paws had a surprising amount of finesse; you've seen her handle objects with them before, but you underestimated just how much control she had over the muscles in her digits. They ground gently into your skin, massaging you in addition to cleaning the filth on you. You groaned in relief as you felt more and more of her touch, and nuzzled yourself into the palm of the paw holding you still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhm, it's quite nice to have a guest that's so appreciative of his host's hard work,\" Buizel smirks, still very much enjoying the scenario she had made up in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I, ah,\" you stammer, your concentration broken by the intense pleasure you're feeling from your partner's gentle ministrations. \"I'm...very grateful, Ma'am. I haven't felt this, ah, intimate with someone in a long time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel senses how hard it was for you to keep up, feeling pride at her roleplaying skills. \"Oh, little one, don't speak if it troubles you. Just <i>relax;</i> let your gracious host smother you some more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder at the way she talked; a vivid flashback of when she dangled you over her waiting mouth zipped through your mind. Sighing tiredly, you lean into the plush expanse of her stomach. It was getting hard to think about anything other than the expert massage she was giving you. You could sit here for hours, snuggling into her paw's gentle embrace...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you feel a sharp jolt of pleasure run up your spine. Buizel had been moving her fingers slowly up your shins, to your knees, to your thighs, rubbing each of your legs at a steady pace, leaving your mind blank and blissful. It was natural that she'd pass by your waist, but that didn't make it any less titillating. With one calculated thrust forward, she managed to get you erect nigh-instantly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, my guest flatters me,\" Buizel chuckles, obviously pleased with your body's reaction. \"Well, we can't just leave your little friend unattended, can we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lurch, gasping in surprise as your partner suddenly clasps two of her digits over your throbbing member and gets to work. Even with the threat of water splashing against your face and choking you, your arousal isn't dampened a bit. Her orange digits retain their soft, fuzzy texture, the natural oil her pores produce keeping her fur from getting wet. With a fervent grip that almost seems <i>trained,</i> she elegantly strokes you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind swirled, taking in the world that your partner created...it all felt so real! It only took minutes for you to reach your breaking point; entranced as you were, there was nothing you could do to prevent yourself from blowing your load. The delicate clutches of Buizel's paws inevitably coaxed it out of you, and you came ecstatically into the water of the bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmh...\" she hummed lustfully. \"I accept your tribute, human. I only regret that you couldn't have given it to me more...<i>inimately~</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the resplendent afterglow, you showered your partner's paw with kisses, showing your appreciation to her the best way you know how. In response, she chuckled and lowered your body ever-so-slightly deeper into the sparkling bathwater. She began to stroke your chest, rubbing some of the grime off of your torso and arms, too. After she felt you were decently clean, she flipped you over and did your back. You sunk even more into the softness of her belly as she worked out your kinks in addition to washing you. Finally, she left you to wash your head of the muck, which took some concentrated effort on your part. Dry saliva (and more unspeakable body fluids) was a real annoyance to remove, but coming from Buizel, it was always worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you were cleaned from head to toe, she set you down on an aqua ring she formed, allowing you to float like you were on a lifesaver. That was...a <i>very</i> intense experience. You never knew that roleplaying could be that fulfilling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel looked down at you, then smiled and turned away demurely. \"So...did you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I LOVED it!\" you shout, pumping your fists into the air. Though you were fairly tired from your climax, your exhaustion was far outweighed by the excitement you felt. Buizel just shared something very intimate with you, something she couldn't truly show you without being able to talk to you; you owe it to her to let her know how much you enjoyed her little game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! I always wanted to do this with you,\" she beams hopefully at you. \"If you don't mind...could we do it again sometime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely! I call dibs on the scenario, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe huffs childishly, a bit miffed at the suggestion. \"Oh, alright. You better think of something good, though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should probably get out of this bath before you get pruney and I get wet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, probably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's in store next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once you both got out of the tub, and had dried yourselves off thoroughly, Buizel didn't wait long to present a certain question. A question that was a whole lot more important than the casual inquiry about your breakfast that it appeared to be on the face of it. She didn't pin you down with it, though, merely sending it out there as she made her out out of bathroom, giving you ample time to think things through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were countless different factors swaying you from one side to the other: from the possible ramifications of you becoming the local hermit of your community, to the fact that some berries to go along with your breakfast didn't sound all too bad... From the possible dangers of being so small in the great outdoors, to the idea of not being able to understand Buizel's speech anymore...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last thought particularly got to you. After just having experienced what felt like the height of pleasure her voice as you were perceiving it could bring you, it was almost impossible for you to imagine going back to only hearing her own name, even as it had been such a set-in-stone norm for so many years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're at the crossroads... What're ya thinking?\" she asked, bringing you up closer to her head. You noticed that she was standing in the living room, equal distance from both the kitchen and the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Your voice caught in your throat, the syllable escaping you before you even had an answer. \"I.... I think it would be, uhm... nice to go berry-hunting with you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel couldn't hide her smile as it slowly grew on her face, a light hum resounding from her form: one that was even easier to detect when she suddenly hugged against the upper part of her chest! \"Then let's get out there already~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't quite realize how much you were in need of some time outdoors until you were basking in the sun's warm rays, and taking in some fresh air with every breath. That much seemed like it was always true -- you were far from the most active trainer around, and certainly not the type to stay outside all day looking to battle -- but you found this berry-hunt had already been <i>particularly</i> refreshing what with the plethora of relieving sensations it offered you. The heat of the sun balanced out by a crisp breeze, the pleasant sound of gently swaying leaves and a calm river's flow, the sweet smells of thriving plant-life: it all came together to be just as invigorating as it was relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel was feeling pretty relaxed herself. She hadn't yet been able to find any of the exact berry she was looking for, but she was already feeling good about her haul on the whole. If she hadn't been in search of a special, bluish-purple type of berry, and more importantly, if she didn't have you with her, resting on the top of the repurposed picnic basket she was carrying, she probably would've called things already. But every moment spent out here with you felt special, so as long as she had a great excuse to keep going, she was content with idea of foraging for hours more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would probably take some issue with that idea, though, not because you weren't having a pleasant time, and <i>certainly</i> not because you were having second thoughts about staying shrunk, but rather... because your hunger was starting to become a bit of an issue, especially now that berries were the main focus of your conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, we could just come back out after breakfast and try again... I'm sure there's still plenty of time before I grow back,\" you eventually called up to her, stomach letting out a little growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you don't want to just munch one of the berries in the basket for now? Trust me, those yellow ones are really good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pursed you lips, quite skeptical of that claim. \"Mm, I don't know if I trust your judgement after you hyped up that one orange lumpy berry that ruined my taste-buds for, like... a whole week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're just a baby when it comes to spicy stuff! Besides, you like Cheri berries, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Cheri berries are okay, I guess...\" you murmured, having gotten a taste of them more recently than she could ever know. \"Pretty sure you've already picked this entire route clean of those, though... if the pantry at home's any indication.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't shame my vices! I just know what I like~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but chuckle, soon noticing that Buizel had stopped in her tracks, sights set on nothing in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, but alright, we can go have breakfast first...\" she said, starting the trek back back home. \"Sooo...what are ya hungry for today? Some panc-- <i>EEP!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel yelped when her left foot didn't meet the ground, getting crammed into a foliage-covered crevice. Instinctively, she assumed a death grip on the basket's wicket handle, knowing that letting the basket tumble with you on it could be a potentially disastrous slip-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y- Yeah, I'm fine... there's some kinda...\" Buizel freed her foot-paw, peering down into the hole. \"...<i>Whooa</i>, no way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel took you in her right paw, bringing you close to the burrow. You were shocked at what you saw, finding you had to a do a double-take for the sight to even register. \"It's a bunch of those berries! They were all right here this whole time!\" she chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second thought, she started nabbing up the berries with her free hand, dumping them all in the basket excitedly. If it was you in her position, though, you'd probably be a little bit more hesitant. \"This feels... too good to be true.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh, best not to question fate, y'know? This sets us up for weeks!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" you mumbled, still feeling a tad wary. \"....Let's just go have some breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing!\" She closed the basket and hoisted it up with one paw -- you safely cradled in the other -- and a started making her way to the house with no more hidden burrows to trip her up. \"You feeling pancakes today?\" she asked, now able to get the question fully out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. No syrup or anything, though... I don't want my entire body to get sticky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, don't pretend like you've got a problem with getting sticky now~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blush flared up at your cheeks, unconcealable even by the hand that you sent towards you face. \"C- C'mon, that was a reach... We're talking about breakfast syrup here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel only giggled in response, clearly getting a lot of amusement from seeing you wound up. Maybe she did feel a <i>little</i> bad, though, one of the giant orange digits nestling you starting to rub the top of your head, almost apologetically. Slowly, you slumped back in Buizel's hand, feeling a wonderful sense of comfort wash over y--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hey!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA powerful, feminine voice suddenly sounded out, freezing Buizel's stride and launching your heart up to your throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, Buizel! Any idea where my stash of berries got off to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel brought her head down in an instant, inches from your form. \"Stay quiet...\" she whispered in a single breath, opening the basket and depositing you inside. It was an easy instruction to follow, at least as long as your throat felt so utterly stopped up, but that did little to abate your spiked nerves. The gloomy dimness that set in around you when Buizel closed the basket only made things worse, light reaching your newfound confinement as mere shreds peeking through the wicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to be more specific,\" Buizel called before she even looked back to the source of the voice, and when she did, any amount of confidence she had tried to muster up was stolen from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh Arceus... A Lucario?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding just a bit aways from Buizel was the powerful final evolution, partly dimmed by the shadow of a tree with a cold, hard-to-read expression. \"The hole here I had stuffed with berries just a few hours ago. The purple ones... The ones I spent hours hunting down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel could no longer bring herself to be coy, slowly rediscovering her voice. \"I- I didn't know they were yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lucario's left eye pinched up, seemingly more out of skepticism than annoyance. \"You found a stash filled with exactly one type of berry... and you didn't think that they <i>maybe</i> belonged to someone else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you even need them for?\" Buizel quickly shot back, unconsciously taking the basket into a tight hold .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To eat. What else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel's sights fell to the ground, foot-paws shifting beneath her \"...I know that's not true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? ...And how's that?\" The Lucario questioned, voice carrying a condescending lilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Because</i>... If you eat them you'll probably shrink. They're not normal berries... A- And you clearly know that, or you wouldn't have hoarded them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smirk gradually appeared on the Lucario's muzzle, clear as day even as it was half-obscured in shadow. \"Mmm, I have to say, I never took you for that kind of Pokemon. You've always come as an innocent little forager to me... Never would've guessed you had... ulterior motives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel felt the blood drain from her face at those words, not liking <i>a single thing</i> about what they implied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, though, you're in good company...\" she continued vaguely, slowly making her way closer. \"In fact, how about we make a deal, one self-invented goddess to another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L- Look, I'll give you all the berries back, okay? Just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't really mean a deal like that. Perhaps calling it a... repayment would be more apt... After all, I'm not just gonna let a little thief like you off scot-free. Especially not one so... interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel's heart was pounding in her chest, so strong that you felt it resound through the inside of basket as she held it tight against her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" The Lucario started with a note of finality in her voice, now only a few feet away...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The second those words came out of Lucario's mouth, you could feel your partner balk and freeze up. You were too busy getting jumbled around with the berries to do the same, so you just let the dread of this new Pokemon's presence wash over you. Was she bluffing? Or did she have some way to detect your figure, even from inside the berry basket? Buizel was thinking much the same, yet as she deliberated, an awful realization dawned on her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait, all Lucario have the ability to sense auras! Of course she could see him!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel gripped the handle tightly. She hated the thought of putting you in danger more than anything else, but keeping you in the basket now would be doing exactly that. With no small amount of reluctance, she took her free paw, opened the lid obscuring you from the outside world, then carefully picked you out between the various berries you were trapped beneath. You know in your heart that she wouldn't throw you to the wolves (literally, in this case) just to save her own hide, so you don't resist when she lifts you up for this seedy stranger to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario beams frighteningly as she catches the sight of your puny form within Buizel's fingers, and instantly, you could tell why she didn't attempt to fight back or flee; it was those bone-chilling eyes, the ones that seemed to bore through your very soul. From that one glance, it seemed obvious that she did not regard you--or anyone like you--in any way, shape, or form as <i>anything </i> other than a toy for her to entertain herself with. Subconsciously, you burrow yourself deeper into your partner's palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so my intuition was correct, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you know that I know that wasn't a guess,\" Buizel mutters, squeezing you protectively as she notices the lone wolf's gaze. Lucario only scoffed in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. Guilty as charged. I could see the both of you the moment you stepped near my Faleli berry stash. The only thing that kept me from knocking you out the second you touched it was the tiny human you have there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour partner only grips you tighter to her chest in response. Even amidst the dreadful beating of her own heart, she could feel your own as strongly as hers. Instinctively, she presses her thumb over your head, stroking you in a vain attempt to calm you down. That's not to say it wasn't comforting, just that the terror of the situation made it impossible to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, did you think I was going to steal your little toy?\" the aura-sensing Pokemon chuckled, \"I'm sorry to have worried you. I wouldn't dare insult a fellow self-made goddess like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she mentioned the word 'goddess', you felt your heart skip a beat. Both in embarrassment, knowing deep down that you truly enjoyed the control Buizel had over you, and dread, knowing this canine probably had a tiny human herself. One that, you'd suppose, didn't have <i>nearly </i>as much say over what happens to him as you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour partner's face hardened at the way this Lucario dismissed you. Not once in her (admittedly long) list of fantasies about shrinking you down did she <i>ever</i> want you to consider yourself lesser than her. Sure, she might've had less than savory dreams about how to use you, but every time, you were a willing party in the exchange. A pang of guilt runs down her spine as she tries to ignore the thought she inevitably worried about. All this pressure made it hard to think straight. One thing's for sure, though; she wasn't going to stand for this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm sorry that I took your berries, but I'm not going to sit here and let you treat my trainer like he's nothing! What kind of monster would <i>ever</i> consider their partner as a toy?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lucario shook her head, her disappointment palpable in the air. Just when she thought she found a kindred spirit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not keen on being talked down to by someone, Pokemon or not, that hasn't the patience to hear me out,\" her scowl deepened. \"Not only are you soft, you're presumptuous, too. No matter how much I made it perfectly clear something was wrong with how I lived, he never listened. There was no respect in our relationship,\" she paused, then gave Buizel a sinister leer, \"That is, until I used this fruit to make him assume his true role, at my beck and call. Even at his puny size, I can make use of him in...other ways~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel shivered, already getting a good idea of what this Lucario did to her shrunken trainer. \"Y-you <i>didn't...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I most certainly did,\" the canine rolled her eyes, then shot your partner a knowing look. \"And don't play coy. I can sense those desires in your head, you know. They're very intense. Did you not do the same thing to your own puny human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel cringed at that. She did shrink you without your permission, and disguised it as something innocuous. She even used you for her own pleasure--though unlike Lucario's trick, this one was meant to be mutual. That didn't make it any less of a violation of your trust and safety, though. Bile crept up in her throat as she revisited the delusion that you weren't going along with her games of your own free will...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...you could easily pick up on this, knowing how prone she was to thinking she was coercing you. It killed you inside to think she really trusted herself so little; and so, you decided to return the favor, wrapping your arms as firmly as you could around her digits and rubbing them with all your strength. For what it's worth, you could feel her pulse calm down a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut...that doesn't really solve the problem, does it? The problem being this nosy canine that's making your precious Buizel relapse! The way she's planting these misplaced seeds of doubt right back into her head makes your blood boil. How dare she hurt your partner?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving worked yourself up, you push your head out of the grip of Buizel's paw, then attempt to give that no-good Pokemon a good chewing out; an attempt that fails the second you open your mouth.

Her eyes were wide; she seemed shocked...and a little impressed, even!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. I wasn't expecting such a strong response from you, girl. There might be something more to your petty words.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe canine closed her eyes, putting a paw up to her chin in thought. She hadn't foreseen the kind of fierce protectiveness Buizel held for you. She didn't react like you were a plaything, or a pet, or even a lesser being. This was compassion one could only hold for an equal; and a close one, at that. Regardless, she had still done wrong by stealing those Faleli berries. You two weren't off the hook just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. I won't disparage your little human anymore. <i>However.</i> You still owe me for attempting to steal from my stash,\" she stated, clearly still interested in that spunk from before. \"So, I wish to have a talk, of sorts. If you manage to justify your lenient treatment of someone so literally beneath you, then I shall let you go. I may even allow you to keep some of the Faleli berries, if you impress me enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel grimaced, knowing she didn't really have a choice in the matter; it was either entertain Lucario or keep you in danger. Sighing, she loosened her grip on you, making it much easier to breath. Still, she rubbed your belly absentmindedly. It helped her think better. That, and the way you cozied up to her fingers was ridiculously cute...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. How do you want me to start? Any questions you have in particular?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe canine smiled playfully. \"Absolutely. First off, when I read your aura earlier, I detected your desire to dominate your trainer. Not only that, I picked up that you've done so, multiple times already. What is the difference between your actions and mine? <i>What,</i> exactly, makes me so vile in your eyes that does not also apply to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel's eyes lit up. This was easy! Maybe this wouldn't be as tricky as she thought...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the main thing that makes us different is the trust I share with my trainer. Every time we, uh,\" she pauses, blushing a bit at having to explain her sexy times with you, \"<i>pamper</i> each other, we always make sure we both want it. From what I'm hearing, you don't do that with yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario chuckles at the bizarre euphemism your partner came up with. \"That's not true at all! I can read his aura, don't you know? He always, hehe, <i>lets me know what he wants.</i> He's probably hornier than your own puny trainer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat earned a blink from both you and Buizel. Certainly, she wasn't thinking in the same terms as you were. Right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid I don't get what you mean. What do you mean, he 'lets you know what what he wants'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe canine rolled her eyes again. \"Oh, don't play dumb. You know <i>exactly</i> how! Sometimes I don't even need to read him; his body lets me know just the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep revulsion spread in Buizel's chest. That was the same line of thinking she'd caved in to when she first put you in her mouth. Yeah, it might've resulted in you and her being closer, but it was stupid and rash and hasty and could've made you <i>hate her forever--{/i]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should <i>know</i> better than that! I can't sense emotions, and even<i> I </i>know that's not how it works! Couldn't you tell he was scared? Anxious? Terrified, even?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah. Sure, he was a little scared, but that doesn't matter in the end, does it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OF COURSE IT DOES!\" Buizel shouted, \"How would you feel if someone messed with you like that without asking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario only raised an eyebrow. \"Why are you asking me how I'd feel? Isn't it normal to spring these kinds of things on someone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Well, in some cases, yes, but that's <i>after</i> you trust each other like me and my trainer,\" your partner replies, caressing you more softly. The stronger Pokemon's words had stirred some self-conscious in her actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. If that's the case, he certainly didn't let me know,\" Lucario muttered, brow furrowed at the notion that what she did was apparently 'taboo'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Buizel interjects, \"What do you mean by that? Did he do anything...'scary', to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, as a matter of fact. Whenever he'd come home from work, he'd hug me from behind and tickle my belly until he was sated. It felt nice, in a way, but even if I wasn't having it, he'd just keep on going until he got bored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. That's...pretty messed up. Hey, did you get physical with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I still hadn't realized how phony the whole thing was. Now I know it was a mistake to hold back; my power would have easily sufficed to stop him in his tracks,\" Lucario pauses for emphasis, \"There's the rub: power. He used to have it over me, keeping me in a ball, as well as that awful, subservient mental state. Now, I hold it freely. Anything I want him to do, he does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and your partner share a pang of sympathy for the Pokemon in front of you. The picture of how she got to this state was a lot clearer now. Her trainer might be a jerk, but you two know better than to attribute malice to something that could be explained by ignorance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...don't think that was the lesson to take from your experience, Lucario.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario breaks from her trance, giving the both of you a quizzical look. \"Oh? How so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Buizel pushed her tongue against her cheek, trying to word this correctly, \"You're right that power was a strong dynamic in that situation. But the problem is, that isn't the only thing at play; there's also something called <i>consent.</i> Your trainer wasn't right to tickle you against your will; he should have <i>known</i> you weren't enjoying it, and stopped. Even if he did have power over you, it was neglectful at best and malicious at worst for him to keep doing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinks, then bounces back through the conversation a bit. \"Of course, that isn't to say that him making you uncomfortable was something he did on purpose. Or that any of the bad things he did were intentionally malicious. He might not have been able to tell just how much you disliked his tickling, or the ball, or your general lifestyle. I don't want to pressure you or anything, but it'd probably be a good idea to talk to him about this, now that he can understand you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario was stunned. She hadn't expected such a thorough argument from this small, unassuming Pokemon in front of her, yet here she was, feeling conflicted for the first time in quite a while. It wasn't enough to totally shake her to the core, but it put a crack in her wall, that's for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" she muttered, still somewhat wide-eyed, \"I might do just that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, Buizel and Lucario just stood there, occasionally moving their gazes away from the scenery, only to stare awkwardly at each other, then look away again. The former, now feeling comfortable with holding you out in the open, simply sat you in her palm and started massaging your back with a singular digit. Both of your hearts were still racing from the tense conversation and disconcerting revelations she had with the latter. Their paces slowed as everything seemed to work out, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was your partner who broke the silence. \"If we're finished here, I'll just, uh, give these berries back--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No, it's fine,\" the canine murmured, staring at the intimate display of affection Buizel was giving you, \"You can keep them. Just...leave a few for me, will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole unbearably tense meeting with the intimidating Lucario ended with your partner tossing five or six of the ten Faleli berries she'd nabbed from the stash right back into it. The only thing exchanged before you two rushed back home was a goodbye and a strangely shy wave...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhose story do you follow?</i></span></div></div>",

You were slightly miffed at the fact she shrunk you and immediately decided to have a nap but then again it wasn't so bad. It let you compose yourself better as you took in the extreme size difference between you and your sleeping Pokemon. Her belly was like a rolling sea of cream and orange fur as she gently snored in and out. Thankfully you were small enough that you couldn't easily fall off her rounded stomach and even then two large yellow tubes would catch you if you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel's fur was always very soft and impeccably clean which made her great for cuddles but now that you've been shrunken you were curious what it felt like to be able to sleep in it. Laying down on your back you stretch your limbs throughout her fur and feel yourself sink into it. You let out a contented sigh as you savor the warmth of her body heat and the soft hairs tickling your bare body. However, your movements seemed to have stirred Floatzel in her sleep. You let out a shocked yelp as you see a large paw suddenly appear over you and rush down towards your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the impact wasn't that hard but you were very lucky you weren't hurt. It reminded you that with such an extreme size difference she could very well break you if she isn't careful. Right now that fact didn't worry you, any anxiety you felt soon fading as you relaxed under her paw and let the warmth envelop you. Well, you might as well sleep as well at this point. You let yourself sink further into her fur and relax. Soon your eyes start to feel heavy and you start to drift off... Until you hear a certain noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a wet noise that was coming from her mouth. You paled as you remembered a certain bad habit Floatzel had. Ever since she was a Buizel she had a habit of suckling or chewing on things when she was sleeping. Many times when you stayed up with her and watched a movie you would look over and see her unconsciously munching on a pillow or even your hand after she fell asleep. It was pretty cute even if it did ruin some cushion coverings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now though it was anything but cute. Turning your head to look at her face you could see her lightly opening and closing her mouth, giving you a glimpse of her sharp, white teeth. The fact that her digits were wrapping tighter around you also did nothing to alleviate your anxiety, they were gripping you tight enough to keep you trapped in her paw!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Floatzel?\" You nervously call out to her. She only restlessly dragged you a short distance up her belly in response. If she does decide to use you as a chew toy the best case scenario was that you could try and wake her up when you get closer to her face. The worst case, you get put in her mouth and possibly eaten. You hope it didn't come to that, though.</span></div></div>",

You are still sitting on your couch, but you have shrunk significantly, and you guess you're just a few inches tall now. And to make matters worse, your Chikorita is standing on the couch right before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Grass-type Pokemon is not looking at you, though. She's glancing around, with a confused expression on her face. Apparently, she's looking for the source of that light. It seems like she wasn't the cause of it. But then what was? And how did it make you shrink?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chikorita lets out a sad cry, and then finally looks down at you. You stare up into her enormous red eyes, each bigger than you are (although Chikorita tend to have very big eyes in the first place), and stand frozen with fear. Sure, this Chikorita is yours, and is friendly, but at your new size, will she still see you as her friend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'll find out soon. The Chikorita extends a vine from the back of her neck, and you watch as it snakes towards you. It reaches you and begins to loop around your torso, deftly coiling you up from chest to waist and pinning the arms you forgot to move out of the way. Instinctively, you squirm against the tight grip of the vine, but it's useless. The Chikorita hoists you into the air and up to her face, bringing you within inches of her gigantic visage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't squirm anymore. You're just overcome with awe and fear at the scale of your once diminutive Pokemon. And you're afraid of what she'll do to you, as she now has you in her grasp, under her control... Will she be nice like before, or will she turn mischievous?</span></div></div>",

You found a young torchic in the woods all alone. The torchic was malnourished and seemed sickly so you took her back to your house and nursed her back to health. 6 years had passed and the torchic (who you named Ember) has evolved into a combusken and shows no sign of ever leaving your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you were currently in the backyard preparing for an upcoming gym battle in a nearby town. While you were packing your backpack with essential supplies like potions and full heals, Ember was practicing her double kick on a tree. You would occasionally glance at her watching the sharp white talons on her feet chip of the bark. Oh how would you love to put those long supple bird toes into your mouth... oops got off track there. It is amazing that you've manage to hide your foot fetish this long since you are head over heels (no pun intended) for Ember's feet! As you continued packing your backpack you began to fantasize about Ember's feet. Just as you were finishing up you began to feel lightheaded and blacked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you slowly open your eyes you noticed two things. One was the fact that you were completely naked and the other was that the blades of grass rose above you like skyscrapers. Somehow you had shrunk! You didn't know how small you were but if you had to guess you would say maybe half an inch. Maybe even less than that! You had to get someone's help before you were eaten by an ant or something. Looking around you noticed your clothes had somehow disappeared so Ember or anyone else wouldn't notice them. Ember! She could help you. You just had to get her attention somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally noticing the silence behind her Ember stopped with her training and turned around noticing the empty backyard. Her master had somehow left without her hearing. She took a few steps forward and looked down at his backpack. It was sitting up straight and was full of medicine. It seems Master was done packing. Maybe he went back inside because he had forgotten something. Wiggling her toes slightly she began walking towards the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hopes began to soar when Ember turned around. This was your chance to get noticed! You began running towards Ember yelling at the top of your lungs.<br>\r\n\"Ember!! Down here! Help!\"<br>\r\nWhat you didn't expect however was Ember taking several steps toward you. The distance she traversed in her first step seemed like half a mile. When she brought her foot back down it created a loud BOOM that made you cover you ears out of fear of going deaf and the shockwave knocked you completely off your feet. You couldn't do anything but watch as the feet (which you were attracted to) of your own pokemon began to raise over you. You screamed as she lowered her foot and then darkness. </span></div></div>",

You began to open your eyes and noticed you were lying down in a mud pit with an immense weight on your back. A strange smell began to fill your nostrils. It was a musky smell and very strong. Most people would find a smell like that to be positively repulsive but to you it was the sweetest smell in existence. It also manage to get a 'lewd' response out of you judging from the feeling from your lower area. The smell made you remember the time you stuck your face into Ember's feet that time she was sleeping... That's when it started to come back to you. Apparently you didn't die when Ember stepped on you. You must be pinned beneath her foot. At the size you are it should have been a 100% guarantee that you would have been squished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou must have some type of super durability to make up for you small size. It was then you noticed the massive pains coming from your back. You were too preoccupied with Ember's foot smell to notice but it seems that you are not invincible since something is definitely broken. A fresh jolt of pain went through your body as Ember wiggled her toes. It was then you knew that this wasn't going to be a good day since you were glued to her foot by the sweat and mud. \"Oh God No!\" you screamed as Ember raised her foot again with you stuck to it and then brought it crashing back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ember walked back to the house she looked around for her Master. He wasn't in the kitchen or living room so he must be upstairs. She didn't feel like going up there so she walked into the living room and propped her feet up on the coffee table. She could just relax down here and wait for Master. He wouldn't mind if she rested her eyes for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each step Ember took it seemed like something was broken. You only hoped you would still be able to move if you got off Ember's foot. Eventually the hard ground of the outside was replaced by the equally hard kitchen tile. Ember's talons made loud clicking noises as she walked through the kitchen and thankfully walked on the much softer carpet of the living room. It was too late however because you blacked out not to long after she walked into the house. Hopefully when you awaken you would be in a better position to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere are you?</span></div></div>",

You could then hear monstrous snores coming from behind and by putting the pieces together you guessed Ember must have fallen asleep with her feet on the coffee table. If you could get off her foot you could climb to the top of her toe and wake her up. That way she'd see you for sure. At that moment another wave of pain even worse than before rolled through your body. That plan just went out the window. There was no way you could make that climb in your current state especially considering that the climb was several hundred yards straight up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to you right you saw that the space between her toes wasn't too far away so you could make it there if you toughed through it. Gritting your teeth you climbed out of the wad of mud that attached you to Ember's foot and began climbing your way in-between her toes. After a minute or so you finally made it to the space between her toes. You wanted to take a breather but you couldn't stop now since she could wake up at any moment. You began to be on Ember's middle toe with as much strength as you could muster hoping to universe would show you some pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber slowly opened her eyes. She could feel something between her toes. It was probably a bug or something and she had half a mind to squeeze her toes together and squish it into oblivion. A small pang on mercy and pity appeared in her mind for some reason so instead of crushing it she grabbed it to see what it was. Gripping the bug in her finger talons she brought it to her face. She squinted her eyes to make it out since it almost looked like... Oh Arceus...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gamble seem to be paying off since Ember began opening her eyes. You hit her toe even harder as she began lowering her fingers toward you. The way she grabbed you wasn't exactly gentle since a fresh wave of pains started but you didn't care since you were happy at finally being found. Ember brought you towards her confused face squinting at you. You began waving towards her with your free arm and watched as recognition, realization, and horror crossed her face in the span of a few seconds. The tight grip Ember had on you instantly softened. Now that you were in safe hands or talons you should say you could tell Ember what happened and figure out how your going to live your life like this.</span></div></div>",

When you got to the part about her stepping and walking all over you she began to tear up. You hated to see Ember like this you so you lied telling her that you were completely unharmed and never in any real danger. You were never a good liar so Ember didn't buy it. She gingerly poked and prodded your tiny body to test your statements and despite your best efforts you cried out in pain. No matter how much you protested Ember made up her mind to personally look after you until you've healed. Even though you told her that a hospital would be a better place she disregarded you. You knew she wouldn't trust anyone with you in your vulnerable state even if they were trying to help. Ember could be stubborn like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were currently lying on top of a pillow on you and Ember's shared bed. Ember was one of those pokemon that didn't like being in a pokeball so you and her shared a bed. You didn't mind sharing it with her even though it was a pretty small. Her being a fire pokemon kept you warm during winter nights and you were attracted to her in a way. You wished Ember was here so you could have some company. She was currently doing chores and the only times she'd come in was to either bring you food (and by food you meant crumbs) or to take you to the bathroom. Now that was weird... Ember placed you on the edge of the toilet and stayed by you incase you accidently fell in or needed help. While you were peeing you swore you saw Ember glance down at your member (how she could actually see it at your size...). You began to wonder if Ember had feelings for you. Relationships between pokemon and people weren't frowned upon but neither were they encouraged... And now that your smaller than an ant how could you make it work...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou train of thought was derailed when the door to the room opened again. Night had fallen and Ember was ready to go to bed. You still had trouble accepting that something that huge was your pokemon. Ember moved back the blanket and climbed into bed. Time seemed to slow down for you as she slid her feet under the covers. One would think that the injuries you sustained would cause you to recoil from the thought of Ember's feet. The complete opposite happened. You were even more obsessed with them than you were before. Let's face it. You loved Ember and everything about her. You could confess your love to her right now but then again maybe you should wait a bit and see how things turn out.</span></div></div>",

The bad thing was that you didn't know when that would be. Ember made herself quite clear that she wasn't going to take you to a doctor until your physical injuries healed and you weren't in a good position to defy her. You wanted Ember so bad! You felt you might go crazy until a nasty plot formed in your head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you and Ember laid your heads down to rest you stayed awake until you heard snores. You called out her name to make sure she was completely asleep. <br>\r\n\"Ember! Hey Ember!\"<br>\r\nYou got no response so you put your plan into action. Looking at the digital clock you saw it was 11:00. You more or less had 12 hours to have your fun since Ember slept pretty late. Your injuries didn't pain you as much as before so you got up and climbed off the pillow and on to the bed. The blanket laid over Ember was like a cave. At the end of the cave was your destination: her feet. You began walking towards the end of the bed so to not strain yourself and to give your eyes time to adjust to the darkness. By the time you got there you could see fairly well in the dark. The moonlight coming from the window also helped make things clearer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you was the things you always wanted to get close to. Her Right Foot was raised straight up like a skyscraper of flesh while her Left Foot was lying on its side. This was the first time you saw your small size as a blessing. At this tiny size you could make out the smallest of details in Ember' feet. The fact that the talon on the middle toe of her left foot was slightly chipped or the scar on her right sole she got from kicking that geodude too hard. Or that the folds of skin on her left foot looked kinda like a woman's vagin... As soon as that thought entered your head you were in a trancelike state. You slowly walked towards the left foot and climbed on. You member had instantly gotten hard so you stuck it in between the folds of skin and began humping her foot. You pounded away on the foot and even though she was sleeping her body could still feel the pleasure as she was wiggling her toes in ecstasy. When you finally came you feel off her foot in exhaustion. The red numbers of the digital clock could still be seen even through the sheets. You were surprised to see it was 1:00 in the morning. You had been humping her foot for nearly 2 hours! You still had one more foot to go and your still hard member convinced you to keep going so you turned your attention to the right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe climb up her was hard but was worth it on you got to the top of her middle toe. Her talon extended over you like a curved roof. You were currently licking it until you could see you reflection in it. Ember's body definitely liked what it was feeling since her toes were gently swaying while you licked her talon. The space between her toes looked inviting so you stopped with your licking and began climbing down. When you got in between her toes you began humping the middle one like you did her left foot. Her toes started to wiggle rather violently so you grabbed ahold of her toe to keep from getting thrown off. This seemed to further excite Ember's body as she unconsciously squeezed her toes together. You weren't crushed or even severely harmed. The pains did start up again but they were ignored in favor of the pleasure you were feeling. You were stuck in between her toes with only you head and upper torso exposed to the open air so you were completely at her mercy. Her toes began rubbing together causing you to gasp in pleasure. After a few minutes of this you blew your load leaving you completely spent. Her toes continued to rub together for a few more minutes but after feeling no more participation from you released their grip leaving you to collapse in the puddle of cum between her toes. You climbed steadily off her foot and after wiping any cum off of you with the sheets you made your way back to the pillow. Ember was still sound asleep with a content look upon her face. She must have thought the feelings of pleasure she was getting due to your little 'session' to be apart of a dream. Good for you because you have no way to explain this to her if she was awake. Climbing back on the pillow you had already made up your mind to do this again the next night and maybe every night that your shrunken...</span></div></div>",

Surprisingly it was very arrousing for you. As she focuses on your lower half you got hard again. She noticed your member becoming hard so she gently cleaned it leaving you on the edge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah that's enough now it's my turn to be clean before we can use the bathtub <i>Master</i>~\"<br>\r\nShe purposely left you on the edge after becoming hard. But it was worth it as she brings you in the shower closing the glass door and started soaping you up again. You first thought it was just to clean you again but to your surprise she used you as a soap and sponge! She started to clean her armpits first with you facing face first towards her armpit. Gathering all the dirt and soap in your face. Surprisingly she also set up a barrier on your face so you won't swallow and soap or water. As she rubs you up and down on her armpits she moves on towards to her breast. Despite how massive they are to you they're surprisingly soft as well. Judging from the size Gardevoir's an E Cup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh ahhhhh\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir moans as she rubs her breast with you. Having her hands move in a circular pattern leaving no space spared. She then moved towards her arms then legs. It was quite sexy and it seems she is leaving her ass to be the final part to clean. You felt the plump skin rub across your face and chest as she drags you around. She lifted up her foot and started to clean it with you between the toes. Running against her sexy soles and toes you felt aroused but this is not the best part. She now lifts you up to her clitoris showing the crevice. But instead of shoving you inside she cleans her pussy and crotch. And now the  best part was to clean her plump ass. A few moments ago you were inside and you are going inside of it again this time as a dick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure to clean it very nice and well <i>Master</i>~  She started to rub you inside her anus back and forth the hole. You certainly are cleaning her ass....and getting all the stains again. As she inserts you face first it was really sexually stimulating having your dick rub against her inside. You already came a lot before you knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Gar-Gardevoir I'm cumming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've already came inside her more than thrice. You were really fatigue and limp due to it being like death by snu-snu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Master now it's time for us to take a relaxing time on the bathtub~\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As Gardevoir reaches her climax so do you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gardevoir!/Master! I-I'm cumming!\" Both of you yelled as reaching the climax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haaaaa.. Haaaaaa that was great! Master.

You were a trainer, though at this point in life you  had no specific goal, with only one pokemon as your partner you were not exactly in a hurry to try and catch them all, nor had you attempted the gym circuit in your own home town. Truth be told, you were just happy to be traveling. It was a great opportunity to see the world and broaden your horizons even if you didn't have any specific goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour partner, was an espeon that had been with you since you were a little kid. You had hatched him from an egg and grew up together, and during your travels one day he had just evolved on his own to an espeon. You understood that there were many ways in which an eevee could evolve, and the espeon evolution was one triggered by happiness and trust with their owner, something you felt a little flattered about to learn your little eevee had thought that much of you. You supposed it had a pretty good life, you couldn't recall the last time you had recalled him to his pokeball instead letting him walk beside you everywhere and be out as often as he wanted. Most people seemed to see him as your pet since you weren't in a huge hurry to participate in pokemon battles or train him, and you supposed that was true to a certain extent. It felt weird to call him a pet though when he probably took care of you more than him. Sure, you could buy things when in the city, but he was always the one looking out for you in your travels out in the wild, dragging you out of harm's way when you didn't even see the beedrill nest in the tree you were about to walk into, or just doing simple things like making sure actually woke up on time. It had even found a few mundane utilities for its psychic powers such as telekinetically moving around dishes and plates to cook breakfast in the morning for you. If anything sometimes you thought that he saw you as his pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a late afternoon in this mostly normal day and you and espeon were currently exploring a market that was located underground the city. There weren't any official stores or chains in the market, instead it was more of a gloried garage sale where anyone who wanted to peddle anything could set up a stand for the day and sale whatever they wanted. Most of the stands sold about what you'd expect, hand me down clothes, old toys, and things that sellers assured you were antiques and could only go up in value at this point. Most of it was not that interesting, but there were two stores that looked interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them was a stand run by an old man that had several TMs or Techincal Machines on sale. These could be used to teach pokemon new moves that they could use in combat, even if you weren't heavily focused on combat there was always the chance of wild pokemon encounters or the occasional trainer who just would not let you walk by them until you battled. It was always a good idea to have a few good moves to fall back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others were run by a woman in a coat with thick glasses and seemed to sell various types of machinery. Honestly, you had no idea what they were as they just looked like blocks of metal with wires running along them, but it did look interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe market was only open until about four in the afternoon though so at this point you only had time to check out one more stand.</span></div></div>",

You worked your way over to the stand followed by espeon to look at the various disc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah welcome welcome!\" The old man running the stall greeted you while rubbing his hands together. \"Top of the line TMs at bottom prices. Just various defects in them where we weren't able to release them to the market?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Defects?\" That didn't sound good. \"Exactly what do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, don't worry nothing major.\" The old man explained. \"Basic things, you know all the discs come in different colors to indicate what type of pokemon they're for, for example pink for psychic types like your friend over there, well sometimes they'd come out say purple indicating it was a poison type instead and then if we sold it on the market trainers would get confused. Then others sometimes the labeling on the disc is corrupted where it can't be read, or you can't see the instructions on what move you're teaching once you turn it on. Basic things, they still work, but for obvious reasons we can't sell in normal chain stores, so I come down here about once a week and just unload some of them at discounted rates, seems a shame just to throw them all away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat, actually made sense you had to admit, though you were a little reluctant to purchase a TM that you didn't even know what it was going to do. You looked around, preparing to leave but then noticed Espeon nudging one of the TM discs with a paw that he seemed to be really interested in. You picked it up to examine it, it was a gray disc, so probably a normal type move, at least if it was correct, the guy had said the colors were wrong on some of them. You looked at it to see if there was a label, or even a number. Nothing. Still, your espeon seemed to want it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much for this one?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh well let me see.\" The old man grabbed it and peered at it for a bit. \"Funny, don't recognize this one. Not sure what it is... Well, guess I'll just do it as a sort of grab bag special, maybe it's something great, maybe not, I'll give it to you for just 500.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a feeling you were being ripped off and it probably didn't do anything, but you looked down at your espeon who nudged you with a paw, they seemed to really want it, well it wasn't that much money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine, you have a deal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou purchased the mystery TM and left the market heading back above ground. It was quiet out not a lot of people were around. You started to think about what you were going to do for dinner, if it would be better to try to buy something or if you an espeon would be better off foraging for fruits and berries in the nearby forest. Your thoughts were interrupted though by espeon running in circles and jumping all around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, easy boy! Calm down!\" You bent down to look at him, and he nuzzled his head against you for a moment then looked at the TM you had purchased and were holding in your other hand. \"You that curious as to what it does? Alright, we'll give it a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou booted up the TM, you expected to see some text appear that explained the move and asked you if you wanted to teach it to espeon, instead you got<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n@U()@HA#^@#^)@!%)*^$#9<br>\r\n(IJ#AJG*#%@)(U^#@(OFJ#<br>\r\n)(_@#U%(J#(I(#%)_I#(_(@#(<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-&gt; *&amp;*)@(#^<br>\r\n    ^(@#%*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that was completely useless. It was garbled and you had no idea what move it would teach, still espeon stood at attention ready to try and learn it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, let's give it a shot.\" You selected the option you thought would use it and waited, the TM glowed for a bit then nothing happened. \"Well, do you feel any different?\" You asked espeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that espeon's eye began to glow and then suddenly a beam of energy fires from its eyes and strikes you and...</span></div></div>",

As if sending your fear and maybe it could due to the fact that it was psychic espeon slowly lowered its paw to the ground. The sidewalk now was just about an inch away from you, a distance most people wouldn't notice, but at this point it was almost your full body length and you were still reluctant to let go, but the strands of fur seemed to be growing larger in your hand and you lost your grip and landed in a rather undignified manner on your bottom on the sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, you weighed so little the fall hadn't hurt at all, but you noticed the sidewalk seemed a lot bumpier than you realized.

The entire thing was completely overwhelming and espeon didn't seen to be taking it much better. It was clearly worried about you and kept reaching out a paw to touch you then pulling it back scared that it might knock you over and hurt you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay.\" You hear yourself tell espeon automatically. \"I'm a little shaken up and not like you knew this would happen either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon seems to calm down a bit at this glad that you're not in any immediate Sanger and not angry with it. It sits down and stares at you for a bit then looks around at the sidewalk and.buildings. it's face suddenly shows concern for a bit and then it seems to get an idea. Espeon lays down as close to the ground as possible next to you to the point that it's muzzle is level with you. It takes you a moment to realize what it wants, and then you realize it's inviting you to climb up onto it. You have a sudden realization that at your new size someone could easily step on you without noticing and so decide to accept the offer. You grab a few handfuls of fur and pull yourself up onto espeon's muzzle. He seems to flinch slightly as you tug on the hairs but only till you're on his muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there you work your way up and climb to the very top of his head and sit down directly between his ears. You realize snuggling up in espeon's head fur is actually quite warm and comfortable. The warmth you especially appreciate due to being completely naked thanks to your clothes not shrinking with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Espee!\" Espeon gives a happy cry once your on top then stands up bring careful not to dislodge you. Now he could carry you around and keep you 100% safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill how safe were you here? Tiny and naked in a large city, maybe it'd be a good idea to tell espeon to get you out of here. There's a forest outside the city you two could find food in for the night and you wouldn't need to worry about running into other trainers or people. Of course if you stay in the city you could maybe look for the guy who sold glyph the TM and see if there's a way to reverse the shrinking. Then again just because you choose to stay in the city doesn't mean you have to seek out a way to reverse this. First it's probably best to decide where you want to go and then what you'll do there.</span></div></div>",

A random trainer tosses out their pokeball only to have it land on top of you before releasing the pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head clearing your mind of the vision. You weren't in a hurry to interact with other people right now, and wanted to go someplace that you and espeon could be alone and not have to worry about being stepped on, or knocked aside, or challenged to a duel against pocket monsters now hundreds of times your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Espeon.\" You patted your hands against the top of it's head. \"I think it's for the best if we get out of the city.\" With that you grabbed a few strands of fur with your hands to keep yourself balanced as espeon gave a slight nod indicating it understood and started walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing able to ride around on espeon's head wasn't entirely unpleasant. It certainly beat walking yourself. At first you held on tight to its fur afraid you'd get thrown off, but once you realized that you were sitting pretty steady on his head with no actual danger of being thrown off you let go and relaxed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked over the side and saw as the sidewalk looked miles away beneath you. Lookg around it was strange, even on top of espeon's head you were lower to the ground than when you used to be tall, yet it still felt like you were being carried high through the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a little worried that someone might see a lone espeon walking around town, or worse see the tiny naked trainer atop his head. Luckily fortune seemed to favor you as the sidewalk gave way to grass and the two of you escaped the city without incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere the grass was wild and uncut unlike the short grass in the city. Even there a single blade of grass had gone high over your head. Here in the forest most of the grass was up to your espeon's knees. To you they were like green skyscrapers reaching torwards the heavens, and you felt a sense of vertigo looking down at them. The trees throughout the forest were almost to large to comprehend, each one taller than a mountain with branches full of leaves larger than you. At one point, espeon moved under a tree with loose leaves and a single lead that had fallen from the tree landed on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision was completely blacked out by the green foreign object and you couldn't see where espeon was going. Slowly, you crawled out from under it a bit surprised by it's weight. It wasn't hard to lift off you but it was like moving a heavy blanket. This gave you a bit of an idea. With some effort you were able to tear a strip of the leaf off. Upon doing this you wrapped the strip around your waist. It managed to cover from your waste to just below your knees allowing you a little modesty. It wasn't a full attire but with this leaf loincloth you felt a little less exposed now that you weren't naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't long after this you realized espeon had stopped walking, that was because...</span></div></div>",

You can feel your heart throbbing in your bare chest as you try to calm down after that encounter. Espeon himself needed a moment to calm down. Sitting atop espeon's head you patted him on top as best as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we're safe now,\" you said. However you had a completely new predicament to deal with. Earlier when it had just been you that had been shrunken espeon was able to navigate the world normally. You could just sit on his head and leave everything to him. With espeon shrunken under half an inch tall, and you shrunken much smaller than that; things were a bit more difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach individual blade of grass that emerged from the ground towered like a skyscraper over espeon. From your point of view the grass might as well have stretched beyond the sky. Just getting above grass level was a dizzying impossible height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only good thing that came out of this was that the two of you might be beneath the notice of other pokemon now. Being considered to insignificant to even be bothered with by other living creatures sounded rough, but at least it meant you didn't have to worry about being attacked. At least you really hoped so. Still, what options did you have now? You doubted you could find your way back to town, and who knows how long it would take to get there. The forest might as well be an entire continent now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Espeeee,\" you hear espeon mutter. It sees he's quite nervous about being shrunken as well. You realize regardless of how bad things are you need to try to put on a strong face. It doesn't matter how tiny or insignificant you may be. You're still espeon's trainer! (Even if you're more of his pet now) You needed to let him know everything was going to be alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey hey we'll be fine,\" you try to convince espeon as well as yourself. \"This looks bad but we can make this work until we find a solution.

Cautiously, Espeon began slowly walking through the towering grass leaves towards nowhere in particular. That was all they could really do. Perhaps it would be better if you both found someplace to hide out. Maybe they would eventually grow back if they waited long enough?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Espeon continued walking along you watched the trees swaying way up above you, the distance making the branches seem like clouds. Then an idea popped into your head. If you were in a higher vantage point you might be able to find food or at least come up with a destination rather than wandering aimlessly.\" Rubbing your hand on Espeon's massive head you call out to him.\"Espeon? Can you use Psychic on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon stopped in his tracks, \"Esp?\" He asked with a hint of confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you use psychic on me and lift me above the grass I might be able to see something!\" You explain. \"And since I'm so much smaller than you I should be really easy to lift up, right?\" Espeon mutters in thought as he thinks about your proposal. He had always used his psychic powers to nudge you out of harms way but never actually lifted you off your feet before. You could see a faint glow emanate from the jewel on the Espeon's forehead and you mentally braced yourself. Slowly you begin to descend, your hands and feet lifting away from your Pokemon's pink fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like you were floating in water as you gradually rose, it was actually kind of relaxing. That was until the rate of your ascent started getting faster. As you rose higher you started getting vertigo as your body started to flip around, giving you a good view of the ground. At your size it was like you were 50 feet from the ground and you haven't even cleared the grass yet! It was only your Espeon's calm face that stopped you from panicking. Not a hint of worry was detected on his face as he effortlessly lifted you up higher and higher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long you breach through the top of the grass. Blocking the apparent 200 foot fall from your mind you were struck with awe as you observed your surroundings. It was like a massive forest within an even more massive forest. Slowly rotating in the air you continue to take in everything your seeing. You see a small burrow at the base of a giant tree, a pile of fallen sticks and leaves and... Your jaw drops as you slowly rotate to see a gigantic blue mountain suddenly dominate your view. Staring at the smooth surface sprinkled with light dimples and a green crown on top you eventually realize it's an Oran berry!  The monolithic berry was actually pretty close. In fact, this berry may have been claimed by the Spearow that attacked you earlier, explaining the aggression it showed towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalling down to your Espeon he slowly lifts you down until your safely sitting back down on his head. \"There's a huge Oran berry just over there!\" You say to your Espeon while pointing the way. \"Lets go!\" Almost immediately he turns and trots towards it, also keen on getting some grub. Unfortunately you underestimated how far away it was. Realistically it was just a few feet away from your position but at your size it the trek was taking forever. Slowing down to a walk even Espeon's belly was rumbling in protest. Thankfully you both could start to see the giant berry towering up above the grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course due to the size difference between you both and the huge berry you couldn't eat it as you normally would. With your Espeon placing a paw on its surface you could tell the skin would be tough to break through. You're nearly flung off your Pokemon's head as he suddenly swipes the berry with a set of claws creating a set of gashes in the fruit. After a few more swipes chunks of berry begin flinging off and a small morsel conveniently lands right in front of you. By small however, relative to you it was the biggest piece of fruit you've ever held. As you heft the fruit up you're surprised by the weight of the juicy flesh as you clutch it in two hands. Espeon too grabs a chunk from the eviscerated part of berry with his mouth and begins chowing down so you decide to do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long you both have full bellies despite taking less than a bug Pokemon's portion from the berry. You both were cleaning the sticky juices off yourselves when the berry seemed to shift and rise away from you. You both look up in awe and fear as something extremely massive picks it up and starts eating it. As the berry ascends you're able to see what took it. What do you see?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were going to really need to rely on its intuition for communicating at this point and found yourself very thankful it was a psychic type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was still the pressing matter of size difference though, and the fact at such a tiny speckish size you weren't exactly able to do much for yourself at this point. It was certainly concerning that....</span></div></div>",

Your espeon very slowly moved a paw near you very clearly scared of hurting you while you were so small but not wanting to lose sight of you, without thinking you grabbed a hold of a few fur strands on your espeon, though an individual hair was like a very thick tree branch at this point and getting to large for you to actually keep a hold on with your hands. You wrapped your arms and legs around a single hair that you assumed was on top of espeon's paw but at this point you were two small to see very far. You had managed to climb onto espeon's paw but now all you could see was an endless forest of pink hairs stretching up forever. Soon even with your arms and legs wrapped around a hair it was becoming difficult to hold on, the hair was wider around than an enormous red wood tree and you lost your rip, falling and landing somewhere on espeon's actual skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, there was no chance of espeon being able to find you. Even if it could somehow see you at such a small size it would never be able to find you amongst all these individual hairs. Now, they were less like trees and more like giant skyscrapers. The base of each hair was the length of an entire city block in comparison to you, and if you could hollow one out you could probably make a rather spacious apartment inside one of the hairs to live in, of course that's a bit of a silly fantasy as you have no way to accomplish that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around wondering what to do, wondering if maybe you should try climbing up further towards espeon's head. It would take a long time to get there, you'd have to somehow get up its leg, body, neck and to its head when each just walking between two individual hairs was like walking a full block, but it was some goal, maybe espeon would be able to hear you? Not likely, it was a psychic type though, could it sense you now, would it be easier to sense you once you had climbed up closer to its head? There was no telling but it was one possibility. You had to do something just to keep you mind off how small you were, invisible to the naked eye at this point you were microscopic, far small than an individual millimeter you were....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was no reasonable way to process your exact scale at this point. You weren't even sure you were on the top of your Espeon's paw. You simply assumed that was the case, but in all likelihood you had climbed up from one of the lower hairs, and had simply worked your way onto a small wrinkle or indentation near the side or even bottom of the paw, even near the paw pad, possibly. You watched as the shrinking continued, and you didn't think for a single moment that it would slow down as of yet. If anything, you anticipated your shrinking coming to a sudden stop. When that happened, you thought, it might be like being in a car when it suddenly comes to a stop, resulting in a bit of whiplash from the acceleration. In this case, the all-over reduction coming to a stop, the rushing feeling of everything rising mightily over you, the pure sensation of everything becoming bigger and more powerful than your puny, shrinking, naked body...that stopping might be strong enough to knock you off your feet entirely. Possibly stronger, and you shuddered at the prospect of the powerful shrinking stopping sensation knocking you off the paw entirely. That would be scary, as you'd have no way to communicate or even so much as draw the attention of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of, the hairs on this paw were starting to appear quite a bit frightening and huge. Comprehending just how thin they were was getting to be a bit hard, since you were getting to sizes so small that you couldn't even run around the circumference of one within a minute. The grisly, intense, visceral detail up close this small, of the skin, of the looming, skyscraper-dwarfing, track field - circumference - rivaling hairs, and past the looming canopy of them, the blurry sky of events so large they defied your comprehension. You sat down, legs crossed, against a hair, still intimidated, and wondering when, if ever, you would stop shrinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll things considered, it wasn't...too bad. Your pink eeveelution was a good boy, and he certainly didn't mean anything wrong. If it were any other pokemon, certainly, you'd be frightened, but being on the foot, possibly underneath, of him? It wasn't that bad. If anything, aside from the prospect of shrinking out of existence, the idea of Espeon playfully shrinking you, maybe to a less extreme size than this, definitely had some appeal. At the moment, however, sitting to cover yourself as best you could to insulate your warmth, assisted by the body heat of the pokemon on the fast track to becoming your god, this was still a bit much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a rushing sensation. It was harsh, and the sheer accelerating force pushed you flat against the paw with no hope of getting up. It was crushing, even though it was just gravity and air rushing past you, and the surface you were being smushed against was normal skin, possibly softer. Since you couldn't move, you had some decent time to think about what it might be. You quickly came up with an answer: Espeon was moving his paw. Whether he was walking someplace, or putting you closer to his head remained to be seen, though you hoped it was the latter, so that you might communicate in some way with your looming, ultra gigantic pokemon. You would definitely need to have that talk, as you were starting to hit sizes where you thought you might start seeing particles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, you were...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWhat a day\u2026\u201d You groan while stretching out comfortably upon your living room couch. After a long day of non-stop working, it felt heavenly to sit back and take a breather. As you release a long tired exhale, a sudden force slams down on your stomach causing you to jolt in surprise. \u201cHuh!?\u201d you stutter taken completely by surprised from the sudden feeling. As you gaze down at your abdomen, the sight of your Vulpix greets your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do know that it\u2019s not very nice to jump onto other people\u2019s stomachs, huh Flare?\u201d You scold the vulpine Pok\u00e9mon with a raised brow. \u201cHmph!\u201d Flare grunts in an almost pouty like tone. \u201cAnyone who manages to catch sight of my adorableness would think otherwise.\u201d She retorts in a matter of fact tone. \u201cRight.\u201d You mutter with a roll of your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlare and you did have quite a history together. In fact, she was the first Pok\u00e9mon you ever managed to raise since childhood. Over the years, both you and her became practically inseparable, that is with the exception of school and work which caused you to leave your home along with her for a short time. Despite being rather mischievous and self-centered at times, she\u2019s one of the most loyal Pok\u00e9mon companions you ever had the liberty of caring for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what brings you up here?\u201d you ask as Flare casually sits upon your stomach. \u201cAm I suppose to be your throne or something?\u201d you ask in a sarcastic manner. \u201cYeah right.\u201d Flare scoffs. \u201cYou\u2019re way too skinny to be a throne.\u201d She jokes with a smirk. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the occasion?\u201d you ask once more before noticing some strange small orb besides her front right paw. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d you ask as Flare\u2019s smile begins to grow ever so slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh nothing at all~\u201d She says while daintily turning her head to the side and closing her eyes. \u201cWell forget I ask.\u201d You reply while nonchalantly shrugging your shoulders. \u201cAlright alright!\u201d Flare quickly stammers as a great amount of giddiness emerges on her face. \u201cDo you know what this is?\u201d she asks curiously while setting her paw on the tiny sphere, casually rolling it about. \u201cLooks like some sort of circle.\u201d You say in a blatant manner. \u201cIt\u2019s not just any circle!\u201d she beams as her head stretches out slightly towards you. \u201cIt\u2019s a minimize berry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA\u2026minimize what?\u201d you stutter with a confused brow raise. \u201cA. Minimize. Berry.\u201d Flare says, making sure to make small pauses between each spoke word to get her point across. \u201cOookay.\u201d You reply, still confused by just how she managed to obtain such an item. \u201cAnd just how did you manage to get this\u2026minimize berry was it?\u201d You ask. \u201cOh! You know. I did this and that.\u201d Flare says nonchalantly while swaying her head side to side in a carefree manner. \u201cCare to elaborate?\u201d you ask, growing suspicious over just how she was able to possess this strange item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so I was spending time with one of my Clefairy friends.\u201d She begins. \u201cSince when did you have a Clefairy friend?\u201d You ask, having no recollection of her ever hanging out with a fairy type Pok\u00e9mon before. \u201cI have friends out there you know.\u201d She smirks with a slightly annoyed expression on her face. \u201cSo. Anyways, she and I were hanging out until we came across an Oran bush. Since we we\u2019re both hungry we started to have out fill in DELICIOUS berries.\u201d She smiles as if the memories of the delicacy brought great happiness. \u201cAnd then she showed me this cool trip she developed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA cool trick?\u201d you ask growing slightly confused by where the story was heading. \u201cYup! She somehow managed to use her minimize ability on this berry here!\u201d Flare beams enthusiastically. \u201cHold up!\u201d you exclaim while raising your right hand. \u201cWhat do you mean used minimize on that berry?\u201d you ask gazing down at the delicacy still by her paw. \u201cThat Berry doesn\u2019t even look shrunk at all.\u201d You retort unsure if Flare was pulling your leg or not. \u201cI wasn\u2019t finished!\u201d she retorts with a scowl and huff. \u201cAnyways, she says whoever eats this berry will shrink in size for a certain amount of time.\u201d She explains, only managing to increase your confusion level by a fraction. \u201cSo\u2026this Clefairy friend of yours used one of her abilities on a berry that will make anyone who eats it shrink in size?\u201d You recall, summarizing the whole story in just one sentence. \u201cYup!\u201d Flare nods her head with a beaming smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd\u2026just why do you happen to have that berry?\u201d You ask, confused and uncertain about her unknown intentions. Without even answering, Flare quickly begins to wiggle her six tails against the sides of your abdomen, causing a burst of laughter to escape your mouth. \u201cF-F-Flare!\u201d you shout between bouts of breaths. As you struggle to get Flare off, an object suddenly ends up being propelled straight into your mouth. Momentarily dazed, you quickly rise up before instinctively swallowing the strange thing. With a gasp and hack, you quickly gaze down at Flare only to notice the berry gone besides her. As your pupils raise to Flare\u2019s face, a huge smile was glued on her face as her six orange tails wag happily behind her. \u201cthis is gonna be fun.\u201d She beams excitedly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first thing you become aware of was the fact that your mischievous little vulpix was suddenly starting to get heavier in your lap. Considering the explanation you had been given just moments ago it's not exactly difficult to find out why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flare why!?\" You coughed as you shouted, still clearing your thrown from having swallowed the berry whole so quickly. You realized that your feet were no longer touching the floor but were now dangling off the side of the couch. Your shoes had slipped off and your socks were hanging off your feet like big white hand towels in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cause it'll be fun!\" Flare said with a smirk. \"Just go with it and you'll fun too. Besides, it's only temporary.\" Flare suddenly paused for a brief moment and looked away. \"Well, probably temporary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what do you mean probably!?\" You protested. Flare really was starting to get heavy. Your shirt and pants were also starting to get really baggy. Your socks decided it was time to officially give trying to stay on your dwindling feet and limply slid off and dropped onto the floor. After only a few moments you were no bigger than a child, with some very loose trousers staying on you by virtue of you sitting down and wearing a shirt that would probably go down to your knees if you stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I mean it was temporary when clefairy showed it off.\" Flare explained while she turned her head and preened her tails indignantly, as if she was insulted by your lack of trust in her. \"I mean, we've never tested it on a human before so don't really know how long it will last or if it'll wear off. It'll be fine though.\" Suddenly her voice dropped as she talked as if she was really hurt by how you were acting. \"Can't believe you'd be upset about it when I just wanted to show you something cool.\" You knew this pitiful act was one of complete lies! Flare was always mischievous and oftentimes if you didn't go along with it she knew how to do an epic pout until you went along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... she was just messing with you about the effect not being temporary. Right? Even she wasn't that mischievous? This would probably wear off in a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea why you were so determined to convince yourself. The temporary or permanent thing was important, but so was the fact that you were shrinking right now and had a vulpix sitting on your lap who was now just as big as you were! And she was really, REALLY heavy now. She was less sitting in your lap now and now just kind of pinning your body from the stomach down to the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't... breathe.\" You complained as she continued to get heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh all right.\" Flare stood and stepped to the side of you on the couch. You pulled your legs out from underneath where she had been immediately, very happy to have that weight off of you. The moment you did your pants slid off the side of the couch. You had less been wearing them by this point as you had just happened to have them on top of you and held up by Flare being on top of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now had more than enough room to stand up on the couch. As you did your shirt nearly slipped right off you. The neck hole was easily large enough for your shoulders to slip through. You tried to catch the edges of the fabric, but your hands couldn't really reach through the sleeves anymore. Instead you were forced to grab the shirt from the inside. Grabbing two giant folds of fabric you managed to hang on to the neckline of your shirt and hold it up to try and keep it on you. You continued to shrink smaller and smaller though and the shirt was like a giant canvas trailing along the couch. It got heavier, and you lost the handholds you had managing to grab at it desperately again. You were able to hold up just a small corner of the fabric and keep it up just over your unmentionables. Even this felt heavy though and you couldn't really do anything to cover your back. You weren't wearing the shirt anymore, you were now standing in the neck hole of it and trying very desperately to maintain some form of modesty. You seemed to stop shrinking at least, and then suddenly you found a massive paw come down and step on a piece of the shirt next to you. The reddish brown fur identified as belonging to Flare, but she was massive. You had to be an inch tall tops as you were now staring at the toes of your once small vulpix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly looked up at the now massive fox pokemon as you saw her looming over you and staring down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked! Awwwww, look how cute you are!\" She nosed you, almost knocking you over and nearly making you drop the corner of fabric that was maintaining your modesty. \"Ah come on just let go of that it's not really going to do you any good now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Flare I'm naked!\" You protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's not as if I've never seen you like that before getting out of the shower or anything.\" Flare said. \"Besides it's not like you can hope to actually carry your clothes around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" With a sigh you let go the shirt corner, it dropped down leaving you naked as the day you were born standing before your giant vulpix. \"Why couldn't my clothes shrink too!?\" You complained. \"And why shrink me in the first place!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I would imagine it's because your clothes didn't eat the berry.\" Flare said coyly. \"And if your clothes do start eating berries it might be a good sign you should stop wearing them. As for that! Cause it'll be fun! Come on!\" She nosed you again. This time you did get knocked down flat onto your bottom. You couldn't do a whole lot to physically resist her right now. \"Until you change back you can be my little pet! You're way cuter when you're smaller than me ya know! I'll take good care of you too!\" She sat up on her hind legs as she moved her fore paws around you and suddenly snagged you. She was thankfully gentle as she pressed you between her two paws and slowly picked up your tiny frame off the couch. You had a sense of vertigo as your legs swung freely in the air unable to find any ground before she suddenly tossed you into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAH WHYYYY!\" You gave a shout as you flew through the air above Flare's head. A moment later you landed on something very soft and warm. It was bright red and all around you. Standing up you realized you were on top of Flare's head. She had caught you in her hair and was now carrying you around. She quickly jumped down from the couch after catching you. You grabbed onto a few strands of her hair to make sure you didn't lose your balance and fall down. \"Okay... Assuming I go with this, because I don't think I have a choice at this point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't!\" Flare responded sounding way more self satisfied than you would have liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly what are we going to do?\"</span></div></div>",

Games and stuff.\u201d She replies vaguely. \u201cBesides. Don\u2019t you think it would be much safer playing inside then outside?\u201d she asks while moving her head slightly. \u201cI mean, if you were outside just think of all the dangers! All those huge pokemon and humans unaware of you.\u201d She states with a small gasp to follow. \u201cThis really isn\u2019t giving me much excitement being small Flare.\u201d You state giving her a glare. \u201cWhich is exactly why you should stay with me!\u201d she states giddily. \u201cNot like I have a choice\u2026\u201d you mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you hate to admit it, it seemed you were completely under Flare\u2019s supervision for now. Being so small, there was no telling the amount of dangers lying about, especially if you left alone. With a small defeated groan, you kneel down to retain a steady position as you feel Flare walk about in the living room. \u201cE-easy Flare!\u201d You stammer feeling your entire body quickly bounce up and down with each step she made. \u201cOh, come on Master.\u201d She scoffs. \u201cJust think of it like riding a ponyta!\u201d she giggles. \u201cExcept the Ponyta is a ginormous Vulpix\u2026\u201d you call out only managing to increase Flare\u2019s laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several moments on the bumpy ride, you soon notice Flare making her way towards her small bedding area. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d you ask growing confused over her chosen destination. \u201cAre you going to take a nap or something?\u201d Flare simply guffaws at your remark before coming to a stop besides her round bedding. \u201cAs if!\u201d she chuckles. \u201cDo you really think I\u2019m just going to sleep with you so small?\u201d she asks before slowly lowering her head downwards. As you hang on tight close to her three ringed bun, you notice her head tilting straight towards her bedding area. \u201cAlright, just slip on down. I\u2019m sure my bed will break your fall.\u201d She states. \u201cEasier said than done.\u201d You mumble. \u201cOh, just trust me!\u201d she states in a pouty voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a long sigh, you soon begin to release your grip upon the red fur as gravity begins to pull you downwards. Not exactly fond of heights, you clench your eyes close as you suddenly feel your entire body freefalling off Flare\u2019s head. While it might\u2019ve been seconds in normal time, to you it took quite a while to finally collide onto a soft, cotton like surface. With your nerves shaking in shear excitement and terror, you slowly open your eyes to see Flare\u2019s massive face gazing down at you. \u201cI give you a ten for the landing.\u201d She smirks. \u201c\u2026but a five for the flailing.\u201d She adds sarcastically. \u201cVery funny.\u201d You groan as you slowly try to calm your shaking nerves from the fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then Master.

You could hide in a shoe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not hiding in a stinking shoe.\" You stated flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe under a rug.\" Flare continued to ignore you. You were pretty certain she heard you and was just doing this on purpose. \"So I'll turn around and count to ten!\" She stops and considers for a moment. \"Actually it might take you a bit longer than that to get into a hiding place. You've got those really short legs after all.\" Flare teased as you looked down at your bare legs slightly embarrassed. You got the feeling that you were going to be the subject of a lot of short jokes before the night was over. \"Let's see what's a good number...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I never even agreed to play yet.\" You tried to object more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't want to play with me?\" Flare looked down at you with epic pout face number 14. Even as a giant the drooped ears, the wide eyes, the lower part of her muzzle just left open over so slightly and the sagging tails. You tried! You tried to resist the pout! But... You couldn't! You knew it was a lie! You knew she was playing you! She knew you knew she was playing you! And you both knew that you were going to give in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine.\" You sagged your shoulders. \"But... what are you going to do when you find me I don't want you trying to chase and tackle me. I don't want to get hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you'd think I'd hurt you.\" Flare whined turning up the fake but effective pout by 30%. \"I mean of course, I would be trying to find and catch you.\" The pouty tone gave way to teasing. \"And you wouldn't be hard to catch. Hmmm shame you don't have a tail I could pick you up by... Guess I'll just have to toss you on my head if I catch you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Don't like the sound of that.\" You stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it'll be fiiiiiiine.\" She said in a less than reassuring tone. \"I caught you last time didn't I! Anyway ohhhh, we should make a bet. Games are more interesting when there's something at stake... Alright! I got it! Whoever wins gets to decide what we do next!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not actually getting a say in this agreement am I?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Of course you get a say in it.\" Flare responded starting to lower her ears. \"I mean if you really want to disappoint me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No. No stop.\" You groan. \"It's fine just... don't make that fake pouting face again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" She smirked. \"Alright now I'll count to a hundred! That should give you plenty of time to find a place.\" With that Flare turned her back to you laid down on the floor and covered her eyes with her fore paws. \"One. Two. Three.\" She started counting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately you tried to get down from her bedding. It was trickier than you expected. It was soft, but the entire thing was unstable and trying to rush to the side of it you kept tripping over yourself whenever your foot would sink in lower than expected. By the time you got off of her bed and onto the floor she was already up to seventeen. You looked around the floor, and muttered to yourself that if you knew you were going to be shrunk today you would have vacuumed first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr avoided being shrunk. One of those two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around the room. Your home was massive now, and you weren't sure her counting to 100 was enough time for you to find a place in any other room, so you decided you had better stick in here. You thought about going under the couch, but dismissed it for two reasons. She could fit under their too, and you weren't entirely sure you wanted to see what was under your couch. You could try crawling underneath her bed, would she expect you started? Of course you were also worried what would happen if she got bored and came back for a nap. Was the bed padded enough to protect you? Maybe not the best idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty eight. Twenty nine. Thirty.\" She continued to count.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have a lot of time to think. You looked around the room trying to figure out the best possible place that might keep you hidden from her... There were two places that came to mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a bookcase in the room. While you couldn't really climb much of it, you could make it up to the bottom shelf, and there was enough gap between the books and the end of the shelf for you to squeeze yourself behind the actual books and be out of sight. There would be no way for her to find you at all short of ripping all the books off the shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were also the pants you had been wearing that were now discarded on the floor. Your belt, and by extension the pokeballs worn on your belt were still there. You could try to pry open one of the pokeballs and hide inside of it. Even if Flare checked inside your pants for you would she really think to look inside her own pokeball for you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't much time left, you made your decision.</span></div></div>",

With a small snicker, you hurriedly make your way down the plain length floors of your living room, straight towards the storing device. There was no way Flare would ever think of looking near that pokeball. One main reason was because it belonged to none other than the now huge vulpix herself, and knowing her, she absolutely despised that thing. When it came to Flare, she would always enjoy wandering about free from her pokeball without a single care in the world. The very idea of being stored inside the orb seemed like a punishment sentence that was the very equivalent of prison to her, though knowing her attitude was a complete over exaggeration. You can't help but recall several times when she would either put up some tantrum or completely wail and cry whenever you urged her to enter in her pokeball. In fact, she scolded you for days just for leaving her in for an hour or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeventy eight-seventy nine-\" She continues to count off as you turn to spot her form further down the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After a few seconds or so of sprinting, you finally manage to stand before the now ginormous sized ball as you look about its form some ideal means of concealment. At first you were pondering if you should actually clamber your way inside the ball in order to remain hidden from within the room. However, that idea was quickly thrown out as you feared you might end up getting trapt inside of the huge orb by sheer accident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEighty!-eighty one-eighty two-\" Flare exclaims, almost eager to initiate this game of hide and seek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your heart starting to race, you ultimately decide to huddle behind the giant pokeball right against the fabric of your pants. That way, you would remain hidden and also get a small vantage point of her looking about the room. \"I hope this works...' you mutter under your breath, unsure what other events Flare had planned with you and your new tiny size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinety seven-Ninety eight-Ninety Nine!~\" Flare exclaims the second to last number in a teasing if not cheery voice before finally shouting, \"ONE HUNDRED.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n At first, you were thinking that Flare would simply take her time and be easy with this game. Seeing as how you were tiny in size, especially when compared to her, she might give you a small chance with this game. However, once she was finished counting Flare quickly takes a leap into the air as her body turns a complete 360 to follow. A loud 'BOOM' echoes from the distance as a small quake emerges from her landing. \"Ready or not!\" she giggles loudly. \"Here comes Flare!\" \"I certainly hope not...\" you stammer as you scoot your body further behind the pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you cease your movements behind Flare's pokeball, you can't help but hear the echoing sounds of her loud footsteps crashing downwards. \"Where are you?~\" her voice asks in a sing song tone. Judging by the way the sounds were emanating down the corner, she seemed to be heading straight towards the right side of the living room. \"Come on now, Did you fall in a crack or something?\" she asks with a laugh, causing a small twinge of irritation to emerge in your mind. Eventually the booming footsteps sound off once more as you manage to hear her making her way to the left side of the room now. Slowly, you shuffle further towards the right of the pokeball in order to keep hidden from view. To your surprise and shock, you manage to spot the huge Vulpix's body not too far off in the distance, though luckily for you, she Flare didn't seem to take notice of you. \"Come on!\" she giggles. \"I already have so many other ideas we could try out!\" she exclaims as a shudder quickly runs down your spine from the thought of her winning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, you remain huddled against the huge storage device, hoping that your quick thinking was enough to claim victory over this game. Only time would tell if Flare would actually give up, or press on in search of you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then again, considering how small you were it's more likely your breathing was barely notcieable at all, but you wouldn't put it past your vulpix's ears to pick it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seconds trailed by each one seeming to be an eternity as you worried about if you'd find it. Then, the seconds started to go by even slower as you suddenly realize she's not finding you, and you start to get a little bored. Waiting around to be found is actually pretty boring, and after awhile you're not even worried about what happens when she finds you or what games she might want to play. You almost start to get sleepy and nod off waiting for her before finally she shouts oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARGH! Where are you!? Did you shrink even smaller or something you're not anywhere!\" Flare shouted in annoyance. You almost shouted back a reply before you realized that the game was in fact still going on.

You wanted to make sure that you were obscured from view at all times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered how long the game would actually go for, and it occurred to you that you probably should have forced Flare to commit to a time limit before the game started. She could basically keep going until she got bored. Well, one good thing about her was she did seem to get bored easily, at least she did anytime you tried to do any actual training. Maybe that was a good indication that the game wouldn't last long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were thinking, it suddenly occurred to you that it was very quiet in the room. You no longer heard the trampling of her paws as she ran around. You very cautiously poked your head out from around the pokeball looking for her, and you didn't see her anywhere in the room.

You looked around but never did find the person who left it there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked into your house, you were greeted by your Ninetails, who tackled you right as you came in. To be honest, she'd only been here a week, and you didn't mind it one bit. She was quite affectionate and always did this as you came in. \"Hey Ninetails,\" you said gently stroking her head as she nuzzled you happily. As you continued to pet your companion, you moved your hand down her back, stopping right above one of her legs and rubbing it back and forth. Ninetails began kicking one of her legs, like every dog does when you find that one sweet spot on their body, and let a satisfied, \"Nine\" as she lowered her head onto your right shoulder and began to make a strange purr-like noise as she continued to nuzzle you after lifting her head again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another minute or so, Ninetails stood up and let you stand up to do whatever. You just walked over to the couch in the living room and sat down, patting right next to you to get her up with you. She happily jumped up on the couch, instantly laying down on your legs and putting her head against your stomach. Even though she'd only been here a week, you two had an extremely close bond, you two were basically inseprable. As you continued to stroke her head, she lifted her head and looked you square in the face for the first time. As you looked into her eyes, you suddenly began to feel very sleepy, your eyes begin to flicker, and eventually they close and you fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're asleep, you feel something tingling in your gut, then nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat'sa happened when you awaken?</span></div></div>",

For the time being you just walk along the soft fuzzy dog bed you bought for him as a puppy Growlithe. You were amazed after he had evolved that the bed was just big enough for your buddy to still curl up in, but Arcanine seemed all the more happy for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of walking, hearing the big fire canine breathing slowly as he slept, seeing his furry bulk rise and fall with each slow breath, watching some of the fluff on his side rustle with him shifting slightly. you'd soon come within close proximity to his warm, fuzzy crotch, to which the air around your fluffy fire dog's genitalia was understandably thick with his musk. Shuddering slightly as you approached the warmth, there was a nagging thought in the back of your mind: What if he doesn't wake from this? What if he mistakes my attempts to stir him as something from a dream? What if I get crushed under his bulk, or worse, get stuck in or under his groin?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head, you pushed these thoughts aside, intent on continuing with your plan to rouse your loyal companion from his no-doubt enjoyable deep slumber. You take a deep breath, choked with musk which only made you shudder more at the sheer moment of your situation: here you were. face to face with your Arcanine's sheathe, which nestled that huge, warm dog cock that had so mercilessly pounded you with reckless abandon earlier in the day, and now you were going to rub and stroke that very same area with the intention of waking him, but in doing so, you also knew you might trigger a different reaction...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah balls to the walls..\" you muttered, shaking off your fears, and stepping up to Arcanine's sheathe pouch, gingerly reaching your hands out.. You could already feel the resonating heat increase as you drew them closer and closer, until finally they made contact.. the big dog remained unaware, contently snoring as you breathed a slight sigh of relief, one part done, now for the next step... Slowly, you press and stroke your hands and arms around the furry flesh of the pouch containing Arcanine's shaft. At first there wasn't any noticable change, but over time, you would hear the canine start to softly groan in pleasure at the stimulation your tiny hands and arms were bringing to him, slightly shifting, you held you breath for a few precious seconds, before sighing again in relief as you resumed rubbing for a time..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good five minutes of rubbing your arms were starting to tire out due to your miniscule proportions. You were starting to worry that your efforts were in vain... That is until the sheathe swelled and the pouch started to part open. You'd gasp quietly and take several steps back, accidently stumbling and falling onto your rear on the soft cushion, watching in awe and amazement as Arcanine's cock finally started to emerge from its protective flesh. Your face flushed entirely red as you watched the monolithic rod rise up like a rocket from a missile silo. the heat intensifying as blood pumped into the increasingly horny, throbbing organ rising up and out before you. the sheer SIZE of Arcanine's penis was appalling to you. scootching back further as you realized it was still erecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile your fiery canine was still groaning soft in lewd pleasure, in his mind, Arcanine was dreaming about meeting the most sensually attractive female of his own species, and she was gently lapping over his ball sack with tender care to stir his arousal out, and it was working, though little would he know it was you that was making him horny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after several moments, what felt to you like minutes that seemed like hours, your Arcanine's gigantic shaft would fully emerge with a heavy, to your eyes and ears, visible <b>THUMP!</b> as the fire dog's penis flopped onto the cushion, now fully erect at its impressively proud length of nine inches, and with nearly four inches of solid thickness, at your size, it was colossal.. as large as a skyscraper nearly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-holy shit...\" you manage to breathe out as you stood and faced the huge shaft.. you, a tiny human, had managed to arouse a giant, lustful, horny, erotically-dreaming Arcanine by mere rubbing.. It was amazing..! You knew you'd done this to wake Arcanine up to help you but this... You can't pass an opportunity like this up... Can you? This is a dream come true after all, you're so small, and he's so big and... Dominant... <i>Dominant..</i> that word now echoed loudly in your mind. your Arcanine could well be as dominant as he wanted now..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you returned to normal size he might be disappointed, but if you stay as is, he'd probably be overjoyed at being the 'master' while you're the 'pet'.. \"Dah this isn't the time..!\" you'd think, you had to choose..

The scent is thick and even more overpowering. You needed more so you stick your tongue inside. Arcanine starts to twitch in response forcing you too hold tight.

You could have jumped off but you just hang on a take dabs of it in your mouth. When the stream ends you start to lick it clean. In your servitude though you forget to notice it getting soft. The sheath was coming back over and you were still on the slit. You try escape but the way is now shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArcanine wakes from his exciting dream and grunts at his now wet bed.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was exhausting having to pet your Furret so much, so you were glad to at least have a short break. You were still trapped under her, no doubt, but it was pretty toasty down here. It's just weird, though. Why did she want you to pet her so thoroughly? She never had you do it as extensively as this when you were your normal height. Maybe she just enjoyed it when you could be as precise as you were just then. Still, you had to wonder what she had pla--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurret interrupts your train of thought, staring intensely at your puny form beneath the soft bulk of her body. Even through her dense fur, you could see a slight reddening of her cheeks. Her lips come down to your head again, giving you a long, eerily passionate kiss. She even slipped her tongue out, licking across your face, leaving traces of saliva on you. Embarrassing as it was, you kind of liked how it felt. It reminded you of when she'd jump on you while you were in bed and nuzzle her head against yours. Yeah, she's probably just having fun with you at your new size. Nothing to see here, away with you, mind-in-the-gutter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, your Pokemon does something unexpected. When she lifts her head again, instead of just plucking you out from under her, she lays flat against the soft covers of the bed; then, she shifts herself forward, leaving you behind, rubbing your miniature body right against her--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. OH. <i>That's</i> what she had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis isn't good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're mortified, though secretly a bit flattered by her forwardness. You can't have sex with your Furret! If you let this happen here, then you can't even begin to know what she'd act like when (read: if) you grow back to normal size. If she ever let her attraction to you show in public, you'd be shunned as a Pokephile!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour concerns are rational, but as Furret sinks further into the cushy blanket covering the bed, your mind starts to dull. Something's sapping your will to resist. Something...musky. Pleasantly so. You try to fight back against it, but instead of reaching to push your Pokemon's body away (a futile gesture), you start...massaging her clit, damp and warm as it is beneath her thick, fuzzy coat. The heady odor of the love juices leaking out of her, combined with the muffled squeak comings from her distant mouth are further pushing you into this lewd, instinctual haze. If this is what all Pokemon smell like when in heat, no wonder there's people who do this kind of thing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Furrrr...~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you continue to stimulate the giant, furry snatch in front of you, Furret clings tightly to the covers. You're slowly compressed beneath her. It's getting harder to breath...that is, until she instinctively humps against the fabric below. The impact knocks the wind out of you, and her soft, squishy flesh bearing down upon you prevents you from rubbing her. She groans needily, then lifts her lower body, letting you take in some (relatively) fresh air. It's still tinged with the scent of her arousal, though, so you're not free from this arousing trance just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe repeats her movements, thrusting against the sheets, then giving you some air, working it into a steady pattern that left you dazed and enticed by her lower lips. Every time, you reach up, only to be squished flat against the ground. The force of her humping leaves you stuck to her flower, the traces of damp arousal sticking you to their surface. You manage to drop back down eventually, until you stick your head out first. Almost automatically, Furret splays her legs further out, leaving her  labia stretched ever-so-slightly open, just wide enough so that your body sinks into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, you're not coming back out with some serious work. Work that your cunt-drunk mind cannot comprehend. It's so much easier to just closer to the source of that heavenly, mind-numbing smell...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wiggle yourself deeper into into Furret's vagina; it's much easier thanks to her powerful thrusting and the natural lubrication that slicked her walls. She moans and shudders in response to your efforts, causing them to squeeze around you lovingly. With how far gone you were, it wasn't surprising that your erection was practically bursting through your shorts. It was hard to even imagine anything other than the wet, enticing, and unbearably hot prison that you've been shoved into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nB-but, even if it was really nice in here...you have to get out! You don't know if your Pokemon knows how to handle you being in here; she could crush you into paste if she's not careful...how should you approach this?</span></div></div>",

You never evolved her, but Blair was always the oldest and strongest of your pokemon. In fact, you didn't even keep her in a pokeball most of the time. <br>\r\nBut most importantly, you were best friends, even if she <i>was</i> always critical of done of your more silly ideas, and there were no secrets between the two of you. You never told a soul what you shared with each other. Blair knew about your fascination with shrinking, and the little model city you had made in your basement, which was all in all about 100 square feet, sitting on the basement floor with 2 foot skyscrapers. And in return for keeping your secret, you kept her out of trouble. <br>\r\nThen, on your twentieth birthday, you saw one of those bargain bin advertisements, like a hypno- ring you see in the back of a comic book. It was selling \"a one of a kind working shrink ray\" and, sucker that you were, you bought it. <br>\r\nAnd when it arrived, you called Blair down to the model city to test it. On you, of course. <br>\r\n\"There's no way this is going to work, hun. \" Blair mocks, sitting beside you silently. <br>\r\n\"Well there's only one way to find out, right?\" You say, pointing the ray straight at your neck. \"Let's see, to make the buildings look the right size, I need to be...\" You run the numbers in your head. <br>\r\n\"Three millimeters tall!\" <br>\r\nYou pull the trigger, and aside from a light shining in your eyes, nothing happens. <br>\r\n\"I <b>told </b>you nothing would happen! If it were this easy to shrink people, it would have happened by now!\" Blair chides, taking a glance up to you only to not see you. She traces her gaze downward toward the model city's edge, locking eyes with you as you shrink past her eye level, out of your clothes, faster and faster until your little naked body achieves the three millimeter size you set. You've shrunken in the middle of a ring of your own clothes, the ray sitting on top of the pile. <br>\r\n\"You were saying? \" You call up to Blair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fire fox looks at your new size playfully, eyelids drooped and a thin smile on her face.<br>\r\n\"Good work, you've successfully turned yourself into the bug you've always dreamed of being.

Her paws could crush you with light pressure, they were almost the size of a house from your point of view. Blair's legs were massive, thick towers which led right as you followed them with your eyes to her face. She was looking at you playfully, eyes fixed on your tiny body as she breathed heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea, \" she purred,  leaning her enormous face in close to you, \"why don't we play Blair - zilla, little man? You can run through your little city like a bug, and I'll try to...<i>find</i> you.\"<br>\r\nYou liked the sound of that. You hug her paw with your tiny body. \"Sounds great! If I don't get caught, you'll give me a ride around on your back! \" <br>\r\n\"And if I catch you, we're going to be...<i>playing</i> some more games I have in mind.\" She smiles and hums, which if you didn't know better, you would say sounded more like a stifled moan. <br>\r\n\"Five second head start, little boy, \" She purrs, smiling down at your little body still hugging her paw. You were so naive and cute at this size. <br>\r\nYou stop hugging her paw, though, and start running into your model city. <br>\r\nBlair follows shortly after, and you swore she went early. She starts knocking over buildings with her paws, bumping your mini - skyscrapers over with her rear, stomping through the streets, causing little tremors for you on the floor. <br>\r\n\"Come on out, bug boy. We have a <b>lot</b> to do! I'll find your tiny winy little body in here, even if I have to knock this <b>whole</b> city over! \" She says, sultry dripping thickly from every syllable. Her hips sway, thighs crashing upon each miniature model building, each tiny tower crumbling from the force imparted to then from this little fox's ass. <br>\r\n<i>She was really getting into character</i>, you thought. Suddenly, the building in front of you falls in front of you, blocking you in and trapping you. Luckily, Blair didn't see, so you hide against your fallen handiwork. <br>\r\n\"I'll crush every inch of this model below me! \" She moans, paw pushing down ever harder upon a toppled structure, pressing harder and harder, forcing all of her weight into it until! <br>\r\n<i>CRUNCH</i>! The building gives out from underneath the fluffy weight, being completely annihilated underneath her paw. \"<b>Much</b> better, \"she says, dainty paws smashing tiny model citizens underneath her. <br>\r\n\"If you don't come out soon, my tiny bug, I'll have to<i>punish</i> you!\" She calls, tremors getting closer and closer. She stops a few feet from you, planting her butt forcefully onto a crowd of tiny model people. She yawns, smiling and looking over her handiwork as she grinds the number of tiny toy people into dust below her. She then gets up, revealing the completely broken remains of her victims, one still stuck to her rear that fell off once she reached less than a foot from your hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle at Blair's realism before your sound attracts her attention. The next few seconds are a blur as Blair's leering face dominates your view and your cover is stomped to nothing underneath her paws. She sits down with force, both onto a tiny person and in front of you, front paws slowly slipping around you, eliminating any chance of escape. <br>\r\n\"There you are, my pet,\" She starts, grinning like mad and staring holes into you. \"It took me breaking several blocks of your pathetic micro city to find you, but I did get to enjoy your little people. I like the way they crunch and crumble underneath my paws, or collapse into oblivion underneath my butt, but now I've got you. You're mine, tiny man.\" She mocks, edging her body closer to you until you have to look straight up just to see her. You were over the moon with joy at how much she appeared to be enjoying herself. You decide to get into character, too. <br>\r\n\"Oh, spare me, giantess! Whatever can I do for you to gain your mercy? \" You say, your terrible acting like music to Blair's furry ears. <br>\r\n\"Puny. Someone as puny as you has only one use for a <b>goddess</b> such as me!\" She sighs, butt wiggling and mangling the unfortunate micro model underneath her cheek beyond recognition. <br>\r\n\"And that is...\"</span></div></div>",

She had you completely at her mercy. She could crush you beneath her fluffy paws, or flatten you like the tiny toy human she had pinned underneath her ass which she was grinding to a plastic pulp. <br>\r\nHowever, whether it was your hubris, your love for Blair, your intense macrophilia, or the fact that you were about as sharp as a bowling ball, you still trusted her completely. So it should come as no surprise what the exchange was when Blair asked you to go inside her pussy and worship her. <br>\r\n\"Puny, the only purpose you serve is to worship <b>me</b>. You're utterly pathetic, don't even deserve to see the light of day. You should just be kept inside my pussy, worshipping me day in and day out, to prove yourself worthy of me even acknowledging your <b>insignificant</b> existence.\" She boomed, cornering you against the organ with her city - demolishing paws. <br>\r\n\"Oh Blair, you don't need to tell me twice! I'll make sure to be worthy for you!\" You squeak, using both arms to part the entrance to Blair's great cavern. She doesn't let you do it all on your own, however, as moments later she slams her paw against her open slit.<br>\r\nYou are completely submerged in the hot sweaty vagina of your pokemon goddess, beginning to worship her as she commanded. You rub your head and hands against the heat and flesh, perspiring heavily in the dominating heat of your enormous fire giant. <br>\r\n\"Ugh, you call that worshipping, you microbe? I wish I could shrink you smaller, keeping a disgusting bug - boy at such a large size while you continue to merely <b>touch</b> my <b>godlike</b> vagina is a <b>crime</b>. If you keep this up, I'll have to make you join your city!\" She taunts, continuing her rampage. She starts stomping through the model city again, cracking the roads with her paws, kicking tiny model cars away, throwing her butt against any building in her way, and standing her paws into the remains until they crumbled below her weight. She made a point of sitting on any model person she came across. Well,  \"sitting\" wasn't too accurate. She really almost jumped up on top of them, landing on her rump and delivering a model - pulverizing force into the unfortunate tinies underneath, which were annihilated into dust from the monumental force put upon them by her furry ass. <br>\r\nOblivious to her activities above, you continue to massage and worship Blair from inside her titanic sex. <br>\r\n\"You think that will service as a massage? I barely feel <b>anything</b>, let alone arousal, from such a poor performance. I think I'll take that shrink ray and put you in your place, six times smaller at half a millimeter! Maybe <b>then</b>, you worthless bug of a man, maybe you'll understand why you shouldn't disappoint me.\"<br>\r\nYou happily take the hint and begin working overtime, happy to please Blair. You're really glad she's having so much fun that she's <i>this</i> committed to role-playing! You were simply overjoyed, and more than willing to demonstrate your committal, too.<br>\r\nThe model city, meanwhile, was experiencing the latest torture of their massive overlord. The round reddish fur tail that they (if they could fear, they would) fear was being experimented with as a means of swatting buildings from vertical to horizontal, where their fate was locked. The terrifying maw was also seeing some newfound use, as tiny citizenry were sucked into the huge jaw, wherein the teeth and tongue became active in sealing their fates. Little model people and cars, swept and licked up from the ground, were quickly made familiar with the sticky saliva, which drenched them and glazed them, paralyzing the model people in place on the white tombstones, and filling every crevice of the cars with the warm, thick fluid. The teeth came upon them, flattening the cars into mangled, tiny flakes of debris in between the frightening molars, and splitting the model humans into gruesome halves of plastic by the canines and front teeth. Chewing the mixture turned the inside of Blair's mouth into a sticky mess of plastic. The taste was all artificial. Physically, it was merely plastic, cold and tasteless, harmless but certainly not appetizing. Inside the mind of the fire fennec fox, however, it was more. The taste came with an intense and indescribable feeling of power over what was an admittedly fake civilization. The sheer sensation of gulping the entire abused amalgam down her throat melted her. <br>\r\nBlair didn't want to admit it, but she was in heaven. She struggled to keep her bitter facade in the face of all of this <b>stimuli</b>. The feeling of the brief fall which came packaged with the give of the fallen towers surrendering to the Fennekin's weight. The sound of the skyscrapers cracking apart under her paws. The feeling of that ball of destroyed model people and vehicles sliding down her throat, or the feeling of it within her stomach. The power trip that was so inextricably linked with the feeling of knocking a building over with her tail. The satisfying comfort, and snug , albeit short -lived, resisting, pressing force she felt every time she sat on a model person. The sight of the quarter of the micro city she had been playing in, all cracked ground, toppled towers, butt imprints, flattened or pulverized people turned to dust beneath her steps or beneath the merciless cheeks, and unidentifiable fragments of all of the above. <br>\r\nAnd you, who just kept going and going, licking, and kicking, and rubbing every limb against her pink, fleshy walls. Despite what she had said about how you were doing a terrible job, it was all Blair could manage not to cum right now, orgasming you out so hard you leave an indent in the ground. She could barely contain herself, and every second you just worked harder and harder. Blair was trying her best to play it cool, to act like she was a goddess in control of every last tiny thing in this 100 square foot model city, including you, but the longer she spent here, feeling your work ethic and attention to detail be annihilated for her pleasure , while you massaged at her most private tissues, the harder Blair found it to pretend. She was teasing and treating you like an insignificant bug,  but the longer she spent <i>here</i>, the more unavoidable it was: Blair really respected you. <br>\r\nBlair wasn't about to admit it, though. <br>\r\n\"Massage harder, you pathetic morsel. I'm just now beginning to feel those specks you call limbs.I want to get an orgasm in five minutes from now or less, or I really will shrink you to a sixth of your size and I'll be a half- mile tall to you. You'll be so <i>very</i> small...mmmm!  Thinking about shrinking you even further is getting me more wet than your poor puny form could ever hope to.\" She continues to tease you, clenching and contracting the muscles in her wet crotch. You are enveloped by the sheer amount of flesh, the secretions of her titanic pussy get in your mouth, and you are nearly crushed to a pulp by each strong flex and contraction, making your frailty clear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat eventually sets her off is a nibble on the inside. You are cummed out onto the ground, where you are quickly secured in place by her ass, which falls gingerly upon you, pinning your three millimeter body underneath her soft anus. You hear the muffled giggles and taunts of your goddess from underneath your embarrassing captor. <br>\r\n\"Hahaha. What's the matter, puny? Can't even handle my butthole? <b>How embarrassing! </b>Don't worry, my little bug boy. I'll make sure you're so small you won't have to worry about showing your face ever again...\"<br>\r\nShe gets up, and your eyes have to adjust. When you finally focus in on Blair, you see her pointing the shrink ray right at you. She wasn't kidding about shrinking you further! You begin to say something, but are interrupted by Blair pulling the trigger. You gaze up in half - terrified awe as your Fennekin goddess expands before your very eyes. She becomes a planet unto herself, each feature from her dainty paws to her soft rear blossoming larger and larger into an imposing threat. You lock eyes with her clit as it grows from an imposing sphere of its own right into a terrifying moon of sexual flesh. The grin on Blair's face flourishes into a beam of pure aroused delight. You were now hers, an infinitesimal speck of a man, not even as tall as a strand of fur. She stares down at your minuscule form. She only has one thing to say. </span></div></div>",

It's adorable! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou briefly express your shock and fear about Blair 's earlier dominating behavior. She brushes you off and pins you underneath her clit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry for scaring you, my infinitesimal pussy toy. I just wanted to have a little bit of fun all over your city! If you were in my place, you'd probably have gone through just as much of it, eeheehee. 'Cuz I broke it while you were busy nibbling on the inside of my meat drip...\" Blair leaned a little forward, imitating a kiss with her clit press. She slowly stood back up, all fours contented, your body adhered to Fennekin by a touch of liquid produced from the rub.  Carried up along the fire fox 's sensitivities, you squirm, trying to free yourself from the hot nub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlair continued to justify and explain her little roleplay while walking through an untouched section of city. From what you could tell, not much was different between the cruel persona Blair put on and her actual opinions and plans for your half millimeter body or your model city. She seemed to like to destroy the city because it aroused her and that was all it was good for, but Blair was now telling you she pushed over buildings with her hip swings and stomped model people and cars just because she thought you had built them so carefully it would be disrespectful not to show her appreciation. The way she explained it, you could tell what she actually meant was \"she wanted to fuck the city, so she fucked the city\". As for your current height and position stuck steadfastly to a pink button, Blair was currently reciting a playfully worded story about how this has been her dream for a while, and how much she deeply cares about you ; and it's a story you identify as completely false and generic. You already know the reason she let you shrink yourself, it's because something alive in the city gets her wet, and you would know, since gauging her moisture in reaction to certain parts of her invented story is all you can do besides attempt weakly to pull free of your sticky, round prison. As for why she shrunk you again,  well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm almost your <b>whole</b> world! You're my puny little speck, glued to my clit, aren't you! You're <b>mine</b>, the cutest little bug ever! We can just play, no worrying about training or all that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. She's doing it because she wants to goof off, and keeping you a sickeningly miniscule speck means you can't really stop her. This is not even remotely better than her dominating side. This is laaaame. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was the middle of a rather lengthy break you took, from the stress of being a trainer and living a city life. You and your long-time partner Oshawott were out in the remote forest, taking a good amount of time off to relax, as you two were essentially alone out here. Recently, though, your Oshawott was starting to get bored of this trip, wanting to play with you more than he was concerned with actually relaxing alongside you. You figured this would happen at some point. Your Oshawott was somewhat jovial and childish, and tended to be really antsy as a result. What you didn\u2019t expect, though, was for him to do something more sinister to play with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the middle of the day, and you were taking a nap, having dozed off as you simply lied there and relaxed. Unfortunately for you, that was exactly the opening Oshawott needed to do what he wanted, and do that he did! He gave a slight wait, and charged a strange attack, which he then shot straight at you! You felt the attack as it struck you and were jolted to your feet, but by then, its effects were ready to begin\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the\u2026?\u201d You looked down to your Oshawott, who seemed to now be holding a mischievous smile. You never really enjoyed it when he acted like that, because that normally meant he wanted to really play rough. However, you would soon come to fear it wholly, as you finally began to notice the impossible; the Oshawott, and, in fact, the entire forest around you, was rising up slowly to meet you and separating further away. Were you\u2026shrinking? No, you reassured, it must be a trick of the eyes, you couldn\u2019t shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, you wondered how much longer you would be able to deny it until you had to face that surprising and unrealistic fact. It was even beginning to accelerate, as your Oshawott now wet your whole body with a light water gun. You had now shrunk down to below 4 feet, quickly approaching your Oshawott\u2019s height, as a voice you had never heard before now spoke\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, didn\u2019t think that\u2019d actually work.\u201d Your Oshawott closes the still-growing distance between you two with surprising quickness. After all, you were soon approaching 2\u20196\u201d, only 1.5 times his size. \u201cFinally, I can have some fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were speechless as you looked at your very own Pokemon. Not only was he growing before your very eyes, but now he was speaking to you, as well?! Your shrinking momentarily stopped at 2\u20191\u201d, only a head above your Oshawott\u2019s size at this point. You had also mysteriously dried off completely when you stopped shrinking. Finally gaining the nerve to speak, you attempted to ask, \"Wh-what did you do to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just made you easier to work with, of course! I've wanted to play the whole time we've been here, but you didn't want to. So, I wanted to go and try something to make you play with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure whether to be worried or not by your own Pokemon as he still had that mischievous smirk plastered over his face. You were completely uncertain of his intentions, and that worried you plenty. \"So, what exactly was this...Something?\" you ask, unsure if you really wanted the answer to that question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I answered it for you when you got all wet. Isn't it obvious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, boy, this was definitely going to be a long few days, at the least. While you wanted to ask whether this whole ordeal was permanent or not, you realized that it didn't matter either way at the moment. What mattered was that, right now, you had shrunk down to smaller than half your size, and were nearly eye level with your very own Oshawott. But then...</span></div></div>",

Knocked aback at this new smaller size (although you knew that even this would look gigantic to you by the end of this), you were taken off your feet as the stream of water pushed you onto your back with its force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up quickly from the blast, just in time to see the world expanding even further around you, the rate starting off even faster than the first shrinking spell. While you were just around eye level with your precious Oshawott just before that second soak down, you could kiss all that size goodbye as you diminish more and more in front of him, his already-large frame becoming all the more massive to you. You continued to dwindle in size, your eye level sinking down in rather quick fashion. It didn't take long for you to be eye level with your Oshawott's belly, now at below half his size and shrinking even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for you to become even smaller, shrinking down even further as your eye level went down to his hips, to his ankles, and then to his flipper-shaped paws. The shrinking then stopped as you now stood at not even half the size of one of his toes. Many words can describe your new stature: minuscule, insignificant, speck. But one thing was for certain...at less than an inch tall, your 'little' buddy Oshawott had complete control over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour now very large Oshawott was still difficult to get a read on. You were unsure of his motivation for doing this to you, but you were about to get your answer...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She seems to be thinking of something, but you can't imagine what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou haven't been watching her for long before she leaves the room and enters the kitchen, returning a few seconds later chewing on something. You notice her holding a half-eaten small blue berry in her paws, which she quickly stuffs into her mouth and finishes off once she enters the living room again. She walks over to the couch you are on and hops up beside you before getting on your lap. She puts her paws on your chest and stares into your eyes as she finishes chewing and swallowing the berry. You look back at her awkwardly, unsure of what she's doing. She's never done this kind of thing before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up, Oshawott?\" you ask her nervously. The Oshawott does not reply. Instead, she simply puffs out her cheeks and then spits a blast of water at your face. You splutter and flail your arms, but your Oshawott hangs on to your shirt. You shake your head quickly and glare at her, asking why she did that, but you start to feel strange within moments. Your head starts spinning, and the weight of your Oshawott on your lap seems to increase greatly. Your Oshawott's eyes widen and she barks happily, smiling at you as you start to feel ever more lightheaded. And you can swear that she seems to be getting bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes, not having realized that you just blacked out. You look around, and realize that you are still on your couch. However, two things are wrong. First, you appear to have somehow shrunk. That stunning realization takes time to set in, and you are quickly distracted by the second thing you noticed: your Oshawott is currently looming over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at her, and realize that she is many times your size. You can't tell just how big, though, but you can estimate that you're currently around the size of one of her toys. You stare at her, and big dark eyes stare back at you as she grins widely. She barks happily, hurting your ears, before quickly reaching down with a paw. You don't even move, and the giant Pokemon grabs you roughly, raising you up to her freckled face and continuing to grin widely. You stare at her in shock, still not fully comprehending what is going on. But what you can comprehend is the meaning behind her grin. You've been with this Oshawott long enough to know that this sort of grin means that she is feeling...</span></div></div>",

You had tried to take on the gym leader in your town but instead were met with defeat and the loss of your allowance for the week. On your pokemon hunt for the day, there wasn't anything new to discover; just the same old machops and numels. Long story short, things didn't go as planned, and this nice walk was making up for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout to head back, you couldn't help but notice a small yellow-ish figure flying out of a nearby cave. Curious, you walked over to where it looked like it was headed. You were beyond surprised to find out that thing is the legendary pokemon, Jirachi! Noticing you, Jirachi quickly got up and flew away, faster this time. You weren't going to let this moment escape from you, nothing has been going your way today and you're determined to change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter chasing after and encountering Jirachi a couple more times, they finally get fed up with it, yelling back, <br>\r\n\"GIVE IT A BREAK ALREADY!

The breeze was pleasant and having Ampere sound asleep on your shoulder was comforting. Being as relaxed and sleepy you are, you fall asleep with your fluffy friend, thinking on how this day could not go wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~3 Hours pass~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up to the sound of Ampere's cry. You look up drowsily to see that, through the leaves of the tree, the sky is a bright orange, with a bit of stars showing. <i>Ampere is probably concerned on how late it is</i> you think as you get up to stretch. Looking around, however, you notice that the grass was up to your knees, and was that tree that big before? It didn't take long for you to notice that you had shrunk, and quite a bit. Looking around some more, you see Ampere, looking for you frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run down towards Ampere's direction, jumping and calling her name. As you get closer, you truly see how small you actually are, almost as tall as Ampere's foot. You soon get close to Ampere and call her name again, this time, she reacts, looking for you in every direction except down. You call for her again, and she begins to walk at your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut does she see you?</span></div></div>",

After a few moments more of her hugging you. Ampere pulls you away from her chest to her head, giving you a good look of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile, \"We should probably head home, since it's getting late and all.\" The sun had already set and the moon had already been out for some time.

You cling on to it, feeling the softness of it, as she starts to run back toward your house. Luckily, since of how thick Ampere's fluff is, you do not get thrown off by the wind.

You try to call out to your buddy for help, but all you manage out is a multitude of sharp gasps. You feel beads of sweat fall down your face, as it becomes harder and harder to breath, until the pain suddenly stops. The pain then transformed to a warm, blissful feeling covering your whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then hear running coming from the other room, as Zorua came running in, looking worried. \"<span class=\"cplum\">I heard some commotion happen? Is everything alright?</span>\" You try to stand back up, but your body wouldn't move, but you did notice something weird. Zorua was a lot bigger than you remember,and as Zorua approaches you, a very shocked expression then fills Zorua's face. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Oh my...... How'd this happen?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally begin to take control of your body, as you stand up, but you notice that everything is off. You have shrunken, but not only that, but you are still shrinking. \"W-what's happening to me?\" You shakily say, moving closer to Zorua for help. Comparing your size to Zorua's, (0.7m) you are at least 0.5m, to Zorua's chest, and still shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">I have no idea. I mean, look at the bright side, at least your clothing shrunk with</span>\" That is true, you're clothes did shrink with you, which is a plus. \"<span class=\"cplum\">We should probably get you to your room, y'know, before you shrink small enough to become microscopic.</span>\" Zorua suggested, \"<span class=\"cplum\">Here, let me help you.</span>\" Zorua picks you up by your shirt by his mouth, since you now shrunken to 0.05 meters in that short time span alone, but you luckily stopped growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both make it to your bedroom, and, looking around, it feels like a whole different area. A place you've gone in and out of has a unfamiliarity to it with your new size. You then feel a lurch, as Zorua jumps onto the bed above. He drops you off on the bed, and lays down. You also sit down next to the now gigantic Zorua. Comparing you to Zorua now, you're just as big as his paws are wide, maybe even smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Sooo..... I was thinking maybe we could still play hide and seek, but with your.... new height.</span> Zorua says slowly, not really facing towards you. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Orrr.....</span>\" He moves his head to face you, as you feel a bit of his hot breath in waves. \"<span class=\"cplum\">Or maybe we could try out some other things with your shrunken state?</span>\" He says in a more fast tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think on it for a second, before responding with...</span></div></div>",

You kick you feet a little but don\u2019t have much time to do much else. Your pushed a little ways out then pulled back in. You giggle at your Charizard pleasuring himself using you. It felt amazing to you though, the rhymatic movement and honestly it was starting to turn you on. One of the outward pushes, pushed from your boobs down out then pulled you back in up to your feet. He did this once more pushed out to your boobs then pulled in. This time though, you pulled you all the way into his cavern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReflet was breathing heavily from the pleasure. He felt you crawl deeper inside of him and moaned from the feeling. He like having his human inside of him, he had never felt something this pleasurable. To have a smaller living thing moving around within him, he absolutely loved it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explored a little deeper, glancing back toward where you had entered from.

Then he feels you moving in his sack and gives a gentle squeeze letting you know he feels you. He cleans himself up then makes his way to the kitchen of your apartment. He fixes some food and sits down to eat. As he devours the food he wonders how he's going to get you out or if you can just live deep inside him. He moaned everytime you moved around the empty sack. Glancing down at his balls then at the food, Reflet realizes you hadn't eaten anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to sit back in your charizard's testicle. There was no point in trying to get out if the hole was too small. You sigh and try to relax but the sudden growl from your stomach reminds you that you had not eaten today. You wonder what to do and try to figure something out. Just then you see the hole open slightly as small scraps of food drop inside. \"Thanks buddy!\" You call as you pick up the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it was covered in slime and other bodily fluids from your partner, at least he was trying to take of you. You sit back and decide to relax while eating the food. Above you hear your Charizard's body going about the passive functions that keep your partner alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReflet sits back, staring at his balls. It was so surreal to him to have his partner inside his body, much less in his balls. He purrs in delight as he feels you getting comfortable. He nods to himself as he decides for the time being that was probably the safest place for you, inside of him. He could easily protect you. He then though about whether he should even try to get you out of whether his testicles would become your permanent home.</span></div></div>",

I only have Grovyle but he's very lovable even if he doesn't let me have cookies.  I love sweet food like cookies.  I get mad at Grovyle for making me eat vegetables.  I hate vegetables!  Except carrots and corn.  I wear a purple sweatshirt and a hat,  I don't know what it's called but It's like a winter hat that you don't have to wear when it gets cold.  I wear boots because I love to wear boots.  That's enough of me here's Grovyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrovyle:  He's determined on what task he goes on.  He's bigger than a human but only above their head like an adult.  He always keep me safe.  He trains to become powerful, but I think he already is.  I came up with a nickname for him called Treave.  He hates it.  He can act nice which I love it when he does it.  He follows my mom's rules, which I don't like.  He protects me from scaring things.  He gives me a piggy back ride but sometimes.  He also gives me hugs.  I wish he could give me more.  I love even if he can be grouchy but is nice.</font></span></div></div>",

You giggle at him speaking with his face shoved full of pizza.  He gulps it all down and says,  \"I'll go get a towel and a heater to dry off the water.\"  <br>\r\nHe comes back with a heater and a towel hung around his shoulders.  He dries off and puts the heater where he left the water marks. He looks at you and says.  \"Are you ok?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I wish I could swim so we could both be together.  I mean I wish I could ride on your back without giving you a broken back when I was 6.\"  You said as you blush.<br>\r\n\"Yeah you were heavy.\"  He said.  Then his eyes glitter.  \"I remembered something,  I wanted to show you a new move or trick.\"<br>\r\n\"And what's that?\"<br>\r\n\"Here I'll show you but you'll have to promise me whatever I do you won't get mad at me.\" He said giving you a soft voice.<br>\r\n\"Ok but it better not involve breaking something, or mom and dad will be angry.\"<br>\r\n\"It won't ok.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok.\"<br>\r\n\"Great!  Wait here.\"  He said as you sit on the couch waiting.<br>\r\nHe comes back with a water colored berry.  \"This is my new trick that I need.\"  He then grabs you and stands you up and backs away.

Once you get to it he tenses it up and hits you square in the face with a rope of pre. Your mouth and ose are overloaded with the scent and taste of his feral musk and all you want is more. You make it to the tip and plant a kiss against the hole as another blob of slimy pre coats your body. With your arms wrapped around his cock just under the bulging tip you shove your head into his cock only to be blasted back out by yet another wave of pre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would love to let you inside, but I can't stop squirting you back out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I make you cum, then crawl in before you recover?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's worth a try.\" He says looking mockingly disappointed at the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggle then start to work by laying under his stiff weasel cock and wrapping your arms and legs around it. Then you begin to stroke and grind against his shaft while licking and kissing the tip. All the while he is creating a pool of pre on hi belly around your body that even begins to spill over to the pool water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel moans and groans while you work. His cock starts to bounce even with you hanging off of it and he even starts to hump slightly. In short time you have the horny water pokemon whimpering and shooting thick white ropes of his feral seed across his own face, chest, and belly. Not to mention all over your face. The blast is enough to make you let go of his cock and fall to the pool of slippery pokefluid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel finished with a few more gushes followed by a bit of cum lazily dripping from his softening rod. You take your chance and manage to stand on the slippery fur and push your head inside his cock then your arms then, you slowly wriggle into the tight tunnel. Luckily, the little bit of cum that is left is helping you slide deeper until your legs are the only thing sticking out. Buizel lifts his paw and pushes against your feet to help you the rest of the way. With one good kick you plunge half way into long thin cock, leaving a nice bulge that buizel can't help but wrap a paw around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside his urethrea you feel his paw slowly working you deeper toward your goal. Outside you can her buizel moan. \"Almost there.\" And with a final squeeze you are deposited into his soft furry sack in a sea of hot feral sperm.You can feel him play with his sack for a while and you begin to wonder what to do next.</span></div></div>",

You tickled his belly and he laughed at this.  \"Stop it your gonna make me shoot electricity from my body.\"  He says as his electricity shoots towards his toys.  Thankfully it's made of rubber so it didn't burned the toy to a crisp.  <br>\r\nYou were having fun with him but hen you remember something.  \"Hey Pikachu do you feel like you hate smaller than everbody else?\" You said.<br>\r\nHe thinks about this and says,  \"Yeah I do hate it.  Besides Pikachu's are smaller than everbody else unless hey evolve into Raichu, but even then they're small.\"  He says. <br>\r\n\"I wish Pikachus were a lot bigger.  You know like if I can ride on their backs look down at bigger Pokemon and give giant hugs.\"  You said.  <br>\r\n\"I wish for that too.\"  He said. <br>\r\nYou then feel tired and decide to go to sleep.  \"Pikachu I'm going to sleep want to come.\"  You said.  <br>\r\n\"No thank you I'll stay up.\"  He said.  He never told you what he did with his toys.  He used the toys like he was Godzilla and crush the toys and bite them like they were buildings this never got old, but he wish it was real.  He looks up to the window and sees a shining star and says, \"I wish me and my friends dream can come true.\"  <br>\r\nYou were getting into your cute Pichu Pajamas and jumped into bed and sleep.  You look at the stars and say,  \"I wish Pikachu's dream can come true.\"  You then go to sleep.<br>\r\nWhen you were sleeping Pikachu felt something strange in his body.  He shot electricity towards his toys and it became smaller.  He was surprised by this and then shot at it again except instead of negative energy it would be positive. He shot at it and it grew back to it's size.  He looks at himselft. Finally he can grow to the size of a Giant.  But he thinks about you.  He decides that instead of growing to a giant, he'll make you shrink to make him look like a giant he goes to your bed and shoots electricity at you.  You shrink and shrink.  You didn't know what height you were at.  Pikachu smiles at this and picks you up and curls up and puts you on his back for warmth and surprise.<br>\r\nYou didn't know you were</span></div></div>",

From your vantage position, you can barely see above yourself, but you're certain his cock is up there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also could climb down his thigh and onto the Ampharos' tail directly underneath it, and follow it to its base.

Ampharos must have eaten while you were trying to regain your consciousness. In that moment, the sphincter in front of you started leaking.

You look around, noticing there's a sea of water and acid in Ampharos' stomach. There are mounds of crushed berries and food you can't identify. Luckily, Ampharos seems to be not be moving at all, it's easy for you to stay on relatively dry terrain while you look for the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou locate it, near the bottom of the stomach. There's a rather sizable bunch of berries there, trapped without any possibility of being moved. Slowly and methodically, you start grabbing piece by piece and throw it behind you, trying to ignore how viscous it all felt. It's not going to get rid of Ampharos' problems, but at least he won't be in pain anymore, you hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon your work does what it intended. The stomach starts pushing everything towards the intestines, that should be the end of Ampharos' distress. You were about to leave when you notice something else.</span></div></div>",
