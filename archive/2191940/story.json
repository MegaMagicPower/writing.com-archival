You would tease your sister Emily (7) until she made that wish that her big sister would have to act nicer to her. Hopefully, Emily will act nice to you when you become more like your baby sister Molly (3).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie Jones: You were a college student of 19-years who did not take your academic achievements seriously. It all becomes awkward when one night at a frat party you barely even remember makes you too young for college, to the amusement of your brother Skylar (14) and sister Margot (9).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica Morton: You were a 17-year old cheerleader who was popular in high school. All of the other girls were envious of your curves, especially your budding sister Kelly (12), until you start going through puberty in reverse from a strange genetic condition. Kelly and your brother Lionel (7) can't help but find this amusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley Summers: You were an overly-vain 23-year old girl who would make herself an epitome of feminine charm through unhealthy habits such as multiple corrective surgeries and eating disorders. Your womanly beauty will not last long, though, when these treatments start to backfire and make you look more like a little girl. You have to turn to those like your tomboy sister Harriet (16) for help.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, it seems like sitting on your post under the summer heat is playing tricks on your mind, whether it's in the form of distracting you to the point you forget small details or even feeling like the heat is causing your previous skin-tight suit to expand slightly. Eventually, you find that you seem to be shrinking. Whether it's really the heat or the water or something else, you are not sure as to why this is happening. As days pass, you would hope that it won't be a recurring thing that builds up, especially with you needing to return to college in the fall and all the little kids and their parents who will see you like this.

Taking a kitchen knife with you to cut open the box, you take the box back to your room. If the package really does contain what you asked for, it would be better if your siblings didn't see what was inside. Slicing through the tape binding the box together, you pry it open and take out a pink plastic wand from a sea of packing peanuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sweet. It's finally here.\" You mutter to yourself. The wand is a collectors' item for an anime series you have been binge watching lately in private. Your brother and sister already make fun of you and call an 'otaku geek', but you felt that they would only make fun of you more from being a fan of a franchise about a moe magical girly girl and her slice of life adventures. Just for fun, you wave the wand and call out the main character's catchphrase, not knowing what is to come right after that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" You pause out of confusion from the gentle hum coming out the wand. Without warning, you get swarmed in a blinding barrage of stars and hearts made of light. Before you can process whether actual magic is in play, you find your clothes becoming loose on you. Whatever muscle you had fades away, leaving behind a dainty frame without any body hair. You squeak with a much higher pitch than you thought possible for you from the pressure on your chest. Having already lost half a foot in height, your clothes become really loose on you. However, your clothes start to match your body again in size. Your pants in particular shrink even further in height and blossoms outward, creating a new skirt/dress for you. Only when the hair on your scalp lengthens to reach your back and your boxers change into panties that fit snugly on you does your transformation stop. You wobble around for a few seconds to get over whatever sensation of dizziness lingered before you look at yourself and your much bigger room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap!\" You squeal out of surprise and excitement. \"I'm a girl! I'm a real magical girl!\" You did not know whether you should be concerned or not, but, either way, you needed to see what you have become. You look onto the mirror hanging on your closet door to confirm what happened. Indeed, you are a girl... or rather the girl you would have been if you were born as such. You also see that you are now actually the same age as the owner of the magical wand. How old are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, it doesn't seem like they fit too well since her curves got in the way. You also found that you are not in your usual state either judging from your sudden voice and clothing changes. You definitely seemed to be more a child than anything, especially considering that you are wearing your little brother's clothes and they were slightly loose on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you kid and why are you wearing my clothes?\" The young lady asked you, clearly being as confused as you were.

From your chest erupted two bulbous breasts that had absorbed and erased any pronounced abdominal muscles and semblance of an Adam's Apple you ever had. Thankfully, after a few more changes, your body finally cooled down and stopped causing agony. You and the boys remained silent to process what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg?\" Your wife Stella called out to you. \"Are you ok-? oh my...\" Stella's face turned white with horror and shock. Whether she could recognize you or not, you could tell this was not going to end well. After a few seconds of Stella experiencing a hurricane of emotions, she finally spoke up again. \"Greg... you're a woman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" You already had reasons to suspect this might have been the case, but you were not willing to believe that it was true. Now having the strength to move, you sat up to take a good look at yourself. You saw that, indeed, you had grown breasts and had developed a smooth feminine frame to match. You instinctively covered your chest with one arm in case your draping shirt failed to protect your new modesty. Reluctantly, you placed your other hand on your crotch to be absolutely sure. You could not help but squeal in horror to find nothing down there. \"How did this happen?\" You tried as hard as you could to ignore your new feminine voice, though you were tempted to crack from that as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this mean daddy is mommy now?\" the youngest son John asked. You could tell that Stella almost giggled at that, but she restrained herself from seeing how uncomfortable you clearly were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let you borrow my clothes. Come on. Everyone inside.\" Stella gestured everyone to the door, to which everyone including yourself complied. You were not willing to risk being outside for any longer in case you got another strange mosquito bite. You figured that you will need to see a doctor tomorrow, preferably under an alias. Until then, ___.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You knew that he is a vastly intelligent young man (his GPA and the effort he puts into his homework is proof of that), but there was one thing about him that concerned you... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour train of thought was interrupted from the sound of the front door being opened.

He went upstairs, no doubt to chat with his like-minded friends online. You sighed, figuring that he will most likely stay in his room for the night, only coming down for dinner or to brush his teeth. Ever since the senior year started, he had started doubting himself. You had no idea why he doubted his academic achievements, but you had a guess as to what was actually going on: he felt inadequate as a man when it comes to women. Until then, the fact that he and his friends mainly hung with each other and never anyone else didn't seem to bother him. However, with prom and later college only barely ahead of him, this form of isolation might have finally taken its toll. You could relate, having had similar feelings towards girls during your years in high school, though you would probably consider yourself luckier there. Then again, you were never the brainy type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I can help that kid. Maybe I can be wing-man or something.\" You almost chuckled from how silly it was for you to be muttering to yourself. Not to mention, it's not like you would be of any valuable help as you are. Little did you know, your wish would soon come true, but, as if to provide a perform a form of cruel irony, it would come at the cost of you no longer being you.

To clarify, the first chapters are past tense for the sake of the prologue. You can switch to present tense as soon the changed young lady is noticed by her new siblings. This present tense should be the default afterwards for the sake of proper writing. However, I realize that some people may have been taught to write otherwise and I understand that this may be a bit confused. With that said, there is no need to panic if you end up alternating between the two as long as the story remains being fun to read.</td>",
