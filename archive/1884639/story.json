In her early 40's she was the mother of three teens, and wife to realtor Phil Dunphy, who was, more or less, an idiot.  Claire was pretty excited for her party tonight at her father's house, as the entire family would be attending. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour or so before the party, Claire decided to get ready.  She put on makeup and a dress that showed her figure off really well.  Now that she thought of it, her body had looked really nice lately, and she did not want to lose her nice figure.  Minutes later, the Dunphy's made their way to her party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the party, Claire was happy to see that her whole family could make it.  This included Jay, Gloria, Manny, Cam, Mitch, and Lilly.  Claire recieved gifts from the entire family, but her favorite was the one from Phil.  It was a necklace with a ruby in the middle, and she absolutely adored it.  Gloria thought that it was nice too, adding,\"Oh my God, it's absolutely beautiful!\"  Soon after the family returned home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt home Claire put on the necklace.  \"Honey, thank you so much for this, it's beautiful!\"  \"No problem, babe.  Hey, you know what? It's still your birthday, and I think I might have one more small present for you...\"  \"Little?  Come on, don't put yourself down like that...\"  \"You know what I mean!  So, are you up for it?\"  Claire responded,\"Am I ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a half an hour later, Claire had fallen asleep, the locket resting on top of her flat belly.</span></div></div>",

She went into the bathroom to get dressed, after she was naked from last night's events.  The first thing she noticed is that her breasts were more sensitive, more than they had been in years.  A violent surge of nausea ran over her, and she found herself at the toilet vomiting.  \"Ugh... too much wine last night, I guess...\", she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put on some jeans, a striped shirt, and the necklace, and then went into the kitchen to help the kids get ready for school.  As usual, Haley and Alex were arguing, with Luke right in the middle of it.  Claire decided to put a stop to their bickering.  \"Alex, Haley, stop it right now, or I will ground yo-\" She was interrupted by her belly growling loudly.  \"What was that?!\", Luke asked, bewildered.  Claire remained silent, placing a hand on her belly, hoping that it would settle down.  Claire then took the kids to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dropping them off, Claire decided to get breakfast.  She stopped at a fast food restaurant to quell her hunger.  She ordered two orders of sausage, eggs, and pancakes.  After eating, she noticed that her belly slightly curved out at the bottom, as if she had swallowed a baseball.  She was at a stoplight, so she lifted up her shirt and felt the small bump.  It was firm, but had some give to it.  \"Must be bloated.\", she thought to herself.  The light turned green, and she returned home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the house, she began to feel tired from the large breakfast, so she decided to take a nap.  An hour later, she noticed that it was about 10:30, and she heard her phone ring.  Gloria was calling, wondering if she wanted to go shopping at the mall with her.  \"Uh, I don't know, Gloria-\".  Just then, she caught a glimpse of her belly in the mirror, and saw that it had grown again, making her look three months pregnant.  \"Actually, on second thought, that sounds fun!\"  Gloria would pick her up in a few minutes, and she hung up.  Lifting up her shirt, she rubbed her swollen belly.  \"Looks like I might need bigger clothes\", she said to herself, the necklace still around her neck.  Not wanting Gloria to become suspicious of her \"bloated\" belly, she put on a light jacket, which hid the bump well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria picked up Claire, and they were on their way.  Minutes later, they arrived at the mall.  Not wanting Gloria to see her belly, she put her hands in her jacket's pockets.  The two made their way to the food court, as it was time for lunch.  Gloria didn't eat much, not wanting to ruin her perfect figure.  Claire, however, found her appetite expanding, mimicking her mysterious growing belly.  \"Wow, you're eating a lot, Claire, are you alright?\"  \"Yep, uh, I'm perfect!\"  Soon after that, they went into a clothing department.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire went looking for clothes to accommodate her growing belly, while Gloria looked for clothes that would show off her body.  The two quickly found what clothes they were looking for, and wanted to try them on.  Gloria was making her way to the dressing rooms, with Claire already in a room.  She noticed that her belly had gotten bigger, making her look four months pregnant.  She took her shirt off, and was about to put on the larger shirt, when Gloria bust into the dressing room.  \"Oh Claire!  I'm so sorry, I didn't see you in here!\"  Her eyes were brought down to Claire's swollen belly, alarming her.  \"What happened to your stomach!?\", she said,\"You look pregnant!\"  Claire placed her hands on her taut belly.  \"Well, I'm not pregnant, I know that.  This started earlier this morning, I'm just bloated, that's all.\"  Gloria felt Claire's belly.  \"It feels like a pregnant belly, but I guess you know best.\"  After that, Claire tried on her other clothes, and made purchases.  They decided that that was all that they should buy, and they started to head home.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they arrived at the Dunphy's, Gloria asked a question.  \"Claire, that necklace is so beautiful.  I was wondering, could I borrow it.\"  \"Oh yeah, sure!\"  \"Also, I'm no doctor, but I think that you should get that checked out.\", she said, gesturing to Claire's belly.  Claire said that she would think about it, and Gloria offered to take her to the doctor's whenever she needed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Claire wondered if she should see a doctor, rubbing her belly, which felt oddly good, as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After minutes of thought, Claire decided to schedule an appointment with her doctor.  She wanted her appointment to be a check up, and it was scheduled for 5:00 that night.  She called Gloria, who would pick her up and take her there.  Claire went to pick up her kids from school.  Once she picked them up, she told them that she would be away later.  \"Kids, Gloria and I are going out later, so you'll be alone for a few hours.  That means no setting the house on fire, Luke.\"  Soon after, they arrived home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 4:45, Gloria went to pick up Claire.  When they were halfway to the doctor's,  Claire desperately had to pee.  \"Can we stop at this gas station?  My bladder has been acting up lately.\"  They pulled over, where Claire went to the restroom, after relieving herself, she stood up, unzipped her jacket, and lifted up her shirt.  Giving her swollen belly a poke, asking herself, \"Why am I so bloated?  Could I be pregnant?  No, no, that's stupid.\"  After that, she left the bathroom and got back into Gloria's car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at the doctor's office right on time, and Claire was able to walk right into her appointment.  The nurse lead her into the office.   \"Please step on the scale.\"  Claire stepped on the scale, and found that she had already gained 10 pounds in two days, to her surprise.  After taking more measurements, the nurse left, leaving Claire and her belly alone.  Minutes later, the family doctor came in.  \"How are you doing, Claire?''  \"F-f-fine,\" she stammered nervously.  \"Could you strip down to your underwear, please?\" he said.  She only took off her pants, not wanting him to see her swollen belly.  He eyed her suspiciously.  \"Your shirt,too.\"  \"Oh,  I thought you just meant my panties,\", she lied.  She unzipped her jacket and took off her shirt, revealing her larger midsection.  \"Oh my, you've gotten a bit bigger around the middle!\", he said, patting her belly.  \"Yep..\",Claire said unenthusiastically, slowly rubbing her belly.  \"Lie down on the table and let me get a look at you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire walked over to the table, and took a few tries heaving herself on, her belly weighing her down.  She spread out on the table, and the doctor walked up to her.  He placed his hands on her belly and felt the tautness of it.  The doctor grabbed his stethoscope and placed it on her quivering belly, hearing what was inside, food, or something else.  After a few minutes of this, he allowed her to put her clothes back on.  \"Unfortunately, this late in the day we can't run any tests on you, but if you come back tomorrow we can certainly run an ultrasound or anything else that you may want done.\"  On that note, Claire left the office with Gloria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did the doctor say?\", Gloria asked.  \"They didn't say what was wrong with my belly, but I have to go back tomorrow for an ultrasound.\"  \"An ultrasound, for what?\"  \"Just in case I'm pregnant, but I have a feeling that it'll be a waste of time.\"  \"I'm starving, do you want something to eat?\", Gloria said.  \"I thought you'd never ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two decided to eat at a buffet.  Claire ate a lot of food to keep her hunger at bay, and she noticed that Gloria ate more than usual.  Claire's belly pushed out once more, making her look five months pregnant.  After eating, the two left to go home.  They arrived at Claire's house, and as she exited the car, she noticed that Gloria seemed a bit bloated, and she still has the necklace on.  Once Claire got in the house, she felt really tired, so she headed to her room.  In the bedroom, she undressed, looking at her body.  She got into her pajamas, which were getting a bit to small for her middle, and went to bed, her swollen belly on her mind.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later that night, Claire was awoken by an unfamiliar feeling in her belly.  She saw that it was almost swaying with movement from within.  \"What-\"  She pulled up her shirt, which had already exposed some of her belly, and placed her hands on the dome, trying to feel for more movement.  As soon as it had started, it had ceased, and Claire had found that whatever was in her belly was pressing on her bladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire attempted to walk normally to the bathroom, but she found that she had developed a bit of a waddle.  Slowly but surely, she made her way to the bathroom. She relieved herself, and began to wash her hands.  She was almost in awe at the sight of her belly, making her appear at least six months pregnant. \"Oh, God...why is this happening to me?\"  Her belly growled with hunger loudly.  \"Well, it looks like I'm starting early today...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire waddled into the kitchen, looking for something to eat.  Reaching in the fridge, she grabbed a carton of ice cream and a jar of pickles.  She quickly devoured the pickles in a matter of minutes.  \"Huh,\"she said, patting her belly,\"I haven't had that since I was-\"  Claire quickly diffused that thought, and decided to go back to bed, because it was a Saturday, and she didn't have to get the kids ready for school.  As she got back into her bed, she felt an odd squirming sensation in her belly, but quickly drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke up at 10:00 a.m., surprised that she wasn't hungry.  Gloria said that she would pick her up at 10:30, so she didn't have long to find out what was wrong with her belly.  Her bowling ball-sized belly had grown yet again, giving her the appearance of a woman who was seven months along.  Not wanting everyone to see her bare belly in public, she decided to get dressed.  She put on a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt that covered all but the bottom of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movement in her belly had increased, and she rubbed the large sphere in an attempt to calm it down, but to no avail.  \"Please hurry, Gloria...\"  Almost on queue, Claire heard a car pull up in the driveway.  \"Finally!\" Claire stood at the door patiently, waiting for Gloria to knock.  She did, and Claire opened the door for her.  Claire was in shock at what stood before her.  \"Oh my God!  What happened?!\"  Gloria's belly had grown monstrously over the night, as it was almost as big as Claire's.  \"I don't know...it started late last night.\"  Gloria did not own any maternity clothes, since she didn't plan on having any more kids after Manny thirteen years ago, so she was forced to wear her usual sexy attire, which was almost bursting at the seams.  They stood with their bellies touching, until Claire felt a kick from her belly.  Gloria felt it, and asked,\"What was that?''  \"I don't know, but we need to leave, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two swollen women made their way into the doctor's office with a few minutes to spare.  They checked in and took a seat.  Claire sat next to an elderly woman, who put her hands on Claire's belly, which had started to quiver with movement from within.  \"Sure is active, isn't it?  Oh, is your friend pregnant as well?  How far along are you?\" A nurse suddenly walked in.  \"Claire Dunphy.\"  Claire struggled to get up, but eventually got up with Gloria's help.  The two followed the nurse into an examining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Claire and Gloria took a seat, waiting for the doctor.  He entered the room.  His eyes widened,\"I see that you've also gotten bigger,\" he said, looking at Gloria.  She nodded her head, her hands drawing themselves to her belly.  The doctor also noticed that Claire's growth, and signaled her to get on the examination table.  It took her a few tries, but she was able to get on the table.  The doctor pulled up her shirt, and began to feel her belly.  She could feel more kicking from her belly, which alarmed the doctor.  \"I think we need an ultrasound for you right now!\"  He called the nurse, who came in with the ultrasound machine.  She turned it on and handed the wand to the doctor.  The nurse squirted gel all over Claire's swollen, kicking belly.  He put the wand on her belly, and moved it around, trying to find out what was inside...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire groaned, feeling more movement inside her as the doctor ran the ultrasound wand over her bulging belly. She couldn't believe it: in her 40s, raising three teenagers, one of whom getting ready for college, and now she was going to have a fourth child to take care of. At least that's what she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what I can tell right now, it looks like you're expecting twins,\" the doctor smiled, turning to Claire. \"Congratulations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire looked between the doctor, Gloria, and the ultrasound's display in shock. \"Twins? I can barely raise my three kids now! You're telling me I'll need to raise two babies now too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor moved the wand and stroked his chin. \"Make that three babies.\" Claire's eyes bugged out more and more. Gloria heaved herself out of her chair to get a better look, or at least she tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get a print-out,\" Gloria said, waving her hand away and sitting back down, hand on her belly, as big as Claire's and forcing her clothing to the limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Triplets,\" Claire repeated to herself, hand on her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...make that quadruplets,\" the doctor said, concerned. \"That's impossible. I definitely scanned this part already but...there's no doubt about it. You're pregnant with four fetuses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you don't want to check any longer?\" Claire scoffed. \"Maybe you'll find a fifth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor shrugged and traced the wand up near Claire's ribs. \"You've got good intuition. Quintuplets.\" He squinted and looked at the screen. \"And it looks like they're...getting bigger. I can see their growth in real time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire looked down at her belly and could see that, gradually, it was swelling outward and she felt the kicking increasing. \"Okay, that's enough,\" she said, slowly turning on her hips to hop off the examination table. \"I'd rather not stick around to find out anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor shrugged. \"Well, it's your choice. Mrs. Pritchett, you're up next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria sighed and gritted her teeth, grunting very un-femininely in contrast to her appearance to get her big belly off of her seat. When she finally got up-right, there was a loud rip and the sides of her belly were now visible; the dark, smooth skin that Claire knew would get Phil excited if he saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ay, what happened?\" Gloria said, noticing Claire and the doctor with their eyes fixed on her. \"Did I tear part of my clothes?\" Gloria turned around to try and get a look, not able to see the exposed part of her belly, only managing to turn her growing belly around in circles, knocking over some of the displays on the doctor's table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...get up here, Mrs. Pritchett,\" the doctor said, reaching a hand out to Gloria, helping her onto the display table. And as Claire saw her belly grow at an even quicker rate than hers, it was clear she needed the help. She rolled up her tight dress, exposing her huge, taut belly. Claire was jealous of how Gloria didn't have a single stretch mark, before remembering that she also had a beautiful, smooth belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Claire, the doctor began scanning the interior of Gloria's womb, the results no less shocking. \"W-well Mrs. Pritchett-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, call me Gloria,\" Gloria said. \"The name 'Pritchett' makes me feel so old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thanks for that</i>, Claire thought to herself as the doctor cleared his throat, looking back at the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well Gloria, it looks like you're carrying...seven fetuses right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dios mio,\" Gloria said softly, hand on her forehead. \"You're sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, like with Mrs. Dunphy, I could check some more,\" the doctor said, moving his wand up toward the top of Gloria's belly, only having his hand swatted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ay, don't try and touch me there,\" Gloria said, holding her hands over her breasts. \"Believe me, I know they've gotten bigger since...the belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire looked down at her own chest, which had managed to get up to about a C cup, while Gloria was now pushing a G cup at least, squished into the tiny, cleavage-revealing dress Gloria she already had on. <i>Of course</i>...Claire complained inside her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-alright,\" the doctor said, admittedly focused on Gloria's chest more than her belly. \"Well, it looks like your fetuses are growing at an astounding rate. Even more than Mrs. Dunphy's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria muttered to herself in Spanish as she tried to make it off of the examining table, another rip revealing her belly permanently. \"Here, take my jacket,\" Claire said, mostly just wanting Gloria to be covered up to draw less attention. \"But seven kids...any idea how far along we are, doctor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head. \"The rate at which they are growing, it's impossible to say. But in 24 hours, I'd say you're both going to look much, much...much bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire sighed. And the way those extra babies popped up during the exam, she wouldn't be surprised if they were both carrying seven...or more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should schedule more tests right away,\" the doctor said. \"This sort of thing...there's no precedent or medical event that we know of. You'll both need to be supervised and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, you're not holding me up in your labs,\" Gloria said. \"Columbian pregnant women are very expressive and open. I will deal with whatever this is at home, with my family,\" she said, patting her belly underneath the jacket that was no longer fitting her as it did Claire. \"C'mon Claire, let's go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire wasn't happy about the idea of being holed up in the hospital with a mysterious pregnancy either but wanted more information. She held her belly with one hand as Gloria roped her arm under Claire's. \"So, what do we do now?\" Claire said, exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We eat a lot of ice cream and then we talk, woman to woman,\" Gloria said. \"We've never gotten to do that much. I know I'm married to your father but I feel like a sister with you. The sister I never had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...there's already a sister in your family,\" Claire said, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire! That's not nice to say about Mitchell. I thought you were more accepting,\" Gloria said, glaring at Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, obviously I don't...I meant Sonia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right,\" Gloria said, her face turning up in disgust. \"Well we were never too close. But you and I-\" Gloria said, wrapping an arm around Claire's shoulder and bringing their bellies together. \"-are going to be very close.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire looked down at her rounding belly again, placing a hand on the bare skin that her shirt revealed, as she felt multiple kicks.  <i>Five babies...how am I gonna do this?  And how is Gloria gonna raise seven kids?</i> she thought to herself.  \"You know--maybe we should schedule you two for another appointment tomorrow.  It wouldn't hurt.\" said the doctor with a shrug.  \"O-okay.  That sounds fine.\" Claire responded.  They set up their appointment and waddled to Claire's car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the two largely pregnant women heaved themselves into Claire's car, their bellies let out a collective grumble.  \"So, about that ice cream...\" Claire chuckled, rubbing her belly in an attempt to stop her babies kicking.  Gloria was in agreement on the suggestion, and Claire drove to the local ice cream parlor, slightly faster than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the ice cream parlor, Claire and Gloria both ordered ice cream cones, with multiple scoops and flavors, their pregnancy cravings getting the best of them.  They grabbed a nearby booth, careful not to get their bellies stuck between the table, and devoured their ice cream in a matter of minutes.  \"Dios mio, I am stuffed like a pig.\" Gloria said, pressing a hand on her jacket-covered belly, which was pressing tightly against the fabric.  Claire could tell that both of their bellies had gotten larger since the doctor's appointment.  Claire appeared full term with a single baby, while Gloria looked well overdue, nearing full term with twins.  They left the parlor and headed home, deciding to have some girl-to-girl talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing a short trek, the pregnant ladies reached the Dunphy home.  Waddling indoors, Claire plopped down on the couch, turning on the TV, while Gloria slowly made her way to the bathroom.  \"Oh, bebes.\" she could be heard saying.  A few minutes later, Gloria exited the restroom.  She had ditched Claire's jacket, and, to Claire's surprise, her tattered dress as well.  Donning only her bra and panties, it was evident that pregnancy suited Gloria, as it accentuated her every curve.  Her round belly was free of any stretch marks, which slightly annoyed Claire, because her own previous pregnancies had been riddled with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria sat on the couch next to Claire, as the couch slightly creaked in response.  Claire was watching a pregnancy documentary on one of those health channels, which had piqued both of their interests.  The watching didn't last long, as they began to discuss their own pregnancies.  \"I'll tell you what, Gloria, I don't know how I'm gonna have five more kids, especially at my age!\" Claire said, as they both felt her large belly, feeling the kicks and punches within.  \"Claire, don't worry.  You're the strongest woman I know.  I don't know anyone else who goes through as much as you do, and hasn't gone cuckoo at the end of the day.\" Gloria said with a smile.  Claire glanced at the necklace hanging around Gloria's neck, and thought that it was a bit odd that their  mysterious pregnancies had occurred at the same time that Claire recieved the necklace.  Claire thought little of it, though, and decided to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Gloria, really.  That helps.  Although, I am excited that I'll be an aunt to seven little ones soon!\" she said, placing her hand on Gloria's round stomach.  \"I know...I just hope I won't burst!\" Gloria said, running her hand down the middle of her belly, as multiple kicks greeted her.  \"Hey, if the Octomom didn't, I think you're safe!\" Claire laughed, her belly shaking as she did so.  The two chatted and swapped belly rubs for the next few hours, the time flying by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire then checked her watch, and realized that it was time to pick up the kids from school.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We need to go pick up the kids!\" Claire said, struggling to get up from the couch.  \"Ay, let's go!\" Gloria responded, heaving herself up and waddling towards the front door.  \"Hey, hey, hey!  You can't go out like that, you're practically naked and huge!  No offense...\" Claire trailed off, realizing that she was also in a similar predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want me to do?  It's not like I have any clothes that fit anymore!\" Gloria said, emphatically placing a hand on her swollen belly.  \"I think I might have some old maternity clothes stowed away in my closet, we should check there.\" Claire replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief search, Claire found some old maternity blouses and jeans, which would fit for the time being.  For her at least, the same couldn't be said for Gloria.  Claire's was able to cover her growing bump fully (although it strained a bit), but Gloria's blouse left a sliver of her belly to be displayed.  Without further ado, the two largely pregnant woman waddled to Claire's van, as they prepared themselves to announce that their kids would get more brothers and sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short drive later, Claire and Gloria pulled up to the school, waiting for the bell to ring.  \"Are you ready to do this?\" Claire asked, nervously placing a hand on her enlarged stomach.  \"Not really, but the truth has to get out sometime.\"  Gloria replied.  \"God, how are we gonna tell everyone else?  I mean, Cam and Mitch might take it alright, but Jay?  He'll have a heart attack!  And who knows how Phil's gonna take it when he comes home...\" Claire said.  \"We'll throw a get-together!  Let's have it at your house, and we can announce it together!  I'll come over before Jay gets home so he won't know about it.\" Gloria said, feeling her babies kick and squirm inside her belly.  \"I...guess that sounds alright.\" Claire responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, kids flooded from the school, and Alex, Luke, and Manny made their way to the van.  They climbed in and took their seats.  Claire breathed heavily, preparing herself to make the announcement.  \"Hey, kids.  How was school?\" she asked, planting on a fake smile.  \"Good.\" they replied in unison, the typical response.  \"Wait, where's Haley?\" Claire asked, slightly concerned.  \"She got a ride from Dylan.  He's going on vacation for a few months and wanted to say goodbye.\" Alex replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.  Okay.  Well, I think there's something that Gloria and I would like to announce something.  We...are...pregnant.  Both of us...\" Claire trailed off, fearing their response.  \"Okay.\" Luke replied.  \"Congratulations, ladies!  Just to let you know, you both have my full support, and I will help you out whenever you need me.\" Manny said.  \"Wait, what?!?  Mom, you're pregnant?!?  At your age?  Having a baby after forty isn't exactly easy!\" Alex replied, exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's the other thing.  We aren't just having one baby.  I'm pregnant with quintuplets...\" Claire said.  \"And I'm having seven babies.\" Gloria responded, rubbing the bare sliver of belly for emphasis.  Alex's head nearly exploded with shock, and she sat in silence for the rest of the ride.  After dropping Gloria and Manny back at their house, the growing Dunphy family returned back to their own home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Luke and Alex went to their rooms to do their homework, Claire returned to the couch, indulging on her cravings in the process.  This time, she didn't have a specific craving, but she craved something, anything that she could eat:  chips, cookies, you name it.  Ending her feeding frenzy minutes later, she noticed that her belly had once again gotten bigger, making her look well overdue.  She rolled up her maternity blouse, and rubbed her bared belly, trying to get where her babies were kicking.  \"Jeez, I wonder how big Gloria must be!\" she chuckled, her belly vibrating along to each laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Haley walked in the house, her hair slightly disheveled.  Claire slowly rose from the couch, although she intended to do it much faster, and turned towards Haley, forgetting that her large belly was bared to her.  \"OH MY GOD, MOM?!?\" she asked, clearly taken aback by her mother's newfound girth.  \"Haley...sweetie...I'm...pregnant.  With five babies.\" she said, puckering her lips as she awaited her daughter's response.  \"Mom, that's disgusting!  Do you know how old you are?\" Haley asked.  \"Yes, Haley, yes I do.  But you know what, this wasn't exactly planned, and it's not exactly a normal--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't understand!  My friends aren't gonna want to hang out with me!  They don't want to hang out with someone who's mom is a big, fat cow!\" she yelled, poking Claire's protruding belly with force, as if she were attempting to pop it.  She stormed upstairs, leaving Claire to think about how quickly her life would change.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well, that could have gone better...\"Claire sighed, rolling down her blouse.  Realizing that she only had about half an hour before the get-together was supposed to start, Claire decided that she should clean up the living room.  She removed the empty bags of chips and other food packages from the couch, and disposed of them in the trash can.  This took a little longer than she thought, and she was a bit surprised when the doorbell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire opened the door, and found that Gloria and Manny were standing behind it.  To Claire's surprise (although at this point, it really shouldn't be), Gloria was bigger, nearing the triplets mark.  Manny went upstairs to Luke's room, where he would correct his homework.\"Hola, Claire.  Jay and everyone else should be here soon.\" Gloria said.  \"Alright, guess the only thing we can do is wait.\" Claire said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she had announced her pregnancy twice before, she was most nervous about this announcement, particularly how her father would react.  Not only would he learn that he would have to raise seven more kids, but he would also have five new grandchildren to take care of.  Before Claire could finish her thought, the doorbell rang once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" she said.  The two pregnant women stood in the living room, waiting for Jay, Cam, and Mitchell to see them.  \"Sorry we're a bit late, we were just able to find a babysitter for Lily.\" Cam said.  They entered the living room, and their collective jaws dropped.  \"Claire, Gloria, are you...\" Mitchell trailed.  \"Pregnant?  Yup.  And we're not only having just one baby.  I'm having quintuplets, and Gloria here is having septuplets.\" Claire said, placing one hand on her own belly and the other on Gloria's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJay was silent.  He took a seat, and placed his head in his hands.  \"Fu....\"he trailed off.  \"I'm sorry, but twelve babies between the both of you?  How did that even happen?  It's not like multiples run in the family or anything.\"  Mitchell said.  \"I'm just as surprised as you are, Mitchell.  Believe me.\"  Claire said.  \"Well, the important thing is that you're both having a healthy pregnancy and you're both happy.  You are happy, right?\" Cam asked, trying to lighten the mood.  \"For now, I guess.  But as I get bigger, I doubt I'll be in as good spirit.\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire wondered where Gloria was, as she hadn't spoken in a while.  She was a bit surprised to see that she was stuffing her face with whatever food was in the fridge.  Jay just looked on, shaking his head.  As the party progressed, the kids made their way downstairs.  Haley had taken a seat next to Gloria, and the two rubbed her humongous stomach.  Haley treated Gloria's pregnancy better then her mother's mainly because she was a little afraid of becoming a big sister again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Gloria.  That's a beautiful necklace.  Would you mind if I borrowed it for a few days?\" Haley asked, hypnotized by the jewelry that dangled around Gloria's neck.  \"Oh, sure!  It's your mother's, but I'm sure she won't mind.\" Gloria said, removing the necklace and handing it to Haley, before quickly returning her hands to her belly.  As Haley donned the necklace, a reddish hue emitted from it, unseen by both of the ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour or so later, the guests left, and Claire decided that it was time to go to bed.  Walking upstairs, she noticed that Haley was in the kitchen eating, and quite ravenously at that.  \"Hey Haley, you didn't eat earlier?\" she asked.  \"No, I did.  I'm still hungry.\" her daughter replied.  \"Alright, well just make sure you turn off all the lights when you go to bed, alright?\" Claire asked.  \"Okay.\" Haley said, between loud munches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire slowly made her way to her bedroom and removed her clothing, only donning her bra and panties.  She lay down in her bed, and slowly drifted off to sleep, her babies lightly kicking inside her swollen stomach.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire awoke groggily from her slumber, feeling her babies kick, slightly stronger than they were yesterday.  She rose from her bed, or at least attempted to.  Her increased girth had continued to hinder her movement, and it took multiple heaves to get herself up.  She waddled to the bathroom, as one of the babies had unleashed a particularly strong kick on her bladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter relieving herself, Claire looked at her pregnant form in the mirror.  Once again, her belly had grown, looking eight months pregnant with twins, if not full term.  Her breasts had also slightly grown, but with three previous pregnancies, there wasn't much more room for them to grow.  \"If I'm like this now...how much time do I have left?\" she asked herself, rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire put on some maternity clothes, and noticed that her belly peeked out from the gaps between her shirt and jeans.  \"Guess I'll need some bigger clothes,\" she noted.  As her round stomach let out a rumble and a flurry of kicks surfaced, Claire headed downstairs to make breakfast, realizing that Luke, Alex, and Haley were still asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile at the Pritchett house, Gloria was just waking up.  She rolled over, her belly carrying a load of momentum, and saw that Jay was nowhere to be found.  She had almost forgot that he said that he would be going golfing.  Which would eventually lead to drinking with his friends, but that was besides the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe threw off the bed sheets, and was left in awe at the sight of her belly.  It had continued to balloon outward, giving her the appearance of a woman who was full term with quadruplets.  Her globular stomach let out a loud rumble, signalling that her babies were hungry.  She tried to get up, grunting as she did so, but it was no use.  Her seven babies kicked wildly, surprised at their mother's sudden \"exercise\".  \"MANNY!\" Gloria yelled at the top of her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mom?\" Manny replied, reaching her bedroom in seconds flat.  \"Manny, dear.  Could you please cook me some breakfast?\" she asked kindly, rubbing her belly for emphasis.  Manny stood in place, alarmed at his mother's growing belly, but snapped out of it and ran to the kitchen.  Gloria sat in bed, rubbing her belly, as she waited for Manny to cook her breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Manny returned with a heap of food on a tray.  He handed it to Gloria, and she used her belly as a shelf, as she began to dig in, not even thanking her son.  A few minutes later, she had licked her plate clean, and let out a small burp for emphasis.  \"Thank you, Manny.  It was delicious!\" she said, handing the tray to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria began to scratch her belly, which slightly alarmed Manny.  \"Mom?  Is everything okay?\" he asked.  \"Yes, it just itches.\" she replied.  \"Here, grab that bottle on my dresser.\" she continued.  Manny grabbed the lotion, and returned to his pregnant mother's side.  \"Now, get a handful of it and spread it around my belly.\" Gloria said.  \"Uh...really?\" he asked.  \"Manny, you said that you would do anything that I needed, right?\" she answered back, prying for sympathy.  \"Alright...\" Manny sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to rub the lotion on Gloria's rotund stomach, and covered most of her belly a short while later, as he could feel the kicks from the occupants within.  Gloria then recieved a call.  \"Hey, Gloria!  It's me, Claire. Do you want to go to the mall to get some bigger clothes?  We can do it before the appointment.\" Claire said.  \"Sure that sounds fine.\" Gloria replied.  \"Okay, then.  I'll be right over.\" Claire said, ending the call.</span></div></div>",

Gloria?\" she called out.  \"She's upstairs.\" Manny replied coming out of the kitchen.  \"Right, thank you, Manny.\" Gloria said, as she slowly made her way up the stairs.  Upon entering the bedroom, she could see that Gloria was lying in her bed, and her humongous belly was blocking her face.  \"Claire, is that you? I can't see anything!\" she declared.  \"Yes, it's me.  I'm gonna help you up, alright?\" Claire responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire pulled Gloria up with all her might, although she was much, much heavier than she expected.  With effort, she was able to get Gloria upright.  \"Alright, Gloria, let's get you dressed.\" Claire said.  \"But I have nothing that fits!\" Gloria answered.  \"Okay, so just put on what I gave you yesterday.\" Claire replied.  Gloria grabbed the maternity clothes, and was able to get the jeans on fine.  Her blouse, however, only went down to her popped-out belly button, the bottom half of her belly exposed.  \"Good enough.\" Gloria noted, rubbing her belly as her babies kicked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling down the stairs was a little easier than getting up them, and they reached Claire's car a few minutes later.  When they arrived at the mall, they waddled to the maternity store.  They bought the biggest clothes that would fit, though they knew that it wouldn't be enough when they reached full term.  Even then, the blouses were a decent fit for Claire, but Gloria's bare belly was revealed in her purchases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made their way down the mall, when they reached the food court.  Their bellies let out a collective, deep rumble, and their occupants kicked up a storm.  Without a single word, they bolted (more of a quick waddle, really) to different restaurants, filling plate upon plate with food.  Squeezing themselves in at a table, they devoured their meals within a few minutes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, their bellies had grown.  Claire looked pregnant with triplets, while Gloria looked pregnant with quintuplets.  Claire looked at her watch.  \"You know what, Gloria?  We have some time to spare, do you wanna go back to my place to try some of these clothes on?\" she asked.  \"Fine by me.\" Gloria groaned, rubbing her bare belly.  Claire was able to get up, but Gloria's belly got stuck between the rest of her body and the table.  After a few moments of shimmying, Claire was able to pull Gloria out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the Dunphy household, Claire and Gloria entered carrying multiple bags of clothing.  \"So we don't have too much time to try these on so--\" \"AAAAAAAAAGGGGGGHHHH!\"  The two pregnant women froze as they heard a bloodcurdling scream from upstairs.  They made their way up the stairs, as fast as their bellies could carry them.  Hearing another scream, they could tell that it was coming from Haley's room.  Claire opened the door, and was shocked at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley looked pregnant, and largely so.  In fact, she was about Claire's size, but her belly appeared to be growing slightly before their eyes.  She hadn't bothered to change clothes from last night, and her skinny jeans had burst open, her t-shirt baring her belly completely.  \"Haley what happened?!?\" Claire asked, exasperated.  \"I DON'T KNOW!  I JUST WOKE UP!\" Haley replied, obviously not calm.  Claire decided that they needed to get to the doctor's office, and fast.  Helping Haley out of bed and down the stairs, Claire and Gloria made it to Claire's car.  As soon as everyone was in, Claire sped off.  \"Great, just great.\" Alex said, realizing that she was left alone with Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the doctor's office, the three pregnant ladies waddled inside, though Haley was lagging behind as she was getting used to her size.  Claire approached the desk and let the secretary know that they had arrived.  A few minutes later, they were called into one of the examining rooms, where the doctor was waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, your daughter, too?\" he asked, perplexed.  \"Unfortunately, yes.\" Claire replied.  \"Well, we only have two ultrasound machines at the moment, so we can do two of you at a time.\" the doctor said.  \"That sounds fine.  I guess Gloria and I will go first.\" Claire answered.  The two heaved themselves onto the examining tables, and the doctor rubbed the gel on both of their bulging bellies.  The doctor moved the wands all over their stomachs, trying to get a full image of their baby-filled wombs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so it appears that there are no more babies that have appeared since yesterday's examination, and the growth is slower, at least when compared to the last exam.\" the doctor noted.  \"How far along are we, m\u00e9dico?\" Gloria asked, wincing as she felt a particularly strong kick.  \"Six, maybe seven months.\" he replied.  Claire gasped.  \"So that means we will give birth--\" \"Tomorrow...\" Gloria finished.  \"It appears that way...\" the doctor concluded.  He wiped the gel off of their bellies with a towel, and helped them get off of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a collective effort to get Haley onto one of tables.  After the hard effort, the doctor began to examine Haley.  \"Oh, my...\" he said, briefly examining her womb.  \"What?\" all three pregnant women asked.  \"I...don't know how to say this but...you're Octomom.  You're going to have eight babies.\" the doctor concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...the fat cow...\" Haley trailed, tears filling her eyes.  \"Oh my god...\" Claire added.  \"I have no answer for you two.  In all my years, I've never seen something like this...\" he added.  Claire looked at her daughter as the doctor mentioned that Haley was four months along, but the pregnancy was quickly progressing.  She looked at her slowly growing belly, her enlarged breasts, and the necklace hanging around her neck.  Wait a minute...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the necklace!\" Claire exclaimed.  \"Excuse me?\" the doctor asked, annoyed that he had been interrupted.  \"The necklace that Phil gave me for my birthday!  I gave it to Gloria, who gave it to Haley...It made us pregnant!\" she concluded.  \"Mrs. Dunphy, that's highly unnatural...\" he replied in a condescending tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think she's telling the truth.  What else could be the cause?\" Gloria asked.  Haley didn't say anything, as she was still in shock, but she realized that somehow it had to be true.  \"I...okay.  Whatever you say...\" the doctor said, as he left the room.  \"What are we going to do now?\" Gloria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am going to call Phil, and then we're going to track down whoever did this to us.\"</span></div></div>",

Gloria is pregnant with Joe and will give birth next month, Jay is at his brother Donnie\u2019s for the weekend and will return on christmas day, Cameron and Mitchell are staying at Cameron\u2019s parents farm for the weekend with Lilly, Phil has been away since Thanksgiving at a business conference and will return with Jay on christmas. So this leaves only Manny, Claire, Haley, Alex, Luke, and Gloria in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s two weeks from christmas. Everyone at Jay and Gloria\u2019s house for a pre christmas party. There will be gifts, food, and music. The first there is obviously the beautiful latina wife Gloria, her beautiful details made more detailed due to be eight months pregnant. Gloria\u2019s son Manny, who is wise beyond his years, is the main caterer of the party, with help from Mitchell and Cam with facetime on the computer. Claire, Jay\u2019s daughter from his first marriage, may be a near, or at middle aged soccer mom who is still pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen entering is Haley, Claire and Phil\u2019s beautiful daughter who dresses like the average american girl and lives for social media. Then enters is Alex, who is pretty, but more of a girl next door pretty, and is very smart. And then entering is the youngest kid of the Dunphy family, Luke, who is always face first in a DS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women are dressed in beautiful dresses with glamorous makeup, except for Alex, who is wearing her regular clothes. Manny and Luke are in formal pants and collared shirts. The rest of the family are on facetime with the mac books and iPhones. Gifts were handed around, from those at the party and outside the state. But the best is one item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a necklace, beautifully ornate with a glass blown glass crystal made up of the seven colors: ROYGBIV. But around it are a series of small gems, probably diamonds. It was a gift from Phil to Claire, with everyone adding in their words of affection for it. After that, the Dunphy's returned back to their home, with Claire wearing the necklace the whole way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter returning home with everyone falling asleep, the diamonds on the necklace start to glow. The die is cast, the game has started, and the next 10 days will be a marvel in modern society.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Since her kids didn\u2019t have school, they woke up later at 10 AM. And she had already made breakfast. Clair had made toast, eggs, bacon, pancakes, and scrambled eggs. While Claire ate slightly more than usual, nothing else was out of the ordinary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd by ordinary, I mean Haley and Alex arguing over the most pointless thing while Luke plays on one of his DS games. After everyone had breakfast and were dressed for the day, Claire dropped Luke off at Jay\u2019s house to hang out with Manny, and dropped Haley and Alex at the mall to hang out with friends. After dropping them off, Claire then went to a place serving lunch and had some lunch. She ate what some would consider enough for two people, even doing some peculiar things with her food, such as mixing and matching to experiment with her lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what freaked her out was that each one of her absent minded tests tasted good. After that, she returned home and just hung out. Then when the clock suddenly hit 4 PM, she suddenly got badly nauseas and ran to the bathroom and emptied out her lunch. After washing out her mouth she went to the couch to watch TV, then was suddenly hit with the need to go to the bathroom. Then once she finished, she went to the couch and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she didn\u2019t know was that this would repeat for her for days. At about 8 PM, she went back into her car and picked up Haley, Alex, and Luke. When she prepared to go to bed that night at 9 PM, she started to notice a tightness in her bra when she took it off and got into her pajamas. As she was about to get into bed, she noticed that she looked a little puffy, so she went to the scale and found that she gained at least 5 pounds. She ignores this and goes to bed, still wearing the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first day ends, and as nine more days come up, more will join this woman as she continues to wear the necklace.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yet while she's in the kitchen, her necklace somehow got removed from her neck and is now somewhere in the house. When she wakes up, she makes breakfast for the kids, while asking aloud, \"Where's all the food in the fridge?\" However, she makes breakfast for the kids anyway and drops them off at the mall and Manny's, just like yesterday.

In between upchucks, she could hear someone else throwing up as well. When she finished and got out of the bathroom, her mother looked as disheveled as her, only very, very puffy in the stomach. Clair raised a hand, \u201cYa know...If I hadn\u2019t thrown up as well, I\u2019d think you went out to a party last night.\u201d Haley shrugs, \u201cI believe you.\u201d The morning continued, Claire making breakfast, although this time enough for two dozen people, Haley and Alex arguing with each other, and Luke ignoring them to play his DS games. That day, Claire dropped the kids off at Jay\u2019s house so that they can hang out with Alex and Manny can go to a museum to hang out with some friends, Luke is dropped off at a game shop, and Haley will go to the mall to hang out with some friends. Haley chose to be dropped off by her mom so that she could borrow some of Gloria\u2019s high heels to check out a dress on sale that day. Claire wore very baggy clothes and a hoodie to hide her stomach, but it only hid so much. When Manny opened the door for the ladies to enter his parent\u2019s house, Claire would put her hands into the jacket pocket. Gloria hugs her husband's daughter and her kids and gets Haley the high heels she needs. When she returned she tells her, \u201cWhat a beautiful necklace, Haley.\u201d Haley holds it up and asks, \u201cThanks. I actually don\u2019t know why I put it on, really. It won\u2019t go with the dress I\u2019m trying on. Would you like to borrow it?\u201d Gloria answers, \u201cAbsolutely!\u201d She doesn\u2019t waste time putting it on. Haley and Claire head out, but Gloria joins them. She asks, \u201cClaire? Can you drop me off at the gynecologists?\u201d Claire shrugs, \u201cSure.\u201d Haley\u2019s dropped off at the mall and Claire goes to the doctors with Gloria. While Gloria is checked on, Claire rushes out to throw up. When she returned, the doctor, a woman, asks, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d Claire answers, \u201cSure. Sure. Sure.\u201d She sounded unsure of herself. The doctor asks, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t ask this otherwise, but since I\u2019m in this appointment...Is it possible that you are pregnant?\u201d Claire turns chalk white at this realization. She stuttered out a lot of sounds, suddenly making the realization. But the only audible part is, \u201cBut I started feeling funny only a few days ago\u2026\u201d The doctor motions for her to lay on the table. The doctor moved about some machines and stated, \u201cFrom the size, I\u2019d say that your around several months pregnant, probably big enough to see the baby\u2026\u201d She puts the applicant and gell onto her belly and saw something unique.

First, they make calls for the kids to be dropped off at the house to tell them the big news. While waiting, they ate an assortment of strange foods due to the cravings. There was indian food mixed with pizza, ice cream mixed with burgers, and so much more. After eating, they sat in the living room and chatted for hours. The kids didn\u2019t arrive until late in the evening. The first to arrive was Alex and Manny, then Haley, and finally Luke. When Alex and Manny entered, Gloria got a thick blanket to cover Claire to surprise the kids. Alex enters, blurting out, \u201cWhy do the perfect in mind and body seem oblivious?\u201d Gloria asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d She tells him, \u201cI met this boy at the museum. His name's Benny and he moved here from Hong Kong. He\u2019s nice, smart, and cute. But all I did was stutter like I was in 3rd grade!\u201d Gloria rubs her head, \u201cMaybe you need to try something different?\u201d Alex asks, \u201cWhat, like makeup?\u201d Gloria shrugs, \u201cMaybe some jewelry will help. Why don\u2019t you try on this necklace? It\u2019s your sisters, so you can give it back to her.\u201d She puts the necklace Claire got at the start of all this around Alex\u2019s neck. When Luke finally arrives, Claire starts off, \u201cGuys, I have a surprise\u2026\u201d Haley finishes, \u201cI\u2019m getting a new car?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d Luke finishes, \u201cI\u2019m getting a new video game?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d Alex finishes, \u201cAm I getting a confidence boost?\u201d \u201cWhat? No. The surprise is\u2026\u201d Gloria finishes, removing the blanket, \u201cWe\u2019re getting some new additions!\u201d Manny goes to Claire and tells her, \u201cCongratulations, Claire. I believe that a speech is in order-\u201d Claire finishes, \u201cNo speeches, please.\u201d Alex blurts out, \u201cYou do realize delivery will be difficult with the fact that you haven\u2019t given birth in a few years?\u201d Claire asks Gloria, \u201cWas I just called old?\u201d Haley weeps, \u201cI\u2019m not getting a car!!!\u201d And rushes over to the kitchen. Luke asks, \u201cYou said \u2018some,\u2019 how many are there?\u201d Claire shrugs, \u201cThree...Maybe five\u2026\u201d Everyone\u2019s eyes bug out. Alex asks, \u201cDoes dad know?\u201d Claire answers, \u201cThat\u2019s one I\u2019ve been trying to figure out.\u201d Claire and her kids return home, along the drive, Claire notices Alex\u2019s new necklace. She asks, \u201cAlex, where\u2019d you get the necklace?\u201d Alex answers, \u201cGloria says it\u2019s Haleys. She let me borrow it to impress Benny.\u201d Claire asks, \u201cHaley, where\u2019d you get that necklace?\u201d She tells her, \u201cI found it in the kitchen at the house.\u201d Claire tells her, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say this but that\u2019s my necklace.\u201d The subject is drawn on as much as it could and eventually dies down. The kids return home and forget about the necklace. When they get home, Claire calls a restaurant with delivery to deliver half a dozen pizzas of different flavors, all the flavor of 10 piece hot wings, and a large helping of fries. When the food arrives, Claire quickly starts on it, and strangely Haley joins her in the food. Afterwards, the Pritchett and Dunphy family fell to sleep, with the three oldest women randomly getting up to go to the bathroom or eat something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire-Day 5<br>\r\nHaley-Day 3<br>\r\nGloria-Month 8/Day 2<br>\r\nAlex-Day 1</span></div></div>",

She'd lied to her time and time again, telling her that she and Dylan weren't ready, and that she didn't need to go on the pill just yet - promised to be safe and yet here she was in a drugstore bathroom with a pregnancy test between her fingers telling her that yes, she was indeed pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan and Haley had only slept together a handful of times, stealing any steamy moment they could however awkward, usually doing it in the back of his car as both their houses were never truly empty. Haley had thought she was ready to lose her virginity since her friends were, but while they were losing it in motel rooms or their own bedrooms, she felt she'd missed out on that 'special' first time and if she was honest, she didn't think she actually loved Dylan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, he was hot, but they didn't really talk much when they hung out, they just made out and he listened to her while she complained about her parents and siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been three weeks since she'd realized her period was late, but shook it off and tried to tell herself that it was nothing. Two weeks ago, she started feeling exhausted and nauseous, but this time she put it down to flu. A week ago, she'd started to eat a little more and felt bloated more often, and realized she'd now missed her period for two months and that her tummy was no longer flat, and that her breasts had started to feel sensitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Haley knew what was going on, and accepted that she needed to take a test. Tears now flowed down her face as she cycled through the three options she saw: abortion, giving up the child for adoption, or keeping it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew in her heart she wouldn't be able to go through with an abortion, and could she really give up a baby after carrying it for seven more months? What made matters worse was that she and Dylan had broken up a few weeks ago, and from what she'd heard he was now dating a junior called Heather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, her stomach rumbled. For the last few days, Haley's appetite had been almost insatiable, which she put down to the pregnancy. Her hand rested on top of her small bump as she tried to think what to do next - she was thinking a buffet would be a great way to kill two birds with one stone as she could drown her sorrows for an hour or so while also satisfying her growing hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left the stall, trying to keep her head high as she went to her car and started driving to Mama's Grub Buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later, Haley lent back in the dark booth at the back of the buffet restaurant after eating almost three full plates of mac n cheese, sliders, buttered greens, and loaded fries and nachos before finishing it off with a large bowl of ice cream. While her hunger was satisfied (for now), her stomach had grown, highlighting her new situation clearly as she rubbed the softer skin. Even though she was young, Haley knew that if she kept eating like this she'd lose her enviable figure and vowed to not let herself eat like that ever again, although she knew in her heart of hearts her habits would slowly change and she wouldn't just be gaining baby weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when an idea popped into her head: she wasn't ready to tell her parents about the pregnancy just yet, so why not just wear baggier clothes and put it down to weight gain until she knew how to tell them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley stared lovingly at her small belly, thinking of the baby inside her growing, about the life they could have together...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was official - she was going to be a teen mom.</span></div></div>",

Penny made her way to her car to leave for her apartment.  Before she could drive off, she was blinded by a bright light.  The next thing she new, she was unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe awoke groggily in what appeared to be an operating room.  She was surrounded by tall, lanky figures, whom she couldn't make out.  \"Are you sure she will be able to do it?  How can we be sure that she will be able to carry them to term, and live to birth them?\", one asked.  Another responded, \"We are not entirely sure, but she is our last hope, her body is perfect for breeding our future.\"  \"Then let it be done.\"  Penny wanted to scream, but she knew that it was just a dream, so she didn't.  A large machine was retracted from the ceiling, with a needle attached to it.  The needle was injected into her lower abdomen, and she could see a green liquid come from the liquid.  After all of the liquid was injected, the machine moved back into the ceiling.  Everything went black again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny woke up peacefully in her bedroom. She looked at her clock and saw that it was almost noon, and it was Saturday. \"That was the weirdest dream last night, I gotta stop watching those Sci-Fi movies with the guys...\"  She wondered how she got home, but she figured that she was driving half asleep.  She was still in her work clothes, so she decided to get changed.  She put on her bra, and noticed that it was tighter than it usually was.  She looked down at her belly, and couldn't see where the injection was placed, so she knew that it really was a dream.  She put on a t-shirt and skinny jeans.  Penny remembered that she didn't have work today, so she wanted to go to the mall.</span></div></div>",

Leonard saw her, and wanted to ask her something.  \"Hey Penny, are you going out?\"  \"Yeah, I'm just going shopping at the mall for a couple of hours.\"  \"Oh, that's cool, that's cool.  I was wondering, me and the guys are gonna watch a new Sci-Fi movie this afternoon at three, you wouldn't want to watch it with us, would you?\"  Almost immediately, Penny responded, \"Absolutely!\"  Leonard and Sheldon were both amazed by this.  \"Really? Cool!\"  Sheldon added,\" Just remember Penny, if you are more than five minutes late to our viewing, you will receive your third and final strike, and you do not want to know what will happen if you get that strike!\"  \"I'll keep it in mind...\"  Penny left the apartment after that.  \"Well that was surprising, she wasn't as happy yesterday...\"  Sheldon responded bluntly, \"Mood swings are common when a female is PMS'ing.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the mall, Penny wanted to get some clothes.  She went into Victoria's Secret to buy some lingerie.  In the store, she bought a sports bra to wear at the gym, a regular bra, and a pair of panties.  Making her purchases, she began to feel very hungry.  She began to pat her belly in an attempt to calm it down, but it only seemed to make it worse.  She completed her purchases, and made her way to the food court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the food court, her hunger was gnawing at her, as if she hadn't eaten in a week.  She stopped at all of the restaurants in the food court, getting a little bit of everything.  Quickly finding a seat, she began to shovel food down her throat like an animal.  In mere minutes, she was finished.  Penny began to pat her belly, thinking,\"Is that enough food for you?\"  She looked down at her belly, and said,\"Ugh, I have a bit of a food baby.  Whatever, it'll go down in a little bit.\"  She heard a loud \"ping!\", and saw that her jeans button had popped off, exposing her belly.  Because of the bloat, her already small  t-shirt became smaller, exposing even more of her belly.  Embarrassed, she quickly left the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny returned to the apartment at one in the afternoon, Penny hurried into her apartment, not wanting anyone to see her slightly puffy belly.  Tired from her binge, she decided to take a nap.</span></div></div>",

She sat up a was surprised at how heavy she felt, she was even more surprised to see that her food baby had not gone away, in fact it looked and felt bigger than before. She quickly put a woollen sweater on over her shirt and then exchanged some her jeans for some sweat pants. She looked at herself in the mirror, the bulky clothes whilst making her feel even heavier and sluggish did the trick of hiding her bloated belly. She made her way across to the other's apartment as quickly as she could, not surprised to see Sheldon counting down the last few minutes on his watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny didn't really pay too much attention to the movies of the guys, and today was no different except that whilst normally she didn't pay attention to the films because she could understand them (not doing the recommended background reading suggested by Sheldon in an email sent exact six hours before the movie started) this time she didn't pay attention because she was eating. She sat with a bowl of snack food on her lap noisily shovelling food into her mouth, after the third bowl Sheldon who had been shooting warning looks at her the entire time paused the movie and said, \"could you be quiet some of us trying to watch the movie.\"<br>\r\n\"Jus... turn ...he sub..itles on,\" said Penny with her mouth full.<br>\r\n\"This is a vintage movie there isn't a subtitle option.\"<br>\r\nPenny swallowed and said, \"just switch places with me and you can sit closes to the tv.\"<br>\r\n\"And Leave My Spot!\" said Sheldon articulating that this was not an option.<br>\r\n\"Just turn the volume up,\" said Leonard.<br>\r\n\"And go deaf!?\" said Sheldon.<br>\r\n\"What?\" said Leonard as Penny poured herself her fifth drink of soda for the night.<br>\r\n\"As mammals we don't regrow the hair cells in our ears, so too much noise breaks them impairing your ability to hear, Another thing that would be different if humans were descended from lizards is the would be no hearing loss.\" At that point Penny, who had just finished her drink, gave a loud belch, Sheldon clapped his hands over his ears.<br>\r\nKnowing that it was probably best if went (that and she finished all the snack food), Penny got up said goodbye and left. After she had Sheldon said, \"good lord, the way she was eating you'd think she had been impregnated with the alien from this film.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Penny got back to her apartment she decided to have a shower, whilst getting undressed she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror, without the bulky sweater and sweat pants on she could see that her belly had gotten bigger, Penny was no expert on pregnancy (other than how not to become pregnant) but her belly definitely had that early expectant mother look to it, even her bra felt tighter. She finished getting undressed and hopped in the shower. Whilst washing herself she found her hand kept being drawn to her belly, whilst it was true that there was more belly then before, but unless she thought about her hands always start rubbing her belly. It was interesting she was half interest and half disgusted by it but as she rubbed she extremely calm and contented. As she was getting out of the shower (careful not to slip over as she had not bought some whimsical adhesive ducks) her belly gave a groan and she felt another pang of hunger, \"You can't be hungry again,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny decided to...   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Penny rubbed her swollen belly, trying to soothe it. <br>\r\n \"I'll get something to eat after I get dressed.\"  <br>\r\nHer belly's groaning subsided, but a low gurgling still emanated from within.  Still naked, she walked into her bedroom to get dressed.  She put on a bra that she bought yesterday, which she was already outgrowing, and a pair of yoga pants, meaning that her bare belly was exposed.  She made her way to the kitchen, and opened her fridge.  She saw a half-full large bottle of soda, pulled it out of the fridge, and put it on the counter. Penny also found a carton of ice cream, and grabbed that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny began to chug the soda quickly, and in a few minutes, it was empty.  She grabbed a spoon and opened the ice cream carton, she opened the fridge again and got whipped cream and chocolate syrup for the ice cream.  Penny covered the ice cream in the chocolate syrup, and began to intake spoonfuls of it, taking every few seconds to spray whipped cream in her mouth.  She could feel the food make its way into her swollen belly, which made her appear three months pregnant.  Her door burst open, and she heard someone say,\"Hey bestie!\"  It was Amy Farrah Fowler, Sheldon's equally smart \"girlfriend\".  She quickly made her way to the binging Penny, who was trying to cover up her belly with her hands, which did would not work.  <br>\r\n\"Are you alright, Penny?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I...yeah, I guess I just haven't gotten over breaking up with Leonard...\"Penny lied, taking another bite of ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was over a year ago...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but sometimes I think about it, and it makes me sad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Amy feel bad for her, so she went over to Penny and hugged her.  She had her hands in between Penny's boobs and her stomach, and her hands began to make their way upwards to her boobs.  Penny grabbed Amy's hands and pushed them down, adding,\"No thanks.\"  \"Sorry, but I'm just so jealous of your perfect figure and gorgeous blonde hair.\"  Amy got a glance at Penny's belly, and saw that it was swollen.  \"I think I might take back that perfect figure statement.\"  Penny put a hand on her belly, and said, \"Oh, this?  It's nothing, this is what happens when you eat as much ice cream as I have today...\", she said, taking eating another scoop of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy said,\"Alright, then.  I can see that you want to be left in peace, so I'll see you soon.\"  Penny got up and responded,\"Bye, Amy,\" slowly pushing her towards the door as she did so.  Penny slammed the door behind Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank God...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny rubbed her belly, saying,\"Was that enough?  God, I think I might burst...\"  Examining her belly, she knew that she had to work it off, but she knew she could always do that in the morning.  It was late, so she decided to go to sleep, hoping that she wouldn't have to go to the gym, because she had to work an all-day shift tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning....</span></div></div>",

She lumbered to her room lied down and fell asleep without bothering to get changed or get under the covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she woke up the next morning she was disappointed to see that her belly was not only still there but slightly bigger than before, furthermore her breast had grown as her bra broke undone. She sat up and tried to put it back on, \"Come on, I spent a lot of money on you, you can't just bre...\" just then one of her breast leaked out some milk. \"What's happen to me?\" she asked herself, 'maybe it was from eat all that taking chicken the other day,' she thought to herself, 'they were probably hormone fed and...' Her train of thought stopped there as she noticed the time, she had to had to get a move on if she wanted to get to work on time. She contemplated not going but she only had a few holidays left this year. She discard the bra for another, which whilst it did fit at least did up, tried to put on her uniform for the cheese cake factory, tried being the key word. The only way she could get the skirt on was not to try and get it over her 'bump' (Penny despite know that she couldn't possibly pregnant found herself referring to her belly as that),  she at least could button up her shirt but it nor the yellow vest could not cover her entire belly stopping just past her navel. Not wanting everyone to see her belly she put on a large brown coat and just left the apartment just as Leonard and Sheldon were leaving theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonard, who was locking the do looked up, \"oh hello, you wrapped up...aren't you,\" he said ending the sentence feebly.<br>\r\n\"Just feeling cold,\" said Penny.<br>\r\n\"But it's  95 degrees (35 in Celsius),\" Sheldon.<br>\r\n\"I never said it was cold, I just said 'I' was feeling cold,\" snapped Penny and used the opportunity to bustle down the stairs.<br>\r\nLeonard and Sheldon stood there for a moment until Sheldon said, \"The weird she shouldn't be acting like this for another two weeks.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Leonard going back to locking the door, \"do you really think we should have that kind of think marked out on our calendar...in the living room.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" replied Sheldon as Leonard him started down the stairs, \"what else is a calendar for if not help us organize our lives. It would help if people kept to their schedules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny got to the cheese cake factory without any trouble (other than having to move the driver's seat in her car back and make sure that the effort hadn't caused to leak expectantly), her supervisor told her take of the coat when working so people could see she was a waitress, but lucky enough was too busy to pay much attention to her and not see her belly. Lucky enough for Penny none of her friends were due in on this shift, whilst Sheldon clockwork behaviour was annoy it did make him (and most of the others) dependable, and Bernadette wasn't on until the afternoon shift. She wasn't sure if she wanted her friend to see or not, well of course she didn't want them to see her  (at least her belly) like this and she wanted her belly to return to its normal flat self. As it was she had to endure people 'congratulating' her and patting her belly, she didn't know what to say obviously (well maybe not obviously) she couldn't be pregnant but at the same time she didn't want to say she was fat. Another thing she had to endure was the hunger, she kept wanting to eat people's unfinished meals as she took them to the kitchen, but the rest of her reminded how disgusting that would be, and it probably was against employee rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the morning shift and Penny had a quick lunch break she didn't know what to do, ask for the rest of the day off (her supervisor would probably let her if she drew their attention to her belly) or continue work in the afternoon shift and face interrogation from Bernadette. Her belly gave a groan, either way she needed to get something to eat.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No one was around and she probably wouldn't have cared if there were, she was that hungry she fail to register the small 'kick' from her belly. She walked over to the bench at ate them all. There should be more to describe that, as woman eating even just one cheese cake of that size would of been amazing little lone four. I was with great speed and gusto, but not messy as Penny seemed determined to eat all them to the very last crumb. If she had been in any state contemplate she would been disgusted with herself especially after she at a tub of icing afterwards. It was all over in a few minutes, \"Oh god,\" she said placing her hands on her belly, \"now I'm really am going to burst,\" she placed a hand on her mother ran (though it was becoming more of a waddle) to the toilets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" said her manager from the door way of the employee toilets, \"take the rest of the day off, you're obviously too sick to work.\" Penny, who was on all four in front of the toilet, only was able groan before throwing up again. Her boss took this as yes and only took note of how her backside and hips were larger than usual before leaving her.<br>\r\nBetween vomiting Penny could hear raised voices, \"Where are those cheese cakes?\"...\"What do mean there gone?! How can they all be gone?\"...\"and who do you think could eat four whole cheese cakes?\"...\"For your information Penny is right now as sick as a dog, if it was only one cheese cake I would agree with you but since it's all four and Penny hasn't exploded we assume that she didn't eat the rest of today's cheese' cake by herself, now go and find them or it will be you telling the customers why there is no cheese cakes at the cheese cake factory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Penny grabbed her large coat, making sure that no one saw her or more importantly her belly, and put it on. Though even that had trouble hiding her 'bump', she looked as though she was half way through a pregnancy.

She got back to the building went inside, she hadn\u2019t thought about the stairs. As her rather obvious waddle now indicated, the strain of her unbeknownst children was making it difficult to walk as it was and she had to walk up to the fourth floor. She pressed one of the buttons for the elevator in the vain hope that, despite the \u2018Out of Order\u2019 sign, it had been fixed. There was no response so Penny made her way up the stair, the trip took much longer than usual as she had to stop and catch her breath half way up, it wasn\u2019t helping that she was also getting really hot with the large coat on. Five minutes after entering the building, Penny stumbled through the door way of her apartment. After closing the door she took of the coat, \u201coooh, that\u2019s better,\u201d she said casting it aside, \u201cI felt like I was going to cook.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went and had a shower, not surprisingly her bra had come undone at some point during the day and fell to the floor as soon as she took her shirt off, what was surprising was the fact that her navel had popped out. She viewed herself in the mirror hand on her belly, \u201cgood god, I look like I\u2019m frickin pregnant,\u201d she said in regards to her body in general but mostly her belly which was approaching the six months mark. She finished getting undressed and hopped in the shower, as with last night, her hands kept absentmindedly rubbing her belly, and despite all the problems it was causing, rubbing her belly made her feel extremely relaxed. She stood there for nearly half an hour rubbing her swollen belly until a kick from inside it broke her reverie. The nearly caused her to fall over, she hurriedly turn off the water and hopped out of the shower and looked pointedly at her belly. Other than sticking out much further than normal it didn\u2019t seem odd. \u201cYou\u2019re imaging things,\u201d she said patting her belly, \u201cjust because you look pregnant doesn\u2019t mean you are pregnant.\u201d She put on the sports bra and a matching set of panties, she put on pair of short denim shorts which she did up under her \u2018bump\u2019 after having trouble getting them over her hips and backside and a pink singlet that nothing to cover the majority of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made her out into the living area, \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d she asked herself. Her belly as though in response gave a groan, \u201cwhat?! I ate enough for twenty people today I can\u2019t be hungry,\u201d another groan from her belly and a pang of hunger from her belly told her otherwise. She made her way to the kitchen and looked for something to eat, unfortunately her action yesterday had meant not only did she not go shopping for groceries but she also ate pretty much all the food in her place. All that was left was some cheese with mould on it, some iffy milk and half a box of cereal. She had the cereal (without milk or the cheese for that matter) in the hope it would make the hunger go away. It didn\u2019t in fact it so how made her hungrier, \u201cuuuuuhhh, how I still be hungry,\u201d just then her eye caught sight of the spare key to Sheldon\u2019s and Leonard\u2019s apartment, surely they wouldn\u2019t mind if she had some food\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She gave a belch and made her way to the door clutching her belly which looked like it was at eight months and waddled much more sluggishly to the door, she only got half way as unused to her new weight and was rather tired and stumbled back into a wall, she slid down it until she lay on her back in the middle of the floor.</span></div></div>",

As in response the children inside Penny began to thrash as kick wildly, Penny wanted to scream but she seemed unable to, the last thing she heard before blacking out was, \u201ccan you believe that in a few days she will give births to sixteen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny then jolted awake, she was lying on the hospital bed, the memory of the room and the lanky things evaporating from her mind like it was a dream. She looked around to see the other all passed out in chairs or against the wall, \u201cWhat happen?\u201d said Penny. Just then Stephanie\u2019s eyes fluttered open and she groggily said the same thing. Soon Bernadette woke up with the same confusion and finally Amy who without opening her eyes blearily said \u201cOh, Sheldon I love it when you touch me that way.\u201d<br>\r\nThey all then looked at each other, none of them wanting to be the first to say something until\u2026</span></div></div>",

Bernadette drove, as she was the smallest of the group, but not by much.  Penny got the passenger seat to accommodate for her baby-filled belly, while Amy was behind Bernadette and Stephanie was behind Penny.  The pizzas were between Stephanie and Amy, and all four girls were digging in.  Penny was forced to move her seat back to give her pregnant belly some room.  \"Penny, I'm sorry, but can I have <b>some</b> leg room?\" Stephanie said, annoyed.  \"Sorry, but you aren't pregnant with 10 babies, cut me some slack, I'm as big as a house!\" she replied.  Stephanie couldn't argue with that reasoning, so they remained silent, eating until Amy cut in.  \"Penny, you're check engine light is on, you should really get that checked out!\"  \"Tell me about it\" Penny replied dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at the mall, with their hunger quelled for the time being.  Their top priority was getting things that Penny and her babies needed.  First, they bought two large cribs, baby clothes, and toys that they could play with.  Next, they went to get clothes that would at least partially cover Penny's belly.  The maternity store was filled with girls close to Penny's size, but none were bigger.  She bought a few pairs of maternity jeans.  She tried on the loosest shirts that they had, but she had a good feeling that they wouldn't fit her later in her pregnancy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls approached the desk to check out their purchases.  The cashier, a woman in her late 40s, eyed Penny suspiciously.  \"You're buying maternity clothes this late in your pregnancy?  That's a bit different, you must be near full term!\"  \"Actually I don't know when I'm due...I'm not having one baby, either...\" Penny said.  \"So you're having twins, then?  Still, you must be pretty far along...\" the cashier said.  Penny sighed as her babies kicked, rubbing her belly.  \"I'm actually having ten, at least...\" she said.  The cashier's jaw dropped.  \"Ten?!?!  Wow....Congratulations, I guess...\"  \"Thank you!\" Penny smiled, turning to leave the shop.  <i>I wonder why the other pregnant women with her didn't buy anything...</i> the cashier thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn unison, the four women's bellies groaned for food.  They made their way to the food court, where they ate more than before.  When all was said and done, Amy, Bernadette, and Stephanie appeared five months pregnant, their swollen bellies peeking out from beneath their shirts.  \"Ugh, I can feel this food moving around in there\" Bernadette said, rubbing her belly.  Amy and Stephanie agreed.  \"Your stomach is just trying to digest it, we've had a lot to eat today, so it's not a surprise that we're so bloated.\" Stephanie said.  A loud burp escaped Penny's mouth, who looked pregnant with twins.  After their latest feast, they left the mall to return to Penny's apartment.</span></div></div>",

The woman serving the food shook her head, whilst trying to peer around Kripkye. \u201cWhat about some Cawamawi?\u201d again the woman shook her head. It was at that point that Kripkye noticed that nearly all the food in the serving display heater was gone, he then noticed that nearly everyone in the dining hall was looking at the same thing. <br>\r\nHe turned to see Alex sitting at a table by herself, shovelling food into her mouth like there was no tomorrow. The table was covered in plate most now bereft of food, Kripkye tapped the man next to him professor Goldfarb, \u201cWhat going on with her?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, she has been eating since I got here.\u201d<br>\r\nProfessor Finkleday, who was sitting a nearby table with a now forgotten cup of coffee said, \u201cShe came in about an hour ago and just started ordering food, her shirt fitted at that point.\u201d Barry then looked and saw the button up shirt Alex was wearing now stretched over a belly that looked like it should belong to a woman five months pregnant, flesh could be seen between the gaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKripkye stood with the rest of them and watch Alex finish off the last of the food she had in front of her, she leaned back and gave a loud belch, there was a couple of pings as the lower buttons of her shirt flew off. Whilst they convince themselves that it was because that it was now free from its confines, but to the watching onlookers it seemed as though Alex\u2019s belly was visibly growing to the stage where she looked full term. Everyone continued to watch, in complete silence, as Alex got up (after a few attempts) and waddled out of the dining hall, her belly groaning and bubbling and her now also larger rear swaying hypnotically as her pants stretched to contain it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence continued for a moment after she left before Kripkye said, \u201cScwew this and heading off.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cScrew what?\u201d asked Goldfarb.<br>\r\n\u201cIf I wanted to see wadies taking their cwothes off, I would go to the stwip cwub near my pwace, at weast they have a fwee buffet there, and the girls don\u2019t wook wike they have a watermewon growing in them.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her belly had grown again, looking pregnant with triplets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, boy.\"she said, running her hand over her large belly, feeling more kicking.  Penny realized that she had to work at the Cheesecake Factory today.  She attempted to rise from her bed, but it was a struggle.  After a few attempts, she heaved herself from the bed.  Penny removed the clothes she wore yesterday, and went to take a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike before, rubbing her belly was felt very good to her, and her many babies kicked strongly inside.  Stepping out of the shower, Penny decided to get dressed.  She put on a pair of panties and one of the larger bras, but it was the uniform that would be difficult.  She was just barely able to put the skirt on.  Penny tried to put the blouse on, but only the middle buttons would do, leaving an ample amount of cleavage and a bared belly.  The yellow over-shirt would only go past her breasts, and the top of her belly.  \"Well, kids, time to go to work.\" she said, rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie was at her home, getting ready for work at the hospital.  This was difficult, because her belly was larger-much larger.  She appeared nearly eight months pregnant.  \"Come on, come on!\" she said, trying to button her pants.  \"Ah, screw it, I'm wearing sweatpants today!\"she said.  After putting on the sweatpants, she put on a t-shirt, which showed off the bottom half of her belly--popped-out navel and all.  Grabbing her doctor's coat, she waddled to the door to leave.  Then she felt it--a flurry of strong *THUMP*s coming from inside her belly.  \"Uh-oh.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy Farrah Fowler was in her apartment, looking at her large eight months-sized belly in the mirror.  \"Please just be pseudocyesis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoward was washing up in the bathroom while his wife was stirring in bed.  \"Howie?\"she asked.  \"Yeah Bernie?\"  \"Could you come here?\"  Howard walked back to the bedroom.  \"Oh my god Bernadette!\"he yelled.  He saw her belly, which was the same size as Stephanie's and Amy's.  But she looked the largest of the three, because the rest of her was so small.  \"I--I think I feel something moving in there!\"she said, running a hand over her belly.  Howard placed a hand to her stomach.  \"Ok, babe, I'm taking you to the hospital!\"he said.  He grabbed his turtleneck and left the house, Bernadette waddling behind, a hand on her belly for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way to the hospital, Bernadette's cellphone started to ring.  \"Hello?  Oh hi, Amy--what?  It's happening to you, too?  Ok, we'll be right there.\" she said, hanging up the phone.  They pulled up to Amy's apartment building, and saw her waddling out of the main door, her belly visibly sticking out from her usually large sweater.  As Amy heaved herself into the car, they pulled off.  \"So, you too, huh?\" Bernadette asked.  \"It looks like it.  Stephanie will be meeting us there, and she'll take us into a private room to get examined.  She's grown, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoward pulled out his cellphone and called Leonard and Sheldon's number.  It was Leonard who picked up.  \"Hey, Howard.  Where are you, we're supposed to be watching the Doctor Who marathon.\" he said.  \"Something's come up.  Meet me at the hospital, bring Raj and Sheldon along too.\"  \"Why?\" Leonard asked.  \"Just do it.  Your question will be answered once you see.\"  \"See what?  Alright, fine.  We're leaving now.\" he said, hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the hospital, Howard helped Amy and Bernadette out of the car.  Once they got in the hospital, they were greeted by Stephanie, her doctor's coat straining from her belly.  \"Hey, guys.  It'll be just a few more minutes and then we can go in.\"  As the girls were too big to fit in the seats, they stood in the waiting room, rubbing their bellies as whatever was inside continued to move around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He stared at the vision greeted him, of course he had heard that Alex Jensen had eaten a lot of food and now her belly was rather stuffed, in fact that was the reason he had came around to ascertain what had happen, he had brought some papers for Sheldon to sign but they had been more of an excuse. He could know see that the stories about Alex had been an understatement. The final few buttons done up on Alex\u2019s shirt were fighting to contain her enlarged breasts, the rest of the buttons had lost against her immense belly which stuck out like a watermelon had grown inside her, whilst her hips and backside had also grown noticeably.<br>\r\nShe looked up from the desk from which she had been leaning over, \u201cOh doctor Gablehauser,\u201d she said straighten up her hands moving to the small of her back to help her compensate with her current weight, \u201cis there anything I can help you with?\u201d<br>\r\nIt took Dr Gablehauser a couple of seconds to find his tongue, \u201cuh yes, I\u2019ve got some papers for Dr Cooper to sign.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDr Cooper isn\u2019t in today\u201d said Alex \u201cwhich is why he made me come to work today,\u201d she added bitterly.<br>\r\n\u201cIn your condition?\u201d asked Gablehauser, \u201che\u2019s always been a bit out of touch like that,\u201d he tried not to look around at the multitude snack food packets around the office it appeared she must of emptied every vending machine on this floor, \u201cyou can go home, or to the hospital if you prefer,\u201d he said flusteredly.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll think I just go home until, the bloating goes away,\u201d said Alex absentmindedly rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n\u201cBloating?! \u2026fine whatever you want,\u201d said Dr Gablehauser who didn\u2019t find it comfortable being in the vicinity of a woman who ballooned up to be ready to pop with twins overnight, he edged his way over to the door, \u201cand if doctor Cooper has any problems just tell him to talk to me.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I mean, Bernadette I could understand, because she actually has a partner who gives affection to her, but it makes no sense!  And with eight babies each?\" Amy asked, rubbing the bare skin that poked out from the bottom of her sweater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  But it's just not right.\" Bernadette said, trying to avoid her pregnancy as much as possible.  A few minutes later, they arrived at the Cheesecake Factory, and waddled inside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo their surprise, Penny was working, and was much bigger than when they last saw her.  She appeared to be nearing the size of a woman who was near term with quadruplets, and her massive belly was on full display, as her work shirt did nothing cover it.  She was sweating heavily, as being a waitress while pregnant with sixteen alien babies is quite the workload.  Penny did not notice the girls walk in, and they sat themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were just able to squeeze into a booth, as their bellies were pressed against the table.  Penny waddled over, about to take their orders.  Her eyes grew wide as she saw the bellies on Amy, Bernadette, and Stephanie.  \"What...what happened to you all?\" she asked, her eyes as wide as her belly.  \"We're...pregnant.  With eight babies.  Each.\" Bernadette said.  \"Pregnant?  Eight babies?  What is going on?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the girls searched for an answer, they stared at Penny's monstrous belly.  Jabs and kicks were clearly visible against her skin.  \"I don't know, but I think that something's up.  Especially with you, Penny.  You're pregnant with over ten babies, and you look bigger than a house and you've been growing bigger and bigger by the day.  How long will it be until you give birth?\" Stephanie asked, feeling her own large bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!  This is the first time I've been pregnant after all!\" Penny replied.  \"Tell you what.  I'll take you to the hospital tomorrow to get another ultrasound, and maybe we'll pinpoint exactly how many babies you're having, and how far along you are.\" Stephanie quipped.  \"Maybe Bernadette and I should join you, after all, our pregnancies are probably similar.\" Amy said.  They decided that this would be the plan.  \"Now, may I take your order?\" Penny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly an hour of eating their makeshift feast, the three girls were stuffed to the brim, and their bellies were larger, looking full term with a single baby, possibly overdue.  The girls agreed to meet up at Penny's apartment, where they would reveal their pregnancies to the guys.  They waddled out of the restaurant, and headed to the apartment building, preparing to reveal their pregnancies.</span></div></div>",

She has been peeing the whole day or then going off to eat at what little of food is left in her apartment. She finally finished using the bathroom once again and she looks at a mirror and sees some buttons on her shirt are loose, mostly around her belly. She takes off the shirt and sees that the belly has a round shape to it. She soon starts to rub it almost instinctively, not having thought it at all. She notices that it feels like a drum, almost making her think she is pregnant, but she hasn't done it recently. There was a groan from her stomach and just went to the kitchen and found nothing left but some jello, half carton of eggs, bread, and some soda. She takes all of this and eats all of it in half of an hour.<br>\r\nAs she finishes, she gets a phone call. It's her boss, Dr. Cooper, she answers with a muffled hello and he yells, \"Ms. Jensen! I gave to you specific orders to not take a sick day! I realize that Gablehauser gave you permission, but I need to speak with you right away! I am currently at the Fremont Memorial Hospital and would like to have a word with you!\" Alex hangs up and has to deal with her weird boss now. She gets herself a more comfortable shirt that barely hides her belly. She heads to her car and finds the seat needs to be back up some.<br>\r\n\"Why did you have to bring her here!?\" Leonard asks Sheldon with the others agreeing. \"I just want to give her a punishment for disobeying me. I was thinking of squirting water in her face.\" Sheldon answers. \"Alright, but you do realize that there are four women, including my wife, have suddenly become massively pregnant with who-knows-how-many babies!?\" Howard says.<br>\r\nAlex soon comes to the hospital and finds Sheldon, Leonard, Howard, and Raj. They are all shocked by the appearance of Alex with Raj just covering his mouth. Sheldon yells, \"Good Lord! Is this happening to everyone!?\" Alex is confused and then taken into the nearby room and sees four massively pregnant women. She recognizes two of them: Penny and Amy. She sees one of the women is wearing a resident coat of the building. She takes Alex over to one of the tables and introduces herself as Stephanie. She then gets Alex an ultrasound which confirms that she is pregnant with at least ten, just like Penny. Alex is shocked by this and just screams. The guys leave the room very awkwardly.<br>\r\nLeonard then looks to the guys and says, \"OK, we need some more information on what's going on. Sheldon, you try and find some more information at the university while Raj will go to the mall the girls have been frequently going to and Howard will stay and try and make the girls feel better.

He goes over and says hi to her. Her immediate response is, \"Are you drunk already?\" He then explains everything that has happened since she made him into a dating wreck. They then get to catching up while she tells him about the four pregnant women who basically stripped the mall of clothes and food. Raj then says that he has to find out all of this crazy information because of the four pregnant women. Raj then says, \"Actually, those women weren't pregnant a week ago... It's almost as if they were abducted by aliens...\" Lucy notices that he started to trail off and Raj gets on his phone to call Howard. \"Howard, it's me! I think I might know what is happening...Can you hand the phone to Alex?\" Raj waits a second but all he can hear is just screaming. So he mutes the phone and has a great day with Lucy.<br>\r\n\"No, no, No, NO, NO, NO!

Whether it was a planet, a moon, or rock, it didn't matter. Secrecy was important at this time, it didn't need the inhabitants of \"Earth\" to learn of their plan right away. Inside of the ship, are thousands of aliens. The aliens are 2 meters tall, digititrade legs, scaly blue skin, but yet very thin. They are dressed like the knights of a king, awaiting orders for war. At a part of a ship, four of these beings are in conversation with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne is dressed in white robes and has several mechanical limbs attached to his back, this is Kabak, the leader of the Guild of the Smiths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother is a woman, you can tell from the shorter stature and the fact her skin is less scaly. She is dressed like the nomads of ancient times, carrying a staff in hand. This is Ravorzhazun, leader of the Shadow Walkers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next is a being of dark and blood red armor, his glowing red eyes the only visible aspect of his body, which produces a red mist. This is Alvanax, leader of the Forged Ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last is a man wearing thick armor, making him look more muscular than his brethren. But what is unique is the crown on his head. It is made up of two parts, the bottom part resting on his head, like a true crown. But the top part floats above him in shards, making a new image every time he moves his head. This is Tassartadaris, leader of these people: The Daeloss, children of the stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlvanax asks in his dark ways that make everyone believe he is a villain, \"Must we waste time with creating an army like this? I understand that the dark one must be defeated, but this is a waste of time. Let me take a fleet of the Forged Ones and I will personally slit his throat!\" Ravorzhazun hisses, \"Learn your place before the Leader, Alvanax. My people and your People might have just been reaccepted into society, but that does not give to us the right to let hubris guide our ways!\" Tassartadaris yells, \"<b>Enough!</b> Kabak,finish your explanation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKabak clears his throat, \"As I was saying, if we are to defeat the Dark One, we will need an army. But we need an army larger than the one we had before.\" Ravorzhazun asks, \"You want us to find an army with more than 3 trillion soldiers? May I ask how we will do that when the maximum population our civilizations had at its highest was 1 trillion. And why must we bother with these 'Earthlings?' They only 7 billion lifeforms on the planet, and have yet to colonize another world.\" Kabak tells her, \"There is an answer to all of that. Earthlings and Daeloss are able to reproduce with each other. We may have lost the drive to reproduce naturally long ago, but we are able to artificially inseminate their females with our young and start producing warriors at a fast rate. And once we have enough, we will...Forgive me if this doesn't sound right, Uplift them to become an advanced civilization as powerful as our own and let them join us with my prediction of 7 trillion warriors. My lord, what do you believe we should do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>What do you answer?</u></span></div></div>",

She had to work the late shift, but was finally heading home to Sheldon and Leonard. But suddenly, she was stung by an odd bee, which secretly infected her with a new disease that made women pregnant with multiple hybrid children. She got back to the apartment very quickly and got to sleep. When she was changing into her pajamas, she absently noted her breasts felt different. When she awoke, she knew that it was a day off and spent the day shopping. She went over to Leonard and Sheldon\u2019s apartment real quickly and said, \u201cHey, Leonard, Sheldon, I\u2019m heading over to the mall for a few hours, I\u2019ll be back in a little bit.\u201d Leonard asked his new wife, \u201cAlright.

Here, she unknowingly starts infecting the random women that walk through the mall. Anyway, she walked about, buy whatever clothes and beauty products she could think of, till suddenly she got hungry. She went to the food court and bought from both an asian restaurant and a mexican restaurant. She quickly began to eat the food, almost like she hadn\u2019t eaten in days. After that moment of embarassment, she left the mall. She returned to her apartment, hoping none of her friends came over to hang out.</span></div></div>",

So she slept till one o\u2019clock, and the guys had already headed out to watch a movie, or headed to the comic book store. Penny\u2019s stomach had groaned for food. Penny realized that she has not a lot of food and she knows Sheldon is uptight about food, so she heads to any place with a drive thru and serves breakfast. She takes a quick shower and gets dressed in clothes that cover her belly, which now makes her look 5 months pregnant. She goes to several places and gets one of everything. She\u2019s glad the job Bernadette got her pays well. She quickly made it back to her apartment, absently snacking on some of the food on the way back, and finishes the rest in her apartment. She went over to the fridge and got a gallon of milk and started to drink from the jug. Penny got a knock on the door as she almost finishes, and finds that her stomach has gotten bigger and more noticeable. She gets a bath robe and answers the door to Bernadette.

Would you look at that.\" Bernadette looks up and sees a green light that from where they are looks much larger than any other light in the sky. Bernadette asks, \"What is it, Howie?\" Howard shrugs, \"I have no idea. Raj never said anything about an astrological anomoly when we were at the apartment, or when we went biking in the park, or when he took me to medy pedy.\" Bernadette looks at him in a disturbed way. Howard gets defensive, \"What?\" Bernadette shakes her head, \"I think Raj needs to go on more dates.\" The two shrug and return to their home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh up in the sky, just above the atmosphere of the planet, a meteor was expelling green gas when it enters the atmosphere, burning up on entry and becoming nothing. But the green gas expelled earlier falls to the Earth and lands on the Earth unscathed. The gas mostly lands outside of Pasadena, and onto a farm just outside the city. The vegetables grown in the farm is exposed the gas, and starts to grow green. Suddenly, they start to swell and become deformed, before bursting, revealing small green spiders escaping the farm. They crawl to the barn, where a man and woman are tending to a truck. While the spiders stay out of the light, waiting for them to make their move. Eventually, the truck's engines rev to life, indicating for the spiders it was time to strike. They jumped at the man and woman and when they bite into them, their bodies withered away as what they really are was just inserted into the man and woman. Eventually, the man and woman stopped screaming, writhing in pain, and eventually bore blank expressions. The two got into the truck and drove off for Pasadena.</span></div></div>",

This only bothered Clara in that sometimes she'd just like for something to be uneventful.  Not all things, not even most things, but every one in a while she'd like to not start the day on vacation and then end it running from some sort of artificial alien life form meant to protect crystal alien caves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, <i>I</i> thought they were here to keep us out, so of course we snuck in!  I mean, what else am I going to do?  But it turns out they're actually here to keep us <i>in</i>!\" the Doctor was turning behind him as he ran, constantly looking down the shiny walls of the cave to see that the beast, while lumbering, was not exactly slow.  Clara panted, right behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't say?\" she said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had entered through some cracks they found around the mountain, out of view from the entrance.  The mountain looked like mundane stone from the outside, but inside the walls were lined with alternating smooth and jagged crystals.  They were shifting and growing, too, almost alive.  That's what the Doctor was looking for.  He wanted to see how a mountain could be alive on a planet were all natural life aside from some grasses and moss died out long ago.  This planet had been known for its genetic engineering and artificial life, and legend had it that that was their eventual undoing.  They just engineered themselves out of existence, leaving on ruins and, apparently, these guardian beasts behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It didn't start chasing us until we tried to run past it!\" Clara said, implicitly blaming the Doctor for suggesting they make a mad dash for the entrance when their secret door proved too high up to get back out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't make a mad dash, you made a mad dash!  I specifically said to walk briskly, not run!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA roar that sounded almost musical echoed from the beast as it turned a corner and they caught side of it again.  They were coming to a widening up ahead, with several paths.  They almost ran off those paths, finding them to be steep descents into further caves, these less well lit than those they had been fleeing through.  They had to stop.  The Doctor looked left, right, clearly preparing to jump down one and skid to safety.  He took Clara's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it, now!\" he advised, but as they were about to jump-Clara hadn't even given the unspoken plan a second thought-he stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Clara asked, spinning around half expecting the creature to be on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had stopped when they stopped.  It's blank, eyeless face aimed towards them.  It gave a very strange-sounding low growl that didn't exactly sound threatening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" the Doctor let go of Clara's hand, nudging her behind himself.  He took a few steps.  The creature hummed, moving backwards clumsily.  He took another step.  The creature did the same.  Then he sprinted forward, just a few feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast bellowed and lunged forward.  It had made it halfway towards them by the time the Doctor was holding up his arms and stopped moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it doesn't like running it's not going to like you,\" Clara said, understanding what was happening but not comprehending its significance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It definitely doesn't like us moving fast, let's see . . . \" the Doctor strolled back and forth along the edge.  The creature watched them, making some humming sounds.  To Clara they almost sounded like a deep purring.  The Doctor started slowly walking towards the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor shushed her.  As he slowly got closer, the creature started to turn, shaking the caves as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up, hold up,\" the Doctor said, careful not to move too fast.  It was too late.  The massive creature was already leaving.  As a test, the Doctor jogged a few feet.  The creature stopped and turned towards them, but sensing no further horseplay, walked away, its casual gate too fast for the Doctor and Clara to catch up with it without it chasing them down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, it was out of sight, although the could hear its footsteps for a good while after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only all aliens were that sensible,\" Clara smiled at the Doctor, \"As long as you're not running at it or away from it it knows you must not be up to any mischief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, does it it now?\" the Doctor smiled back, turning to the paths before them.  \"Now then!  Let's go explore us a cave.\"</span></div></div>",

As they walked, the crystals lighting the way became more uniform, looking more and more like traditional lighting.  Clara tapped one, noting that it was cold to the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this then?\" the Doctor said as Clara turned back.  He took a few quick paces ahead as the cave-now really more of a hallway-opened up to a large, smooth-floored cavern.  The Doctor looked around in awe.  The were machines lining the walls, wiring and pipes built into the walls.  The whole place was carved to look more like a room than the rest of the caves, complete with a flat ceiling canvassed with metal support beams.  Clara couldn't help but smile at the Doctor's enthusiasm.  He burst into the center of the room, doing a little spinning dance thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't see this every day, Clara!\" he said.  Considering the stuff she had seen with him, that he was that impressed must mean something.  \"Perfectly preserved lost technology of a long dead race!  I know, I know, I ride around in one of those, but this is different.  These are people who had almost no connection with mine, or any other major technological civilization of the last million years.  This,\" he spread his arms, \"is high technology in almost perfect isolation, almost perfectly preserved!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced around, not knowing where to go first.  \"Maybe completely perfectly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara wasn't quite as impressed as the Doctor.  She saw what looked to be sleek, alien technology, but nothing more fantastic than what she had seen before on her travels with the Doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks pretty normal, from what I can tell,\" Clara said, egging him on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normal?  Normal?  Is-is that normal?\" he rushed towards what looked like a giant lamp with a ring of pitch-black beads held above it by stiff, thin wires.  \"I mean?  Really?  Is it normal?  I don't even know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat actually did impress Clara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do we look at first?\" she asked, looking around, but the Doctor was already examining another equally baffling device.  Clara saw towards the center of the room and to the side what looked like a padded dentist chair.  She might assume what that might be for.  On the other end was a large, blank screen, with a thick cord coming out of the back and leading to a box with innumerable switches and a small, blinking screen.  That, too, caught her eye.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She heard the Doctor excitedly talking to himself from across the massive room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll bet this device fixes broken bones!  I forgot these people even had bones!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara wandered over the screen device.  It was against the wall away from other machines, with a few comfortable looking chairs nearby.  The controls on the box gave nothing away.  Only a few of them were even marked with anything that looked like letters.  Clara assumed they must symbols rather than words, otherwise that TARDIS would translate them for her, wouldn't it?  She didn't touch anything, however.  She near enough to know that would cause nothing but trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout ten feet from the screen at the center was a square on the floor.  She bent down to look at it.  It was a slightly raised block of metal built into the floor, probably with wires underneath heading to the screen.  She stood up and looked towards the screen.  She could see now that it wasn't completely black.  There was a fluid, almost liquid texture to the surface.  She was about to step forward to feel it when she stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr rather, Clara found she couldn't step forward at all.  She was standing on the block, her feet spread out more than usual for simply standing, and was stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, Doctoooor . . . \"she started to say but then looked to the screen.  It flicked, then turned on, as far as she could tell.  It still looked black, but that liquid sensation underneath started to flow and swirl.  She couldn't move, or speak, or even turn away.  Her eyes were dead set on the screen.  She started to worry now, staring wide-eyed and open-mouthed as those swirls took on an extra dimension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor . . .\" she tried to yell but it only came out as a whisper.  Her whole body tingled.  She could feel something going through her, like the screen was transmitting information into her brain and body, analyzing it, and then trying again.  Whatever this medical machine was doing she got the impression it didn't know how to do what it was supposed to do on humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a thought was forced into her head, so hard her ears rang and her breath was knocked out of her.  Her hands moved to her middle as though they were moving through thick mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Pregnant</i> the thought was, coming as an impression rather than a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waa-wwaait . . \" Clara forced out, still in a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething deep inside her turned.  Under her hands she felt her stomach tighten and convulse.  Her breathing quickened as panic set in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Pregnant</i> the impression came again, but it felt unsure now.  Clara wasn't though.  She knew what this machine was doing and would have give anything to have been able to run.  But she couldn't run.  She couldn't even look away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Preparation</i> the impression was almost like a question, like it was asking her what a human body needed to be pregnant.  Clara didn't want to give it any response, and she didn't, at least knowingly.  But it pulled information from her brain in no subtle or systematic manner, leaving her feeling dazed and light headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands were still on her rolling stomach as she felt the top of her dress grow tight.  Her breasts had swelled, she wasn't sure how much.  It couldn't have been too much as her bra was still firmly in place, but any kind of sudden bodily transformation was too much as far as she was concerned.  She managed to get out a quiet squeal of surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Preparation</i> came again, and then <i>Pregnant</i> began repeating in her brain until she could almost hear the word drowning out her thoughts.  She felt her dress grow tight around her hips as her hips widened.  Like her breasts, it couldn't have been a lot, but it was still too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the machine drumming into her brain, she heard a growling, sloshing sound from her middle.  She felt something bump out of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooof, ooh,\" she moaned, bending over but being forced back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor!\" she said, louder than before, the panic becoming too much even for the machine to completely quiet her.  A warmth, and then a great pressure filled her stomach.  Clara moaned, feeling her flat stomach press out into her hands in fits and starts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do-doooctor!\" she said again, this time in her normal speaking voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything in her stomach seemed to roll around again, and it pressed out again, straining her dress.  She couldn't look down but could already tell that she now had a pregnant bump, round, firm, and unmistakable.  Her breasts tinged again, growing tighter in her bra, feeling tender and sore, but what was happening inside her belly was still her greater concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Baaawooooomp</i> came a sound from her stomach as the heaviness intensified.  Her back arched.  Clara gasped, tried to spread her feet further to steady herself.  Something like <i>first trimester</i> passed through her brain, but it was fuzzy, and she was quickly beyond rational thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor, come here right now!\" Clara finally screamed.  She could hear him running, yelling \"Clara!\", but it sounded far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\" the Doctor asked, looking in awe over her as he darted past her to the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed, Clara forced out, \"I didn't do anything, just stop it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay okay,\" the Doctor waved around the machine, trying to find something he could use, glancing back at his companion's swollen form with worry and even fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Clara, we'll fix this!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara felt the fullness inside her grow heavier.  Her hips were starting to feel strained under the weight.  No wonder the machine widened them for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry!  It's growing too muc-oooaaaaah, just stop it!\" Clara screamed.  She as gripping her stomach as another surge swelled it out at least as far as her breasts.  It was little consolation that the Doctor was panicking nearly as much as her.  He was speaking to himself quickly now, but Clara couldn't make it out, just the peripheral images of him jumping around the machine, waving his sonic screwdriver over parts of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he didn't do something soon, Clara thought, she'd either explode or give birth to . . . she didn't even want to finish the thought.</span></div></div>",

It seemed the machine was only allowing her to spread her feet to stay standing, and to slowly move her hands down to her stomach.  It was out far enough now that she could grasp its sides, feeling the tightness and the awkward, jolting movements inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay calm, Clara, I'll fix this!\" the Doctor said in a tone that did not calm Clara down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had seen a lot of technology, and so part of what was going on was familiar.  He could see that it was making Clara pregnant, but he wasn't certain that this machine was entirely designed to only impregnate.  And if it was, it would only be for this species.  So it needed other data.  He was able to detect that there was a feedback loop going on between the machine, Clara's brain, and the rest of her body.  It was finding out what pregnancy was for a human, and then implementing it.  But how well, he had no idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Bawoooooomp!</i> The sound, low and deep, came from Clara's stomach.  She gagged and thrust her head forward as her hips widened yet again.  Her dress strained, the seams nearly ready to tear from both her stomach and hips now.  Clara could feel it telling her, in its own way, to arch her back and jut her stomach forward, but she resisted.  It didn't help, her stomach bulged outward in spurts despite her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to me?\" she forced out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst things first, the Doctor thought.  First, he interrupted the mental feedback loop the machine was employing to gather what pregnancy was.  Clara's eyes focused, and her breathing quickened.  For the moment, she had control back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, what is this?\" she said quietly, finally able to look down at her stomach.  It was huge, maybe halfway to full term.  She whimpered as she twisted to see her hips.  On her otherwise still tiny figure they looked unnatural.  Something lurched inside her and she doubled forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Clara, I have this!\" the Doctor reassured her.  He restarted the loop, causing Clara's eyes to go blank, her movements to cease again.  She wasn't sure this was for the best.  The Doctor fed, the best he could, the reverse of the signal that he just interrupted.  The effects were instant.  A squirming, churning sound came from Clara's belly.  She opened her mouth in a long, low moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clara?  Clara, how does it feel?\" the Doctor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara rolled her eyes at him.  Her stomach was retreating.  She could feel it forcing itself back into its normal, flat self.  Her hips, too, in two jarring motions, shrunk back to their normal size as well.  Finally, the pressure in her bra eased as her breasts shrunk.  The Doctor, determining that the process was complete, aimed his screwdriver at the machine and shut it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara stood for a moment, and then sunk down to the floor, her arms wrapped around her stomach.  The Doctor rushed to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clara, how do you feel?  Are you okay?\" he started to poke at her stomach, and Clara slapped him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter shaking for a few minutes, Clara's whole body calmed down.  In fact, she fond it hard to believe anything had just happened.  She kept rubbing her stomach, though, as if to make sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like everything is back to normal,\" the Doctor said scanning her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I . . . I guess I <i>feel</i> normal,\" Clara got to her feet.  She was already feeling completely fine.  The only evidence that anything had happened were that the seams on the side of her dress were one quick tear away from coming undone.  \"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That,\" the Doctor said, placing his hands on her shoulder to move her further from the machine.  \"is some of that ancient medical technology I was talking about.  Why did you turn it on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara smacked him, half playfully, \"I didn't turn it on, it captured me!  And then . . I don't know-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever else it does this machine was used to impregnate the race.  I imagine it tried to do so with you, but didn't quite know how humans work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't want to talk about this right now, Doctor,\" she said.  \"Can we get out of here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right,\" the Doctor said.  \"Let's slip past the guard monster.  I'm sure we can outrun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can try, because I am not spending another minute in this place,\" Clara shuddered, feeling her stomach again to make sure it was still flat.</span></div></div>",

The whole way towards the entrance he kept asking how she was feeling, if anything didn't feel normal, and eventually Clara snapped at him.  Snapped sweetly, but still snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor, listen to me.  I know it sounds strange, but I feel completely normal.  I don't know if I ever felt anything that horrible, but now, it's like it never happened,\" then she added, \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well, that's all good then,\" the Doctor nodded, but still obviously intended to watch her closely.  While he hadn't said why or if it was normal of him with his companions, but he always acted so jittery whenever any kind of harm came close to Clara.  Clara took it for concern for a friend he was putting in danger, and yet there seemed to be something more there.  She had gotten the impression he knew something, maybe something she should know too, but was never able to press the issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Clara said.  They had come to one of the actual exits of the cave, not the hidden crevice they had sneaked in through.  Two of the massive beasts lay in wait.  But as they walked towards them, they both turned their backs to them and went into alcoves along the entrance.  They went into sitting positions, then all but shut down.  Cautiously, the Doctor and Clara approached.  No movement.  They walked directly between them.  Nothing at all.  They exited the cave unmolested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a relief,\" the Doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding,\" Clara said.  \"Doctor, what was that machine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor hesitated to answer, knowing Clara was still unnerved by having her body forcibly twisted against her will and something temporarily implanted in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it was just a machine ti induce pregnancy,\" he said, \"I didn't have a lot of time to study it, but I think it was an all-purpose medical bay.  I think that if you showed it somebody with an issue, it could fix it.  Broken bone?  Healed!  Cancer? Not anymore!  I think it just has to be programmed beforehand.  As far as I can tell the last time it was used some thousands of years ago it would have been to impregnate someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, if they have a machine like that, that can do anything, why have all that other equipment but only one of them?  Wouldn't that replace all other medicine on the planet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were making their way around the mountain to the TARDIS.  It was a difficult hike but not a long one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Clara, there's a lot nobody knows about these people.  If I had to guess, and my guesses are rarely too far off as you know, I'd say that particular machine had some . . . bugs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it did,\" Clara said, briefly flashing back to that first moment of panic as she felt her body changing and being unable to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we don't have to worry about that now, Clara.  That machine told you you were pregnant, so I got the machine to tell you you weren't.  It was a reverse feedback loop . . .\" he went on like that for a few minutes.  Clara listened, only caring that the general consensus was that the Doctor had completely reversed the effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Clara vowed to make a very thorough examination of herself when they got the TARDIS.  If she thought she looked the least bit bloated or her hips were half an inch wider, she'd dedicate the Doctor's time to making sure that everything really was back as it should be.  She shuddered, not for the first time, then tried to push those thoughts to the back of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home sweet home,\" Clara said as they entered the TARDIS.  \"Doctor, I'd like to . . . have a little alone time if you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor put his hands up in an understanding gesture, as if to say \"Don't let me stop you.\"  Clara went off to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor bolted to the TARDIS's controls.  He did his usual trickery, pulling on levers, thinking out loud, pressing buttons, looking at screens.  He had the TARDIS scan Clara for any signs of change, particularly pregnancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TARDIS came back with a negative reading, but with a catch.  <i>Something</i> was definitely off with her, and whatever it was the TARDIS did not have a handle on what that was.  The Doctor banged one of the control panels lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do I even trust you when it comes to pregnancies?  You only ever give me the most frustratingly ambiguous answers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Option 1:</b> Clara is pregnant, but it will play out as close to a normal human pregnancy as possible.  Maybe some catches will develop later on . . .</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Option 2:</b> Clara is pregnant, but it's a weird, mishmash parody of a human pregnancy as seen through an alien computer's eyes.  Maybe she grows in spurts, or all at once, or experiences symptoms at random and to stranger degrees than normal.</i></span></div></div>",

Even if they didn't stop at another place for weeks she was sure they could still find something to do without leaving it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara found herself wandering a hallway leading to a room that looked to be an endless closet, racks of clothes stretching as far as she could see.  Right next to it was another room, this one tall and cramped with large, blocky computers that could have come from the 50s.  There was an unease in her, though.  How could there not be, she reasoned?  She had just been trapped by a machine as her brain yelled at her to be pregnant, and her body was helpless to obey.  She began to relive the moments of panic again, feeling her stomach swell under her dress, her hips spreading, unable to flee and barely able to cry for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara was staring at one of the 50s-looking computers for a few moments before she caught herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Pregnant . . . pregnant . . .</i> the thought, more than the idea, was going through her head.  It reminded her too much of being under the control of that machine.  Rubbing her temples, Clara backed out of the room, intending to head back to the Doctor.  As she did so, she felt a more fully formed thought forcing its way into her mind like a blunt object.  She leaned against the wall, one hand on her head and the other on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh,\"she muttered, her voice shaking, \"This isn't happening . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, like a quick shout in her head, the thoughts forced their way into her.</span></div></div>",

Her stomach rumbled, quietly at first, but then grew into a steady bubbling growl.  Soon, Clara was leaning against the wall with her hands pressed firmly into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Eat!  Eat!  Eat!</i> the simple thought boomed through her head.  It was like a migraine with words.  Her tummy not only growled now, it pulsed and squirmed grossly under her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she even knew it, Clara was walking, her arms wrapped tightly around her middle.  She wasn't positive where she was going, except that every part of her was demanding food and the only counter argument she could muster were some sad squeaks of protest.  If she could just run toe the main TARDIS control room no doubt the Doctor would recognize something was wrong.  He had halted this before when the machine was right there, he could certainly reverse it again, right?  But then, maybe this wasn't the same thing.  Sure, she felt the thoughts of being pregnant before the desire to eat overwhelmed her, but where were they now?  All she could hear were her body and brain's demand for food, and lots of it.  And where was she going?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right,\" Clara said quietly, then grunted as she felt another squirming feeling inside her.  A door, not too far from where she had been, slid open.  She had seen this room before.  She couldn't remember where or when the Doctor had picked up this equipment, she only knew that the only device in there still working looked like an oversized espresso machine and could create matter seemingly from nowhere.  It was used, the Doctor told her, to supply the crews of intersteller ships with food, created by some species or other in the days before faster than light travel.  They had required it to create a rare and exotic snack for an angry alien that the Doctor had unintentionally inconvenienced, and she would have completely forgotten about it except for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked up to it and pushed what looked like the on button.  It buzzed to life.  Clara spoke into the speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh . . . can I get some f-food?\" she tried to stop herself, but it was a halfhearted effort at best.  She was weak with hunger now, and the thought of resisting was as unpleasant to her as the throbbing in her skull or the squirming in her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine clugged, clanked, and chinged, but in the end produced two fist-sized cubes of an off-white, tofu-like substance.  Clara grimaced, but found herself eating them both in two bites each with no hesitation.  They actually weren't bad.  Nothing remarkable, but nothing offensive either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More?\" she asked.  The machine produced more.  She ate those as well.  Her stomach settled down the fuller she got.  The intense, intrusive thoughts forcing themselves onto her grew quieter, too, but they were still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More,\" Clara said, and the machine complied.  \"Um, can you just keep making them until I tell you to stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to understand.  Clara was down to her twentieth when she thought she must be full enough.  She patted her stomach under her dress.  She shuddered.  It even felt a little puffy from her bland feast.  That further reminded her of her ordeal just hours before, when her stomach was more than just a little puffy.  Clara took a few steps back from the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nutrients!  Food!</i> the thoughts began growing more pronounced again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't -urp! - I don't need anymore.  I'm stuffed,\" Clara said, one hand holding the side of her head, the other her stuffed tummy.  The machine was still pushing out those generic cubes.  Clara reached out and grabbed some more, stuffing them in her face despite her protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" she yelled at her hands after swallowing.  Her stomach groaned, now from fullness rather than hunger.  But her brain wasn't listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Eat!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara stuffed another two, then another two into her unwilling mouth again.  Now she could feel her skin stretching tight around her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" she yelled, but didn't stop.  She felt the weight in her overstuffed stomach grow.  Her dress, casually formfitting around her, was now actually tight around her middle.  She pressed her hands into her stomach between food cubes and moaned, forcing out a few burps, and trying to work up enough lung power to yell for the Doctor.  Then, the thought hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Machine, stop making food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine complied instantly.  Clara, who had fell to her knees in front of the machine, sat back.  She massaged her poor stomach.  It was not just full, but swollen with tightly compacted food.  She pushed herself further from the machine to prevent any temptation.  This was the second time today some crazy piece of alien technology had given her a big belly, and while this one was thankfully not the enormous pregnancy belly she had gotten before, that was only a small comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp,\" she pressed her stomach, amazed that it could be that full, and even a little round.  Seizing her change while her brain was apparently no longer making demands on her, she prepared to rush to the Doctor.  The next command might not be as normal as \"eat a whole lot of food.\"</span></div></div>",

I hope that doesn't mean...\" Clara began to say, but was cut off by a small 'ping'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA button from her blouse, which was loose on her body before she stuffed herself with tasteless alien tofu, had flown across the room. Looking down, Clara yelped. <br>\r\nHer breasts, which had gone unchanged through her stuffing, were now slowly growing. Grabbing one, she gasped. They were much more sensitive than before. <br>\r\n\"What's happening?\" moaned Clara, partially from annoyance and fear, but also a bit of pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could run to find the Doctor, she was hit with a second 'MILK!'<br>\r\nThis one hit her hard, and forced her to sit and cradle her head. It also hit her growing breasts, which jumped up a cup size. Her bra was digging into them. Reaching down, she loosened it. It was better, but with the rate her breasts were growing, it wouldn't last. <br>\r\n\"Need... to find... Doctor\", gasped Clara, trying to get to her feet. Her body wasn't having it. <br>\r\nHer breasts, now hefty D-Cups at this point, were weighing down on her. Her stuffed belly had grown a small bit, but Clara didn't notice it. She was more concerned with her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple more minutes of Clara trying to work up the will to leave, her bra finally gave way. She heard the snap, and her breasts fell down onto her belly.<br>\r\n\"Help... me\", she whispered. She whimpered when a second button flew across the room, revealing her impressive cleavage. <br>\r\nHer breasts had stopped growing, but were now leaking milk, or what Clara hoped was milk. This day was already messed up enough. They were now heavy E-Cups, and were straining to break through her dress. <br>\r\nAfter a while of sitting on the cold floor...</span></div></div>",

Her skin was stretched and stung with the pressure of her dress over it.  Her breasts now were worse, though, as every movement sent tingles of pleasure throughout her body.  She looked down and moaned at the ridiculous cleavage her once slim figure now sported.  She wanted to steady them but new that would make it worse.  She wobbled a little, ready to start moving to get to the Doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed her temples.

Her first thought was her stomach, which she released one hand from her hand to press back, praying it wouldn't start expanding again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grow what?\" Clara said in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Grow!  Support!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-support?\" Clara said.  Her walk slowed.  She spread her legs out.  The loud throbbing in her head seemed to command it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Grow!</i>  And Clara felt the sides of her dress grow even more taught, and her legs jerk as her hips widened a few inches.  She screamed, grabbing them and stumbling backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" she yelled as another burst caused the sides of her dress to begin to tear.  Within seconds she was getting ridiculously wide hips to go with her breasts, giving her an hourglass figure that in another few seconds would look cartoonishly exaggerated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Grow!  Support!</i>  Clara thought this must be what childbearing hips were, and she did not like it anymore than her childbearing breasts.  She didn't know if her bones were widening or her hips were getting fatter, but she knew that her dress had about as much as it could take.  The seams began tearing apart at her sides.  She swayed her hips in a way that might have been sexual had they not been ballooning outwards.  She stumbled to the ground now with her head in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, no more!\" she screamed, \"Doctor!  Help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Grow!</i> With one last surge of growth her hips rounded out, much further than her shoulders and adding some growth to her tiny behind, too.  She shook with fear and pleasure as her fall caused her oversensitive breasts to go haywire.  The growth might have stopped for now as far as she knew, but Clara was going through an uncomfortable flurry of sensations and the feeling that her body was no longer hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor!\" she yelled as loud as she could, trying to stand but finding her aching head and transforming body throwing her off.  She thought with how much she was changing even he might not recognize this big-breasted, pear-shaped girl on his TARDIS now.</span></div></div>",

This morning, she had woken up in her bed, with her small body that she liked. Now, she had an alien body that she didn't like. Sure, her new breasts and ass looked good, but on her small frame, and with her stuffed belly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me...\", Clara moaned, partly due to sadness and partly due to the feeling of pleasure that her over-sensitive breasts were causing. Her headache had dulled down now, so she decided to go for broke. <br>\r\n\"Find the Doctor... He can fix this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara pushed her body up, gasping when her breasts brushed against the cool material of her dress. <br>\r\nShe stumbled slightly, not used to her body. <br>\r\n\"Easy does it... One foot after the other\", she told herself, moving her left foot forward. As soon as it hit the ground...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not again!\"<br>\r\nHer throbbing head began to ache again. Within seconds, she was forced to sit back against the wall. <br>\r\n\"Please, just stop!\" She yelled, grasping her head with one hand, her over-stuffed belly with the other. <br>\r\n<i>Instincts!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Clara moaned, her mind began to change. Knowledge of babies, parenting classes and childcare entered her mind. At the same time, some of the hatred she had for her new body dissolved. She still didn't like it, but being pregnant... She could learn to like it. <br>\r\n\"It's not that bad...\", she mused, not realizing that she was rubbing her belly, which had rounded out and protruded from her body by a couple more inches. Her breasts and hips, not wanting to be left out, grew as well. Her breasts filled with milk, tightening her dress and causing another button to fly off, revealing her canyon of cleavage. <br>\r\nHer hips widened another couple of inches, straining the lower part of her dress, and revealing her bigger behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually broke out of her trance. Her head wasn't hurting as much, so she got to her feet. <br>\r\n\"I can do this. Play through the pain\".<br>\r\nShe had taken 10 steps down the corridor, when...</span></div></div>",

It inched forward, \"Urk! Hurry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clara, wait right there!\" The Doctor jumped into action. Waving his trusty sonic screwdriver over her he knelt down next to her. Clara was so thrilled she couldn't wipe the smile off her face. The Doctor would fix this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did this start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few minutes ago. I started getting these head aches, and hearing these voices, or impressions of voices,\" Clara's belly bubbled loudly, and her hips spread further, causing her dress to tear along the sides. \"Aah! Doctor, hurry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" he said, helping her up. Clara's body was no longer built for running as it once was, and it took longer for them to get back to the control room of the TARDIS than it should have. In that time, Clara knew her ass had bloated up behind her some, and that her belly had not given up. She sat down as the Doctor ran to the middle console.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had been growing before, she was almost in a trance and couldn't truly appreciate the changes happening to her. Now, however light headed and confused, she could now fully explore what was happening to her. She ran her hands over the tight fabric covering her round belly and cringed. And yet, it didn't seem quite as horrible as it did before. There was something even a little beautiful, maybe, in her bloated body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was I this big before?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor turned around as a screen full of alien characters she didn't recognized flew up in front of him from the console.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh no, much bigger. Huge even. How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a balloon about to pop,\" Clara said as she felt a wiggling feeling inside her. \"Doctor, please, hurry. Why is this happening again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor looked at her and the screen responding to the TARDIS scanning her. \"It's your brain, Clara. It's reprogrammed your brain to make you pregnant. But it's an alien machine and it doesn't know how human pregnancies work. So we don't know what-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara interrupted the Doctor with a yelp as her belly surged forward, her hips widened, and her breasts finally snapped her bra off. \"My brain!\" she yelled, \"Doctor, this isn't just changing my body, it's changing my thoughts. I'm starting to . . .\" she shuddered at the words but could not ignore that not unpleasant emotion rising from her as she looked down at her belly, \"I'm starting to like it . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor stopped his work for just a moment to lean in close to Clara, \"I promise you we will stop this, and reverse it, before it's permanent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Permanent? Are you serious?\" Clara nearly screamed, her own voice causing the nauseating wiggling inside her to increase. The Doctor grimaced at his poor choice of words. Clara felt panic again. If what the Doctor let slip was true, then it was possible her body might never be hers again, that it might constantly be changing against her will. And worse, that an alien program in her brain would force her to like it.</span></div></div>",

Her breasts, full and heavy with milk, flopped freely down onto her belly. They jumped up a cup size, surpassing her head in size. Each one was as big as a basketball, and both were dripping with milk.<br>\r\nAs her belly was revealed, it started growing as well. It became rounder and rounder. Stretch marks started appearing as the skin was pulled taut around her filling womb.

I may like my bigger tits and ass but I need to get rid of this huge belly stop trying to make me like this horrible mistake brain!\"<br>\r\nClara tried to take control of her body again and tried to get out of bed and go find the doctor.  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nBit she heard the voice in her head say \"Clara theirs no need to fight this. You should feel blessed to know that your becoming a perfect mother.\" <br>\r\nAnnoyingly she lost control again and lied back down on the comfy bed it seemed like the voice had far more power over her then she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara thought this was so strange but even if it seemned crazy she tried to talk to voice and maybe try to reason with it.<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this to me? I dont want kids I'm not ready to be a mother yet....\" <br>\r\nThe voice said \"That's a lie Clara you've wanted this for a long time now. You try to hide it but you know deep down in your heart what you really want in life is a big house filled with the sounds of children playing and laughing as you nature protect and help them grow up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara said \"No I'm not ready yet. What if I'm not a good enouth mother what if they get hurt? I could never forgive my self if that happened. What if they dont love me back? what if...what if...\"<br>\r\nthe voice interrupted \"You see you do care about having a family you love children and want children of your own why else would you be a teacher after all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara said \"Its just a job besides having one baby is hard work enouth but I can tell I have more then just one baby in me I cant take care of 3 or 4 or 5! kids its too hard..\"<br>\r\nThe voice said \"You keep lying to yourself Clara. You will be a perfect mother no matter how many children you will be there for them no matter what because you already love your babies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara felt her heart flutter and her body grew warmer as much as she wanted to block out the voice and as much as she thought it was lying she couldn't help but feel that the voice was right was she ready? was it finally time to settle down and have a family? <br>\r\nClara felt tears fill her eyes this was all to much for her to deal with this all felt so wrong yet so right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice seemned to try to comfort her \"Clara I know you feel strange confused and scared but I know this is for the best by the end of this you will be a perfect mother that I promise. Now relax your body and try to get some sleep your body will grow and change faster as you rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara soon felt her whole body become as light as feather as she rested.<br>\r\nAfter such a crazy day her eyes felt heavy she felt so tired soon her eyes shut and in minutes she was out like a light.<br>\r\nAll the while she rubbed her big belly in her sleep peacefully. And as she slumbered her body now had all the time it needed to keeping changing inside and out<br>\r\nand for her body to grow and for her belly to expand with more babies.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yawning, Clara wiped some sleep from her eyes with a chubbier hand. She didn't know where she was, until she remembered yesterday's events.<br>\r\n\"Oh, crap... I didn't run, did I?\"<br>\r\nA quick glance around the room told her that she did indeed run, or at the very least, waddle away from the Doctor, the one man who could fix her predicament. <br>\r\n\"If I did that, then I must still be...\"<br>\r\nLooking down, Clara stifled a scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered being big, but now? She was downright huge!<br>\r\nHer breasts had filled with an absurd amount of milk. Each one was about twice the size of her head, and dripping with milk. Scooping some up, Clara stuck her chubby finger in her mouth and swallowed. It was cool and creamy, and reminded her of milk fresh from the shop. <br>\r\nHer ass and hips had ballooned, making her lower body look huge. Each ass cheek spread out below her, acting as a sofa for her. Her thighs had put on a bit of weight, and now touched each other.<br>\r\nAnd her belly... It was huge. Lying down, it protruded a good three feet from her body. It provided support for her leaking breasts, which lay on top of the massive globe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing herself into a sitting position, Clara groaned. Even sitting, she could feel the weight of her massively pregnant body. She wasn't a doctor, but even she could tell that was pregnant with an inhuman amount of babies. <br>\r\n\"I really, really need to find the Doctor...\"<br>\r\nStanding up, Clara swayed before collapsing back onto the bed. She wasn't used to moving her new body. <br>\r\n\"So heavy... I doubt I'll be able to move around for very long\", she noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she was confined to her bed for a moment, Clara took the opportunity to inspect her body. <br>\r\nHer belly, despite being big enough to hold her old body, was strangely devoid of stretch marks. Her skin actually seemed to... glow, almost. Looking down at her forearm, she noticed that one of her scars had disappeared. <br>\r\n\"That's not bad, but still...\"<br>\r\nTurning, she saw her reflection in a mirror on the other side of the room. Her hair had an unnatural shine to it, and looked a little longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>See, Clara? You suit the motherly look.</i>  <br>\r\nShe groaned.<br>\r\n\"Why don't you sod off?!\"<br>\r\n<i>I cannot, and will not. Until you have given birth, I will remain with you, and advise you. </i><br>\r\n\"You mean change me against my will!\", she shouted, pointing at her gravid form. <br>\r\n<i>Necessary changes. Your old, small form would not have been suitable. Your current form still is not suitable to give birth to an entire race</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AN ENTIRE RACE?!\" Clara screamed. She wasn't sure if she could handle anymore. <br>\r\n<i>Of course. We were wiped out, but our biological data was stored within the machine you activated. You have been chosen as our host, our mother. You will be revered as a Goddess. </i><br>\r\n\"I refuse! I won't do it!\"<br>\r\n<i>You have no choice. Your body belongs to me, should you falter. Such an occasion is now.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara suddenly stood up. Her breasts jumped wildly, while her ass jiggled. <br>\r\n\"Leave me alone! Doctor!\"<br>\r\n<i>He will not find us, not yet. Now, you must change.</i></span></div></div>",

Her nipples seemned bigger too and annoyingly her breasts seemned to keep dribbling milk none stop now which she found very humiliating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara's ass and hips were also larger now each butt check were the size of perfectly smooth basketballs now and seemned to jiggle anytime she moved and her hips were now very big and perfect for birthing babies.<br>\r\nNot only that but her hair seemned to be longer now and even more beautiful reaching all the way to her shoulders her lips seemned bigger and she felt perfectly healthy and fit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara let out a annoyed sigh \"God damn it I look nothing like my old self anymore I bet when the doctor finds me he's not even going to know who I am... \"<br>\r\nThe voice said \"Don't be upset Clara you look so beautiful now you like a goddess of fertility.\" <br>\r\nClara said \"Oh sod off already you may think this is nice but I hate this I dont look anything like my old self anymore.<br>\r\nMy tits and belly feel heavy my back hurts from all the weight my feet hurt and as I already said I dont want to be a mother especially not to a long dead alien race...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice said \"I really dont think you understand just how important this is Clara. Your not just going to a mother to some random aliens. Your going to bring a highly civilised advanced alien race back from extinction how do you not grasp the importance of this. You will be the mother to them and you will be worshipped as a goddess throw out space and time forever.\"<br>\r\nClara shouted \"I am NOT going to be a goddess to some freaky aliens. I'm an adventure seeking primary school teacher.<br>\r\nI dont want to be this stupid dead alien races mother besides that I dont know anything about this race what if there a bunch of war crazy savages that eat people I dont want to give birth to an alien race like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice said \"Clara this alien race was once considered a beacon of hope around the universe the aliens you are carrying used to save worlds and brought warring planets together in peace you would be doing not only this race a favour but the entire universe this alien race could even bring peace to the universe one day please cant you see this is a very big deal and theses babies need you Clara and you need them.<br>\r\nAs much as you try to act like you hate this I know the more this goes on the more you want this to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara grabbed her head in frustration trying to black out the voice \"N..no that's just you putting thoughts into my head that aren't mine.\"<br>\r\nThe voice said \"Look into your heart Clara you already know that you cant just let that Doctor freind of yours hurt your precious babies you want to protect give birth to them and raise them as your own. And I know by the end of this you will see it my way that this is the right thing to do you will be a perfect mother Clara that I already know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara sighed and stooped trying to block out the voice till the Doctor found her it seemned there was no point in fighting back.<br>\r\nClara asked \"Since you your not planning on leaving soon can you answer a few questions?\" the voice said \"Ask me anything Clara.\"<br>\r\nShe said \"Well can you tell me what you are? after all you are inside my own head controlling my brain and body,,,\"<br>\r\nThe Voice said \"Well this mite be hard for you to understand but I am a pretty much a living computer I was inside the old technology you used and when you used it I entered your mind, My main goal is to see that the race that created me lives on and you were the perfect host to hep that be possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara asked \"Are you ever going to leave or I'm I stuck with you forever?\"<br>\r\nThe voice said \"I only plan to stay till I am no longer needed once my task is fully complete I will fade away into your conscious\"    <br>\r\nClara said in a upset tone \"So you really want me to throw my whole life away on earth. Birth a dead race back from extinction and raise them up so they can bring there dead civilization back to life?\"<br>\r\nThe voice said \"For the most part yes I know this is hard for you I can read your mind and I know ever emotion you feel I understand why your scared.<br>\r\nThis is a big leap in your life going from earth school teacher to saviour to an entire race but I want you to understand that you are important and I will do everything I can to make sure you and the babies are save and ready for the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara sat back down on the bed and stared at her big belly.<br>\r\nShe put out her hand to her warm skin and felt the tiny kicks and bumps of her babies moving inside of her.<br>\r\nThe voice said \"Clara if you need anything I can help. My goal is to make sure both the babies and you are in perfect heath and security let me help you just ask me anything and ill see if I can make it happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara knew she couldn't ask if the voice could get rid of this pregnancy or tell her were doctor was. so Clara asked for the one thing she wanted more then anything else right now, <br>\r\nClara said \"Hey can you help me find something in this huge place?<br>\r\nThe voice said \"I dont know this place but I'm very good at tracking things down just ask for it and ill show you the way to what every you want.\"  <br>\r\nClara asked...         </span></div></div>",

I need some REAL food, not that alien tofu crap\", Clara said, remembering the amount she had stuffed herself with yesterday. <br>\r\n<i>Of course, Clara. Leave this room, take a right, keep straight for two turns, and then the kitchen is on your left.</i><br>\r\n\"Thanks...\" Clara mumbled, still not happy with her massive body, but pleased that she was going to eat something solid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeaving herself to her feet, she groaned as all her weight started acting downwards. Her breasts flopped down onto her belly, while her ass cheeks jiggled. <br>\r\n\"God... I'm so heavy!\" She moaned, placing one of her chubby feet in front of her. <br>\r\n<i>I could help, if you allow me to assume control of your body. </i><br>\r\n\"No! It's my body, I keep control of it!\" Clara said defensively, crossing her pudgy arms over her breasts. She stifled a moan as she brushed against her sensitive nipples. <br>\r\n<i>If you wish. I only wish to help. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the room, Clara leaned against the wall and caught her breath. <br>\r\n\"Brilliant... only another couple hundred of steps left!\" She huffed. <br>\r\nPushing away from the wall, Clara waddled down the hall when she felt a new found strength fill her. <br>\r\n<i>Perhaps this will help? A little more strength will help a mother in many ways.</i> <br>\r\nClara nodded. Her body wasn't as heavy, but she was still forced to waddle her nude body down the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching a door, she heard the voice. <br>\r\n<i>This is it. A kitchen with human food inside. </i><br>\r\n\"Thank God, I'm starving!\" Clara shouted, pushing the door open and making a beeline for the fridge. She yanked the door open and started shoving food in her mouth. She didn't care what she ate, as long as she could eat it. <br>\r\n<i>That's it, Clara. Provide nutrients for your body. For your children. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ate, her skin seemed to shine a bit brighter, and became completely devoid of all imperfections. Her hair lengthened. It now reached halfway down her back. Her lips plumped up. <br>\r\n\"This is really good...\" She moaned, plunging her hands into an Apple pie and then shoving them into her mouth. <br>\r\n<i>That's it. Become bigger...</i><br>\r\nThat caused her to stop. <br>\r\n\"What? No, not again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lost control of her body and continued stuffing her face. <br>\r\n\"No, stop!\" She shouted, trying to fight back. <br>\r\n<i>Your children require nutrients. I am merely providing for them. If you grow bigger, then that is fine.</i> <br>\r\n\"Maybe to you, but it's not for me!\"<br>\r\nShe was interrupted by a massive slice of pie being shoved in her mouth. It caused her belly to grow. It looked as though three toddlers could fit inside, with room to spare. Her breasts, still leaking milk, plumped up. Her ass spread out below her, acting as a cushion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the fridge was empty. But Clara...<br>\r\n\"No more... please!\"<br>\r\nDespite her new strength, she was having trouble lifting her colossal body of the ground. Her breasts now resembled massive watermelons, and had a constant stream of cool milk leaking from them. Her belly could comfortably fit two adults now, and had constants movements within her chubby womb. Her hips had widened again, now giving her excellent child-bearing hips. Her ass could act as a sofa, and had caused her to rise up a couple of inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Come, Clara. I have explained it many times. The bigger you are, the more you will give birth to.</i> <br>\r\n\"How long until I give birth?\" She asked, worried about the answer. <br>\r\nThe voice replied...</span></div></div>",

Everywhere she looked, trees. <br>\r\n\"At least there's a plentiful supply of oxygen\", Clara said, cracking a weak smile. <br>\r\n<i>This is a remote planet on the edges of an uncharted galaxy. Only a few thousand aliens make this their home, so we shouldn't be discovered here. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And these aliens are where?\" Clara asked, hoping they were friendly. <br>\r\n<i>The closest lifesign is a couple of miles away.

Her last growth had proven itself a burden, even with her increased strength. Thankfully, the voice picked this up, and within a couple of seconds, Clara felt much better. She started forward, occasionally stopping to move her longer hair from her vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like hours of walking, Clara finally stopped. She fell onto her backside, causing a small quake. <br>\r\n<i>Take it easy. Babies are fragile, as is the mother. </i><br>\r\n\"Sure, whatever...\" Clara mumbled, wiping some sweat from her brow.

They illuminated a small village composed of primitive straw huts. It looked almost cozy after the hard trek through the jungle Clara had been on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, natives,\" Clara said, not even sure herself if she was being sarcastic. She wanted to lie back and sleep. Despite her captor's physical aid all the strength it could must couldn't stop her from feeling every unwanted pound dragging her exhausted body down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They may prove useful,</i> the voice said, <i>Let's go and rest in their village.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRest sounded really nice about now. Clara shifted her weight on the ground, craning to rub her sore back and cringing at the new softness, and width, she found there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know if they're friendly,\" Clara said, more out of not wanting to get up again than any real concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They are simple people. I will ensure they do not harm you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare go controlling anyone else, you hear me?\" Clara said feeling her blood rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I thought we agreed this was for the greater good of your children? You do want what's best for them, don't you?</i> Clara's hands went to her enormous belly, rubbing it gently. Once again, her own thoughts and emotions were quietly subdued by a calm, motherly feeling. A sweet smile spread across her recently plumped up lips. She almost cooed as waves of kicks rocked her body. She knew she shouldn't be feeling good about any of this, but she couldn't help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And besides, you're hungry,</i> the voice said. It was a command, not a question. Clara's belly roared, almost painfully. It snapped her out of her induced revelry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, damn you,\" Clara said. She struggled to her feet, wobbling and huffing all while her belly yelled its juicy, gurgling sounds of hunger at her. \"Enough, okay? I'm coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot fast enough, apparently. Without lessening her exhaustion mental Clara's 'guardian' pumped her full of renewed energy, probably the last she had in her. Her hips ached, her taut skin of her belly and breasts screamed with every bounce, but on Clara went down the steep hills towards the village. She wished for some clothing to provide some support, some security from all the wobbling and jiggling her new body was prone to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey passed through no farm lands or roads, the village came on quite suddenly. This told Clara that these were sedentary people but had not yet developed agriculture to any large degree, and probably never would if they got everything they needed from their jungle home. The village was small. There couldn't have been more than forty, fifty people in it, and all of them were tending to the fires, sitting with their young, or preparing large wooden bowels of fruit and meat to cook over the fire. The dense jungle stench gave way to a delightful aroma that made Clara's belly gurgle with desire and her mind grow hazy from hunger and exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villages were humanoid, and a little shorter than her, although with her newfound bulk Clara felt much larger. They were light blue with tufts of hair growing in long ponytails from their heads, pulled back into elegant weaves down their backs. They looked quite human even if their features were a little off, their fingers too long. Clara had seen much weirder. They saw her before they heard her. Within seconds the village came to a stop, the only sound being the crackling of their fires and Clara's growling belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er . . . hi,\" Clara said with a bashful wave. They were all fully clothed in protective, leathery garments. Clara now felt the full force of her nudity. She had accepted it somewhat until just them more as a side effect of her, the real Clara, wearing some kind of Clara fat suit. She rubbed her belly, then suddenly squirmed uncomfortably as her arm brushed her breasts, a little milk dribbling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" one of the village eventually said. Clara sighed with relief. She could understand them, which meant she was in some way still connected with the TARDIS, and thus with the Doctor. \"Can we . . . help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara couldn't read the villages. Many of the men stood up, not in an aggressive way. While short they were well built and could be warriors themselves. The women Clara saw were on the heavier side in contrast to their men, although even their chubby figures were nothing compared to Clara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They could be dangerous, Clara. We need to protect your children.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't!\" Clara said emphatically, causing the village approaching her to jump back. Her looked at her cautiously, apparently believing Clara's outburst was direct at him. Slowly, the men began inching close to her, while the women either stayed put or backed away. Clara had to think much faster than her starving, tired, pregnant mind would let her to save these people from either attacking her on sight or being turned into slaves of the growing power inside her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from that, her strength was dropping fast. She'd pass out any minute help and food.</span></div></div>",

She had recently been cut off by her parents, she was forced to stay with JD, and she had been single for quite some time. Elliot needed some money, and she needed it fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot walked down the hallways of Sacred Heart Hospital, and stopped as she noticed a sign-up sheet. She looked around to see who may have put it up, and found Dr. Cox standing nearby. \"Dr. Cox, what's this sign-up sheet for?\" she asked taking a look the sheet in question. \"Well, Barbie, if you actually read the sheet you would know that some huge pharmaceutical company gave us a buttload of money if we offered shots of this new experimental drug to our female staff,\" said Dr. Cox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would any volunteer to try an experimental drug?\" said Elliot looking the signup sheet without reading it, her mind focusing on the problem of financial situation. \"The same way they get any animal to do a dumb thing, they give them an incentive.\" \"You mean you get paid?\" said Elliot eagerly now reading through the sheet. \"How much?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Barbie, I know you are going through a rough patch with money and all but you are seriously considering doing this are you? Drug testing is is like the prostitution of the medical world.\" \"It says 150,\" said Elliot with disbelief in her voice. \"Is that per an hour?\" started Dr Cox. \"$150,000.\" Elliot said, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis even stunned Dr Cox who must of dismissed the sheet before getting that far, but he rallied.<br>\r\n\"And why do you think they are giving that much, its because they are going to inject some barely test entails cocktail of god-knows-what chemical into you that could any possible side effect.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its a fertility drug, it cant be too risky,\" said Elliot continuing to read down the sheet. \"See? It says \"fills you with life.\" \"So bacteria which of course will be patho, Barbie\" said Dr Cox as Elliot picked up the pen next to the signup sheet. \"Barbie if you sign that I'm going to have to call you Mercedes or some other hooker name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Elliot signed the sheet gave a Dr Cox a triumphed look before strutting away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was later in the day after Elliot had finished her rounds when a man with a white coat and clipboard she didn't recognize seem to almost appear beside her. \"Elliot Reid?\" he inquired in a sharp emotionless voice.<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"she asked. \"You signed up for the experiment fertility drug trail...\" said the man, and whilst the sentence itself was a question the man seem to pronounce in such a way as though it was a fact.        <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did... \"said Elliot wonder where this was going. \"I have come to give you the injection.\" \"Oh, that was quick.\" \"We were already set to go,\" said the man opening a nearby door. \"Can you step in side...\" again leaving the question mark off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room seem to be an examination room and was currently used by the representative of the pharmaceutical company who gestured Elliot to sit in the chair normally used by patients. \"Uh, about the money?\" asked Elliot nervously. \"All $150,000 will be paid in cash after you take the injection,\" said the man producing a couple rolls of cash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis more than anything should of alerted Elliot that something was not quite right, but she desperately needed that money. \"Can you first fill out these forms?\" said the pharmaceutical representative producing a few pieces of paper. Elliot filled out the forms, which mostly consisted of a survey and an agreement to procedure, as Elliot was in a hurry to see her friends she only skimmed through the forms before signing them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs nearly as soon as she sign the agreement the forms were taken away from her. The representative produce a syringe filled with a bluish-pink substance. \"Hold still please,\" he said in his emotionless voice, it wasn't emotionless like a robot but like everything he was saying was strictly business. Elliot offered her upper arm into which the man injected the syringe, which surprisingly didn't hurt but made a strange warm feeling at the point of injection that could help but rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here is your payment,\" said the man giving Elliot the money before getting up and walking to the door. It was only after he had left did Elliot realize that she didn't ask him for the company's contact details or even its name, she got up intending to catch up and ask him but when looked around outside of the room the man was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Elliot, where have you been?\" said a voice. Elliot turned and saw Carla, JD, and Turk at the end of the hall near the desk where they usually hung out. \"I volunteered to recieve a shot for this new experimental fertility drug. It pays 150,000 dollars.\" Elliot mentioned. \"Wait, it pays 150k?\" Carla asked. \"Where do I sign up?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby do you really think you should?\" asked Turk. \"That could more and pay for the wedding,\" said Carla, \"And if we have the wedding sooner then the drug can help us get a baby,\" replied Carla. Elliot told her where, and Carla left, seeking to sign up. \"Hey, Turk. Do you know what day it is?\" JD asked. \"Hold up, is it Steak Night?\" Turk responded. \"It's Steak Night. Wanna do the dance?\" \"Let's do the dance.\" Turk replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steak night, we're gonna eat it right. Steak is such a treat. It is the world's BEST MEAT!\" the two sang as they danced the sacred dance. \"Right, so I know what you to are doing tonight. I guess I'll just stay home.\" said Elliot. Suddenly, Todd popped in out of nowhere. \"World's best meat? You mean the one in my pants?\" he asked. All of them stood in the silent disbelief that often followed a Todd statement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then they heard the faint whistling that announced arrival of Dr. Kelso, after Doctor Cox had recently punch the head of the hospital, Dr Kelso made a whistling noise as he breathed normally giving time for people to scatter but not this time, he entered the room, whilst he couldn't fire Dr Cox he could find other ways to take out his anger on him and the other hospital staff. \"What is the meaning of this? Get back to work!\" he barked. \"But it's 5:00.\" JD replied. \"Oh, well in that case, go home!\" Dr. Kelso shouted. Carla returned from signing up for the shot, and the four left the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late at night, as Elliot was sitting in JD's and Turks apartment, watching TV. JD then entered the apartment. \"How was Steak Night?\" Elliot asked. \"Great, like always.\" JD replied, Though Turk is spending the night at Carla's place. \"Hey listen, I know that the whole \"sex buddies\" thing never really panned out, but Steak Night has got me feeling really good. Do you wanna, you know...\"he trailed off, doing the finger-through-the-hole gesture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vague thought in her mind rose concerns about doing intercourse after taking the fertility drug but hormones swimming through her system, from said drug, made her feel otherwise. \"Sure, what the hell.\" she said, as she followed JD into his bedroom. <i>Besides</i>, she thought to herself, <i>if we use protection whats the worst that could happen?</i></span></div></div>",

Then remembered that she had work today, glancing over at the clock she noticed that even if she left for work now she would still be late. Clutching a sheet to Elliot stood up, JD who didn\u2019t have work today, gave a snore and rolled over. Elliot rushed as fast she could to her room listing what she needed to do, \u201cfirst I need to get dressed then I a need to wash my\u2026uhgmmm,\u201d she finished as she was hit by a wave nausea. <br>\r\nAfter spending a few minutes she couldn't afford to waste heaving into the toilet she made her way to her room, she contemplated calling in sick, but that would require finding someone to cover for her and  she couldn\u2019t asked for anymore favors off anyone, \u2018besides she felt fine now.\u2019<br>\r\nHer next problem came about half a minute later when she was getting dressed, \u201cCome on, why won\u2019t you do up?\u201d For some reason her breasts which were never that big seemed to have recently grown, and now prevented her from doing up her bra. Normally she would of rejoiced at such a thing but not when she was in a hurry, she considered going without the bra which would have normally been a valid option before but the increase in size also gave them a bouncy quality which would cause problems plus they were tender and she couldn\u2019t have them chafing all day. \u201cCome on do the frick up,\u201d with a great effort she managed to fasten her bra but the level of tightness was almost as bad as the chafing would be.<br>\r\nShe managed to get dressed and get out the door without any more problems, traffic was worse than she thought it would be but she would be late one way or another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rushed into the doors of Sacred Heart nearly half an hour late, feeling nauseous again but this time it was because of her running from the far side of the car park, she found it more difficult to run feeling strangely top heavy. She stood doubled over in front of the reception desk hands on knees and breathing heavily, trying not hurl and hoping no one important saw her come in late.<br>\r\nShe jolted at the sound talking to her, \u201cThere you are,\u201d Elliot looked up to see Carla, \u201cprobably not the best day to be late Kelso has already taken some of his anger out on Dr Cox and now he is looking to pass on the favor.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh\u2026I just humhhf,\u201d Elliot clasped a hand to her mouth and dashed to the toilet. \u201cShe's not having a good day,\u201d said Carla watching Elliot, \u201cI sure hope that's not a side effect of the fertility drug,\u201d she continued rubbing her upper arm absentmindedly.<br>\r\nAfter emptying the contents of her stomach a second time Elliot went to collect the charts of the patients that she would be treating today, hoping that no one would notice that she was originally absent. When she got to the nurses station she found that\u2026.</span></div></div>",

A few minutes after Elliot started tucking in to her lunch Carla sat down at the table in the seat opposite to her.<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d said Elliot in down tone expression.<br>\r\n\u201cNot so well?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPatients being completely self-centred pricks.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThey normally are,\u201d said Carla, not mentioning that patients who are seriously ill or are dying generally have a right to be self-centred.<br>\r\n\u201cI mean this morning bra was too small and I could barely do it up, I swear my breast have gotten bigger since I got that injection.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell take it for the good thing it is,\u201d said Carla.<br>\r\n\u201cBut not so fast I haven\u2019t had a chance to buy new clothes yet my bra feels like it\u2019s about to snap and my panties\u2026Oh no,\u201d said Elliot as she realised something. Her hands flew to her backside, \u201cOh My God! It\u2019s huge,\u201d she said standing up to show Carla the offending rump.<br>\r\n\u201cYes I see,\u201d said Carla leaning back as Elliot shoved her rear in her general direction, too distraught to remember all the people in the cafeteria, \u201cYou might want to sit down.\u201d<br>\r\nElliot slowly sat down and winced as she touch the chair, as though she had a bruise on her behind, \u201cIt\u2019s bigger that the chair,\u201d she whispered, \u201cwhen I sit down my ass is bigger than the chair, you know what this drug has done? It\u2019s made me look like a bimbo.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo it hasn\u2019t,\u201d said Carla automatically.<br>\r\n\u201cYes it has, I have a hard enough time to be taken seriously in this job and know I look like a bimbo.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cStop fretting about, chances are it\u2019s only temporary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling slightly better but not much overall, Elliot finished her lunch and started on her afternoon rounds. It was better than the morning\u2019s ones as she wasn\u2019t late to the first one but generally it was about the same. But then she was finished and ready to go home after she handed her clipboard back in at the nurses\u2019 station. It was whilst she was doing this; Carla and Turk were talking to Jordan at the other end of the Nurses\u2019 station.<br>\r\n\u201cWedding ceremonies are overrated,\u201d said Jordan, \u201cYou spend years paying for them; you don\u2019t even have to go into church to have one.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIs it because you\u2019ll burn up if you enter holy ground,\u201d said Turk. Carla jabbed him in the ribs for this remark but felt less well disposed to Jordan for what she just said.<br>\r\nAll of them looked around (as did everyone one else at the nurses\u2019 station) at a creaking sound which was quickly found to be emanating from Elliot\u2019s chest, who grunted fiddling at her tight bra, which had being growing increasingly tighter over the course of the day and was now making noises like a drawn bow string. \u201cCome on, you fricking thing com\u2026\u201d she was interrupted by the taught bra finally snapping with a discorded \u2018twang\u2019, her eyes bulged with everyone else\u2019s as her breasts, now free from their confines, ballooned out with a visible \u2018boing\u2019 pressing out against her scrubs. \u201cFrick!\u201d said Elliot pressing grapefruit sized mammaries, \u201cstupid freaking drug trial.\u201d<br>\r\nJordan leaned over to Carla, as everyone in room (particularly the men) watched Elliot fuss around with her newly enlarged assets, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on stick, why is she cursing her new social fortune on a drug trial?\u201d Carla who had just prodded Turk into getting the Todd out of the way (who was walking towards Elliot with a zombie like gait which matched the expression on his face as his hand were getting ready to grasp) said, \u201cshe has taken part of that fertility drug trial, actually she might be right I\u2019ve been feeling a bit tender there since this morning.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how much does this trial cost,\u201d said Jordan in a sweet voice that was obviously fake and nonchalant it sounded sarcastic.<br>\r\nBut the effect if any was lost on Carla as she was more concern on removing the Todd and any others with the same idea, \u201coh nothing they pay you?\u201d<br>\r\nJordan gave a devilish grin at the news of this breast enhancement drug where they pay the applicant, \u201coh just one more thing,\u201d she said in the same voice, \u201cwhere would one sign up for the trial?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJust down the hall on the notice board,\u201d said Carla as Jordan slipped off.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Need anything, Carla?\"  Elliot asked, walking out of the hospital.  \"No, I'm all good.  See you tomorrow?\"  Carla asked, absentmindedly rubbing the side of one of her breasts, which she swore were a little bigger than they were this morning.  \"Yeah.  See ya.\" she replied, leaving Sacred Heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing a short drive, Elliot arrived at the local shopping mall.  She headed over to Victoria's Secret, in search of bigger bras.  A day ago, her breasts had been a solid B cup, but now she figured that they were nearing the C cup range.  After trying on a few bras, she was able to find a few that she liked, and made her purchase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she exited the store, Elliot's stomach let out a rumble.  \"I just ate a few hours ago, how can I still be hungry?\" she thought to herself.  Still, her hunger was evident, and she needed to satisfy it.  She hurried to the food court, filling a plateful of food.  After devouring it in a hurry, she returned back to JD's apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the apartment, she was a little surprised to find that nobody was home.  Within a few seconds, her cellphone buzzed.  It was from JD himself.  <i>Working late 2nite</i> it said, incredibly straightforward.  \"Guess that explains that...\" Elliot said, stifling a yawn.  \"Why the hell am I so tired?\" she asked herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot walked into the bathroom and removed her scrubs and underwear.  She caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror, and was shocked at the sight.  \"What the frick?\" she asked, wondering what had happened.  Elliot realized that her breasts had gotten a little bigger, but she was unaware that her areolas had gotten a shade darker.  In addition, her lower stomach now had the faintest curve protruding from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed the tiny bump, feeling its firmness.  \"Must be from eating so much today...yeah, that's it...\" she said.  Elliot put on her pajamas and headed towards the couch,  After a few minutes, she drifted off into sleep.</span></div></div>",

She felt her breast rubbed against her pillow and had to hold back a moan. They were so tender all of a sudden and Elliot couldn't mistake that they looked even better then they were last night. Shaking off the feeling she sat up more in her bed and noticed that her butt felt even softer then it did yesterday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that food had to go somewhere I guess.\" thought Elliot. She pulled at her panties to get rid of the wedgie she had and then she went to stand up.  She walked a little awkwardly to the bathroom when she caught herself in the mirror. She let out a surprised scream as she covered her mouth. The small curve from the night before had turned into a little bump, like the beginning of a food baby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed the small belly.  She looked at her breasts and even through her pajama top she could tell they had easily gone up another cup size. \"Guess that bra might not be great fit anymore.\" thought Elliot. Elliot turned around to examine the damage done to her butt and had to hold back another gasp. Her butt had easily grown out another inch, making the protruding booty hard to miss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is getting too strange.\" said Elliot. \"I have to go see that doctor.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped out of the bathroom to start getting dressed when her gurgling belly stopped her in her tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God you're hungry again!!\" said Elliot grabbing her belly to try and calm it. \" We don't have time I need to go see the doctor before this gets any worse.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took one step towards her pants when another hunger pain hit her. She groaned as it passed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe a little snack wouldn't be so bad.\" said Elliot out loud. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She uncontrollably licked her lips, she shook off the feeling of excitement and just went for the bit of leftovers from the mall.

Very quickly Elliot started to empty the contents of her fridge moving from leftovers to microwavable food.

Elliot had planned to walk in and hopefully go unnoticed but that looked like it was going to be hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't start off well. Her swollen middle had made it a little harder getting out of the car, after two failed attempts to sit up she shimmied her way out of the car. Right as she escaped the car her bulging belly pushed against the horn. The nice loud honk made sure to attract the attention of several people in the parking lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat people saw was a clearly pregnant blonde woman walking into the hospital in her PJ's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot did her best to look nonchalant as she strolled/waddled into the building. Her shirt was doing it's best to hold up but her growing stomach had taken up most of the loose fabric. Her half exposed belly had slight goosebumps in the cold morning air. Next her breasts had turned into cantaloupes, her new found cleavage was on full display as her bigger breasts jiggled. Her new bra was already straining and she was praying she wouldn't have a repeat of the previous day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot walked through the front door and couldn't shake the feeling that all eyes were on her, she moved some of her messy hair out of the way as she made a beeline for the doctor's office. She couldn't shake the feeling that people were staring at her butt, and for good reason. Since the previous day her butt had doubled in size and even her stretchy pajama pants were having a tough time containing it. The crack of her butt as well as her overworked underwear were on display as she turned the corner and bumped into someone.</span></div></div>",

What really happened was as follows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bright sunny start to a new year at Greendale. After taking care of the incident that nearly burn The lovely campus to the ground, the students were ready to take on a new year studying Hospitality. \" You know, I swear I shouldn't have asked Shirley to choose this years topic\" Jeff said, walking across campus with Pierce. \" Come on Jeff, You started this group with Spanish, Annie chose Anthropology, Troy chose Biology because the teacher looked like he was from the wire. It was only fair we let the sexy fox that is Shirley choose his years class\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they entered the halls to C block, a smell of pastry and freshly baked cookies came wafting through the air. \"Troy and Abed have been baking\" said the dynamic duo as they open the doors. \" Annie taught us last night how much fun baking can be\" Troy said in his chefs showing Jeff and Pierce their Blorgon shaped cookies. \" That's right Troy, great work\" came a feminine voice. Up from behind the doors came a 35 year old woman that had log flowing black hair, curves of Nigella Lawson and the face of Audrey Hepburn. \" Oh I'm sorry, I didn't realise more students had come in, hello, I'm Miss Mayall, but you can call me Taliha.\" Said the lustrous teacher. \"Well I can see why the two youngings came to class\" Pierce whispered pervingly to Jeff. \" yeah I hear you, hi, I'm Jeff\" he said shaking her hand, looking straight into her enchanting eyes. Walking into class Jeff and Pierce were stopped by Miss Mayall. \" I'm sorry boys, but you can't come in until you wear what's needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross campus...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie, Shirley and Britta were at a sign up desk for some kind of medical trial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I dunno Britta, this seems weird\" Annie said looking at Shirley and Britta who already put their names down. \" oh come on are you going to let them experiment on animals? They have had enough already!\" Britta stated demandingly. \"Come on little Annie, it's just a female test thing, a thousand bucks a week just to try some pill? Surely you don't want to go back to that bad neighbourhood\" Shirley said trying to soothe her into doing it. \" I guess it would be helpful to medical science\" Annie surrended to her friends\" BUT then we go straight to class!\" Signing up they all took their one pill and headed to c block.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile at the deans office. Dean Craig Pelton rubbed his temples as he was on the phone with a medical commite. \" are you kidding me? Women becoming pregnant from these pills?\" The dean questioned quizzically \"The pregnancies speed up to a matter of days? Sometimes their pregnancies are stuck, permanently? And you are saying they have multiples?! I'm sorry but I cannot risk turning this community college into a day care centre! Wait, how much did you say you would offer? A QUATER OF A MILLION?! PER FORTNIGHT!? Hmmm well, if you say no one will get hurt, I guess we will have nothing to worry about, okay deal\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Drinking her drink. Suddenly Britta fell ill. Running to the nearest trash can she puked heavily into it. Annie came back to see Shirley doing her best to look nonchalant and Britta sounding like two Mooses fucking. \"What's wrong with her?\" Annie asked \" ah it doesn't matter, hey had no water, something about the plumbing not working.\" Sighing she drank the cups contents, completely. As she finished the drink, she saw Shirley holding her mouth and running for he bathroom and holding her mouth. \"Shirley?\" Was all that Annie could say before the pills took their affect. She resorted to the last possible place to go, the bushes outside. As Britta finished, she could see people coming in for lunch. Grabbing Annie they ran outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPierce waited outside c block. Eating his freshly made dish he saw that someone spray painted 'ock' next to the c.

Delicous?\" Jeff sarcastically said trying to stop him from saying what he was going to say. \"Fantastic!\" Pierce said returning to his food. \" okay, by now you wapould have made a dick joke, who are you and what have you done with Pearce? Jeff said looking at the older gentleman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" oh this is Pearce, but I have started taking this drink to regulate my anxieties and exaggeratings . Who knows what would happen to me of I lost control of my mind.\" Pearce contiued  rambling as Jeff looked around, \" hey where is Shirley, Britta and Annie?\" Jeff asked, \" they weren't here for the first lesion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows, let's try the library.\" Pierce said. They got up and headed towards the library, past an unwell Vicki and asian Annie running with their arms around their stomachs to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaliha was in her office, watching Downton Abby when Dean Craig Pelton came in. \"Ah hello Taliha, I hope the plumbing wasn't an issue through class today.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well after I took the pill I was sick, but I battled through it until the end of class, oh you mean the water plumbing, no it was okay, it can be washed up tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

That morning at the precinct, they were finishing some paperwork at their desks when they were approached by Captain Holt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, you two. I just received word that there's a drug deal happening at the docks in about half an hour. Peralta, I'd like you to accompany Santiago to help stop it,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On it!\" Amy said as she stood up, her enthusiasm evident even this early in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake scratched his head. \"Come on, Captain! It's Valentine's Day! Shouldn't you be a little happier than you usually are? I mean, I know that's hard, since you're always so chipper, but still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peralta, rest assured I am absolutely giddy on the inside. Docks. Thirty minutes. Don't let them get away with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Holt returned to his office, leaving them alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Jake,\" Amy said, and they left the precinct and headed towards the docks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the docks, Amy and Jake sat in a car across the street from where the deal was supposed to go down. Amy was using binoculars to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to do tonight?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake, we have the office party. Remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake sighed. \"Do we really have to go to that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be fun! There's gonna be alcohol, too...\" Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I do like alcohol. Is that them?\" Jake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed to a man and a woman standing suspiciously on the sidewalk across from them. They stood in front of a crate, and they appeared to be waiting for someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it. Let's go,\" Amy said, exiting the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake followed her lead, and they approached the man and woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You here for the pills?\" the man asked under hushed breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake nodded. \"Yeah. We're here for you, too. NYPD, you're under arrest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake and Amy flashed their badges, and the crooks shook their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! I told you we should have been more discreet!\" the woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then the buyers wouldn't have been able to find us!\" the man replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey shoved them into the back of the car and returned to the precinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, officers,\" Captain Holt said as Jake and Amy entered the office with the crate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Captain!\" Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we go home now? I think we've done enough for today,\" Jake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake nodded. \"Right. Thought I might give it a shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Holt looked at the crate on the ground. \"What's in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea. One of them mentioned that they were pills, but I don't know exactly what they are,\" Amy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolt nodded. \"Put it in the evidence room for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day went by as normal, and eventually the Valentine's Day party began.</span></div></div>",

The two couples conversed slowly, feeling awkward as the only people there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dIm gonna grab something to drink, ease the ol\u2019 awkwardness. Want anything?\u201d Jake asked Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYeah, grab me a drink as well. Talking about different ways to cook vegetables gets really old, really fast!\u201d Amy whispered back, trying not to let Boyle hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake returned with two drinks in his hand. The two downed their drinks quickly and resumed their conversations. As time passed, more and more people turned up, giving Jake and Amy an opportunity to talk about something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Amy was sat down with Boyle in the break room, talking about his son, Nickolaj.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dAw Charles! His little police costume is so cute!\u201d Amy said, fawning over the pictures on Boyles phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYeah, he said he wants to be just like his Daddy!\u201d Boyle replied, smiling proudly. \u201dYou know he would love a little playmate\u201d he added, nudging Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOh no, not yet. Jake and I both don't think that were ready for a kid yet\u201d Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dAw come on, you guys would ace it! Nickolaj loves it when you guys babysit!\u201d Boyle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWhen we\u2019re ready, we'll tell you first, Charles\u201d Amy said. \u201dBut please don't tell us about \u2019optimum positions or whatever\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the evening wore on, and more drinks were drunk, people started to get hazy. Amy tried her best to look sober, but only added to her drunkenness, slurring more and more words as she spoke. She stumbled into the evidence locker, and found Gina and Rosa stood, discussing something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWhat\u2019re youu two doing?\u201d she stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dGina says wee should retry these pills\u201d Rosa replied, equally drunk as Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWhat, no-one will know if three are gone!\u201d Gina added, not quite as far gone as the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh what the hell, Amy thought, grabbing one of the pills and swallowing it whole. It tasted sweet as she swallowed it, and she opened her mouth to show the other two. \u201dA-all done!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina and Rosa both quickly followed suit, swallowing the pills, and the three of them waited for them to kick in. They waited a few minutes before realising that nothing was gonna happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThat sucked, \u201d Rosa said, sounding slightly annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThey t-tasted good though!\u201d Amy said, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while the party began to quiet down and everyone started to leave, Jake and Amy included. The two grabbed a taxi back to their apartment, and as soon as they got in, they were all over each other, making out and undressing easily on the way to their bedroom.</span></div></div>",

Jake we need to go, we\u2019re late!\u201d She exclaimed, rubbing her temples to soothe her headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake simply groaned in response and didn\u2019t move from his spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Jake, seriously!\u201d She said, getting up and out of bed, trying to work through her hangover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo early\u201d he grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts almost 8:30. Oh god, Holt is going to be so mad!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Jake crawled out of bed, but by that point Amy had already gotten dressed, had breakfast and was ready to go. She sat i the kitchen and waited for Jake, holding her head in her hands and sipping on a cup of coffee. Jake walked out of their bedroom, dressed and ready to go, and the two set off to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived at the precinct they both put on a pair of dark sunglasses and made a brisk walk into the building and then into the lift. The doors opened and they walked out and saw the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharles was sat with his head on his desk doing some paperwork, looking like he was trying not to fall asleep, Gina was reclining in her chair with a pair of thick sunglasses on, scrolling through her phone. Rosa was working on some files, lazily sifting through the pile on her desk, and the sarge was sat at his desk, completely fine, tucking into a blueberry yougurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake and Amy quickly walked to their desks and sat down, thankful that almost everyone was too hungover to notice them come in late. Terry gave the two of them a look of slight disappointment and amusement, leaving both of them sighing and settling into their seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeralta, Santiago, come into my office\u201d Captain Holt said, sounding too loud for the hungover members of the nine nine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake and Amy both walked gingerly into the captains office, and sat on his couch, sinking into the cushions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI noticed that the two of you were late. Peralta, I expected, but Santiago..\u201d he said, leaving Amy with a horrified look on her face. \u201cHowever, since it was the Valentines party last night i will let the two of you off\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you sir, it won\u2019t ever happen again\u201d Amy said, trying to sound enthusiastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDismissed\u201d he said, and the two detectives walked back to their desks.</span></div></div>",

She wandered around the apartment aimlessly for a while, taking several breaks to vomit. She eventually got some paperwork to finish, to take her mind off her illness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake walked into the precinct, and walked to his desk, sitting down opposite amys empty seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Charles, where are Rosa and Gina? Still sick?\u201d He asked, starting to get to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that virus is still with them.
