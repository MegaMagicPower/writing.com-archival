            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You could say that I'm overly prepared or obsessive about my neighbor. Heck, I might know them better than how their own families do. But first, let me introduce myself, and then I'll introduce you (indirectly) my neighbors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy name is Daniel Pecino and if you recognize the origins of last names, you might think I'm either Chinese or Filipino. Let's just say I'm Asian. I look and behave like the average Asian-American college student. I do good in school and I'm a bit nerdy sometimes. You could say I'm the stereotypical Asian kid. Trained to be obsessed with homework and exams and having little to no social life. Well, this year, as one of my resolutions, I wanted to change all that. Along with getting high marks in school, I would like to have the average American social life, where a quarter (is that a bit too much?) or at least a tenth (good number) of the student body at least has seen me before in passing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo enough about me. Here are my neighbors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, is Dave. He lives in the apartment above mine. He's a cool dude, mainly because he plays the guitar and he sings too. I can tell he's a big Incubus band, even in this day and age. Reminds me of the good old days. The only annoying thing is that he always has parties every other Friday and the music he plays is very loud sometimes (the police has warned him about the disturbance on numerous occasions. The other neighbors tolerate the music only until midnight. After hours, it becomes a hassle. The best thing to do is go out rather than stay home, but I'm the stereotypical Asian student. I have no time to do that stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond is Richard, who lives next door, but everyone who knows him (and even staff and professors) address him as 'Ricky.' He's just like me meaning that he's Asian, but that's where the similarities end. Instead of being the smart guy, Ricky is the party-goer. He actually isn't at his apartment most of the time, since he usually has either class or some party to go to. Another quality he has is that he's very health-conscious and many times, he has only pants on and on hot days, he likes to expose his toned torso glistening with his sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThird is Rebecca. She's an art major who lives right below me. I walked by her open door when she was first moving in and I found her whole place littered with canvases, both blank and painted on. Her idea of neat is much more different than most people. Even to this day, she has boxes of materials stacked outside her apartment. Rumors in the apartment say she's a lesbian and eat an extreme vegan diet. She is also seen at many rallies and protests on campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFourth is Quentin, who like Ricky is an athlete, a giant of a man who lives right across from my apartment in the opposite apartment building, meaning the courtyard is right below us and between us two floors down. He's the model football player, and possibly the only black male living in this apartment complex. He's also a jock and has done wrestling and weight lifting. Despite his tough exterior, he is very friendly, especially to women. Often times, he is always offering to carry heavy loads for the women living in the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd last but not least, is Michelle. As far as I can tell, she's just like me. Asian. Smart. Good Grades. The only difference would be that she is attractive and more popular than me, at least I assume that's the case. She lives in the apartment next-door, opposite Ricky's apartment. The reason I suspect she is more popular than me is that every week or so, she gets a small package delivered to her door. When I see her get the package, she has this bright smile on her face, as if she is love with the sender. This is most peculiar. Even if I spy on her from the staircase, there is no sign of the sender nor does the packages change. Yes, they may change in size once or twice a year (yes, it's been that long), but the timing is always on the dot. If only I could be in her shoes. She must be more better off than me in the social aspect of our lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo which of my neighbors should we interact with first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Choice with an extra (*) at the end is the recommended storyline]</span></div></div>",

Heck, she lives just next door. But how should I go about interacting with her? Do it the neighborly way and knock on her door and strike a conversation? Or do it the suave kind of way that is totally fake and totally not my current character? How do I know she'll be home anyway? She could be in class for all I know. If she's home, would she open the door to someone like me? What if I choke on my words or blabber something inappropriate out? Why am I even worrying about interacting with her? It's unlikely I would meet up with worst-case scenario right off the bat, but who knows? I certainly don't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this time I'm contemplating what to do, I hear a series of knocks on my door. My alertness rises and I wonder who could be behind the door. Is it Michelle, the very target of my current goal of interacting with my neighbors? Or someone else entirely? Could the universe have altered time and space completely that I'm bound to meet one of the my other neighbors? My question distract me and I sense that the knocking on my door has grown impatient and the intensity of the rapping at the door has increased, almost like it is kicking rather than knocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk to the door and quickly look out the peephole. It's neither Michelle nor my other neighbors, but an unrecognizable man in a brown shirt and pants. He has something in his hands but I'm not quite sure what it is. I open the door anyways. To my surprise, it's none other than a man who has come to my door to deliver a package, one that's familiarly small. In his hands is the signature pad with connected stylus, which he hand over to have me sign. I sign it quickly and exchange his device with the box, which indeed is addressed to me. I close the door and carry the box to my bedroom. Using a knife, I cut the tape and open the package. The box contains mostly packaging peanuts and scrap paper that protects what looks like a charm in a different language wrapped with a clear plastic sleeve. Fortunately, I know how to read the language the inscription is written in and I read it out. \"I hereby accept my role as beneficiery,\" I read the charm aloud. It's weird to think that I get a package that's huge, but get something this pathetic and useless with it. Disappointed, I throw the box, with the packaging peanuts and meaningless charm in the trash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis little event with the package has surely been a thorn at my side and just because of that, I give up the opportunity of interacting with Michelle, my neighbor. For some reason, I start to feel tired, even though I just woke up two hours ago. I feel fatigued so much that I slump down on the floor, stomach-down. The last view I see is of my door and the fact that I neglected to lock it. The next moment, fatigue has stricken me and I doze off into a forced slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment I come to I hear light knocking on my door. The rapping escalates to a more harder knock with a voice that calls out into the apartment. It's a girl's voice. The door knob open and in comes...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho enters my apartment?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Choice with an extra (*) is the recommended storyline]</span></div></div>",

The person has long brunette hair and is wearing a bright outfit of pink and baby blue. \"Cesar? You're door was unlocked, so I just let myself in. You seem to have a package at the door... are you alright?\" she asked in her sweet gentle voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy whole body feels numb and in some places, it seems like the body parts, the muscles and the nerves are coming back to life. The whole pins-and-needles-type of sensation. All I can do is lay there like a heavy log with no feeling or ability to move at all. When my head slump back down on the ground, sending a boom through my ears, the voice shouts out in concern for me. \"Cesar! Oh god!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't explain it, but despite being almost completely numb throughout my whole body, I can feel the woman taking my body and dragging it across the room to the couch. All my senses are completely blocked except for part of my touch and all of my hearing. I cannot not even see at this moment, but the voice continues to talk to me. I can only listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The package you got today... I remember the first day I got it. It was two years ago. Do you remember somebody else living in my current apartment? Well, the owner didn't change, so to speak... he just changed his gender. Not willingly... Whoever sends us these packages.... I don't know how, but somehow he can find us where we are at our lowest or weakest and somehow.... somehow can change our fates. You and I, we're not at all that different from each other. But there no knowing what you'll become. It's just this one painful transformation and you pick up from where you left off or start anew. At our benefactor gives us that freedom. So don't be all that disappointed. This is for your own good... I think,\" she tells me. \"Say, do you still have that charm with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't explain the next moments. Somehow I have a fraction of the ability to speak but only a fraction. I have just enough energy to say a word and lift my hand and express my hand as if I'm pointing with my index finger. In just a second or two I do what I have to do, pointing towards the kitchen and saying in a ragged, raspy voice, \"Trash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can sense the woman getting up from the side of the couch where she was seated all along and go over to the kitchen, I hear her gasp pretty clearly and I imagine her finding a discard box, packing peanuts and the charm resting in the trash. But for some reason, the universe gives me only that moment before it takes my senses away and all I can do is drift back into slumber again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next time I come to (very weird why I'm this tired) I find myself transformed, but into what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Choice with an extra (*) is the recommended storyline)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As I drift out of a dreamless slumber and into consciousness, the immediate sensation I feel is soreness. It affects my arm, legs and abdomen, but unusually I feel the opposite in the general area of my crotch, chest and even my scalp. The sensation I experience is similar to throbbing swelling, though not in a bad way. It's akin to a mild swelling, though with my eyes closed I can't tell how mild it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI find that I have the strength to move my body, but only barely due to how sore I am. Did I go through an intense full-body workout without having any recollection of it or is it the fact that I've been limited to laying on my couch for a full day yesterday? I discover the only movement I can muster at the moment is being able to open my eyes, but when I do, it is revealed to me that there are long brunette locks covering my face. I try to blow them aside, but the sheer volume of the hair is too much for my focused breathed to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis when I lift my arms and hands to my face despite feeling the hardness of my muscles. I'm able to perform it while enduring the uncomfortable sensation in my arm, but when I do, I surprised myself. My fingers part the locks aside so that they flank my temples and cheeks, but in the next moment I tuck the locks behind my ears. My fingers also feel upon more strands of hair and this is when it gets serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat motion of my fingers tucking long locks behind my ears is a shock. I don't recall having a mane of hair like that. I spring up into a sitting position, regretting it every second as I push against the soreness in my body. I manage to get to my feet, but I realize as I do, I grunt and groan, but in such a way that it's similar to a woman moaning. When I push myself into a standing position, that's when it hits me. As my jeans and white briefs drop to the floor, bunching up about my ankles, I unwittingly cause myself to trip when I try to rush for the bathroom to assess the \u201cdamage.\u201d My ankles and my feet are doomed to get caught in the denim and cotton and with my center of balance teetering forward too far, I fall face-down towards the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to break my fall with my hands is met with shock to my already sore arms, which give way from the immediate pressure and they buckle at the elbow, failing to keep my upper body from hitting the ground, which is an even more shocking sensation. The what I assume is swelling on my chest is indeed a type of swelling that when it's squeezed between my weight and firm carpet, even through my button-up shirt, I realize that the swelling is a pair of breasts, soft and round. I yelp at the unfamiliar  and uncomfortable sensation and push myself up. Kicking my jeans and underwear away, I dash for the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere in the mirror I see a rather attractive young woman with a slender figure and long brunette hair. She's wearing the shirt I chose to wear yesterday and as she wears it on her person, it's clear that's she's shorter than me as well as smaller. I should realize that my wide, yet narrower hips could not fill up the jeans that caused me to trip, but it's the fact that I no longer have something dangling between my legs that gets hard when I'm aroused that I realize more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could calm down and try to make sense of things, but a knock at the door interrupts my train of thought. I look out the doorway of the bathroom and see that the door is still unlocked from yesterday. The doorknob turns and the door is opened. Whoever is behind the door pushes it in. The person is revealed to be...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Choices with an extra (*) is the recommended storyline]</span></div></div>",

He looks like he's been out for a run, very typical of the captain of the football team. He scans the place and easily finds .e peeking at him from the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seems like he's the one at fault and doesn't dare take another step forward into the apartment. He quickly apologizes, \"Sorry. I didn't mean to intrude. Your door was unlocked and I seem to just let myself in. A man in a suit came by knocking on your door for what seemed like a long minute and gave up and left this package on your doorstep.\" Quentin turns to reach behind him and when he turns back he reveals a rather large box, placing it near the entryway into the small kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking this an opportunity of a lifetime, even though I'm not in my own body, I step out of the bathroom, a part of me comfortable of the fact that Quentin doesn't know who I am while the other part is ashamed I'm practically naked dressed in this shirt of mine. Slowly, but surely, I make it to where Quentin and the box are placed in the room. \"Thanks Quentin,\" I say with no hesitation one second and awkwardly realizing that I've made a grave mistake the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you know my name?\" the jock asks inquisitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I'm screwed and have to explain myself.

I know Cesar and he's not the kind to lean over to the other side. You almost got me with that, girl, but tell Cesar that it was a good prank,\" Quentin says, barely containing his laughter. He lets go of my hand and walk around me to the locked front door. He unlocks it and steps out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't really know how to feel. I'm mostly just shocked to experience that reaction. It wasn't along the lines of what I was expecting. There is a heaviness that weighs on my heart and it feels that it's a struggle to breathe. Before worse comes to worse, I hear the door swing open behind me. I suspect it's Quentin again, but I realize, that's too good to be true. \"Cesar?\" the familiar voice of Michelle asks with a concerned tone. I immediately turn around and see her wearing an off shoulder top. For some reason, she says nothing else and immediately embraces me in her arms. It's at this moment that I start to reali8ze that I've been silently crying. the squishing of my breasts against Michelle's is no longer awkward and the pressure from the hug is actually comforting. So comforting in fact, that in the next moment the dam that kept my tears from falling breaks and I allow myself to cry. It's like this emotional event is allowing me to vent this stress in a producting way that's definitely suited to my female state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout talking, Michelle guides me to the living room where she takes a seat before letting me lay my head on her lap. Like a mother comforting a daughter, she gently caresses my head and hair until I'm calm enough and out of tears to start talking. \"I told Quentin the truth about me, about me being Cesar, but in a woman's body,\" I say out of the blue. \"Quentin didn't take it the way I was expecting him to. He thought it was a joke to my face and left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh hon, you poor thing,\" Michelle commented. \"Why didn't you tell him that you were my cousin that Cesar allowed to stay in his apartment for the summer while he was gone. I would believe it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking of saying that, but I was worried he might find out eventually,\" I reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least you told the truth. That should count for something. Maybe ye'll get a chance tio make it up to you,\" Michelle adds. \"You know, it's Friday and I don't have plans tonight. Why don't you join me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've always wanted a chance to ask Michelle out on a date. Perhaps this is fate telling me it would be improbable for me to do that as a guy and more likely to accomplish the feat as a woman. What should we do tonight?</span></div></div>",

Is that you?\" she asks, leaning to one side so that she could get a better look at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't reply. Instead I reveal myself and leave the bathroom, showing her that I'm only wearing the oversized button-up shirt on my obvious petite figure. The sleeve go past the tips of my fingers and the top two button that are undone threaten to ease the shirt in slip off my slender body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sense of despair overwhelms me and I fall to my knees. Fortunately, Michelle is fast enough in coming to my aid and keeping me upright. She guides me to the couch and sits me down. She takes a seat intimately right beside me. Her arm wraps around my back and rests upon my hip. The feeling of contact is not at all uncomfortable, just unfamiliar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happened to me?\" I ask, on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, hon. Whoever is sending you these packages has given you an opportunity for a better life,\" she tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why turn me into a woman?\" I ask once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. Take it from me. I've been an attractive woman for two years. Worrying about the why's and why not's did not get me anywhere. There will come a time where you have to just move on and live your life. You are a beneficiary after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A beneficiary?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're someone who receives assistance on a regular basis. In our case, it's mostly monetary with the occasional gift and every week we get something. If you want proof, you can check your bank statements for today. You should have gotten a hefty amount deposited directly into your account.\" Michelle gets up and finds my cell phone on the coffee table. She tosses the phone towards me and I catch it, noting how awkward if feel to brush against the sides of my breasts with my arms as I'm catching the device. I open up my banking app and there on the screen, I behold an amount that seems to good to be true. A total sum of two grand has been deposited into my checking account from a unfamiliar account. There is no name. Only a routing number. \"Should be up to two grand for starters.\" I look up at Michelle with dwindling doubt as she mentions the close guess of the deposit. \"Believe me now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why turn me into a woman?\" I ask again, trying to get a definitive answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I truly can't answer that. Only your Benefactor has the reason.\" Michelle goes for the door, but turns around to bid me farewell. \"I'm going to go on my run. Do me a favor and just open the packages you have. They will probably give you clues for your question. Heck, maybe your Benefactor left you a letter or note.\" With that, she leaves, closing the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding the soreness fading a bit, though half of it still lingering throughout my body, I get up from the couch and towards the door. I make sure to lock it this time. I want to be careful, since with no security on my door, anybody, like a guy, could enter and see me in my current state and take advantage of me. I realize my train of thought and I wonder why I'm worrying about that kind of scenario. I turn around and walk back into the dining area of my apartment. There on the table are the two packages that I've gotten so far after finding that charm. I suddenly realize that this, my transformation into an attractive woman, is all because of me reciting the inscription. An average Joe who did not study Asian language and calligraphy probably wouldn't even make sense of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore me are the second and third packages I've received. The second is much bigger than the first and the third, yet the third is the familiarly-sized package that Michelle gets every week without fail. Which package should I open?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Choices with an extra (*) is the recommended storyline]</span></div></div>",

From what I can tell, he is as dark as a Hispanic guy but built like a mixed-martial artist who's Samoan. This is all I see as he walk further into the room and I quickly hide deeper into the bathroom. In my haste, I accidentally turn off the lights, which should be a sure sign of my presence. He looked something like a hit man, gang member, mercenary, or kidnapper and his purpose of being here was to take my now-vulnerable self away to his lair or dungeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nin the quiet of the apartment I can hear his footsteps on the carpet, drawing ever so closer to the bathroom. It's when he steps on a creaky floorboard underneath the carpet where I make my move, even if it's in vain. I lunge for the man and as I suspect, he easily counters it by embracing me from behind and wrapping his arms across my front where he pins my arms underneath his. He surprisingly falls back to the floor just to keep me away from anything I can use in my defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scolds into my ear, \"Trying to hurt yourself, girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurt myself? I thought you were the one trying to hurt me!\" I shout back, though by now I'm out of breath from the scuffle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't the one lunging out of nowhere. You were the one doing that. I was only defending myself and trying to prevent you from breaking your furniture,\" he tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter catching my breath, I ask, \"Why did you walk into my apartment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"i was sent to deliver a package but also to send a personal message in person. Out of habit, I twisted the door knob and it opened. That's a sure sign something bad happened, so I walked in to make sure. I didn't know the girl who lived here was crazy though,\" he says, almost finishing with a joke. In retaliation, after finding freedom for one of my forearms, I deliver a striking blow to the man's crotch. He weakens his grip and I bust out of his arms, get to my feet and back away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI expect him to get up just as quick and lunge for me, but instead I find him still on the floor reeling from my attack. \"Damn girl! What was that for?\" He gets up and quickly grabs the collar of my shirt which unwitingly unbuttons the top two buttons. He pulls the collar with eyes that are simmering in rage. I feel that my actions are to blame and that I'm in for a beating, but at the last second, his phone rings. He answers it, \"Hello? Oh Sir,\" opening his hand in the process. I slump down on my ass but in fear, I stay put.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man exits the apartment and I sit there waiting for him to come back. I wait for what seems like five minutes. When he comes back he tells me simply to get ready. His boss has asked for me and this man is my escort. All I need is in the two boxes that have been delivered. The small one from yesterday and a big one that the man apparently was sent to deliver to me. The man says nothing more, only that any questions I have should be saved for his boss. He exits the apartment saying he is waiting outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I do?</span></div></div>",

Yes, I may be in a body that is not of my choosing, but what to do with the body should be up to me? I decide not to follow the rude guy's orders and stay put. I don't take a look at the boxes on my table even I envied my neighbor Michelle whenever she got hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wonder. What kind of reaction did Michelle have when she received her first anonymous package? Did a strong man enter her apartment and tell her to open the boxes and get ready? Well, it's a bit different since I made the mistake of leaving my door unlocked, but still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll these questions I have and I realize that I'm still naked with my shirt on. Having no bra to support these new melons on my chest and a panty to cover my crotch does put up a problem. I simply can't goes out like this and expect to buy clothes for my female body with no one staring at me. I look at the door once more and realize that once again I've left the door unlocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk over and reach for the door knob, but before I can twist the lock and engage the bolt, the door opens and that rude man from before appears behind it. He has a pissed-off look on his face. Before he gives me another scolding he closes the door and locks. Good riddance on his part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI back away towards the dining room, unwittingly backing myself up to the dining table. The man draws the gap and stands inches away from me.  \"Didn't I tell you to get ready five minutes ago?\" he scolds me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna stay mister. You can tell your boss I said no thanks,\" I reply. I reach behind me and take the small package in my hand. Without thinking, I swiftly bring the package up to slam it against the side of his head. He is immediately shocked and stumbles back, stepping on a black trash bag filled with discarded junk mail and useless magazines. He slips back, hits his head against the wall and falls to his knees. Knocked out cold, he has no sense to break his fall with his hands and he leans and lands hard towards the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dramatic scene, even though it might have been funny in another context, has me concerned for the guy and I start feeling guilty for attacking him in this manner. I immediately tend to him and start asking if he is okay. The feeling of guilt starts to boil in my gut and I start to act desperate, thinking that I've genuinely hurt the guy. \"Hey mister! Please tell me you're okay, I didn't mean it, I'm sorry, I really am!\" I frantically exclaim to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hits me. Having done a first aid class I start to remember the procedure, the order of which I have to check for vital signs. Well, the order is a bit jumbled and I can't quite remember most of it. the part I do recall is checking for breathing and checking the pulse. I place a finger under his nose and faintly feel a steady breath exhale. I succesfully find a vein and find the pulse is actually in a resting state. He may be out cold, but he's resting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there is another problem. What to do with the body? What should I do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He'll probably be mad too since this is the second time I've tried to attack him. It would be a good idea to move his body someplace that's not in my field of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI go ahead and pull the guy from his shoulders, with my hands gripping his armpits. I immediately discover that with this new body of mine, I'm not as strong as I would like to be. It's definitely a struggle to just drag him a few inches. What would have taken me 30 minutes, it has taken me three times that. At least a third of that time was devoted to lifting the man's weight up and on top of my bed. I lay his head on a pillow and with my work done, I take a deep breath. I take a look around and remember that this room with posters of guy stuff, this definitely used to be a room belonging to my original self. Taking into consideration the improbability and impossibility of the events that made me a girl, I don't there is anything I could do to reverse whatever has happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear the man groan behind me and it startles me. For a moment there, I thought he was about to wake up. I get up and turn around and find he has not come to. I retrace my steps and close the door behind me as I walk out. As I get back to the dining room, I see the boxes on the table. One is a large box, which the guy brought in and the other is a small box from yesterday. I throw caution to the wind even though it might have been that charm a couple of days ago that has made me into what I am now. There's no worrying about that now, but there is something that Michelle mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said I'm a beneficiary, which would mean these packages would be from a benefactor. My benefactor. Whoever he or she is, they must have a reason for sponsoring me. Is it because I'm a dpressed scholar who wants to break out and start socializing? Or is it karma coming to bite me back after all those years in my childhood that had me wondering what it would feel like to be a woman?

Using whatever strength my female hands and arms have, I manage to rip the flaps open and expose the box's contents. When I was using it to deliver a stunning blow to the guy laying in my bed, I noticed that it was w bit heavy for a small package. Now I know why. Contained in the small cardboard cube is a leather wallet with a small stack of cards. The cards include a debit card and a credit card, which has a note stuck to it that says, \"Emergency Only.\" The next card I find is a driver's license with all the information of this female body. My name is no longer my previous name. The cardholder's name reads, \"Rosario Lee.\" A unique first name paired with a very common last name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the card stack is another card that simply reads, \"For requests to your Benefactor please call,\" and then a phone number that is printed underneath. I take out the card stack and wallet and find more at the bottom of the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking much of the space underneath is a new smartphone that I haven't even seen before plus its charger. I take it out and try to turn it on but a convenient red light blinking in the corner tells me I would need to charge it first. I take the phone and it's charger and plug it into the wall. The blue light which replaced the red light is the indication that it's charging. I stand up straight but freeze as I hear a familiar groan behind me. It's the man who I hit finally awake. I must have not hit him that hard. After clearing his throat, he says...?</span></div></div>",

Before I can retaliate with a groin shot with my leg, he pushes me towards the wall and pins me against it, using his weight to secure me. \"You wouldn't want someone you just knocked out to wake up and wander around. I'm glad I brought mine, though. This way, I can control you and prevent you from hurting me or your own self.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do you think you are?

He throws me against the bed, but fortunately my fall is cushioned by the pillows and blankets. It's the hand-cuffs, which I had no idea they were on the guy, that's put me in an awkward position. The man walks in and closes the door behind him. \"Let's start over, since our first moment meeting was rather unusual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI manage to turn over onto my back and push myself up to the side of the bed, where I take a seat.

I was here to deliver a package and out of habit I opened the door. I didn't know it was going to be unlocked.

It's clear that I've been backed into a corner with my only means of escape being the door that sitting right behind this man.

There was just one thing you left out. If you were staying in this place, you probably would need clothes to wear. When I came in, there was no luggage, not in this living space and neither in the room. What I did find was your clothes that you left over here.\" He picks up my pants along with my boxer shorts. \"You must've literally woken up and had your clothes slide off your petite body. The only thing that was left was that shirt you're wearing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now that you know what and who I am, what are you going to do now?\" I ask, slowly approaching him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll guess I'll stay here. There's nothing much for me to do that to deliver the packages to you and Michelle. As far as your Benefactor knows, he probably doesn't even know I'm in here. So, don't mind me,\" he replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I supposed to do now?\" I ask, clearly clueless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man gets up from the couch and walks over to me. \"I don't know. Live your life, even though it's going to be unfamiliar and very different from your old life. For starters, why don't you put some clothes on,\" he says to me and carefully takes the collar of my shirt that he peeled down my shoulder in the room and puts it back in place. \"Why don't you open that other box? It probably has clothes. What I know about your Benefactor is that he won't stop giving you packages.\" He leaves me for he kitchen where he starts rummaging through the refrigerator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscovering he is not much a threat than I initially assumed, little by little I start to relax. I go over to the table and take a seat, placing the larger unopened box in front of me. Finding the box is much more tightly sealed, I call over to the guy who now has taken some food out to eat. \"Can you hand me a knife, please?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you can stab me in the back with it?\" the man says, clearly being a smart-ass. He looks through several drawers and grabs one from the drawer where I know where knives are stored. \"Here,\" he says as he hands me a small paring knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take the knife and cut all the tape that has secured the box shut.

I pick a black bra with a risqu\u00e9 thong, both in a lacy material. I closed the door (but again forget to lock it) and quickly take off the shirt I have on, tossing it aside on the floor. Putting on the thong is easy, but it's a bit unfamiliar since the material gently slides up the crack of my buttocks. The harder part is putting on the. I slip my arms under the straps and allow the bra to cup my breasts. In the full-size mirror hanging off a portion of the wall that's between my door and the closet, I see that the bra actually pushes up my breasts and gives me an illusion that they are more fuller. I have to reach behind my back to fasten the bra with the hooks, but my male mind feels like it is impossible. It's only when I actually perform the feat that I discover that I have much more flexibility than I initially think. It's much more possible for me to do this with my body and its flexibility rather than if I were to do it as a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your ass is fine in that thong,\" the man's voice speaks behind me.

I take a minute to lock the door after closing it behind me before heading back to the dining room.

Not only that, any wrappers or foils are thrown in the trash and the dishes are done. I can feel a burden lifting from my shoulders and the corner of my mouth rising. Yes, the guy's a jerk and smart-ass sometimes, but in the very least, he knows how to do chores. I leave the kitchen and I'm immediately startled by a high-pitched alarm of some kind. I look on the counter and find that there is a green light in the corner of the smartphone instead of a blue pulsating one. The phone must be fully charged by now. I unhook the cable and turn the device on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a flashy start-up animation, the home page of the phone pops up. In the notifications section at the top, I have several icons.

In the messages, I find a peculiar one sent by a Mr. Allende, which congratulates me of becoming a Beneficiary. After skimming through most of them, the message sent most recently from the same person tells me that my current deliveryman is being put under a 're-examination.'

How I did not realize it was stormy outside by now is beyond me, but the pressing matter is who could be at my doorstep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wonder if it's that deliveryman, who I realize hasn't told me his name yet. In retrospect, he doesn't even know my 'new' name yet. Or could it be someone else entirely. In the very least, my door isn't unlocked so I have no fear of anyone trying to open the door. I walk over to the door and unlock it. I twist open the knob and pull the door towards me. Before me, drenched from the rain is a man. In his lap is a package, which is also drenched from the rain, though I hope the contents inside are still dry. At first, I don't recognize the man, but when he tilts his head back, I see the familiar shape and features, though for a second there, the bloody lip and scratches on his cheek almost fool me into thinking it's someone different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's the jerk alright and it seems like he is in pain, as if the injuries to his face aren't superficial or someplace in his body he's hurting. He reaches his hand out to me as if he's in desperation to get in and for a second, I space out. It's his grunts and groans that tell me to do something and I grab his arm and using all of my womanly strength, I pull him to his feet. The package drops on the ground outside, but it's the wellbeing of this man that takes priority. I get him inside and using the wall to prop him up, I manage to remove his jacket. Luckily, it's only his jacket, pants, shoes, and hair that's wet. Wrapping his arm around my shoulder and using what strength I have to support him, I get him into my bedroom and straight on the bed. I take the time I have to get the box from outside and locking the door behind me before I tend to the man. When I get back to the bedroom, I discover that with the comfortable bed, he's already dozed off to sleep, giving me the chance to take off his shoes and pants. As I undress him, as if I wasn't a guy two days ago, I look away, preventing myself from seeing either boxer briefs or just briefs. Before I can get a glimpse, I toss the covers onto him. I toss the wet clothes into the laundry basket and take his shoes outside to the rear balcony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I do next? I clearly see the box I left on the table, which is actually much bigger than the last one I got. But are the contents inside more important than the well-being of the man in my bedroom? Or should I just leave everything for tomorrow?</span></div></div>",

He only does this before climbing back into the bed with his back facing the door. I consider the fact that me being in there and watching over him to be an increase of my womanly attraction to his male character.

That's before I open my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe increase in comfort is surely not a dream. I wake up to find myself in my own bed with my favorite down blanket covering me and full-sized fluffy pillows to cushion my head. I also remember its here that I laid that man to rest. As its morning already, I look over and see that his space in empty and I'm on the other side of the queen-sized bed. Did he carry me while I was still asleep from the sofa to the bed? Did he do anything else?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy second question is answered when I finally sit up and remove the covers. I'm still wearing my bra, thong and makeshift tank-top-shirt. So no, he didn't do anything inappropriate to me. But where could he have gone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I leave the room, I decide to change into clean clothes. I remove the tank top and before taking off the undergarments, I make sure to lock the door. Once it's locked and secure with no chance of opening, instead by force, I begin taking off my bra. I use the newfound flexibility of my arms to unfasten the hooks that keep the bra in place. In its place, I choose a light-blue sports bra just to save myself from fastening and fastening more hooks. I then take off the thong and replace it with a similar-colored thong. To cover it all, I take a short-sleeved shirt that I haven't worn since high-school, when I didn't hit puberty and didn't get my growth spurt until the age of 18. I put it on and find that it really fits me lengthwise. The bottom hem of the shirt end right at the bottom of my ads cheeks and if I use the same method to tie it along my hip, it shows a bit of my midsection. What I'm really bothered about is the collar which seems a bit too stretched, allowing one of my shoulders to peek out of the shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I'm done, I unlock the door and make my way outside to the living room.

Just the notion that he was okay after sleeping in my bed (even though he put me on the opposite side of it) would be somewhat of encouragement that I did the right thing. I walk further into the room and find the box on the table with a small note on top. The note reads: \"Made you a small breakfast to thank you. Please open the box, because you're tempting me whenever you have a thong on. I'll be back with another package.\" Again, he neglects to leave his name and our relationship is left at deliveryman and woman who had a male-to-female sex-change in two days. It's not that I want our relationship to be any different. I blame the hormones that might be at play. Directly behind the box is a plate that's covered with paper towels. I uncover it and there on the plate is piece of toasted bread, two eggs seasoned with salt and pepper and a turkey patty (since I have no sausages or bacon) in my refrigerator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a seat and proceed to eat the breakfast made for me with the provided fork. While I munch on the food, I go ahead and open the box. Inside I find a few items of clothes. What catches my first is the shortness of the denim shorts and board shorts. Underneath them are two pairs of pants. One of the pairs is denim jeans in a slim-fit sort of skinny-type design. The other pair is a pair of pajamas patterned with a navy blue and white diamond style. I could almost look at it like I'm looking at a navy blue atmosphere through a white chain-link fence. Following the note's instructions, I take the short shorts and put them on. For some reason, there is no need to know my size or tell anyone what my measurements are. I think I can honestly assume that whatever comes in the packages will be in my size (unless I drastically change my shape in the intervals between deliveries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at myself in the mirror and find that the shorts are actually short at all. In no time at all, I start to feel comfortable in them and I'm not as concerned about the extra skin of my legs showing either. I go back to the dining table to finish my breakfast and proceed to clean the dishes. After one chore is done, I start on the rest of the house, cleaning it as if it was still my own. I just wonder what my parents or siblings would think. Would they know that their son and their brother respectively was no more? Before I can ponder on more things, there is a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI go to the door in an almost excited sort of way and quickly open it. Who's behind the door?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I choose to open the bigger box, but when I do, something blunt hits somewhere in the area of my abck and neckline and I'm knocked out cold. When I come to, I feel a bunch of tension around my wrists, like my body weight is burdening them. I wake up and find that I'm suspended from the ceiling of my living room. I look up and find a pulley which hangs a rope that is wrapped around my wrists and the rest is tied to a hook off to the side. Though the wall to the side is farther off than the wall in my living room. And much of the rest of the apartment is shrouded in darkness. That's when I realize that this isn't my apartment at all. \"Where am I?\" I say aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're at my place,\" a familiar voice is heard behind me. With me dangling like this, it's hard to turn myself around without the help of an outside force. \"I decided this is something you should get after attacking me twice, Rosario.\" I realize the voice belongs to that man. I also find out that my name is Rosario instead of my male name before. I find out by the ID that the man holds out to me as he rounds to my front from behind me. There isn't anything sinister about this guy, but given the circumstances, there must be reason why this guy has me hanging here. \"You might have asked the question, but the answer is no, your Benefactor, your sponsor, did not order me to come get you. My boss isn't that kind of man. And I don't think he'd like who I found out you were to be. You've been hostile for no apparent reason when I met you. That's someone who my boss surely would not like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why keep me here? Why don't you leave me alone and go back to whereever it is you came from?\" I shout down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man chuckles and walks over to the side and unties the knot keeping me hanging above the floor. When he does though, I fall straight down and rather fast. When my feet land, my legs buckle and I teeter down hard onto my side. I realize I'm still wearing my man-sized shirt with nothing underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy thoughts and reverie gets the better of me and the man swiftly snatches me and easily drapes me over his shoulder. I definitely feel he's deliberately trying to take advantage of me. At once, he's off to another part of wherever he has me hold up in. Where does he take me?</span></div></div>",

Since I'm a college student living alone in my apartment, that would mean the five neighbors that I usually see at the apartment complex. It would be easy if I wasn't shy or timid or totally conscious of what I say or somebody who overthinks about the interacting part. Luckily, help comes my way in the most unusual of ways.</td>",
