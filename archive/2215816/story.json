He didn't know that when she had replaced the toothbrushes last month she had sent his off to the software company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah knew she could change the category later if she wished, but she still thought it important to choose carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were four categories to choose from:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 - Inanimate object. No matter how mundane it is, no matter how much it will repulse them, or excite them, turn your subject into any object you desire for as long as you desire. He / she will retain their human mind and thoughts, along with all of their senses but have no way to communicate with you themselves. WARNING If the item is damaged or a material change is made they could be stuck as the item in question permanently, or if not, then at least prevented from returning to their original form<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 - An animal. Turn your subject into any animal you like for as long as you like. They will retain their human mind, but this is the sum of the humanity they will retain. They will be dumb, just as the animal you turn them into is. WARNING: Be wary of taking your animal to the vets for certain procedures. The impact of any surgery a vet performs will remain when (if) returned to their original form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 - Body part - Turn your subject into a part of someone else's body. They will simply be one part of another person's body, regardless of gender or what it is. As ever, they will retain their own mind and senses yet be unable to communicate. Please note, this option often leaves your subject very sexually charged. This has the effect of influencing the owner's sex drive, albeit the subject gets no pleasure from this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4 - Gender Transformation - Turn your subject into someone of the opposite gender. Laugh as their new and old minds collide and they struggle to find their new identity. WARNING At this time the mental effects of this transformation can be permanent, even if reverted to their original gender<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled and started typing. She knew exactly what to do with Robert...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He maintained that it was something to do with seeing an elegant watch on a woman's dainty wrist. Sarah just thought it weird. However, she saw no reason not to use his fetish against him. Sarah clicked \"Wrist watch.\" A drop down box appeared asking for a duration. Sarah selected \"4 years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe filled out a few other details about where he was to be found before uploading a picture of the watch she wanted him to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pressed return a warning popped up on the screen reminding her that if any material changes were made to the watch he would not be able to change back at the end of the 4 year term unless that change was rectified first. Sarah pressed \"Accept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert was led in bed, sleeping after having worked a night shift when he awoke in immense pain. His arms shot up above his head while his legs and feet were suddenly pinned together. He tried to move but was paralysed. He tried to shout but his voice was gone. He then felt his arms and legs being pulled backwards behind him, further than should have been possible. It was incredibly painful. His arms and legs clipped together where they met, around some sort of cushion. A box seemed to develop around him and snapped shut. All light was blotted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert now waited, paralysed, unable to move and in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt length Sarah walked into their bedroom and saw the box sat on the bed. She opened it and marvelled at the speed and power of this computer programme and her new watch. Robert had been turned into...</span></div></div>",

She stroked the inside of the strap which was lovely and smooth and compared it to the bumpy outside. As she did this Robert sat in her hand, unable to move and trying to comprehend what was going on. Sarah stood up and moved to her dressing table where she held him up in front of her mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Robert a minute or two to work out what had happened as he stared at the mirror unable to see himself; just Sarah and this wrist watch. Sarah then draped Robert over her wrist. Deftly, she flicked her wrist over and closed the clasp. He hung loosely on her wrist: far too loosely. Robert was terrified that he would fall off, sliding around as she moved her arm<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah removed him from her wrist and examined him.

He felt so small in there was worried that he would get lost. As she shut her handbag his world was plunged into darkness. Robert didn't understand why she wasn't even bothering to wear him. What was she going to do? At length he felt the handbag being picked up as if Sarah was carrying it and walking somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the bag opened and Sarah's giant like hand reached in, searching for something: searching for Robert. She picked him out of her bag and laid him on a counter in front of another woman. His limited vision showed him that he was in a jewellers shop. The woman stood in front of him was not unattractive, though looked to be in her late thirties.<br>\r\n\"Can you just take one link out please?\" Sarah asked. The lady picked Robert up and took him into a back room where she set to work on removing a link from the bracelet. It hurt. Robert found that it was like having a piece of his body removed. He wanted to scream in agony but of course he couldn't. After just a couple of minutes she was done. She carried him back into the shop and placed him on his back on the counter in front of Sarah. Now that the pain of having a part of him effectively amputated had subsided Robert's mind started to clear. Sarah had made a material change to him. He didn't need it explained to him. He already knew that at the end of his 4 years he wouldn't be able to turn back unless she took him back to the jewellers shop and had the link put back in. Robert led on the counter in impotent rage. He wanted to scream, shout and give her a piece of her mind. Instead, powerless, he just led there like the inanimate object he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah paid, and then picked Robert up. She then placed him on her wrist again and buckled the clasp.<br>\r\n\"Much better,\" she commented. Robert found that he was still a loose fit, but it was nowhere near as loose as before. Sarah looked at him briefly and pushed him over the bony part of her wrist. Then she lifted her arm and gravity took over and he slid back down her arm. She lowered her arm and shook her wrist so that he naturally fell into place where she wanted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile a whole range of emotions were going through Robert's mind. First of all, rage. What right did Sarah have to do this to him? He was also angry at being treated like an object, even though that's what he now was, and letting gravity do the work to move him about. Yet he was also aroused. In fact he'd never been so aroused. He was aroused by the fact that he was being worn and touched. Every movement made him tingle.He realised that he was desperate to cum, but that was never going to happen. Object's don't cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill wearing me, Sarah walked out of the jewellers. Robert could only wonder where they were going to now.</span></div></div>",

It was soon evident that Sarah wasn't going home. She had been going for too long. She still gave Robert no clue as to where they were going though. But then why would she? He was just an object. For his part, he clung to her wrist, terrified that he would fall off and be lost forever. He needn't have worried though. He had a strong clasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt length Sarah stopped walking and rang a doorbell. When the door opened Robert recognised the voice. It was her friend Jenni. Jenni and Robert had never really got on. Sarah went in and took her coat off. As she did so Robert glinted from under her jumper.<br>\r\n\"Oh I like your watch, is it new?\" Jenni commented.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I got it today,\" Sarah smiled, stretching out her arm so that he could be seen properly. \"Do you want to try it on?\" Sarah took me off her wrist and handed me to Jenni. This proved to be another moment of impotent rage for Robert. He couldn't stand Jenni. He really didn't want to sit on her wrist. Oblivious to his feelings Jenni draped him over her wrist and fastened the clasp. Robert was a tighter fit on her wrist. She looked down at him.<br>\r\n\"It's lovely,\" she commented.<br>\r\n\"It's Robert,\" Sarah laughed.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n\"It's Robert. I bought this computer programme that gave me the power to turn him into anything I wanted. I chose this.\"<br>\r\n\"Fantastic,\" Jenni laughed.<br>\r\n\"He's going to get his cummuppence,\" Sarah giggled. \"I know he was cheating on me. Do you want to go out tonight? I feel like having some fun.\"<br>\r\nJenni removed Robert from her wrist and handed him to Sarah. \"Is he coming?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Sarah grinned.<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't miss it for the world then,\" Jenni giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening Jenni and Sarah went to a club. Wearing a short black top with no sleeves it was as if Sarah was showing Robert off, or ensuring that he saw everything. With a gorgeous body it was no surprise that Sarah attracted a man that evening and went home with him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Craig was his name: the man that took Sarah to his house. Robert felt so jealous. He was supposed to be her boyfriend, not this man. Robert was supposed to be the one to make her cum, to kiss and caress her. Instead this toned man was stripping Robert's girlfriend naked, grabbing her wrists, enveloping Robert in his big palms as he did so and pinning Sarah against a wall while he kissed her passionately. Robert's own emotions were in overdrive. Being touched, being held, being worn seemed to make him horny. It was mind-blowing. But while he was being worn by Sarah, it was Craig who was holding him in his manly hands. Robert didn't want a man making him horny!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt length Sarah and Craig found their way to his bedroom. As they fell onto the bed Sarah undid his pants and pulled down his underwear. She worked her way down his body, taking his cock in her mouth and holding the shaft with her left hand while Robert nestled in his genitals on her left wrist. Before he came he pulled her up to his face. Sarah went where she was commanded, but kept her left hand sandwiched between them, holding Robert where he could smell and taste Craig's dick. As he flipped them over into the male dominant position Craig grabbed both of Sarah's arms and pinned them above his head, where he held them as he penetrated her and started to have sex with her. Before long, he came. As he relaxed from his orgasm he rolled onto his back. Sarah rolled over and cuddled him, her hand on his penis and her watch nestled in his pubic hairs while she went to sleep. Robert felt repulsed yet again was powerless to resist or object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah awoke early the next morning and as she did so toyed with Craig's cock, teasing it to full tumescence. He woke up to Sarah masturbating it and presently spurted his seed into the air. Sarah expertly withdrew her wrist as he spurted and allowed his cum to land on her watch and on it's face. His sense of taste still present, Robert got to taste Craig's seed. Robert was repulsed. Sarah giggled, took him off her wrist and threw him onto Craig's bedside table, facing them so that Robert could watch them cuddle.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eventually Sarah and Craig got up. Sarah didn't pick her watch up though. It was left, still covered in his now cold yet sticky seed on his bedside table where he'd landed. Sarah got herself dressed and picked up her handbag. She then walked out of the room and Robert was left alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hours later when Craig walked back into the room. He was on the phone. He picked Robert up in his enormous hands.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's here,\" he said. \"You left it on my bedside table. I'll keep it for you until I see you again.\" As Craig hung up he rubbed the smooth back of the bracelet between his thick fingers. He then draped Robert over one wrist and looked down at him. Robert thought it was a small mercy that Sarah had removed a link, otherwise Craig would have been able to fasten him there. As Craig touched Robert feelings of excitement and delight rolled through him. It seemed that Robert was impervious as to who touched him: just being touched would be enough to sexually arouse him; not that such arousal would do him any good. At the same time Robert's homophobic side was coming through. He was disgusted and repulsed at himself for the fact that he was aroused by another man's touch. At length Craig dropped him down on his bedside table again where Robert would watch him sleep until he next saw Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later Craig picked the watch up. He dropped it into his trouser pocket before leaving his house. Inside his pocket was dark and hot. And so close to his genitals, separated by just a couple of pieces of fabric, Robert could smell his scent. At length he heard him speaking to Sarah and his hand reached into his pocket and grabbed him. He pulled Robert out and handed him to her. Robert took in his surroundings. This man was in Robert's living room with Robert's girlfriend. Sarah barely looked at Robert. She just threw him down on the coffee table.<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" she said. \"Are you staying tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after Craig and Sarah went to bed, leaving Robert alone and abandoned in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was early the next morning when Sarah's alarm went off. Robert knew her routine. She would get up, shower, have breakfast and get dressed. He would be one of the last things she would think of before she left the house to go to work. But he looked forward to when she did think about him and place him on her wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the time came. Sarah picked him up, casually, as though he could have been any inanimate object. She draped him over her left wrist and fed the clasp through the buckle. She took a brief look at him then gave her wrist a violent shake to move him to where she wanted him to be. She then put her coat on and left, driving to work. As she drove Robert moved around slightly on her wrist, particularly when she was steering or changing gear. This was ridiculously arousing for him and yet he would never actually climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah worked in an outbound call centre. Once at work she hung her coat up on the back of her chair and sat at her desk, displaying her watch to the world. Robert wondered if anyone would notice her new watch, and if they did whether they would realise it was him. Of course it was silly to even think that anyone would recognise him as her watch. As she rested her hands on the desk in front of her he felt his bracelet on the wooden top of the desk and he simply looked straight up as I waited for Sarah to look at me again. The day was long and boring. Eventually lunch time came. Sarah got up and walked to the canteen where she sat down to eat her lunch. Robert could not see her eating her lunch but she reached into her handbag and pulled out an e-reader. As she held it in her left hand and read while eating Robert found himself being held up at an angle, still unable to see her. He looked out into the canteen, watching as her co-workers walked past. Eventually she twisted her wrist and glanced at him, her deep brown eyes momentarily locking onto his face. Sarah got up and walked back to her desk where she again sat down and resumed her work. Robert desperately craved her looking at him again, but she didn\u2019t. She ignored him while she sat on the phone and typing at her computer. Robert felt himself being continually moved around as her hands moved over the keyboard. Despite this all he could think about was her looking at him and him being useful to her. Eventually the end of the day came and she drove home from work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce home Sarah went to the bathroom where she washed her hands and face. As she did so she unclipped her watch from her wrist and dis-guarded it in the bathroom. When she was finished she left Robert there, alone, abandoned and unwanted. Robert savoured the scent coming from the kitchen as she cooked her dinner, knowing that he would never actually taste the food. She would usually leave him in the bathroom overnight before putting him on again the next day.</span></div></div>",

In fact, overall, it felt as if she had completely forgotten about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, after about 3 years, for her birthday, her boyfriend gave her a new watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was wearing Robert when she opened her present containing a new pink Apple watch. She took him off and discarded him on her boyfriend's coffee table. She put her new watch on. Robert seethed with jealousy. And he was fearful. This watch would do so much more than tell the time. It appeared that his time as her watch was over. Whatever happened now, whatever she decided to do, he was her old watch.

The two did not make for a good match as all the grime stuck to Robert. He really would need Sarah to clean him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt length her bag opened again and she dropped something else into it: a pair of her knickers.

Her getting home, removing him from her bag and cleaning him up could not come soon enough. Robert also found another strange feeling creeping over him. It was a yearning. A desire to be worn. He was feeling the need to be on a wrist. He was a watch. He was supposed to be worn on a wrist. It felt like this was what now mattered to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She didn't touch her watch though. That was left in her bag for a bit longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was later that evening when Sarah pulled Robert out of her bag. He was covered in fluff. She took a damp tissue and wiped him clean before putting him down on her bedside table for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was early the next morning when Sarah's alarm went off. Robert knew her routine. She would get up, shower, have breakfast and get dressed. He would be one of the last things she would think of before she left the house to go to work. But he looked forward to when she did think about him and place him on her wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the time came. Sarah picked him up, casually, as though he could have been any inanimate object. She draped him over her left wrist and fed the clasp through the buckle. She took a brief look at him then gave her wrist a violent shake to move him to where she wanted him to be. She then put her coat on and left, driving to work. As she drove Robert moved around slightly on her wrist, particularly when she was steering or changing gear. This was ridiculously arousing for him and yet he would never actually climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah worked in an outbound call centre. Once at work she hung her coat up on the back of her chair and sat at her desk, displaying her watch to the world. Robert wondered if anyone would notice her new watch, and if they did whether they would realise it was him. Of course it was silly to even think that anyone would recognise him as her watch. As she rested her hands on the desk in front of her he felt his bracelet on the wooden top of the desk and he simply looked straight up as I waited for Sarah to look at me again. The day was long and boring. Eventually lunch time came. Sarah got up and walked to the canteen where she sat down to eat her lunch. Robert could not see her eating her lunch but she reached into her handbag and pulled out an e-reader. As she held it in her left hand and read while eating Robert found himself being held up at an angle, still unable to see her. He looked out into the canteen, watching as her co-workers walked past. Eventually she twisted her wrist and glanced at him, her deep brown eyes momentarily locking onto his face. Sarah got up and walked back to her desk where she again sat down and resumed her work. Robert desperately craved her looking at him again, but she didn\u2019t. She ignored him while she sat on the phone and typing at her computer. Robert felt himself being continually moved around as her hands moved over the keyboard. Despite this all he could think about was her looking at him and him being useful to her. Eventually the end of the day came and she drove home from work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce home Sarah went to the bathroom where she washed her hands and face. As she did so she unclipped her watch from her wrist and dis-guarded it in the bathroom. When she was finished she left Robert there, alone, abandoned and unwanted. Robert savoured the scent coming from the kitchen as she cooked her dinner, knowing that he would never actually taste the food. She would usually leave him in the bathroom overnight before putting him on again the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime went on. The weekday routine rarely varied much, unless she was on holiday. If she went away though she had a habit of either not taking him or leaving him locked in a hotel safe for the duration of the trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt weekends Robert would only get worn if she had something going on or if she was going out with friends, or boyfriends. In fact, overall, it felt as if she had completely forgotten about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, after about 3 years, for her birthday, her boyfriend gave her a new watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was wearing Robert when she opened her present containing a new pink Apple watch. She took him off and discarded him on her boyfriend's coffee table. She put her new watch on. Robert seethed with jealousy. And he was fearful. This watch would do so much more than tell the time. It appeared that his time as her watch was over. Whatever happened now, whatever she decided to do, he was her old watch. From his position on her boyfriends living room table Robert watched the pair make out.</span></div></div>",

She didn't even realise she'd left him behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that evening her boyfriend was talking to her on the phone. \"You know you left your old watch here?\"<br>\r\n\"That old thing?\" Sarah replied. \"I've no use for it. Can you just drop it in at the charity shop please?\" Her boyfriend picked it up and looked at Robert in his rough and masculine hands. Then he tossed it into a box on his dining table. Robert dropped down to the bottom of the box between other unwanted possessions. He couldn't believe that Sarah was just discarding him like this. The worst thing however was knowing that he was being sent to the charity shop still missing a link. That part of him would be forever missing now, leaving him trapped as this watch forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a few days later when Robert was deposited at the charity shop. As the shop keeper sorted through the donations she looked at the watch and tied a label onto me, offering it for sale for just \u00a35. She then placed him on a shelf in the shop, to await a new owner.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Robert saw Sarah's mum, Claire staring down at him.<br>\r\n\"Oh Sarah, it's beautiful, thank you,\" Claire said, pulling him out of the box. She took Robert off the cushion and placed him on her slim wrists. His senses went into overdrive as she closed the clasp. As he had done with Sarah, he hung loosely around Claire's wrist, but she mother didn't remove me. Claire just left me dangling like a bracelet as they sat in a restaurant and ate their meal. All the while I slid up and down her wrist and bumped on the table every time she lowered her arm. Finally Sarah's parents and 18 year old sister, Natasha headed home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving been barely touched, let alone worn, since being turned into a watch Robert had had no idea what sensations to expect. Now he started to find out. As he was put upon Claire's wrist he felt a sensation of elation. He found that in the back of his mind he knew he was doing what he was made for. It was also nice to feel warm. Made of metal, he would be cold unless placed on a warm wrist and able to conduct heat from that. Another thing Robert quickly found was that every movement, every touch, every slide had a lasting impact on him. Every movement was increasing his levels of sexual frustration, and yet there would be no way to relieve it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at home Claire removed me from her wrist and set me down on the kitchen counter.<br>\r\n\"Please can you get that adjusted tomorrow?\" she asked Sarah's dad, Paul. \"It should only need one link removing.\" Already cooling down and feeling cold, Robert lay abandoned on the kitchen worktop pining for his new owner.</span></div></div>",

Robert remained in his pocket all morning while Paul was at work. It was lunchtime when he walked into the jewellers. He dug his hand into his pocket and thoughtlessly pulled Robert out. He put Robert down on the counter in front of a young lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you just take one link out please?\" he asked. The lady picked me up and took me into a back room where she set to work on removing a link from my bracelet. It hurt. Robert found that it was akin to surgery, but without any aesthetic. It was like having a piece of his body removed. Robert wanted to scream in agony but of course he couldn't. After just a couple of minutes the woman was done. She carried him back into the shop and placed him on his back on the counter, looking straight up. As the shock and pain of having a part of him effectively amputated subsided Robert's mind started to clear. Someone had made a material change to him A link had been removed. He didn't need it explaining to him. At the end of his 4 year term he would not be able to turn back into a person unless the link was put back in. Robert led on the counter in impotent rage. Paul picked him up, dropped him in his pocket again, and left the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening he handed Robert back to his wife.<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Claire said, putting him on her wrist to try him on.

She opened the lid and pulled out a Baby G watch with a pink strap and case.She released Robert from the cushion, checked the time and then put him on her wrist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert tried to process what was happening as Sarah strapped him into place on her left wrist. He knew he was a watch. As she touched him and placed him on her slim wrist he felt sexual excitement. It was a feeling he was to become used to as it would increase every time he was moved or touched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sarah thread the bottom strap through the buckle and pulled it tight to her wrist Robert felt a searing pain as the strap bent into shape around her wrist. Robert felt the warmth of her wrist on the stainless steel back of my case, warming me up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah went about her business, starting off with the housework. As she moved around the flat, dusting and hoovering, R felt myself moving around constantly. he was terrified that he would fall off her wrist, but deep down he knew that would not happen. He was securely fastened there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat afternoon Robert got his first outing in public as Sarah went to the supermarket. He wasn't sure how he felt about this. She wore him on her wrist while she pushed her trolley around the store. Robert was regularly exposed as she reached for items, took them off the shelf and dropped them into her trolley. He felt as if everyone was looking at him. He felt embarrassed at the fact that he was a watch, and not just a watch, but a girly pink watch. In reality it hardly mattered. There was no reason for anyone to stare at him, let alone for them to know that this pink watch was actually a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grocery shopping done, Sarah went home and cooked her dinner. The smell was wonderful and Robert realised that he was hungry, yet in his current state there was no way he could eat. Sarah spent a quiet evening at home, curled up with a bottle of wine in front of the television. Robert spent the evening on her wrist, waiting for the moment when she would glance at him to see the time. Those moment's were few and far between. Finally her film finished. Sarah looked at the time, got up and switched off the television. She went and turned out the light and headed for the bathroom. She got herself ready for bed and climbed in, still wearing Robert on her wrist. Finally, she took him off, dropped him on her bedside table and settled down to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatches don't sleep. Robert didn't seep. He spent the night alone, sexually frustrated, cold and immobile, watching his now ex-girlfriend as she slept.</span></div></div>",

She pressed a button at the top right hand side, causing his face to light up. Having looked at the time she placed Robert on her wrist. He found it hurt as she pulled the strap tight, bending him around her wrist and flicking the tongue through one of the eye holes so that he had no means of escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he was held securely on her wrist Sarah got up. Sarah went to the bathroom and used the toilet before going into the kitchen to make her breakfast. She then went and sat in the living room watching the television while she ate. At length Sarah got dressed, putting on a swimming costume and track suit She then went to the pool. Being waterproof she didn't need to take him off to go in the pool and kept him on her wrist while she went swimming. Robert found it a scary feeling; being submerged in water at someone else's will, never knowing how long it would be for or when it would come. On the other hand, it wasn't a problem. He was an inanimate object, so it wasn't like he needed to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt length Sarah finished her session in the swimming pool and got out and dried. She put her tracksuit back on and went home. Once home she stripped again and got int the shower. Again Robert remained on her wrist for this. It was becoming increasingly clear to him that Sarah would only take him off in order to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat afternoon Sarah went to work, once again with Robert on her wrist. She was a paramedic and Robert found her looking at him regularly as she went to different jobs and completed paperwork. He also found his vision being restricted regularly as she would cover her hands and sometimes him with latex gloves at each job she went to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert stayed on Sarah's wrist until she went to bed that night when he was tossed onto her bedside table again, landing face down so that he could see nothing, while his straps stood up behind his case in the air.</span></div></div>",

She found the feel of the silicone band addictive to touch and could not stop feeling it. The black case and LCD face looked quite chunky as she placed this watch on her slim wrist and pulled the strap tight before buckling it into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked at the watch on her wrist trying to decide if she was happy with it. At length she took it off. She pressed and held the top left button, turning the watch on. Robert, who had been in some sort of suspended animation, burst into life, his brain processing all sorts of additional information from the chips and micro processors in this smart watch. Sarah meanwhile was busy connecting the watch to her phone through Bluetooth. As the two devices paired Robert's mind was overloaded with information. A text message came through to Sarah's phone and he found himself buzzing in order to alert her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah  picked Robert up and pressed the bottom right button to check that she could scroll through the message. She then put him on her left wrist and continued with her day, largely ignoring him. Robert found that he could not ignore Sarah however. Every movement she made, every step she took, Every beat of her heart through her pulse, Robert would track: he had no choice. It was what he was now programmed to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that afternoon, Sarah put on a tracksuit and tied her hair back before going out for a run. As she walked out of the door she pressed the top right button on the watch, setting it to recognise that she was going for a run. She then started the timer and started running. Not only was Robert expected to keep track of the time, the time she had been running how far she had gone, he was also expected to monitor and remember the route and her heart rate. Robert found that he was so busy with all this that he did not notice how sweaty Sarah was. It was only when she finished her run and pressed the stop button that Robert got a chance to process this. Initially he found himself busy sending all the data to Sarah's phone, but once this was done he had time to process other things. He noticed that Sarah's wrist was sweaty and that she smelt after her work out. He could feel beads of perspiration on her arm, on the back of his case and on the inside of the soft silicone band. He felt dirty and took in the pungent smell of Sarah's body oder. Then he felt Sarah release him from her wrist. She flung him down on the bed and walked off to get in the shower. Robert lay helpless on her bed still covered in her sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce out of the shower Sarah put him back on her wrist again. Despite her being clean she hadn't bothered to wipe him and he could not shake the taste and smell of her sweat. Sarah went to the kitchen and started to cook her dinner. The smell was mouth watering and yet Robert knew he would taste none of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt length Sarah sat down in front of the television for the evening. While watching the TV she received a text message. It shocked Robert as the connection to her phone registered this message and he buzzed involuntary, the details of the sender and the message itself displaying on his LCD face. Sarah raised her hand and looked at Robert rather than her phone, She pressed a button on his face to read the text before reaching for her phone to reply. The other surprise that Robert got was when Sarah had been inactive for an hour he buzzed to remind her that she needed to move. Sarah ignored him. At length, Sarah went to bed. She didn't take Robert off her wrist though: she left him there so that he could monitor her heart rate and her sleep overnight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert found himself being worn almost all the time. The only time Sarah bothered to remove him from her wrist was when she wanted to go for a shower. However after a few days Sarah saw that Robert's battery needed charging. She took him off her wist and found the charging lead. It connected with a clip similar to an alligator clop. As she connected this, Robert found this hurt. More was to come though. She plugged the other end of the lead into the power. Robert gave a buzz as he started to charge. The feeling as the electricity ran into him and charged his battery was one of sexual frustration.It was as though the  electricity was stimulating his cock somehow yet it would never let him achieve sexual satisfaction.</span></div></div>",

He could clearly see that he was a chastity tube. It was obvious from his shape. Made of metal he was suddenly stone cold. He would be reliant on a man's dick to warm him up.

While I didn't have eyes I could see and was looking up at her from just above the water line.

The lid was down, taking away the light and blocking my vision. It struck me only now as to how cold I felt, bolted into a tiled floor with a cold pot body and cold water constantly in my throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah lifted the seat, sat down and relaxed her sphincter muscle.. She peed, the acrid liquid splashing into my mouth and my body, her urine splashing against the side of the pan on the way down before it landed in the water. Sarah stood up and wiped. She dropped the tissue into me and flushed. I felt as if I was drinking her piss. Without speaking to me or looking back, she walked away. In the distance I heard her front door shut as if she had gone out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was several hours later when I saw Sarah again. Once again she sat above me. As she did I could see her pussy glistening with another mans cum. She had had sex with someone other than me. I felt hurt. Yes, I was just a toilet, but this was temporary. I was her boyfriend really. Sarah must have read my mind.<br>\r\n\"I'm just giving you the full toilet experience,\" she giggled, using tissue to wipe what was left of this man's cum from her pussy. Again she stood up and flushed before walking off.</span></div></div>",

In effect Robert was upside down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he didn't have eyes he could see and was looking up at what appeared to be the inside of a toilet bowl from just above the water line. In the distance he could see a cubical door. Just then another painful sensation ripped through Robert as a chain appeared on the cistern for the flush. There was one final searing pain as a toilet seat, but no lid was attached to the top of the pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if it wasn't clear how it had happened, it was quite clear to Robert that he had been turned into a toilet in a washroom. He only hoped that it was a woman's washroom..Just then someone walked in.</span></div></div>",

Powerless to resist Robert had a front row seat as the man pushed and a soft, brown log slowly appeared from the man's anus. It hit the side of the pan leaving brown skid-marks before landing with a plop in the water. Robert could taste it. It was revolting. The man stood up, wiped his backside and pulled his trousers up. He grabbed the flush chain. His relief for small mercies that he was actually going to flush was replaced with one of horror. As the man pulled the chain it was as if he had grabbed Robert's penis and given it a good teasing rub and wank. The flush chain was, in effect, Robert's penis. Every flush would be equivalent to a man playing with his cock. Yet the alternative was just as bad: be left with his mouth full of another man's shit.</span></div></div>",

The fact that he would be used by men was the least of his worries: he didn't want another man effectively jacking him off as they flushed the toilet did he have any desire to have his mouth left full of piss and poo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Robert sat helpless he heard the door open again and in walked another man. He plonked himself down on the seat and pushed. This man farted and out came a load of watery poo. He then pushed and Robert watched in horror as a log appeared from this man's anus and fell into Robert's waiting mouth. The man got up and used plenty of toilet roll to wipe himself before walking out. He hadn't even bothered to flush. Now Robert sat with his mouth full of poo and toilet roll, remnants of this man's initial watery produce all around his bowl. He could taste it all. It was revolting yet there was nothing he could do. The only thing Robert could do was wait for someone else to come along and flush him. Robert suddenly realised that he would rather be flushed than suffer this. He would rather have a man pull the chain, touch his penis and tease it, making him horny, than have a mouth left full of shit. If he could speak he would have begged a man for that teasing rub on his penis if it meant that his mouth could be cleared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert sat and waited, desperately hoping that soon someone would come along and clear his mouth for him.</span></div></div>",

And more to the point, she knew he had a homophobic streak. Sarah resolved to use that against him. Without thinking about it she typed in \"Condom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe selected the location as the box of condoms in Robert's bedside drawer and set a duration as \"Until use, plus 48 hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hit Enter and a warning came up:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing use, you must select what is to happen with him at the end of the 48 hour period or else this will refresh and he will become a condom again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled at the thought of her soon to be ex boyfriend being a condom on endless repeat for all eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ********************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert was asleep in bed having worked a night shift when he awoke in terrible pain., He felt his body go limp and flexible. He felt hollow and stretched out; Almost empty. Then he felt myself roll up. Finally all light and vision were blotted out as he felt some packaging develop around the outside of him. He dropped into a box full of condoms in his bedside drawer.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\"Wow, it worked,\" Sarah giggled, looking in the box and noting that there was one extra condom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert lay lifeless and motionless in the dark wrapper. He had no idea what had happened, where he was or what he had become. All he knew was that he was no longer human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert had no idea how long he waited in there. Kept in total darkness, inside a foil wrapper, time was meaningless. He was bored. He wanted his life back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen one day it happened. He felt his wrapper being pulled out of the box. The wrapper was ripped open and he fell out onto the bed. Sarah picked him up and approached her bull's hard and throbbing cock with him in her fingers. It was as she did this that Robert caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror. If he had any blood it would have run cold. Sarah had turned him into a condom. He realised his awful fate was about to meet him as he was put on another man's cock. Sarah placed Robert over the end of her man's dick cock and with a deft move of her hand unrolled Robert onto his huge organ. Once unrolled Robert found his sight was on the inside of the condom looking straight up at this man's ureatha. Robert was to have a front row seat for this man's orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert tried to shout out that he wanted this to stop, but no noise came. He tried to console himself thinking about the feel and taste of Sarah's sex. As this man pushed Robert into Sarah's vagina Robert found that he could not taste what was on the outside of the condom, only what was on the inside. As this penis thrust inside Sarah it oozed precum. Robert felt the rhythm, slow at first and then speeding up as the two of them had sex. Then it happened. The penis squirted hot sticky cum deep into Robert. He could smell and taste this man's sperm. It repulsed him. Robert didn't want to be anywhere near this. As the man's orgasm subsided and the sperm stopped flowing his cock began to shrink. At length he pulled out of Sarah. He then pulled Robert off his cock and tied a knot in the top, trapping his cum inside Robert. While it was a relief to be off his cock Robert hated having the sperm trapped inside him. It was all he could smell and taste. He felt violated and was terrified he would have to bask in this for all eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce off his cock with the end tied the man got out of bed to dispose of Robert.</span></div></div>",

He got up and headed to the living room.<br>\r\n\"Sarah, I've...\" He didn't finish as a tail bust out of his behind, ripping his night clothes. Sarah looked at him and laughed, seeing a man with a dogs tail. Worse still Robert couldn't help but wag it excitedly.The tingling now moved to his head. Again this became more like a pain before a pair of dog ears burst through his skull and his human ears were sucked into it. At the same time both his hearing and sense of smell sharpened. He suddenly had an overwhelming urge to start sniffing everything in the flat. The next tingling and pain he developed was in his face. He felt like it was going to explode.<br>\r\n\"Sarah, please, call a doctor or an ambulance,\" Robert begged. \"Somethings...\" A snout exploded out of Robert's face. His head now looked exactly like that of a dog. He tried to speak again, but all he could do was to bark.<br>\r\n\"I don't know about a doctor, or an ambulance,\" Sarah laughed. \"I think you'd be better with a vet.\" Robert tried to object but could only manage a volley of barks.<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" Sarah continued, \"by the look of things it should be you doing the fetching...\" She threw a soft ball across the room. \"Go fetch boy.\" Almost instinctively Robert ran after it. He bent down to pick it up only to see his hands turn into paws and arms into legs. Robert had no choice but to get down on all fours to pick this up in his mouth. By the time he had it and tried to stand up, it was all done. His legs had also become dog's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah approached him and put a pink collar around his neck. \"Don't panic,\" she said soothingly. \"We'll sort this out.\" She clipped a lead to the collar. \"We'll go for a walk later and find a tree for you to pee on..\" Sarah led him to the kitchen where a dog cage had appeared. She pushed him into it and closed the door, fastening it shut. \"Meanwhile, why don't you have something to eat?\" Sarah referred to the bowl of dog food in the corner of the cage. She laughed and walked away.</span></div></div>",

Robert was still taking this in when he saw a toilet directly beneath him. This quickly came closer until he found himself positioned right over the bowl. He heard a female moan as urine started to flow out of his mouth. It was hot and strong and tasted revolting. A moment later he felt some toilet tissue being dabbed at his mouth, before he was lifted up again and saw those thin legs. Then all light was blotted out as he saw two hands lift the knickers and cover his face with them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert sat in a state of confusion, desperately trying to figure out what had happened.</span></div></div>",

He knew the voice: it was Sarah.<br>\r\n\"Have you worked it out yet? Do you know what I've turned you into? You're my pussy. Your entire body has become my vulva.
