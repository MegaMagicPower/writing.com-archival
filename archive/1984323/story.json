At the entrance, was the great she-bear herself, Irene. Irene was the Tooth and Claw Gaming's guard and was perfectly good at her job; however, there were nasty rumors about her, though. RJ, himself, didn't know much about Irene and was skeptical of the rumors, though, not completely. Showing his ID, Irene nodded him in and RJ walked through the doors. Entering the IT division, RJ got to his cubicle and begins to work on the servers. For a few hours he does this: checking on the severs, looking for any anomalies, fixing and securing firewalls, and so on. By break time, RJ goes to the nearby cafeteria and gets himself some coffee. Returning to his workplace, he bumps into someone around the corner. Who was it?</span></div></div>",

Due to his species, he's very slow and lethargic, but is able to get to complete his work immediately, once he gets, which a mystery you'll never find out.<br>\r\n\"Boss wants to see ya,\" he slowly said, so slow, that by the time you read the next ten chapter after this, he'll be done speaking, and without a care in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and some the other workers near enough to listen in, freeze up in fear. Sid's boss was in fact the CEO and founder of Tooth &amp; Claw Gaming and had a nasty reputation. Cruel to her workers, if they fail her and may even 'fire' them, depending on their pleads and on her mood, Ms. Caves was a strict boss and one that people wouldn't want to displease. RJ could only sigh, as he couldn't decline her, for two reasons: she was his boss first off, and secondly, but most importantly, Ms. Caves was a dragon. <br>\r\nDragons are among one of the ultra rare creatures that only a few people could meet, rarer than unicorns and griffons. These creatures were extremely powerful, in terms of actual power and politics, and holds the most of the world's wealth. Walking down the hallway, word has spread and some of the workers offer looks of sorrow, while others sing the doomed song. Entering Ms. Caves's lobby, you see her slim secretary, Stella, who is another rare anthro, an unicorn, typing down something before addressing you.<br>\r\n\"You can go in, but I suggest you wait for a bit.\"<br>\r\nPreferring not to be late, you head in and wish you hadn't. Inside the office, all of the furniture was enlarged to past the point for anthro to use; at least, normal ones, that is. Sitting in chair, behind her desk was a black dragon wearing the usual black business suit and white undershirt, with the suit skirt. Her breasts were the size four times the size of her head, revealed by her opened clothes, and her butt was far larger than those. With her boobs resting a large dome of squishy flesh, straining her clothes to the limit, her buttons on their dying breaths, her gut stood at a couple of feet away from her, if she was human sized. However, your focus was on her face, or more precise, in her mouth. In her mouth, was a 13'4 gorilla anthro you recognized from the research department, as you hung out with him a couple of times and in a couple of gulps, he was gone, a bulge in the dragoness's throat, going past her collarbone, gone forever. Licking her lips, her red eyes spot you and shiver in fear: from being eaten and her crush on you.<br>\r\nMs. Caves had developed a crush on you and is willing to have you by any means necessary. Of course, it would ruin her, if he started dating her, so she kept it by bay, and the fact that she was always busy till the night helped, though she would call him in when she gets the chance. Standing up, she goes around her desk and crouches so she can get a better view (her excuse for letting RJ see up her skirt, as she was currently wearing some pink lace panties-turned-thong).<br>\r\n\"Uuuurrrrrpppp! Excuse me! Must been something I ate!\" She chuckles to herself, patting her massive stomach.<br>\r\n\"What did you want to see me for, Ms. Caves?\" You ask, hoping she'll let you go quickly.<br>\r\n\"Can I say I wanted to see you?\" The fat dragon asks, where you quickly shake your head no, her smile fading a bit.<br>\r\n\"Fine, you got me, RJ! I needed to see you for a.....\"</span></div></div>",

The relationship between you two is friendly, as the both of you work in the same division. Even you're scared of her, time to time, she promised never to harm you. The muscular dino woman had the usual look of a T-Rex, but with longer arms, small bumps for breasts, and a huge bubble butt, all in the business woman attire. \"Nah, I'm planning on doing some overtime work, but thanks for the offer, Belinda,\" RJ replies. Waving bye, the largest anthro in the building left, leaving just you in the building. He continues his work up till midnight and decides he did enough. Checking out, RJ enters the parking lot, and makes it to his car, before a large shadow covers him. Turning around, RJ meets the shadow's owner. Who is it?</span></div></div>",

Then a malicious toothy grin appeared on Zelda's bloated cheeks and RJ realized what Zelda had in store for him. \"Well,\" said Zelda. \"You know the rules, Ron James Smith,\" says the huge feline as she licks her lips. \"You know what happens to humans who fail to pay their rent in Furdale Towers.\" RJ knew all too well. All humans who failed to pay their rent to Zelda ended up making Zelda's ass even fatter. The lioness even licked RJ as RJ was afraid for his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Zelda,\" you say. \"Have a heart. Give me a second chance.\" Zelda shook her head and growled. \"You tried to run. Only prey tries to run from predators, therefore you are no longer a tenant of Furdale Towers. But you will be a tenant of my belly.\" RJ tried to wiggle his way out of Zelda's grip but Zelda was much too strong. RJ was fighting as the lioness brought him back to her room but then Zelda bit him in the shoulder to immobilize RJ. RJ  groaned in pain right before Zelda opened her fridge and took out ketchup and mustard to squirt over her human prey. Some of which got into RJ's eyes and caused him discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda smiled and licked her chops. \"Consider this,\" she said as she drooled heavily. \"Your eviction.\" With that, Zelda grabbed RJ violently and held open her jaws, giving the human a view of the lion's blackhole-like stomach. RJ tried to grab the sides of Zelda's mouth to prevent the lioness from shoving him inside and swallowing him, but it was no use and Zelda slammed her mouth shut, trapping RJ's upper body inside before she tilted her head back and slurped up RJ's legs as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the beast, RJ let out a scream right before he fell with a splash in Zelda's big belly. Outside, the lioness rubbed her stomach. She was still hungry and one human would just not do, so she opened her fridge and took out several leftover pizzas and scarfed them down one by one. Then Zelda took three boxes of donuts and ravenously shoved them down her throat. After swallowing the donuts, the lioness slurped up an entire block of gelatin and then downed two pages of chips. Finally, she emptied out two cases of ice cream and made herself a sundae complete with bananas, whipped cream and cherries and shoveled it down. The ravenous beast finished her meal by washing it down with a large soda, all while RJ was being buried in binge and letting out muffled screams and tried to pound on Zelda's stomach, only succeeding in making his face of terror appear on the mountainous lion's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda then let out an explosive belch, shaking up her insides and burying RJ under the contents of her belly. RJ struggled to stand as he splashed in the stomach juices. Outside, Zelda scratched her belly and picked her teeth with her claws before burping again. \"Sorry, RJ,\" said Zelda as she pat her stomach and made it jiggle. \"But rules are rules. Better get ice and cozy while you can because you're never getting out of there. But perhaps it will take a while before you fully melt. A good-sized morsel like you will make my rump twice as big as it was before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda laughed fiendishly and picked up her stomach to wiggle it and cause further discomfort for the prisoner trapped inside right before she walked out of her abode to inspect the rest of the apartment.</span></div></div>",

It kind of tingled, but it wouldn't be an unpleasant situation if it weren't for the pre-chewed food around him. Almost like a massage...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Zelda gave her stomach a pat as it noisily got to work. \"Hmph, was kind of hoping he'd stick around longer. He was kind of cute. Ah well, he'll still be cute as some fat on my rump.\" She grumbled a bit, hefting herself up as her bulging stomach sagged in front of her. \"Geez, you're heavy RJ,\" she complained, \"I'm going to hate having to move work on getting your room ready for a new tenant while you get settled into your new home in my body fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ears twitched as she heard RJ's muffled complaints in response, and she could feel him squirming. She grinned cheekily, living meals were always more satisfying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda made her way down to RJ's apartment, some of the other tenants stopping to get a glance at the lioness's squirming stomach. It wouldn't be long before everyone in the building knew RJ had been \"relocated.\" Once Zelda let herself inside, she started going through RJ's things and packing them into boxes. Anything valuable enough to sell (or interesting enough to steal) she confiscated to cover her losses. Everything else that wasn't a part of the apartment's furniture was placed aside to be thrown out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Zelda was finished her stomach was already still, and slightly smaller, though still rather rounded. All the effort of the packing up had burned off most of the calories she gained, so it wouldn't be TOO obvious she gained weight once she was done processing RJ. She sighed as she pressed her hand against her gut, feeling it sink slightly, and hearing the slight slosh of the now liquified remains of her recent meal. \"Ugh, I'm starting to get out of shape, I should hit up the gym...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------<br>\r\n<i>Sure enough, a few weeks later a new tenant arrived and moved in, business as usual. RJ had made few friends, and while a certain wolfess had confronted Zelda about RJ's passing, there was little that could be done. Zelda had been inspired by the meal to work on her figure, and after a couple more meals of that caliber and a bit of daily exercise, she was proud to now have relocated most of her pudge to her bust and backside, and looking much more physically fit as well. Interestingly, among those whose eyes she caught with the change in look was the same wolfess who'd complained about RJ being \"evicted\" by Zelda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a strange relationship at first, but Sabrina and Zelda began dating. They were actually quite compatible, and before too long Sabrina moved in with Zelda. Of course, Zelda was a bit of a corruptive influence, and it wouldn't be long before Sabrina ate her first human. Eventually, the pair gained a bit of a reputation as man eaters, but they still managed to attract human tenants to the apartments, and they even had the self control not to eat every human that entered the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n RJ was little more than a layer of pudge on the lioness' rear end, but he wouldn't be forgotten by either of the two ladies, as he would forever be remembered as the person whose life (and death) brought the two together. </i></span></div></div>",

Yeah, there was no contest there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Al-alright.\" RJ finally conceded nervously. \"I'll... I'll do it, Zelda.\"<br>\r\nThe immense lioness smiled like the Cheshire cat, revealing many, many sharp teeth in the process. \"Good.\" She purred. \"Now strip, little man. You've got work to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ obediently bent down and began to hurriedly take off his shirt and step out of his shoes. While he wasn't a virgin, this was definitely his first time with an anthro, not to mention with a woman almost twice as tall and several times heavier than he was. As his shirt came over his head, though, Zelda loomed over the smaller man with an aroused purr, her immense shadow completely covering RJ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me help you with those, RJ.\" The lioness rumbled, her large hand grabbing hold of the hem of RJ's pants. With a tug and a loud <i>rrrip!</i>, his jeans were torn clean off his body, the tattered article of clothing tossed to the floor and soon being joined by the remains of the human's underpants, leaving RJ standing buck naked before his titanic landlady.<br>\r\n\"Yes, you will definitely do.\" Zelda murmured as she stared at RJ's sizable dick, now standing fully erect. The lioness grabbed the smaller human by the scruff of his neck and lifted him up off the ground, throwing him none-too-gently onto the bed, then pulled her panties down and tossed them aside, stalking towards her new boytoy with a hypnotic sway in her wide hips. \"You'd better make this good for me, RJ, or you'll be sitting in my stomach before you can scream.\"<br>\r\nThe immense feline anthro reached the foot of RJ's bed and crawled onto it, the mattress creaking and groaning in protest under her immense weight. She kept moving forward until her face was mere inches from RJ's, her immense furred bulk held over his prone body like a hammer waiting to drop down upon a nail.<br>\r\n\"You ready?\" Zelda asked in a surprisingly teasing, seductive voice. RJ could only nod frantically in reply, too stunned to say anything intelligible.<br>\r\n\"Good.\" The lioness replied with a sly smile. \"Then let's begin the matter of your payment.\"<br>\r\nWith that, the titanic landlady lowered her massive body downwards, smothering RJ's much smaller form underneath like a tidal wave of fat and fur as she eased herself down onto his diamond-hard member. Both anthro and human let out a moan of pleasure as his cock entered her slit, the sensation prompting Zelda to lower herself down even more, crushing her tiny lover even more and making it hard for him to breath.<br>\r\n\"Y-yes... more...\" Zelda moaned to herself, her tongue hanging out of her mouth as she began to thrust up and down onto RJ's dick, her titanic form rocking like a ship at sea as she rode the tiny human. Beneath her, RJ let out a blissful (somewhat choked) cry of his own as his relatively thin arms wrapped around as much of the lioness' bulk that he could reach - mostly her tits and a good portion of her huge soft belly. The human's arms felt like they were sinking into Zelda's soft fur and softer flab as he embraced his gargantuan lover, his hands kneading and squeezing every inch of flab that they could reach as he managed to weakly thrust into the lioness as well. Before either Zelda and RJ knew it, their lips were crashing against one another, the former's much larger, rougher tongue wrapping around the latter's and squeezing it like a slimy python. The anthro and the human continued their passionate kiss as their thrusts became faster and faster, closing their eyes and moaning into one another's mouths as their arousal began to reach a climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Zelda broke the kiss to let out a high-pitched yowl as she climaxed, her vaginal walls clamping down tight on RJ's dick like a vice. RJ came mere moments later, his own shout joining Zelda's as he hugged her tighter and his cock spasmed and jerked, blasting a load of seed directly into her womb.<br>\r\nZelda panted happily as her crushing weight atop RJ's torso began to lessen somewhat, but didn't dissipate entirely - she must have been leaning on her side, RJ realized. Neither she nor the little human underneath her spoke for several long moments; they merely basked together in their afterglow and in each other's body heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what now? </span></div></div>",

Anyway, you're off the hook for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing out a sigh of relief, RJ sits up and watches as the giant lioness gets out of her bed. Her back turned to him, Zelda puts on her shirt and starts to pull up her pants and underwear. Noticing her massive ass, gained from the countless lives she ate, RJ couldn't help but blush for some reason and wanted to grope it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you have work or something?\" Zelda growls, breaking RJ out of his trance and reminding him of his shredded clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to be late because of I have to replace my jeans, and god forbid if someone sees me naked,\" RJ retorts back, guilting the huge woman in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I may of been too hasty since it's been a while I had a good time with someone. I'll take you back to your apartment, since I tore your jeans,\" she said, picking RJ up and lowering him between her ass cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? This is the only way that nobody would see you. Unless you prefer riding in my stomach? I can guarantee you that I won't be spitting you back up, so deal with it!\" She growls, as she turns to face you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite seeing her face numerous times and always fearing it, RJ couldn't help but notice that her face was quite beautiful, despite the chub on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has she always looked like this before?\" RJ thinks to himself, before being encased by Zelda's butt and the anthro pulling up her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ was quite glad when he was let out of Zelda's rear end. After the intense heat, pounding he got from her fat cheeks, and the occasional farts Zelda would let out by 'accident,' the human was quite happy to away from her buttocks. Changing into some new clothes, RJ was somehow able to make it to his work on time. His friend Sarah would ask about the smell, but RJ was quick enough to lie that Jasmine did a prank on him, including slime. The rest of week went by without incident, other then a few close calls, but RJ could of sworn that the landlady was watching him ever since the morning they did it. After two weeks after the incident, RJ was watching TV when a knock was heard on his door, the heavy knocks coming from an anthro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming!\" RJ calls out, but before he fully stand up, the visitor rattles his door handle and the door swings open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door behind her, was none other than Zelda herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I paid you the rent already!?\" RJ almost shouts out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did after we had sex. That morning is what I want to talk about,\" She said quietly, sitting on his couch and shutting off his TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis person was much different from the usual Zelda, making RJ sit down beside her, despite the lack of space, and take it seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Zelda?\" RJ asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing deeply, Zelda soon speaks softly.</span></div></div>",

To say RJ was shocked would be a huge understatement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Excuse me? Am I hearing you correctly?\" RJ asked bewildered. All Zelda could do was simply nod as she tried her best to avoid making eye contact with RJ. \"Wait a minute, I thought you hated me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't hate you. I never did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why have you been so cruel to me ever since I arrived here?\" he asked the lioness. Zelda simply let out a heavy sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just being cautious. You're not exactly the first human to ever live in one of these apartments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well seeing as how there are no other humans in this building, I think I know what happened to them. But just to be sure, why don't you tell me.\" RJ said as he poked Zelda's stomach, causing Zelda to blush even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I wasn't the sole reason as to what happened to them. All the other humans kept stirring up trouble, which ended up ticking off myself and the other tenants. A majority of them were eaten by myself and the other tenants, while the others were either evicted or simply moved out. When the last human was gone, I told myself and the other tenants that I wouldn't allow another human to move in. And then you came along.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And due to your prior experience with humans, you thought I would be just like the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo! As soon as you moved in I kept a close eye on you. But as time went on, I began to realize that you aren't such a bad person. A part of me wanted to be less harsh on you but another part of me kept saying that you were just like the others. It wasn't until we did it that I knew you were different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's very swell and all but what does this have to do with you wanting to have sex with me again?\" RJ asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After we had sex, I couldn't get you out of my head. All I could think about was how good us having sex felt. And as surprising as this may sound, you pleasured me more than any other man. I think...I think I might be falling in love with you RJ.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ was flabbergasted. He had always known Zelda as a loud and terrifying woman. But here she was, being the complete opposite. She had, in some way, opened up to him. It was all too much for him to comprehend at once. First there was the fact that she never hated him but instead was just suspicious about him. Then there was how she was slowly becoming less aggressive towards him. But hands down the biggest shock was the fact that Zelda said that RJ had pleasured her more than any other man and that she was falling in love with him. How could he have been the best man Zelda has ever slept with? She was much taller and definitely much heavier than he was. And to top it off she was falling in love with him?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that Zelda took RJ's hand in her paw and looked him in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do ya say, wanna go for round two? It's your call.\"</span></div></div>",

The camel girl was very obese, especially in her butt and had two large humps on her back. She also had reddish purple fur and long white hair that covered her left eye. The camel girl was wearing a black tank top with an orange-red jacket and jean shorts that looked painted on her big booty. She looked down at RJ as he stepped back. \"I-I'm really sorry, Ms...\" The camel woman just bent down to get a good look at RJ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then gave a rather creepy smile. \"Very interesting,\" said the camel woman. \"I've never seen a camel woman up close. I'm Dominique by the way.\" RJ stepped back nervously as the camel woman inched her way forward and smiled down at him. \"Uh, I'm RJ, and right now I'm running late for work. I work at Tooth &amp; Claw Gaming.\" Dominique smirked and nodded her head as her belly fat wiggled and she stood up. \"Well,\" she said. \"I could give you a ride to work. I happen to know where it is.\" \"You can?\" asked RJ. \"That's great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominique led RJ outside and RJ looked in surprise because from the looks of it, Dominique had a motorcycle that had a figurehead painted like a WWII-style plane complete with an angry face and checkers. \"You're a biker?\" RJ asked. Dominique smiled and nodded her head as she sat down on her motorcycle. That was when RJ realized something. The bicycle actually looked smaller than its obese rider and the 2 ton camel woman clearly didn't put a sidecar on her bike. \"Uh,\" said RJ. \"Where am I supposed to ride?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominique reached into her pocket to take out a strange topaz dust and then smirked as she held it up. The camel blew on the dust and it spread to RJ and made him cough as he inhaled it. \"Oh geez! What did you do that for?! (Cough!) Crazy camel!\" As RJ kept coughing, he dropped his suitcase and something strange was happening to him. RJ leaned against the a small shrub out on the street and then sneezed. Suddenly, he looked up and noticed the shrub was taller than he remembered. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ stepped back and saw that the trashcan nearby was as tall as himself. \"Okay,\" muttered RJ. \"I think I'll just walk. It's not like being late will...\" RJ tried to pick up his briefcase but for some reason it seemed that the briefcase was too heavy for him. RJ looked up and saw Dominique getting off her motorcycle. However, she seemed surprisingly bigger and was laughing down at him. \"Looks like humans are even more puny than I heard. Especially with the right spell.\" RJ saw that he was actually shrinking and at a rapid rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to run but as he kept getting smaller and smaller, Dominique was able to follow him by calmly and slowly walking after him and then stopped, knocking RJ to the ground. RJ tumbled on the sidewalk and as he got up, he gasped because one of Dominique's camel toes was right behind him and it was the size of a bus. From RJ's perspective, he had been shrunken to 1/2 an inch tall. Dominique was 11'. She was a veritable colossus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore RJ could even think about the situation, Dominique plucked him between her fingers and brought him in front of her house sized grinning teeth right as she gave a sinister laugh. \"You and me are going for a ride.\" With that, the giant camel biker chick proceeded to drop the tiny human...</span></div></div>",

The anthro in the center whose belly RJ bumped into was an Asian looking blue sea lion woman with thunderous thighs and light blue hair worn in a style similar to Sailor Mercury. She was even wearing a similar outfit that looked like it came straight out of an anime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the left of the sea lion girl was a red skinned anthro who had the upper body and udder of an obese goat girl with long blonde hair and a hair of sunglasses along with a biker shirt and a tank top. But the goat girl had gills on her neck and gray scales on her legs that made it look like she was wearing pants but with fins at the side. She was a capricorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl at the right of the sea lion girl was a green skinned alligator snapping turtle girl with red hair worn with a bun and ponytail and she looked like she was wearing a yellow martial artist's belt as she looked down at RJ. All three of the girls were exactly 12' tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well look what we have here,\" said the capricorn girl in an Greek accent. \"A human.\" The snapping turtle girl lowered her head and RJ inched back out of fear of her massive jaws. But he wound up bumping his head into something else that was big and soft. he looked up to see a large an obese jaguar girl with bright golden yellow fur and reddish blonde hair worn in a ponytail with a purple bow. She was also wearing a pair of cargo pants with a shirt bearing the Thundercats logo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ looked up in fear but then the jaguar girl lifted him in the air to inspect him and spotted his briefcase before smiling. \"You going our way?\" she asked. RJ was surprised. \"You work for Tooth and Claw Gaming?\" you ask. \"We start work today,\" said the jaguar girl. \"My name's Selena.\" RJ shook hands with Selena before she put him on the ground. \"I'm RJ.\" The capricorn bent over, placing her udder on RJ's head as she gave a smug smile and looked down. \"Don't forget it,\" she said. \"But I'm Hera.\" The sea lion girl looked nervous and shy but forced herself to smile. \"My name's Ami and this is April.\" Ami pointed to the snapping turtle girl who smiled, though her jaws made her more intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's dangerous for humans to be alone in this neck of town,\" said Selena with a grin. \"Some anthro might leave you as bones on the street.\" RJ shivered at that thought. \"Don't scare him!\" yelled Selena. \"RJ, I think you better carpool with us. It would be safer that way.\" RJ smiled and nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car they took belonged to Selena and she was the driver as April sat in the front seat. RJ found himself in the back sandwiched between Ami and Hera's massive thighs. The sea lion girl was blushing as she looked down on the tiny human being pressed against her hip. The capricorn on the other hand was lighting herself a cigarette. RJ looked around and saw that the girls were as beautiful as they were big-bodied. Selena was a cat girl which was always a plus and she was the friendliest of the girls. Ami was shy but cute. Hera was a more hardy type but that didn't do anything against her sex appeal and even the intimidating April had an exotic touch to her, ignoring her monstrous teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut RJ realized something. \"Do any of you eat humans?\" he asked. Selena gasped. \"Don't even say that.\" She said. April made a face as if she was gagging and Ami shook her head. \"No, never. \"I quit,\" said Hera as she puffed on her cigarette. \"They don't sit well inside me.\" RJ breathed out a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the quartet parked the car and got out and as RJ walked into the building, he decided that he would ask one of them out for Friday Night, but which one?</span></div></div>",

He had considered just sending it to her, but the risk of her lying and saying it never arrived was a good possibility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door swung opened swiftly and RJ was eye level with a furry belly. Looking up passed two large breasts, Zelda's bloodshot eyes glared at him. Her only clothing was her bra and panties, plus an open bathrobe.

Like she was more tired than anything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What could you possibly want?\" she asked. <br>\r\n\"I...brought you the rent. It's due today...\" he reminded her. He held up the envelope up to show he actually had it. She didn't remember? This is the first time she hasn't brought up the rent around him. The only two things she ever talks about is either the rent or eating him.<br>\r\n\"Oh...right...\" she says as she took it out of his hand. Then lightly tossed it onto her table.

If he could befriend the carnivore, then perhaps he could be a day or two late with rent without perishing in a sack of acid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong? You seem a little out of it today.\" Zelda stared at him for a few seconds before letting out a heavy sigh. <br>\r\n\"I must be a wreck if <b>You're</b> asking me that...Fine. I'll tell you.\" She motioned him into her room. RJ stepped inside Zelda's apartment for the very first time. He's been in her office, but this was her actual room. It was surprisingly cozy. He took a seat in an over sized love seat while Zelda sat across from him. He felt like a child around all the large furniture, meant for the much larger lion woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you guessed, there is something out. As much as I hate to say it...maybe you can help me out with it. In fact, you're probably the ONLY one that can help.\" Okay...no pressure there...<br>\r\n\"What is it? I don't now how much help I can be, but if it's something I can do-\"<br>\r\n\"Listen. I'll be frank about this. Help me out this time, you won't have to pay for three months rent, and I won't eat you in during that time.\"<br>\r\n\"Deal.\" RJ said it without even thinking. The biggest threat in the apartment building out of his hair for three months? Whatever she needed, this will be worth it. For the first time since he saw her, Zelda smiled. Her shoulder slumped, like a large weight was dropped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Ah, that's a relief. Call your work, you'll need the day off. Tomorrow too. We'll need to spend today going over what you need to do.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure, but...what exactly is it I'll be doing?\" Zelda looked away and huffed.<br>\r\n\"I'll need you to be my...\"</span></div></div>",

Typical mother stuff, wanting to see her daughter get married, raise a family, yada yada yada. I'm an adult but she treats me like a cub. I'm thinking if I have a 'boyfriend' that comes by she'll get off my back a little and give me some room to breath.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it really that bad?\" RJ just couldn't imagine what it was like to have a mother like that. His own had her moments, but she really never pushed him to do things. She always said that what he did with his life was his business and that she'd raised him well enough to make his own choices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda gave another nod. \"Oh yeah. Shoot, if she had it her way, I'd be married and twice her size from eating all her cooking.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" What could RJ say to that? He didn't want to imagine Zelda even bigger. Then what she said hit him. \"Wait, you said 'twice her size'?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of replying, Zelda pulled out a picture from seemingly nowhere and handed it to him. RJ's eyes widened without him even realizing it. Zelda's mom was frickin' HUGE. The picture showed Zelda and another lioness at least four times her size! Zelda's mother had reddish brown fur with long black hair that was tied together towards the tip. Her eyes were the same brown of Zelda's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness anthro had a belly that dwarfed her daughter's entire body with a large pair of breasts settling on top of it. Those were really the only part of her that could be called fat, however. The rest of her was toned muscle. Strong legs and arms with clearly defined muscles and tight buttocks. Her face was even devoid of fat, proud and almost youthful with only a few lines under her eyes to denote her age. Overall, RJ could say that Zelda's mother was one of the largest anthros he'd ever seen and probably in the best shape. Heck, even her gargantuan gut was a tight wrecking ball instead of a mountain of flab like her daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn...\" He honestly couldn't help it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I hardly believe myself and she raised me.\" Zelda agreed. \"I swear she could have tried out for the ASL but didn't want to. Big mama Haley had other ideas.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ nodded, giving the picture back to Zelda. \"So what's she like? Anything to watch out for.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Confident and playful. Like to tease. Real proud of her size but always looking to get bigger. She's a bit domineering but only because she wants to look out for everyone. She feels like she's got to be everyone's pillar of support. Someone they can count on. She just goes a bit too far.\" Zelda rubbed her chin in thought. \"The only time I've ever seen her angry was this time when I was little that this elephant gal tried to pick on me. Mom nearly tore her apart and threatened to serve her family up a dinner if she even looked at me funny.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ gave a low whistle. \"Man, she's protective!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep but that's the only time I can remember even seeing her mad. So, you really don't have to worry too much.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When is she coming?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She should be here tomorrow evening will be staying for about a week. Nothing too crazy. What could happen?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ felt an ominous feeling at that...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It sucks that I have to call in even though I just started, but it can't be helped. You should...probably get changed while I'm doing that...\" RJ pulled out his cell phone and began to dial the number. Zelda looked down and finally remembered that her bath robe was left open, leaving her tight underwear exposed. She let out a scoff while getting up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're going to pull this off you shouldn't car about just this. We may need to fake a kiss or two, so man up.\" She made her way towards the closet, but a knock at the door caught her attention. RJ was talking with his boss, saying he had a non-existent flu and would need the next two days off. Zelda sighed and tied her robe as she made for the door. RJ hung up and looked back towards Zelda. Seconds after the door opened, the large lioness let out a pained mewl as large furry arms crushed her in a powerful hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mouth hung open as he saw Haley. Even having seen the picture, even after trying to mentally prepare himself, it was still quite a sight. Zelda practically dissapeared while covered in her mother's muscular arms against her rubbery stomach and large breasts. <br>\r\n\"Ah, Mom?! Let go! You're crushing me!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry sweetie. But it's been so long since I've seen you!\"<br>\r\n\"I saw you last month!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley gave one final squeeze before releasing her child. To think they were both lion anthros yet there was such a difference in strength! <br>\r\n\"Besides, aren't you supposed to come tomorrow? I'm not even dressed yet.\" <br>\r\n\"I wanted to surprise you! Besides, it's not like I was interrupting any...thing...\" she said, finally noticing RJ sitting inside. She looked between him and Zelda a few times. Then Zelda's robe fell open. \"Huh. I guess I AM interrupting something. Maybe mommy can show you a few things~\" <br>\r\n\"Mom we are not-!\"<br>\r\n\"Calm down, I'm kidding. I can smell that nothing happened...yet.\"<br>\r\n\"Just shut up and come inside.\" Zelda motioned for her mother to follow inside. The larger lioness struggled to get inside through the doorway. While all doors in the building were built large for the taller anthros, she still struggled to fit. When she gave up on fitting, she forced her way through by breaking the frame. Zelda sighed and went into her closet. <br>\r\n\"You're paying for that before you leave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley sat down on a couch on the other side of RJ that Zelda was in moments before. It shattered under her immense weight. The older woman grinned at the human as RJ finally snapped out of his trance. <br>\r\n\"It's nice to finally meet you ma'am. My name is RJ, I'm Zelda's boyfriend.\" He stood up and reached a hand out. If he was going to act, he might as well play the part right. She gave a catlike grin and shook his hand firmly. <br>\r\n\"I'm Haley, the mother to that little cub. But I must say, I'm shocked Zelda is dating...anyone really.\"<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" RJ couldn't help but chuckle. Zelda was usually a symbol of fear to RJ. A constant reminder that he was the bottom of the food chain. Seeing this embarrassed side of her was actually pretty cute. <br>\r\n\"We just started going out recently. I must say, I'm quite fond of your daughter. I hope you don't mind if I take her from you.\" Making up lies on the spot was actually pretty easy, but remembering all of them would be a bit of a hassle. He'd need to get Zelda alone later to make up details.<br>\r\n\"My, such a smooth talker! Keep that up and I might take you for myself!\" Zelda stepped out of the closet with a bundle of clothes in her hand. <br>\r\n\"That's it. I give up. You two talk while I go shower. RJ has the day off, so we'll take you out.\" As his fake lover went towards the bathroom RJ noticed her silently mouth the words \"No details\" before shutting the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft alone, Haley suddenly got a serious expression. She leaned forward and looked him dead in the eye. <br>\r\n\"Let's get to the point. I love my daughter. I don't want anything to hurt her. Am I clear?\"<br>\r\n\"Y-yes ma'am.\"<br>\r\n\"Call me Haley.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright...Haley.\"<br>\r\n'Now, I'm going to ask you a serious question. If I feel like your lying, you're going straight to here.\" She pointed at her rock hard gut. It was so large, it could probably fit him, Zelda, and several others and still have room! He nodded his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat surprising question does she ask him?</span></div></div>",

It was like she was carved out of stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man gave a shuddering breath, suddenly aware of the rapid beating of his heart, before he answered. \"Y-Yeah...I suck at lying. Never really it done too often.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley nodded, never breaking eye contact. \"Trust me, I can tell. It's not really a bad thing, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ raised a brow. \"So how did you know exactly?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley gave a sigh. \"If Zelda had really found someone to date, she would've called me.

If he told the truth, Zelda would make his life Hell if she didn't just eat him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, the truth shall set you free</i>, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, Zelda promised me that I wouldn't have to pay rent for several months if we did this. She wanted you off her back for a little while. She thought this was her best bet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley shook her head. \"All I want is for her to be happy. She seems content to just close herself off. It's not healthy nor is it right.\" She then thought over what RJ said. \"Is rent here that bad? I always thought my little cub was reasonable about those kinds of things.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ fidgeted. How do you tell someone that their daughter threatened to eat you every month if you couldn't pay your rent? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...it is.\" RJ started, gathering his courage. \"It's just that, Zelda added a little clause to my lease.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley's eyes narrowed. \"What clause?\" Her tone was low, underlined with displeasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ wished the ground could have opened a swallowed him right then and there. \"Zelda told me that if I don't have, my rent first thing every month...she'd eat me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley stared at him for the longest time and RJ couldn't tell what she was thinking. That was at least before the immense lioness let out an angry bark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!!\" She bellowed. \"What kind of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Haley was still staring him straight in the eye, gauging his reaction. <br>\r\n\"If I'm being completely honest...we haven't done anything yet. We just started dating, so we haven't even had a kiss yet.\" It was all technically true...but Haley was still staring at him. Without saying a word, it was clear she wanted him to continue.

But Haley finally let out a sigh and reclined on the couch. <br>\r\n\"I must say, that's quite a daring thing to say to someone's mother. But I like that. It sounds like my little cub finally snagged herself a good one.\" RJ finally allowed himself to let out a sigh of relief and relax. The serious air was gone, and Haley was back to her light hearted side. <br>\r\n\"Thanks. My grandma always said I was a catch.\" Haley let out a chuckle, but slid forward again. <br>\r\n\"However, if I ever find out that you cheated on her or broke her heart I'll put you between two slices of bread.\"<br>\r\n\"U-understood.\"<br>\r\n\"One more thing.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Haley smiled at him. <br>\r\n\"If she ever breaks up with you, give me a call\" she says with a wink. Before he can even stutter the door to the bathroom swings open. Zelda steps out wearing a long skirt and a sweater that struggled against her large gut. With a towel on her head she made her way over to RJ and slid a hand on his shoulder. He felt her heavy breasts against his head as she faked a hug with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, did you find out what you wanted about my little man?\"<br>\r\n\"For now.\"<br>\r\n\"What did you guys even talk about?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, RJ was assuring me that I'd be a grandmother soon!\" RJ felt his blood run cold as one of Zelda's claws slid dangerously close to his neck. Right over an important vein. <br>\r\n\"N-n-no we weren't!\" He couldn't tell if her sharp claw was piercing him or not, but the presence of it didn't waver. Until Haley started laughing. <br>\r\n\"That's my little cub. Always getting so worked up over a joke.\" Her claw retreated and RJ took a deep breath. He might not have many of those left. Looking up he noticed Zelda was blushing. <br>\r\n\"I'm not a cub...\" she muttered. RJ reached up and have her hand a soft pat. <br>\r\n\"Don't worry honey, she's just showing her affection. My parents do the same thing. At least yours doesn't bring naked baby pictures...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaley cracked up laughing and even Zelda smiled. Maybe this won't be such a bad week after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr it could get much worse. What happens next? </span></div></div>",

She even gave him a fairly deep cut on the arm halfway through after they had to fake a first kiss. A kiss that neither one denied enjoyed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Haley bought all of it. At the end of the seven days, they were all crammed into Zelda's car and pulling up to the airport. Normally there would be more than enough space to fit five people, but with Haley's girth RJ was squished between seats as he sat in the back.

Her hide is a dark grey-brown in color, like stone, and her head almost scrapes the 15-foot-tall ceiling. She's very heavily built, with thick pillar-like legs with thick thighs, a massive ass, a great pudgy stomach, and utterly enormous breasts that each look like they weigh more than RJ's entire body. Long wavy black hair runs down to the small of her back, and her face is equipped with a short pair of tusks, a trunk, and a pair of bright green eyes. The elephant's immense bulk is just barely contained by a simple black tank top and jeans, but it's clear that the clothes are a size or two too small for her; RJ idly wonders if she might burst out of them if she breathes in too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RJ, this is Ivory. She's going to be your roommate, which means she's also gonna be chipping in for your rent. However, if you end up in her gut, I'm not responsible for it.\" Zelda summarizes, ignoring RJ's paling face at that last comment. \"Now go head off, I've got shit to do. Unless, of course, you <i>want</i> to be fat on my tits...\"<br>\r\nRJ frantically scrambles out of the room before the lioness can finish her sentence; with a shrug, Ivory follows him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two reach RJ's - now technically <i>their</i> - apartment without much incident.

And not just any roommate but a total stranger. Was this even allowed in his lease? He hadn't argued with Zelda because he was afraid of being eaten, but now that he was alone with this massive elephant, he wished he'd asked more questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis apartment was small by anthro standards, which meant it was more than big enough for RJ. It was only when he invited Sabrina over that he realized how puny his home must seem from an anthro's perspective. Ivory was even bigger than his wolf friend, her girth taking up a third of the living room on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um,\" RJ said awkwardly. \"This is the living room. Sorry about the mess, I didn't know I was getting a roomie today.\" He smiled but Ivory's face was expressionless. RJ coughed awkwardly. \"So, kitchen's over there, bathroom's there and... huh. I just remembered we only have the one bedroom... I wonder if Zelda remembers that... Well, the couch is a pull-out so you can use that for now--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take the bed,\" Ivory grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the bed's mine--\" The elephant looked at him and something in her eyes made him zip it. \"I mean sure, my room's your room! Literally, I guess? I'll take the pull-out for now. So... um... I'm not sure what else you need to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, there was a large rumbling sound. RJ startled and looked around for the noise when he realized it was coming from the colossal gut of the elephant woman. She traced one finger over her stomach and looked at RJ. The look sent shivers up his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starving,\" she grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the kitchen's fully stocked. I went food shopping yesterday. Feel free to help yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't have to tell me twice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore RJ could move Ivory's tusk lashed out and roped around him like a lasso, tying him up and lifting him off his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helping myself,\" she said as she positioned him over her gaping mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we're supposed to be roommates!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elephant shrugged. \"I prefer my privacy. And I make more than enough on my salary to afford rent on my own. I don't need you. Besides, you heard Zelda. She doesn't care one way or another if I eat you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-but-but-wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvory paid him no mind as she stuffed him feet-first into her mouth. Her tongue greedily lapped at his legs, tickling his skin. She gave off an \"mmmm\" of satisfaction at his taste. RJ fought against the trunk, but it was wrapped tight around him like a boa constrictor. He pleaded but Ivory gave no sign that she heard him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ivory! Don't do this! Please! We can work something out! We can--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>GLUCK</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvory worked RJ's kicking feet to the back of her mouth and swallowed. Her trunk released him and RJ gave off a frightened yipe as he was pulled completely into her mouth. Darkness was all around him. His legs were halfway down her throat. He tried to use his newly free hands to pull himself out, but her esophagus was stronger than his entire body. No matter how much he strained, he wasn't going anywhere. He sputtered as Ivory ran her tongue up and down his face. Sucking the last few drops of flavor from his body was the only reason why she hadn't sent the rest of him down her gullet already. He needed to think of something fast! He threw his dignity away like it was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'LL BE YOUR SLAVE FOREVER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ cringed, waiting for the second swallow that would spell his doom, but it didn't come. The elephant's tongue went still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Schlave?\" she asked, her voice booming in his ears, slurping on her drool. \"Wha do oo een, schlave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ saw a chance and he took it. \"Slave, yes! Spare me and I'll do whatever you want! I'll cook for you, I'll clean for you, I'll cater to you on hand-and-foot. I'll live to serve you, just don't eat me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvory paused in thought. A human slave. The idea did have a certain appeal. Much more than the idea of a human roommate at any rate. On the other hand, judging by how messy the apartment was, he might not be much use for cleaning. And Zelda did have a maid to clean the apartments for the residents... Though, she was a skunk. The rooms may look clean afterwards but they certainly didn't smell good. What to do? Ivory sucked on her human treat for a minute as she thought, meanwhile RJ spent the entire time whimpering and praying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A'righ,\" Ivory slurped. \"I've mayd uph mah mind. You will be my...\"</span></div></div>",

He was convinced he was about to go flailing down Ivory's throat but instead he was sucked up into her trunk and shot out the end like a loogie. RJ splatted on the ground and shuddered at the feeling of elephant snot covering him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew ew ew ew ew ew ew!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock it off,\" Ivory said. \"I didn't spare you to listen to you whine. I'm doing you a favor by not eating you, but it's never too late for me to change my mind.\" She emphasized her point by smacking her belly. \"Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" RJ squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now clean yourself up and do it fast. I'm still hungry and you're gonna take care of that. Either by cooking me a meal or being one. Oh, and before I forget, hand over your cell phone and your computer. I don't want you getting any ideas on calling for help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ reluctantly handed over his phone and pointed out his computer on the living room table. Then he scurried to the bathroom and began washing all the spit and snot off his body. All the time he wondered, how was he going to get out of this? Back when he was seconds away from being swallowed, a lifetime of servitude seemed like a small price to pay for his life, but now that he was back in the outside world, he didn't have a clue of what he'd gotten himself into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm waiting!\" Ivory yelled from the next room. RJ left the bathroom. For a second his eyes shot to the door. Ivory was sitting on the couch, using his laptop. She didn't even look at him but she said. \"Don't even think about it. Just remember that I'm faster than you think. And I can be a Grade-A Bitch when someone makes me mad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ grimaced. He decided to take her word for it. He went to the kitchen and began cooking a breakfast big enough for a hungry elephant. RJ heard Ivory typing away at his laptop, wondering what she was doing on it. Maybe it'd be smart to talk to her? After all, if they could be friends, he might be able to talk her out of this whole slave situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" RJ asked as casually as possible, \"what do you do for a living?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Video game reviewer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Cool! I work for Tooth &amp; Claw Gaming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their games suck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... well I just handle computer security...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not any more you don't,\" Ivory said. \"Remember, you work for me, and I work from home. You'll be sticking around here doing whatever I ask. Speaking of which, that food better be ready soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeems Ivory isn't the type to make friends easily. RJ decided to just keep quiet and focus on making her breakfast. RJ piled the food on several plates and carried them to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that it?\" Ivory demanded, sounding unimpressed. RJ's heart fell. Ivory scoffed. \"Whatever. It'll do for now. But you better get your act together for lunch. In the mean time, clean this place up. It's a sty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvory grabbed fistfuls of food and shoveled them into her mouth. To think, if he didn't play his cards right, he'd be joining that breakfast. RJ gulped and began cleaning up his messy apartment. It looked like he couldn't get out of this on his own. He needed help. Sabrina was the first person he thought of who could save him. She was always so protective of him. Whenever he was late to work and didn't call in, she usually checked up on him during her lunch break. If she saw what was going on, she'd help for sure! Maybe she'd even let him crash at her place until he could find somewhere less dangerous to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop your lollygagging! As soon as this living room's cleaned up, you'll be giving me a foot massage.\" Ivory kicked off her shoes, exposing her elephantine feet. RJ shuddered. He could smell them from across the room. He begged Sabrina would check up on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she?</span></div></div>",

RJ looked up from collecting the bits of trash around the living room at the towering elephant and gave an audible gulp of anxiety. He was really banking on the Albino Wolf to save him from this newfound hellhole, but now that she knew about her\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, well, she\u2019s an albino wolf who leads the graphic design department at Tooth &amp; Claw. She's...really nice, and imaginative. She\u2019s a great friend who always has my b-\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow big is she?\u201d Ivory interrupted him as she began deleting contacts besides Sabrina\u2019s from RJ\u2019s phone, starting with names that sounded like family to his workplace. She grabbed a another fistful of food from the relatively small breakfast her new Human slave made and gave out a deep belch. \u201cWell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d RJ grimaced, not liking where Ivory was going with this. \u201cShe\u2019s...about eight feet tall. I don\u2019t know how much she weighs, but I guess you could just call her fat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCall her.\u201d Ivory ordered, tossing the phone to RJ lazily. The human scurried to catch the black mirror and immediately called Sabrina. This was great! The stone colored Elephant was leading his salvation straight to him! Soon, this morning will just be seen as a distant and brief nightmare. \u201cPut it on speakerphone.\u201d The pachyderm ordered again. The slave was puzzled by this, but obliged, not wanting to incur her wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BZZZT*...*BZZZT*...*CLICK*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey RJ, how ya\u2019 doin\u2019?\u201d A cheery voice greeted RJ as Sabrina picked up. \u201cDid you remember to pay Zelda, today? I don\u2019t like all those comments she makes about you, ya\u2019 know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hey there, Sabrin-na.\u201d RJ stuttered, failing miserably to conceal the anxiety in his voice, while Ivory rolled her eyes. \u201cI was wondering if you uh...we-wanted to come over for a visit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRJ, Is something wrong? You sound like you\u2019ve seen a ghost.\u201d Sabrina detected her human friends fear and immediately tried to soothe him. \u201cDid someone try to eat you?! I\u2019ll give them a piece of mind if that\u2019s what it is!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no, it\u2019s not that Sabrina\u2026\u201d RJ looked up at Ivory, apathetic as ever and making a gesture with her pudgy hand to keep going. \u201cI just uh...there's something really important I have to talk to you about. It\u2019s...It\u2019s about us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a short silence after that, before RJ and Ivory could hear rapid, deep breathing on the other end. \u201cOh. Uh...Sure RJ! I\u2019ll be there in a couple minutes!\u201d With that, there was an audible deadline sound as the Phone Call ended. RJ let out a sign, hating that he had to emotionally manipulate his best friend like that. Not that he had much of a choice anyways, but still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...why do did you call her here?\u201d RJ tapped his fingers together as he began to collect the trash in the room again, not wanting to appear lazy to Ivory. Sure, he was about to get as far away from this sociopath as possible, but a lot of things can happen in a couple of minutes. \u201cDid...you want to talk to her about video games or\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep cleaning all this shit up.\u201d Ivory ordered one last time as she exited the Living Room into her new bedroom, RJ\u2019s old bedroom, slamming the door behind her. The human let out a nervous shrug and continued to tidy up his...her apartment. Something didn't feel right about this, the human felt it at the bottom of his gut that something really bad was about to happen. He repressed these feelings and kept trying to be optimistic, time seeming to slow down as he waited for the Albino Wolf in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five minutes, RJ had successfully cleaned up a good portion of his old living room. He sighed and wiped his brow of sweat, impressed of the amount of work he had done in such a short amount of time. He just wished that the prospect of digesting and being turned into Elephantine blubber wasn't the main factor motivating him. Suddenly, he heard a series of knocks on the front door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey RJ, I-I\u2019m here!\u201d Sabrina opened the door and let herself in. She let out an impressed whistle, noting how clean the living room looked. \u201cWow, Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a little early for spring cleaning buddy, what\u2019s gotten into you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore RJ could let out a single peep from his mouth, Ivory barreled through the bedroom door into the living room, catching him and Sabrina off by surprise. \u201cW-woah! Who the hell are-?!\u201d The fifteen foot tall elephant didn't allow the albino wolf to finish her sentence as she grabbed the smaller anthro by her waist and wrapped her trunk around her neck. \u201cUh, RJ, what\u2019s going on?!\u201d Those were the last cohesively sounding words RJ heard from his best friend as Ivory lifted her up from the ground and plunged her head into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...nonononono!\u201d RJ began to sob as he understood what was unfolding before him. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t eat her, Ivory, you can't! She\u2019s my only friend, spit her out!\u201d The human rushed up to Ivory as began to pound on her exposed feet, his punches and kicks only amounting to a pleasant foot massage for her. \u201cPlease...please you can\u2019t!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvory couldn't care less about what her slave wanted. All she cared about was getting a proper breakfast in her system and getting rid of a liability in one fell swoop. She felt RJ wail and force all of his strength onto her feet, giving her the foot massage she asked for earlier. \u2018Hmmm...emotionally abusing him makes him do his jobs faster...good to know.\u2019 The elephant pondered as she effortlessly move more of Sabrina into her gaping, slimy maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou monster, I hate you!\u201d RJ bawled, failing to take the chance with running away through the now open door in his emotional state. He collapsed to the floor, spending the last of his energy railing onto the pungent feet of his new mistress. This was his life now. He was going to be a slave for Ivory until the day he died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Sabrina was watching her life flash before her eyes. Wet, gooey slime coated her face and lubed her down Ivory\u2019s slick, wide throat to her inevitable destination. RJ watched in horror as his friend's shoulders slid past the elephant\u2019s blunt teeth and lips. Still hungry from that pathetic excuse of a breakfast her new slave made, she slid her draping jaws over the albino wolf\u2019s chest as she kicked at nothing an beated her fists into her fat breasts and stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvory opened her mouth wider than both RJ and Sabrina could imagine and chomped down on her heavyset waist, further gulping her down as she was soon nothing but a pair of flailing legs sticking out of her lips, shouting in peril as she was pushed closer to her inevitable demise. The sounds the elephant made as she swallowed his friend made the human shiver in disgust, opening her mouth wide again with a big contented sigh before pushing the albino wolf further and chomping down on her chubby legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ could only sit they're on the floor of his old apartment living room, traumatized as more of his best and only friend since he came to the anthro world disappear before his eyes. He wanted to help, his friends final scream making him feel obligated to, though he knew he would suffer the same fate if he did. He watched Ivory\u2019s blubbery neck bulge with her body as she slid slickly down her gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvory lifted the albino wolf\u2019s flailing lower section over he head as she felt her body curl into a fetal position in the digested remains of her meager breakfast. She continued to chug down with more and more powerful gulps, Sabrina now reduced to just wiggling her feet before the stone pachyderm claimed her fully in the name of her appetite. RJ stared at the bulge Sabrina\u2019s feet made as it disappeared into her chest, the massive stomach wobbling like a provoked waterbed as it bulges with it\u2019s new occupant. The human looked at her now even bigger gut as it hung closer to the ground, the fat and muscle masking any sort of movement behind it\u2019s dark, rubbery textured flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOomph...ya\u2019 got any more friends, slave?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was all a fantasy that RJ never wanted to see come true, but now with the Elephants gigantic tummy hovering over him ominously, all he can do is cry his eyes out as he tries in vain to not get off to Sabrina\u2019s demise.

He attempted to bat the phone away like an insect, but this was only met with the elephant giving off a humongous belch, sending bits of saliva that hit him in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ continued to cry pitifully, his only friend Sabrina was just consumed, and Ivory\u2019s unrelenting humiliation was just salt in the already deep wound. \u201cOh my god, you can\u2019t fake a face like that. One moment, I\u2019m going to share this with all my friends.\u201d The elephant sends the picture and begins typing away at her phone as her friends begin to comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, Sabrina squirms away and pleads for her life, stuffed tight in a prison of raw flesh hidden under layer upon layer of stomach purge and muscle. Her voice couldn\u2019t make it out through Ivory\u2019s flab, keeping her begs of mercy at bay as she bathed in the digestive acids. Had she really come so far in life...just to be fat jiggling on an elephant\u2019s ass? Ivory sets down her smartphone and smiles wickedly at RJ while he sobs and whimpers on the floor. As she let out yet another meaty, rolling belch, she pats her squirming stomach and sits down next to crying, unwilling human slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet you want to be where your girlfriend is now, huh? All squirming and churning around in my gut...I honestly didn\u2019t think that sluts like you even existed until today. It\u2019s so big and round, ain\u2019t it? I bet this just makes your day~\u201d. RJ doesn't offer an answer, opting to avoid Ivory\u2019s gaze as she continues to rub her belly sensually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvory sighs contently. \u201cTell you what, little...RJ, right? Since you have such a hard on for me and my big fat gut, you\u2019ve pretty much secured your place as my slave. You would be less than a snack If I ate you, but this\u2026\u201d She wipes away a tear rolling down RJ\u2019s cheek with her dexterous trunk. \u201c...brings me eternal joy. So, lets have some \u2018fun\u2019, shall we?\u201d<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She was a 15 foot tall and very pear shaped white dragon woman with a cyan colored underbelly and lips with long blonde hair. For clothing she was wearing tight white spandex pants, a bra and gloves with what looked like a cape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragons lowers her head to RJ's level and smiles. \"Hello,\" she says. \"I must say, I didn't think any human would willingly live in this apartment. Good to meet you. I'm Emma.\" Emma holds out her hand and RJ nervously shakes it. As he looks up he sees that Emma's teeth in the back seem to be bright pink. This made him nervous. Her mouth looked big enough to gulp him down in one bite. But RJ nervously smiled and shook hands with his new roommate. Zelda actually smiles as she rubs her massive stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she says. \"I'll leave you both to get acquainted. However RJ, if you there's any trouble between you and Emma, you won't be getting a new roommate, you'll be getting a new apartment. Namely, my belly.\" Zelda smiles and shows her sharp teeth to RJ as he steps back nervously. Son RJ and Emma reached the apartment and Emma started to unpack. Most of her supplies were painting supplies. \"I see you're an artist.\" Says RJ. Emma snorts out some smoke from her nostrils and smiles. \"Mainly a painter by choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ hung up Emma's paintings and saw that a majority was light blue and pink in terms of color schemes. \"They're pretty good.\" \"Thanks.\" Says Emma. \"So what do you do for a living.\" RJ shrugs his shoulders. \"I work at Tooth &amp; Claw Gaming as a programmer.\" \"Oh really? Isn't that building full of carnivores.\" \"It is, but I've got a friend named Sabrina to take care of me.\" Emma smiles and takes a seat on the couch, unintentionally breaking it in the process. \"Oops,\" she says. \"Sorry about that.\" \"Well,\" says RJ. \"It happens.

As RJ set the luggage down gently, and fumbled with the keys, he heard a low, guttural noise, almost like a growl. Looking for the source of the noise, he noticed the foreign vixen cover her mouth with one of the kimono's long sleeves, embarrassed. With a cough, she turned her gaze away from his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!... ahem... you hungry, Misuto?\" upon seeing her affirmative response, RJ chuckled, fitting the key into his door. \"It's alright, I can order some takeout if you want, I'm not much of a cook anyways. Want some japanese noodles?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I do not mean to impose, it is true I am your roommate, but I can pay for my half.\" she replied, pouting. Something in the back of RJ's mind found her expression to be... cute. Seeing this golden-furred fox of a woman, clad in a traditional piece of clothing, pouting  and speaking with a slight accent was kinda cute. It reminded him of those japanese anime shows, he mused to himself. \"...besides, I do not think you would be able to pay for my meal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCocking his eyebrow, RJ gaver her a confused stare. Was she that big of an eater? The Japanese noodle shop near Furdale Towers was not that expensive, either. With a shrug, he gestured to her with his head pointing at the now-opened door, and picked the luggage back up. With a polite (if somewhat frantic) nod, Misuto entered the premises, followed by the room's original tenant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much, RJ. Miss Zelda said you were a bit troublesome, but I guess she was just exaggerating.\" like a refined lady, she sat herself gently on the old loveseat RJ had in the living room. Oddly enough, the old piece of furniture creaked as she sat, as if she was really heavy, creating something of a tense moment in the room. Coughing again and covering her muzzle with the kimono's sleeve, she turned away, as if finding the paintings on the wall to be interesting works of art. With another shrug, you head to the telephone and look through the contact notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, that couch is pretty old, don't worry about it.\" is what he said. In his head though, he pondered about the times he sat on it and it had never given so much of a creak. Having found the noodle shop's number, he started dialing the digits, and soon enough, the voice of a polite senior was speaking on his ear. \"Hello? 'Afternoon, Mr. Sato. Yeah, I'd like to place an order, just the usual soup with noodles, corn, and pork. Yes of course, no wasabi. Hang on, I have someone else here with an order, I'll pass to her.\" and with that, he handed the phone to Misuto, who took it with an eager look on her face. Saying something that sounded like 'moshi moshi', she began speaking in Japanese, seemingly happy at hearing someone communicating in her native language. After a few minutes of her describing her order, she finished, and handed RJ the phone back. \"Hello? Oh, eh... she's a new roommate the landlady arranged for me to share the room with. Yeah, I'll... what. She ordered THAT much? I... fine, I mean, I'm in no rush... really? But I... alright, thanks. See you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ put the phone back in its base, and regarded his roomie with a dumbfounded expression, and the vixen, wagging her tails from side to side, smiled. \"I told you, you wouldn't be able to pay for all of that. So, for your help carrying my luggage here, the meal's on me today.\" RJ had no words. He just scratched his head, and sighed. \"He also said the order would be delivered here in twenty minutes, so, until then... do you happen to have....s-some snacks? I'm still a bit hungry.\" Still looking at her warily, he nodded and gestured for her to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might as well give you the tour of the place. Come on, I have some chips in the pantry.\" and with that, she got back up and followed him, tails wagging.</span></div></div>",

I am sure we can be friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ raised an eyebrow at that but sighed and decided to let it be for now, continuing to help Misuto until all of her baggage was in the apartment.

In fact, wherever he was, it was damp, extremely cramped, warm, and <i>moving.</i> It didn't take him long to realize he was trapped inside a stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! Lemme out!\" He exclaimed, pounding on the stomach walls. Outside, Misuto was busy rinsing the glass she'd just used off, and gave her stomach a gentle pat. While RJ was sleeping, her instincts had gotten the better of her and she'd swallowed him down, legs first. Now that he was waking up, she wasn't too surprised that he was squirming around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Settle down RJ-san.\" Misuto said, letting out a soft belch from the gas worked up by the squirming. \"You're safe as long as you don't make my stomach act up.\" She murrs a bit as she walked around, unpacking her things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ groaned. \"Seriously, you couldn't even wait a whole day before eating me?\" He stopped pushing against the walls for now, hoping Misuto's stomach would at least stay dormant. While he was more annoyed than frightened so far (Misuto seemed genuine enough in just wanting to hold onto him for a while) he'd rather not be stored someplace that smelled like digested meat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next several minutes, Misuto and RJ chatted a bit as she unpacked, mostly just getting more acquainted.

Soon enough the stairs to the second floor were upon them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLosing no time in her stride Jasmine began to jog up the stairs. Her powerful legs propelled her quickly to the landing between the two flights to the next story. The poor little human she was carrying experienced quite a bit of whiplash as she rounded the corner and dashed up the last segment. With a final leap she launched herself up to the second floor. Sticking a perfect landing, she snickered as the back of RJ's head swung upwards and involuntarily smacked into the underside of her firm breast with a thunderous smack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still with me dork?\" She asked teasingly as her pace slowed back to a casual walk. Her apartment was back towards the end of the building and at her current leisurely gait it would take about five minutes to walk there. With a rough flinging motion she brought his body out in front of her to inspect the human, instantly mortified when she realized that RJ was unconscious. She hadn't wanted to hurt the little guy, Jasmine had simply wanted his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a panic she brought him into a much gentler carrying position, cradling his body in her arms. Satisfied that she had a better hold on him than before Jasmine rolled into a sprint and quickly arrived at the door to her apartment. The door was flung open, almost coming off the hinges, and the lizard deposited the unconscious man onto her couch before shutting the door and turning the deadbolt lock that was far out of RJ's reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPensively the lizard turned to face RJ, who seemed to be stirring. It wasn't a crime to hurt a human, or to even kill one, but Jasmine felt guilty all the same. And if RJ had any friends that might come after her, that just wouldn't be good. She had two options here. She could wait and see if the human was alright before going back to her original plan of messing around with him. Or, she could try to hide the evidence.</span></div></div>",

It was obvious that RJ was still alive, even returning to consciousness, but she worried about what he would try to do when he did come to. Would he try to scream? Would that wolf woman Sabrina come looking for him then? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plump wolfess wasn't too big of a threat in the lizard's eyes though, it was Sabrina's older sister Anna that she was most concerned about. There was no doubt such a gargantuan creature would be able to swallow Jasmine whole. Even if it was murder, no one got to be Anna's size on a diet of human alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only way out of this was sending RJ into her gullet before word could get out that in her clumsy show of physical strength she had injured the little man. \"Fuck.\" She muttered in frustration, clasping her palms on the sides of her head and rubbing vigorously. She really didn't want to go through with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one, even if she had a funny way of showing it, she kind of liked RJ. He always seemed so friendly to most everyone else. All Jasmine had wanted was a little kindness herself. Two, she knew eating the man would be arduous for a fitness fanatic like herself. She had never eaten someone before. It was insane that she was even considering this course of action. It would be fairly painful to swallow him with her inexperienced jaws, and weeks to work him off through exercise. Three, she didn't want to know if such an act would actually be something she enjoyed. If it turned out that the rush of consuming someone was great enough to make her do it again she would never be able to maintain her current lifestyle. From then on it would be junk food and maternity clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut something had to be done. The mere possibility of Sabrina and Anna coming after her was too frightening.</span></div></div>",

Or maybe she was in a calmer state of mind, and now it just seemed like a fun idea. She quickly stripped her gym shorts and sports bra to reveal her toned chest and muscularly thick hips. A minuscule layer of fat in the right places maintained her feminine look, but her tall reptilian form exuded immense amounts of power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe threw her clothes into a nearby hamper midway into kneeling down next to the couch. Jasmine couldn't help but luck her lips in anticipation as she glanced over RJ's helpless form. It felt like her fear was melting away as she imagined what it would be like to swallow him into one of her greedy orifices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of her rock hard yellow midriff and thighs sliding around his body was the first vision that greeted RJ as he finally regained consciousness. As he tried to jump up and run away her powerful arms grabbed him mid stride to bring him down to the carpeted floor. \"Where are you off to nerd? You've got a pretty woman you need to satisfy first.\" Her tail shot around to his ankles, pulled his shoes and socks off with one motion, then regained their purchase around the bare skin on his waist and held him fast to free her hands for the tasks ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ struggled in her grasp as she pulled his shirt off with a free hand. \"Jasmine, I'm sorry for bumping into you downstairs but I need to go, m-maybe I can make it up to you lat-\" His voice disappeared as she began to remove his pants. A noticeable bulge in his underwear was the first thing apparent to both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lizard woman let out a long winded whistle as she threw his pants on the other side of the couch. \"That looks like it might be a good sized joystick, maybe you can show me how you play with it.\" A devilish smirk crept across her lips as she grabbed hold of his boxers with both hands and began to pull them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to thrash and did his best to push the Amazonian reptile off of him but it was in vain. \"An erection doesn't mean anything! It's involuntary! Let me go!\" To RJ's dismay his protests received no response other than excited and emasculating laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, you're a pretty good size for being such a little guy, RJ.\" She remarked as her clawed fingertips danced along the length of his shaft. \"Maybe later I can show you a good time. But for right now, there's an emptiness inside me you can fill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widened with terror as he realized what she meant. \"Jasmine, no. No please. Please don't eat me!\" RJ curled up into a ball and tried to shove away the world. This couldn't be his fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA haughty laugh of absolute victory thundered down on him from above, followed by a somewhat reassuring clarification. \"Relax dweeb.

Her tail contracted, pulling him upright and positioning her captive just below her muscular cheeks. \"I know you don't work out much RJ, but I think this experience might give you a new appreciation for exercise.\" The amazon leaned forward at the point to spread her glutes further apart and give RJ a better look at his destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he could muster the will to do was wiper at the thought of what was about to happen. His eyes shut as tears welled down his face. A stray thought about how his sorrow was literally about to be lubrication for her lust crossed his mind, and it made him even sadder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to say goodbye for a while RJ. I'll be sure to let you know if I plan to let you out before squat thrust day. Haven't decided whether or not I need the extra resistance yet.\" Halfway through the last sentence Jasmine rapidly lowered herself onto RJ's head. The sides of his skull felt nice against her ass, and she could scarcely contain her excitement as she felt the human's hair begin to tickle her butthole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ fought hard against her tail around his waist but he couldn't seem to make any progress against it. It seemed to coil tighter as he struggled, and soon enough his attention turned from the muscular limb to the muscular ring of flesh that had begun to advance down his scalp and onto his forehead. He began to scream in absolute horror as her anus stretched over his brow and blinded him with her surprisingly clean rectum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lizard cooed with delight as she felt RJ's nose and lips slip inside of her. She let out a gasp of surprise as his chin was swallowed up and the resistance slackened. In short order his neck was completely gone and Jasmine began to work on his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside RJ was dumbstruck as he found that he could breathe the musky air inside of his nemesis. Though it gave him small comfort, he was still dismayed as he felt Jasmine's hands grab his upper arms and in conjunction with her tail work to pull him in deeper. He was up to his nipples, and then his navel in her backside before long. Her arms retreated at this point and Jasmine got on all fours. A gasp of surprise rang out as RJ's head began to file into her intestine, followed by his waist and then the base of his cock meeting in up with her entrapping flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moan of bliss slithered from the jet black and pale yellow lizard woman's lips as she began to feel RJ's erection and parts of her own tail slide into her butt. She pulled her limb from her anal clench in time to fold the human's member upward against his belly, saving him from some discomfort.. She was considerate when she had to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another contraction the hungry lizard swallowed RJ up to his knees into her cavernous digestive tract. The simple act of the lizard standing up was enough to pull him in to his own feet, and Jasmine reveled in the discovery that her tail was enough to keep him from being visible from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer front was a different story however. Despite her musculature the simple fact that she had a fully grown human man in her abdomen meant her body had to make room somehow. A slight protrusion against her toned belly muscles was the solution, and she could plainly see his outlines as she rubbed the bulges he made in her well kept flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get comfy twerp. Damn you feel good in there...\" Jasmine had decided the act of taking a human into her rectum was enough exercise for now. In fact she was now glistening with sweat and panting. In a huff she sat down on the couch and finally drove RJ's feet inside of her. She then flipped the TV to a basketball game and enjoyed her captive's wriggling, struggles, and her own involuntary spasms.</span></div></div>",

A sickening squelch could be heard as she shoved his feet toe first into her depths, and her shameless moaning was deafening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick contraction later and suddenly RJ found himself buried up to his calves in her most sensitive flesh. Every motion he made sent charges through her nerves that elicited painful gasps of pleasure and only served to make Jasmine want to contain RJ with the power of her womanhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, squirm for me my little toy. That's... iiiiittttt...\" She pulled on his arms like a wishbone in order to drive him further into her awaiting vagina. Soon enough he slipped in to his knees, and then his navel. Well over a quarter of his mass lay past her cervix at this point. \"I see what all the fuss is about now. Swallowing humans is a hell of a good time. Not really a fan of gaining weight though, so I figured some alternative methods needed to be brought to the table...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pleasured grunt escaped her jaws as RJ was consumed to his nipples, with his arms and head flailing uselessly outside. \"Jasmine please stop! I'm begging you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lizard ignored his pleas as she placed her palm on the back of his head and pushed into herself. With a contented grin she beamed at the fact that a fully grown human was now writhing in her womb with only his elbows to his hands sticking out into the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed like this as she teased her captive, roiling her distended belly and its occupant to the point of violently bouncing it on her hips while she sat on the couch and listened to her workout mixtape. \"Bet you wish you hadn't ignored me now, huh RJ? Only one thing left to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Amazonian reptile stood up and clenched her kegel muscles, pulling RJ's arms into her fleshy embrace with a single powerful contraction. \"All mine until I decide to let you out, you bastard!\" She announced in a mocking tone. \"You'll never be able to pretend I don't exist after I'm done with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding the couch once again Jasmine allowed herself to simply fall upon it, reveling in the feeling of the tiny man in her loins squirming and being jostled around by her rough play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling quite horny after conquering her annoying neighbor, the lizard set to work fingering herself and massaging one of her nipples.

On the outside, RJ had been unable to tell how much of her body was her and how much was her baggy maid uniform, but now that he was actually inside her, he knew that she was indeed a sizable anthro. She may not have been as fat as Zelda or Sabrina--RJ's form made a slight bulge in her stomach whereas if one of the others had eaten him, nobody would've ever known--but even empty her gut was still pretty large. Despite RJ's presence squirming inside her, Maya's work ethic wasn't dampened at all. If anything, it made working more fun. Instead of feeling sluggish, she felt giddy from the internal massage RJ was giving her with his squirms. His movements as he sloshed around her gut tickled, and she'd frequently burp involuntarily from the air shifting around inside her. At first it was embarrassing but after a while, Maya challenged herself to see how loud a burp she could give off. RJ's presence made the work day positively fly by!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor RJ, things weren't as rosy. His prison was cramped, moist and humid. Her insides reeked of previous meals, and the constant wobble of her stomach made him nauseous. Maya had said if his struggles pleased her, she'd let him go and RJ was praying she was telling the truth. He struggled against the insides of her stomach, his actions eliciting a giggle or a belch every now and then. The hours passed by at a crawl. He originally planned to raise as big a ruckus as he could inside Maya if he heard another anthro walking by. If it was someone he knew, it might've earned him his freedom, but against all odds Maya didn't run into a single other anthro through all her work. Not a resident and not an employee. As the hours stretched on and on, RJ began to feel his skin tingling from Maya's stomach acids. With panic, he inspected his body and saw his clothes were beginning to disintegrate. He had no idea how long he'd been inside her, but he knew it didn't take long for an anthro to digest a human. His squirming stopped being done in a pleasant attempt to gain the massive skunk's favor, instead they were desperate struggles for survival. These frantic movements caused Maya to unleash her biggest belch yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya smacked her lips, tasting RJ all over again with that latest belch, and sighed happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, that felt wonderful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya!\" RJ cried out, his words muffled by her fur and flab. \"Please let me out of here! I'm beginning to be digested!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya only laughed. \"Pipe down in there, you silly lunch! Work's not over yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya, please! I'll die in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ could feel Maya shrug even if he didn't see it. \"Maybe you will, maybe you won't. But if you keep interrupting my work, you're definitely not gonna make it. So shush up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya patted her stomach, which had the effect of smacking you in the face through her pudge. RJ stop pleading but not trying to escape. He clawed at the sphincter back up Maya's throat, but was unable to pry it open. Outside, Maya hummed to herself, enjoying RJ's failed efforts to gain freedom. What she hadn't told RJ was that she was almost finished cleaning the last room. Once that was done she'd be free to go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was, would Maya honor her word and release RJ? Or was she a liar who never planned on letting him out?</span></div></div>",

Tasting RJ again, the anthro walks back to her car and drives home. Back at her home, Maya takes off her uniform and changes into a wifebeater shirt and a pair of small blue shorts. The shirt couldn't cover her stomach and Maya pats it, smug with the human sitting still in her gut, aware of his place. Going to her couch, she lies on it and surfs her TV, with the occasional belly rub. Her stomach would rumble a bit once in a while, Maya would respond by breaking wind later on.<br>\r\n\"Phew! That's rank, RJ! Keep them to yourself!\" She jokes, after ripping her first fart of night, before pushing out another colon cloud from her rear, much to RJ's grumbling.<br>\r\nIt was near midnight, when the skunk anthro decided to hit the sack, and got into her bed, wet, bubbly farts coming from her rear for every movement she made. Getting under her covers, she lovingly rubs her stomach one last time and whispers.<br>\r\n\"Good night and pleasant journey.\"<br>\r\nSoon as her head hits the pillow, it's lights out for the skunk, but a few minutes later, the loudest fart of the night pulls the anthro out of bed and she rushes over to the bathroom, explosive flatulence expelled from her bottom. Had Maya noticed her stomach, it was much lower than before, indicating RJ was ready to come out. Once she finishes pushing him and RJ takes a shower, the human comes out of the bathroom, wearing a towel around his waist.<br>\r\n\"You are a bitch, you know that?\" He asks angrily, a smirk on the perpetrator's face and takes a step forward, making the smaller human blush.<br>\r\nSeeing her without her uniform, she has quite the body; her ample breasts sticking out a good deal, while her rump was at least five feet wide.<br>\r\n\"Like what you see? Maybe I should gas and spray? Never did that before and I still have plenty of gas left from you,\" she giggles, turning around and showing off her massive pants eating derriere, a small toot to prove point, if any.<br>\r\n\"I'll pass,\" he replies, going out of the room, or tries to.<br>\r\n\"Where do you think you're going? You're going to be sleeping with me, you got it?\" She states, revealing her sleepiness and drags RJ to her bed.<br>\r\nHe knew that fighting was useless and was quite surprised that the two of you were able to go to sleep. The next morning, RJ wakes up and sees that the anthro is still sleeping. Getting out, RJ heads to where you left your clothes after cleaning them and gets dressed. Thankfully for him it was the weekend and he approaches the door.</span></div></div>",

She'd promised to let him go once she was done work and she'd wrapped up just in time too. Her stomach acids were tingling worse than ever. He decided to stop struggling to avoid making her mad now that escape was in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can let out in my room,\" RJ said nervously. \"Don't worry about the mess, I'll clean it myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya giggled. \"Oh, how generous. I'll get right on that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ didn't like the way she said that but gave her the benefit of the doubt and waited patiently for the anthro to chuck him up. He sloshed around inside her as she walked, hopefully back to his apartment, but when she finally came to a stop in a room, she made no move to let him out. Unknown to RJ, Maya had returned to her own apartment. Inside she stretched then laid on her back on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home sweet home,\" Maya sighed happily, running a finger over her grumbling belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Maya, I don't think I last much longer in here. May you please let me out like you promised?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound RJ heard next chilled his blood. Maya was laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let you out? I can't believe you fell for that!\" she laughed loudly. \"As a human living in an anthro apartment building, I knew your survival instincts were awful, but I never actually expected you to think I'd let you out after eating you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" RJ yelped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're food, dummy. I don't eat food only to throw it back up. Zelda's the boss and she said I could do anything I want with you, and what I want is for you to digest. I'm honestly surprised you've lasted this long. Whatever. It won't be long now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET ME OUT!\" RJ screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kicked and punched with renewed vigor against the confines of his fleshy prison, but his efforts were just as useless now as they'd been before. Maya giggled, her meal's struggles tickling her again. Just like last time, gas built up from RJ's struggles, only this time they didn't come out as burps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Pffffffffrrrrrrrrt!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya wasn't really embarrassed about this. She was a skunk after all. She lazed on the couch, watching TV as RJ cried and pleaded for help inside her. She just turned up the volume so she wouldn't have to hear him. His continued struggles kept her gassy but the internal massage he gave her more than made up for a few foul smells. The full, fun feeling of her meal made her doze off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Maya next woke up, she found her stomach still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RJ? You still alive in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurbles from her stomach was her only response. Maya smiled and patted her stomach. It was then she noticed what time it was and realized she'd overslept!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap!\" she yelled. She didn't bother washing or changing clothes, she just booked it to Zelda's office to report it. Zelda wasn't happy with her, but when Maya explained what had happened to RJ, the lioness laughed and decided to let her off the hook with a warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya went back to work, only this time it was much less fun than yesterday when she'd had company throughout her shift. In fact, she had a bit of a stomachache. While RJ may have been dead, he still existed in the gas he gave his devourer. Throughout the day, when no one was around, Maya would let off a fart and sigh in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she came to RJ's apartment where Maya met with the wolf as she was looking for her friend. Maya liked her and ended up feeling bad when she lied to her over her friend's disappearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Maya... you haven't seen my friend around, have you? He's a human named RJ. He didn't come home last night and I'm getting kind of worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, haven't seen him,\" Maya lied. \"But I'm sure he'll turn up eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... you're probably right... Alright, see you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya went inside RJ's apartment and got to cleaning. She decided to do a half-assed job. After all, it's not like the apartment's occupant would ever appreciate her work. By the time she got around to RJ's bedroom, her stomach was hurting again and more gas was building up. With a grunt, she let loose. The fart that followed was earth-shattering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>PPPPPPPFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded like a miniature explosion and reeked worse than anything Maya had ever smelled before. Even she couldn't help but blush in embarrassment despite no one being around. She wafted a hand in front of her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, RJ, you stink worse than I do... Guess I did what you asked, though. I <i>did</i> let you out in your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya laughed as she packed up her cleaning supplies and left the room. No one else ever did move into RJ's old apartment, no matter how cheaply Zelda priced it. For some reason, despite all the cleaners Zelda hired, no one was ever able to get the foul smell out of the bedroom.</span></div></div>",

Taking his chance, RJ quietly put his rent payment on her desk. Zelda quietly took it and counted through the cash to make sure it was all there, though she seemed... distracted.

He'd never seen someone take a stance against Zelda directly like this, and to be frank, Maya was easily a good foot and a half shorter than the lioness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I understand you need your rent to make ends meet and run the business, but give him a break, he's trying his best!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda maintained a poker face as Maya finished her speech, and RJ couldn't get a read on her reaction.

She then looked over at RJ and wondered how the two of them would get along as roommates. <i>\"I mean he seems like a nice guy and...well...kinda cute too.\"</i> Maya averted her eyes from RJ with a barely visible blush on her face. Did she really just call him cute? Maya, however, quickly recovered and thought back to the topic at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really have another option.\" she continued, while she was able to afford her current apartment,her time there has been nothing but stress, anger, and misery. Her apartment complex was 45 minute drive away, and she her shift started at 7 am so he had to wake up incredibly early to get herself ready and drive to here on time. She didn't really have any friends since it was in a very bad neighborhood of Furdale the other tenants in her apartment building were sketchy and weren't really the nicest people to be around. But worst of all was her landlord Samson, and how much of a cruel and perverted man he is. Maya was filled with anger and disgust at the thought of that man. The son of a bitch obese sow, was incredibly strict and had one of the shortest tempers Maya had ever seen. In a similar situation to RJ she was late by an hour to pay her rent for the month because she overslept and he screamed and yelled at her for 30 minutes straight, nearly reducing her to tears. The man was also always eye her up whenever they were together, he would constantly try to hit on her, would get mad when she rejected him, and would make remarks about her somewhat chubby and pear shaped body saying \"All fat women are as ugly as sin, you really need to lose that weight if your ever gonna have your lease reinstated.\" However all of those things would be unable to hold a candle to this next event.It was one of the worst days on her life came 2 months ago when she went to deliver another payment to him. As she entered his office and he popped out of the closet beside her and gave her a smack on her butt, Maya was completely caught off guard, she screamed and accidentally released her noxious gas on Samson which sent him into a coughing fit. After Maya realized what happened she tried to apologize to him, he smacked her in the face so hard she fell to the ground leaving her left eye closed and cheek swollen. He began to scream at her again and almost evicted her right there on the spot, however, after Maya cried and pleaded for him to give her another chance, he decided to not evict her under one condition. Samson then told her that if she wanted to stay she had to pay for his dry cleaning, and would agree to have her rent increased by $200 dollars for the last two months. She agreed since she didn't have any other place to go, however he revealed the last condition after she had accepted, which was her having to strip to her underwear, and preform a lap dance for him as well as give him a blowjob. She looked at him horrified and was about to protest, but when she that rage filled glare from his eye, she knew he wasn't going to take no for answer. With tears about to break out she stripped out of her clothes and pleasured him until he was fully satisfied. Once she was finally allowed to leave she raced back to her apartment and started sobbing uncontrollably in her bed. It was incredibly hard for Maya to even think about that day much less talk about it with someone. She felt tears brimming again when she looked back over at RJ again, it was then she realized that she had her way out of this hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more Maya thought about it the more it seemed like a blessing in disguise. Sure she barely knew RJ at all, but living in his apartment complex had a lot of benefits. First of all she wouldn't have to drive to work everyday as mentioned before by Zelda. Secondly she'll be out of the terrible neighborhood and wouldn't have to worry about getting robbed, rapped or even killed there. Thirdly she'll be able to meet new people who will most likely be a lot nicer here then back at her place, Fourthly she'll most likely make a friend in RJ seeing as they're going to be roommates,and he seems like a relatively nice guy. And finally she'll be away from that awful man Samson. She thought back to how RJ mentioned about how she would most likely become involved with some of the issues he goes through being a human here in Furdale. They both seemed to against the world in there own special ways, and she was more then willing to have a companion to help her out and she would be willing to protect him if he was willing to take her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no further thought need she lifted her head up with a determined look on her face and said to RJ, \"I'm not afraid and I'll be more than happy to be your roommate.\" RJ, was slightly surprised she agreed but gave her a smile back and said. \" And I'm glad I'll be yours too.\" Which caused Maya to look away with another  this time more pronounced blush and smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud whistle from in front of them brought both of them to the slightly annoyed face of the Lioness Zelda, who had secretly been hopping for her to decline. \"Now that I have your two lovebirds attention, I have a contract which both of you have to sign which will allow her to become an official tenant, and your new roommate.\" RJ looked away and Maya blushed again at the love birds comment. They than walked over to Zelda's desk and took the contract from the table with Maya holding it in her hands while RJ was standing next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked to be the same contract he signed but with an additional page at the end which was consent form they both had to sign in order to be roommates. RJ stepped back to allow her to read it, and after she was all finished she placed the contract back on the table, grabbed a pen and began filling in the blanks for her signature. As she bent down to sign she unintentionally gave RJ another view of her rather plump backside, he looked away and took a gaze out the window as the sky got brighter and the city was starting to wake up and come to life with more people and sounds coming from outside. RJ looked at his watch to and saw it was almost 7:30 and he had to get going soon for his job. He turned around to the desk and saw Maya had just finished and now he had to sign the last consent from. He quickly read through it and saw no glaring or outlandish rules or requirements and sign his name and handed the contract back to Zelda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,Make sure your moved in within the next 72 hours or the deal is off. Maya nodded her head \"Yes Miss Zelda.\" she said. Zelda than turned her gaze to RJ, \"You know human, you're very lucky you caught me in a good mood, and you had one of my employees stick up for you otherwise I might've devoured you on the spot.\" she said with a intimidating look which made RJ freeze up for a second before nodding his head as well. \"Now since that's out of the way I can have you two get out of my office and I can fry that bigger fish I was talking about before.\" Zelda said as she shewed the two of them out the door, and closed it in there faces before they could say another word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them turned to look at each other with Maya being the first to speak realizing she might've changed his whole situation for the worse by having herself as now his new roommate she felt she needed to apologize to him, I'm so sorry for putting you in this situation, now your stuck with a fat,smelly, skunk as your new roommate.\" RJ was surprised by her sudden change in mood after it seemed like she was glad to be his new roommate and vice versa. \" Maya there's no need to apologize for, if anything I should be saying thanks.\" Maya looked shocked as RJ continued. \" It's thanks to you that I'm still here right now, Of I hadn't had you for helping me out and sticking up for me back there, my ass would've been lion food.\" She started feeling better and a smile was growing on her face once again. \" Also I really don't think your fat at all, if anything I think your body looks great the way it is, and as far as smelly, (he smelled the air next to her) you don't smell bad at all, in fact you honestly smell really sweet almost like flowers and cinnamon.\" This got Maya to once again visibly blush and smile, it was the first time in her life she heard someone say that she wasn't' fat or smell and she could tell he was being genuine. \"T-thank you.\" she replied shyly. \"I make sure to out on a lot of perfume on in the morning to make sure I'm not a nuisance to anyone, also if your called stinky your whole life you learn how to smell nice, and be clean.Though saying that, it doesn't always work out perfectly.\" Maya continued on rather timidly \"Since I was born with out a scent gland do to a genetic defect, my makes up for this loss by producing more and more gas than a normal person would when they eat something, which results in me occasionally having bad bouts of.....flatulence.\" Maya had an embarrassed look on her face again when she said that word. \"Hey\" RJ said causing Maya to look up again, \" It's honestly not a big deal to me, I mean there will be some growing pains with us being new roommates that's to be expected, but if the thing your worried about is if I'm going to hate you for passing gas, you really don't need to be concerned it's something all of us do.\" Maya felt  she was about to tear up again from the happiness that was over flowing through her, she grabbed RJ and picked him up in a big hug. \"Oh thank you so much RJ.\" she said joy \" You don't know how long I've been waiting to hear those words.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately to break up at that romantic moment was RJ watch beeping, he had to leave for work now or he'll be late. He told Maya that he had to leave and she put him down. \"If you want i can show you my place after I'm out of work.\" RJ said. Maya smiled \"Sure.\" \"Cool come at 7:30, room 119, bye Maya.\" \"See ya RJ.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><span style=\"line-height:1.6;\">Heading out of a Mexican restaurant after leaving work, Maya returns to her apartment with a full belly. The ugly building was in a decayed state and the fact it was standing to hold people within was nothing short of a miracle. The people living there also had personalities that matched the building's appearance, with Maya scared that one day they will do something to her, especially the landlord. Taking at least five minutes to unlock her door, Maya enters her home and starts packing everything she owes, which wasn't much thanks to Samson raising the rent whenever he wanted. Tossing everything into her car, Maya was ready to go when she remembers that she nearly forgot about her toothbrush and returns back to get it. Back again in her apartment for the final time, she grabs her toothbrush and was ready to leave when her stomach gurgles. It wasn't gas, as the payload felt solid in her bowels, and an evil idea popped into the skunkess's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feels like I dropped 30 pounds out of me, though I didn't think I had that much in me,\" Maya said, giggling at the last part, as she locks the door.<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well, well. If it ain't the girly!\" A sickening voice sneers, Maya freezing up at the sound.<br>\r\nThe voice belongs to Samson, a sadistically violent pig anthro, who owes the building Maya was living in. He was an obese creature and very slobbish, making him reek from his breath to his body. The dimwitted landlord would bully anybody he sees as easy prey, including Maya, and have them do tasks they wouldn't do normally or risk having to move out or live in hell. Samson had a few of his buddies behind him, as they followed him and in return, paid for almost nothing or didn't even have to pay.<br>\r\n\"You been moving more actively, Maya,\" he says, his cronies chuckling as more people came out to see the sight.<br>\r\n\"Maybe she's trying to get rid of her fatass!\" Someone said, adding laughter as the skunk shrank more and more.<br>\r\nMaya's ass was huge and envy of other women, but thanks to Samson using it as a form of sexual harassment and insults, Maya tried to hide it whenever she can, though the results are far more harsher than before.<br>\r\n\"What you going to do, cry?\" Samson said, cornering Maya into the wall.<br>\r\n\"Come on! Try something and I'll have your slutty ass out on the curb, you skank! He says using her cruel pet name he gave her.<br>\r\nMaya was cowering before the pig in fear and was ready to give into the pig's cruelty when he mentioned about kicking her out.<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute! I don't have to deal with this bull! I'm leaving this dump of a building, so I don't have to fear this fat bastard!\" Maya thought to herself, before standing up straight and glaring Samson into the eye, surprising the anthro.<br>\r\n\"What's with that look, you skank?\" He asks, though he was losing a bit of his bravo.<br>\r\n\"Actually, I was going to find you by following your rancid breath, but since you're here, here's the keys, you fatass,\" Maya replies, giving him her apartment keys, shocking everyone.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n\"You heard me, you disgusting slob, or maybe that filth on you is getting in the way of your ears, but then again, your lack of a brain, is certain to miss it, so I'll say it slowly. IIII'mmmm. Llleeeaaavvviiinnng. Tttthhhhiiisss. Ddddduuuummmppp,\" she answers slowly and in a mocking tone, as a dam inside of her starts breaking.<br>\r\nMaya then walks away from Samson, as he tries to understand what happened and by the time she reaches the end of the hall, the pig understood it, his face red while veins bulge out in anger.<br>\r\n\"YOU BITCH! You think you can get away with this?\" He asks, as he storms towards her, unaware of the gas bubble, cultivated by anger and Mexican food, was ready to be unleashed onto the cruel hog.<br>\r\n\"You know you shouldn't come at a skunk from the behind, as we're notorious for our spray,\" she says as she turns her head to see him come into range and her butt explodes, with Samson at ground zero.<br>\r\nMaya's face melted into pleasure, as her fart lasted for a few minutes and the sound could be heard by a couple of buildings over. Samson immediately entered into a coughing fit and some of his followers fell from the intense smell. Once the fart ended, Maya turns to see Samson hacking out his lungs and everyone else either knocked out, coughing, or closing their doors. The dam finally bursts, rage from the pressure of the pig's bullying consumes Maya when she sees him in a weakened state and delivers a kick to the groin, felling the bully. Holding his crotch, Samson could only look up at the same skunkette he tormented over time, before another kick into his face throws him to the floor and soon a barrage of kicks hit him in the gut, but he couldn't do a thing about it, as there was too much it to cover.<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, you fat fuck!? Gotten too greedy and aroggant, you stupid piggy bastard?\" Maya swears, anger pouring out from the abuse while she continues to kick him until she gets tired and everyone else who was conscious was greatly scared of the bullied skunk. Hocking a logey at pained pig, Maya heads out of the door, before stopping right before it and a squeak comes out of her anus.<br>\r\n\"Almost forgot: did a paintjob in my place, though it's not complete, and I also clogged the toilet. That's my present, from me to you, mothefucker.\"<br>\r\nAs she left, she could hear cheering and applause from the other victims, plus some others as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow outside of the building, next to her car, Maya pulls out her phone and calls her sister.<br>\r\n\"Hey sis, it's me, Maya.\"<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n\"Just moving out of that hellhole and into a better apartment. How's Anthro Sumo going for you?\"<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n\"It's where I work at and I'm sharing with a roommate, so the rent isn't that bad.\"<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n\"He's surprising nice and cute for a human,\" Maya answers, blushing at the thought of RJ.<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n\"You got one too by the name of Marc and you think he's the one. Oh, I think Samson is about to see the paintjob I did to the place. Left it a nice shade of brown,\" Maya said, spying Samson heading to her place from a window, her sister chuckling on the other end, then erupting into a boisterous laughter as Samson screamed so loud that the whole block could hear it.<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n\"Just stuck around to see his reaction, so I'll be going now. Bye, Cindy, and see you soon,\" Maya said, ending the call, before heading over to her new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ was washing up when he heard the door open and when he came out, he saw it was his new roommate entering the building.<br>\r\n\"Let me help you with that,\" he says, grabbing some of Maya's luggage.<br>\r\n\"What a gentleman. So how's your day?\"<br>\r\n\"Busy, but okay. What about you?\" The human asks, placing her bags into her new room.<br>\r\n\"Perfect,\" she answers, a bright smile across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's next?</span></span></div></div>",

Entering her room she sees that everything was prepared for her, ready for her to move in.<br>\r\n\"I know that he did this to save his ass, but still, he didn't have to go all the way for me to feel like it's home. The fact, he treats me almost the same as a human on his level, is kind of sweet,\" the skunk girl thought, getting mixed feelings for the human.<br>\r\nSwitching into some pink PJs with hearts on, which defines her curves very well, she enters her bed, greatly noticing the difference between here and back at her old apartment.<br>\r\n\"Definitely an upgrade to my living space!\" She mentally says happily before sleep over comes her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA window opening and something struggling to get in wakes both Maya and RJ up. Silently tiptoeing out of their rooms, RJ grabs a broom while Maya grabs a lamp.<br>\r\n\"A lamp? That's a bargain I got it for!\" He quietly chides her.<br>\r\n\"If I use it, then I'll buy a new one for you,\" she whispers back, both people silently walking towards the source, ready to hit the intruder at first sight.<br>\r\nNearing the room where they believe the source of the sound came from, RJ motions to his roommate to stay and crouches down before crawling into the room. Hearing some grumbling and someone insulting his accomplice, RJ pinpoints it before heading over to the light switch. With careful timing, he flips it on, the intruder surprised at the sudden change in brightness, before charging at his foe and bringing his broom down hard on him.<br>\r\n\"Aaaahhhh!\" A pig anthro screams in pain as he's stuck in RJ's window and struggles to get out of it.<br>\r\n\"Sean, get me out here! Sean? Don't leave me here, you cowardly bitch,\" he shouts to his fleeing comrade, before facing the human in front of him.<br>\r\nBlood was flowing down his face, he stares down at RJ with hatred and growls in hopes RJ would free him from being scared of the fat pig before a shriek is heard behind the human.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here!?\" Maya screams, the pig wickedly smiles at the skunkette.<br>\r\n\"I came by to punish a certain <i>skank</i> for fucking up my place! Thanks to her, I lost some residents, meaning I lost money and someone has to pay! Ain't that right, <i>skank</i>!\" He said, grinning while Maya shivers in fear before he continues.<br>\r\n\"A weak, pathetic loser like you couldn't get away without any consequences and the fact that you're living with a human makes me sick! No sane anthro would d- Ack!\" He manages to say before RJ hits him again.<br>\r\n\"Says the fatass that tried to break into my home and I particularly dislike you insulting my roommate! Maya, seeing how you are <i>well acquainted</i> with him, can you go to room 201 for a Elisabeth and if she's not there, simply head over to Zelda while I call the police, okay?\" He said, picking up the phone while Maya looks at him and nods her head before leaving.<br>\r\nRJ calls the cops after Maya left and grabs a book. Of course, Samson refused to stay quiet and was shouting occurities at the smaller being before the said being grabs an anthro apple (just another way to say a bigger apple) and stuffs deep in the pig's mouth. Had a normal person encountered Samson, they would have been terrified of him, but after dealing with Zelda's threats and Jasmine's bullying, RJ thought of him as a pushover in this situation, though he was irritated by the anthro's complaints. To pass time, he vocally read aloud on how to make multiple ham dishes until Maya returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This better bbbbeeee good to wake me up in middle of the night or else I'm having a midnight snack,\" Zelda yawns, sleep in her eyes, while a hippo anthro stands beside her and Maya leads them to Samson.<br>\r\nSeeing the fat pig stuck in the window, Zelda immediately wakes up before bursting into laughter while the hippo glares daggers at him, who really started to sweat a lot.<br>\r\n\"I couldn't find Elisabeth at her apartment, so informed Zelda about the situation, though she wasn't very happy about being woken up and we were about to head back when I bumped into Elisabeth<br>\r\n\"I called the police already, but I was hoping you'll be around to make things easier. Sorry for popping this on you. I promise to pay you back for it eventually,\" he said, the hippo sighs before responding.<br>\r\n\"Part of the job, though I kind have wished my job didn't follow home.\"<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Samson spits out the apple and something rude, judging from Zelda's reaction, as she pulls him out of the window and holds him over a foot off the ground in rage, claws out. Samson held his tongue for the rest of the night and soon it was Maya's turn to make a statement. The poor skunk couldn't say a thing, as sounds came from her mouth and she silently shivered when Samson sent his glaring eyes in her direction. However, RJ held her hand and gave her a look of confidence, making the skunk girl smile.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry; he won't hurt you again, that I promise you!\" Elisabeth said, adding more confidence to Maya.<br>\r\nTaking a breath, she soon told everyone what happened, plus the abuse she received over her time back at her old apartment, and she finished everything she had to say when the police arrived. At this point everyone was glaring at Samson with disgust as he paled other cops showed up at the door.<br>\r\n\"Samson, you are under arrest for unlawful breaking and entering, sexual abuse, and embezzlement. Also, put a search warrant for him and his accomplice, Sean,\" the hippo said, as the other police cuffed him.<br>\r\nZelda stayed around until the police left and returns back to bed. Elisabeth informs RJ and Maya to head over to police station say their victim statement before leaving. RJ cloes the door and sighs out in exhaustion before sliding down to the ground.<br>\r\n\"So glad that's over! Thankfully, he was stuck in the window or else I would have been done for!\"<br>\r\n\"You were awfully brave back. Couldn't imagine you being scared,\" she said, the human shaking his head.<br>\r\n\"Don't you remember me from when I was giving rent money to Zelda. I was scared shitless! Even that guy would have made mince meat of me, but luckily he was stupid and fat enough to get stuck. Well, off to bed,\" RJ said.<br>\r\nGetting up and walking back to his bed, a black and white tail stops him .<br>\r\n\"Something the matter? Is it because of earlier?\"<br>\r\n\"Kind of. Is okay if we slept together?\" She asks blushing.<br>\r\nHe was baffled by her request and couldn't help but blush, as her body was quite... Good looking.<br>\r\n\"I guess it's okay, despite the age we're at,\" he said, the last part he muttered as she drags him into her bed and falls asleep immediately, her heart conquered by the small human.<br>\r\nHe would later regret it, as Maya sleep farts and thankfully he was too tired to care before sleeping himself.</span></div></div>",

The rather plump wolfess was by far the nicest anthro he had had the pleasure of meeting since coming to Furdale.

As one of T&amp;C's lead graphic designers, she said it was reassuring that all their hard work would be protected and not go to waste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat little moment had given RJ the confidence to really stick around Furdale. He didn't need everyone around him as long as he had at least a few who were nice to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only issue now was what she wanted to talk with him about? They didn't work on the same team or project so it was rather curious. RJ shrugged, maybe she just wanted to talk. There wasn't anything wrong with that.

His workload at T&amp;C had been high,especially with the release trailer of T&amp;C's sequel to one of it's greatest masterpieces \"Rings of Destiny\" . Both hackers and rival companies were trying to get any information that they could to either play the game early or leak and spoil it's contents. So RJ was working like overtime to make sure the servers were perfectly secure and not on threat and to be honest he had a close call or two, though thankfully with it being the weekend someone else has his place until Monday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also had to pay his rent to Zelda on Wednesday and he nearly got himself eaten for almost being late to drop off his payment to the mammoth lioness, and nearly ended up as an experiment for Olivia the day after. With all that work RJ had somewhat neglected to clean his place up, mostly because he was too exhausted to once he got back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a good look around his apartment, and noticed clothes on the ground, dirty dishes in the sink and a small layer  of dust forming on the ground and some of the furniture. RJ being a little bit of a clean freak frowned at the site of his apartment thought to himself \"Well I might as well get this place straightened out.\" After grabbing a couple of breakfast bars to, RJ spent the next 2 and half hours cleaning up all around his apartment, washing the dishes, doing his laundry, vacuuming the floors dusting furniture and even cleaning the windows. With a sigh, RJ plopped down on his couch and looked up at his clock. The time reading 10:12 AM he still had another hour and 45 minutes till his lunch with Sabrina. With nothing else to do RJ decided to watch a little TV, he scrolled through the channels clicking past the weather broadcast, the Furdale news which including discussion about laws for humans, the sports channel, With the announcers talking about last nights ASL(Anthro Sumo League's show). They showed a few highlights including a great picture of Claudine the giant Unicorn planting her fist right into the face of the slightly larger Amaya a phoenix Anthro. He kept going before stopping at the video gaming/nerd channel. RJ smiled, he was always a big nerd even in his younger days video games were a big part of him. The three figures on screen were humans and they were talking about some of the latest news in the gaming world, including the aforementioned \"Rings of Destiny 2\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued watching for about an hour until he heard a knock on the door. RJ took another look at the clock 11:17 AM appeared before him, he wondered who it could be since he still had time before his lunch meet up, making his way over to the door RJ looked through his peep hole to see...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was told he wasn't needed that day, so he figured that the best idea would be to go to the upper floors and try to meet the neighbors he hadn't seen yet. From what he knew he was the only male in the buildings as well as the only human. He knew it was risky but it would be good to have some friends in this building with Olivia trying to study him and Jasmine out to get him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ nodded his head and then walked out as he made his way to the stairs, stopping and hiding only briefly as he watched his landlady Zelda the lioness walk down the stairs. He could've sworn there was a human face shaped bulge on her large stomach. Perhaps Zelda was serious about her warnings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the landlady was out of sight, RJ made his way up to the second floor and saw a row of several apartments. From what he heard, there were four anthro girls on this floor he knew about. It would only be fair to finally meet the neighbors given that he's been living there for a while now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first girl RJ knew about on this floor was Elisabeth, a 12' 11\" hippopotamus anthro with dark tan skin and long black hair reaching down to her considerable rear. She was very obese but that was normal for her species. RJ had actually seen her before and recognized her because of her bright red jacket. He heard Elisabeth was friendly, but Zelda also told RJ that Elisabeth had a human boyfriend until she ate him for cheating on her. Not to mention Elisabeth was big enough to swallow two humans whole at once. Maybe she wasn't the best choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second choice was Mako, an 8' 8\" muscle bound shark anthro with long palish purple hair. Despite her name, Mako was a hammerhead shark. RJ heard that Mako was a conspiracy theorist and overheard the other tenants saying unflattering things about her. Perhaps there was more to her that met the eye. However, her species made you nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third anthro RJ heard of was the one next to nobody knows about. Her name was Uma and she was a 9' 2\" unicorn anthro who was quite voluptuous. She had bright white fur and long blonde hair. However, little was known about her because she rarely interacted with the other tenants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, RJ had heard about was another one that the other tenants didn't think much about. Her name was Dorothy and she was an 8'5\" cheetah anthro. She was an hourglass shaped body and always wore a lab coat. The other tenants saw Dorothy as a mad scientist and RJ heard she conducted strange experiments in her apartment. Maybe she wasn't the best idea to visit either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, which of his neighbors is RJ going to introduce himself to?</span></div></div>",

The idea that the hippopotamus actually ate a human before and her boyfriend no less, terrified him. But was Zelda really serious? After all, hippos are generally herbivores. As RJ walked up to the door, he heard music playing. Elisabeth must've had the radio on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ looked into the keyhole but he couldn't see anything. He quickly jumped back and shook. Elisabeth probably didn't like peeping toms. \"Hello?\" asked RJ. \"Elisabeth! Are you in there? I'm RJ, your neighbor from the first floor! Hello!?\" RJ didn't get a response. Then he started to think. He heard Zelda say that Elisabeth was a police detective. Zelda had to tell that to everybody in the apartment building to keep them in line. Maybe that meant Elisabeth was a reasonable anthro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ knocked on the door again and waited before looking at his watch. But then he heard a loud stomping noise and felt tremors. Not surprising given the type of anthro there was behind the door. RJ then saw the door open and he looked at Elisabeth. She was a 12' 11\" hippopotamus and had dark tan skin with long black hair. She was utterly massive. Her stomach was nearly as wide as she was tall, she had huge D-cup breasts and each of her butt cheeks had to be at least five feet wide with hips thicker than tree trunks. For clothing she was wearing her bright red jacket along with a gray shirt and tight blue jeans. RJ looked up in fear because he knew he was a toothpick in comparison to this massive anthro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be RJ,\" said Elisabeth with a smile, showing her sharp hippo teeth. \"I've seen you a few times in the hall. Nice to meet you, I'm Elisabeth and that's Elisabeth with an 's'.\" Elisabeth smiled and then held out her hand and RJ nervously shook one of her flabby fingers. \"Don't take this the wrong way Elisabeth,\" he said. \"But.. I...\" Elisabeth let out a chuckle. \"You didn't expect me to be this big? Hello, I'm a hippo. Who ever heard of a small one of those.\" RJ smiled confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed friendly enough, perhaps Elisabeth could be a good friend. You'd need one in this apartment. But then RJ remembered something. \"Uh, Elisabeth, Zelda told me you had a human boyfriend. Is that true.\" Elisabeth let out a snort. \"I did,\" she said with venom in her voice. \"But I caught the jerk cheating on me with a crocodile girl!?\" RJ stepped back out of caution but then Elisabeth let out a sigh and smiled. \"But I got my revenge on him. The first thing I did when I found out about the affair was to swallow him whole.\" RJ gasped as Elisabeth licked her fangs. \"He was delicious. But don't worry. I only eat humans who have it coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she did eat humans. Well, RJ realized he had to be very careful around Elisabeth. She may seem friendly, but she just confirmed she did eat her ex-boyfriend. RJ knew that if he made Elisabeth mad, he'd be going down her throat soon enough. So he decided to try and stay on her good side, all ten thousand pounds of it.</span></div></div>",

RJ even stepped back as she bent to her level. \"Why not come inside?\" asked Elisabeth. \"I'm not due to go in for a few hours.\" RJ simply smiled. \"Sure,\" he said. \"I have the day off after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs RJ walked in, he saw that Elisabeth's apartment was rather large. Made sense considering what type of anthro she was. RJ couldn't help but stare as Elisabeth's tail was shaking back and fourth on her monster sized booty. RJ looked around the apartment and saw that Elisabeth had quite an impressive sky garden at the side of her window and there was a shelf on the wall that depicted several glass creatures of myth, including a sphinx, a manticore and even a cockatrice. RJ then noticed a photograph on the shelf that appeared to depict Elisabeth on the beach with four other hippopotamus anthros that from the looks of it were her sisters. There was one blonde haired hippo woman wearing a pair of glasses and had gray skin. She was wearing a blue jacket. Next to her was an orange haired pink skinned hippo woman who appeared only slightly younger than Elisabeth and was wearing a yellow jacket. The last was a pale white skinned hippo girl with dark green hair and a green jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's me and my sisters,\" said Elisabeth to RJ. \"Cleopatra, Anastasia and Victoria.\" \"Oh,\" said RJ. \"I didn't know... uh, do they...\" Elisabeth just smiles smugly before gesturing to RJ to join her for breakfast. Elisabeth then handed her human guest a plate stacked with pancakes. RJ saw that it was too tall for him to cut and Elisabeth put half of them on a second plate before she gave it to RJ. \"Sorry,\" said Elisabeth as she ate several pancakes in one bite. \"I forget that humans don't eat as much as anthros. Especially not hippos.\" RJ laughed and then started to eat his pancakes. As he did, he saw Elisabeth's mouth open wide and saw that she could very easily swallow him whole. Thankfully she said she normally doesn't eat humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Elisabeth,\" said RJ. \"I heard you were a cop from Zelda.\" Elisabeth smiled. \"Most of my family is involved in rescue work. Cleopatra and Victoria work for the fire department while Anastasia is a nurse.\" RJ laughed as Elisabeth handed him some more pancakes. \"But I'm curious as to know why there's a human in Furdale. Most humans in this city wind up in an anthro's belly within a week. What brings you here.\" \"Well Elisabeth, I'm a programmer and a very good one. I was offered several jobs but took one at Tooth &amp; Claw Gaming. Didn't think I'd wind up in an anthro town.\" Elisabeth lets out a laugh as RJ gets a good look at her. For a hippo, she was beautiful. That ex-boyfriend she digested must've been a complete idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

RJ just gave a nervous laugh and Elisabeth smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to. How does four o'clock sound?\" \"S-Sounds great.\" Said RJ. RJ smiled. He actually had a date for tomorrow night. But then Elisabeth gave a grim look and showed her sharp teeth. \"But you had better not stand me up, if you know what's good for you.\" RJ shivered and then smiled as the hippo smiled back at him. RJ knew better than to scorn a woman, especially a woman who had seven feet and several tons on him who could swallow him whole in a fit of rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, RJ was getting dressed for the date in question and was on the phone with his friend Sabrina, the wolf girl from work. \"Elisabeth?\" asked Sabrina on the phone. \"Elisabeth Richardson? Are you sure that's a good idea.\" RJ is applying some cologne on. \"I know all about her last boyfriend. All I have to do is avoid cheating on her and I won't get to see what a hippopotamus looks like from the inside. I've been on dates before, Sabrina.\" At the other end, Sabrina was just getting ready to enter the shower. \"Okay,\" she said. \"Just be careful.\" RJ nodded his head and then walked out with a bouquet of jasmines (the flower, not the lizard woman).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ made his way back to Elisabeth's apartment and knocked on the door. \"Just a minute.\" Said the hippopotamus woman inside the apartment. It wasn't long before the door opened and out walked Elisabeth. RJ looked up in surprise to see the tan-skinned hippopotamus beauty with her hair tied into a ponytail and bun and was wearing a yellow cocktail dress with gloves. While RJ is stammering he holds up the flowers. \"Jasmines?\" asks Elisabeth. \"How thoughtful.\" With that, the hippo woman took the bouquet and ate it before smiling down at RJ. \"Ready to paint the town red?\" asked Elisabeth. RJ excitedly nodded his head and with that, they were off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo What's First?</span></div></div>",

Dorothy's reputation gave off a similar vibe to Olivia and the less he had to deal with science gone wrong, the better. That left Uma, the unicorn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was the only one that didn't have anything bad said about, if only because she didn't really interact with anyone.

He knew that voice and he turned to face it, hoping beyond all hope that wasn't who he thought it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was disappointed. Staring at him in all her muscle bound glory was Jasmine. His relationship with said Jasmine was less than stellar. The woman just didn't seem to like RJ. In fact, she reminded RJ of the stereotypical bully he and probably everyone else in the world had to deal with a one point in their lives or another. Since she first met him, the reptile had tried to get a rise out of him. To this point, RJ had never even so much as snapped back for two major reasons: 1). he was afraid that Zelda might actually eat him for it and 2). he really think it was that big of a deal. Sadly, Jasmine disagreed with that last one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I completely forgot she lived on the second floor!' RJ mentally yelled at himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what's a pipsqueak like you doing up here?\" Jasmine leered down at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ stared back at her. \"Just trying to get to know my neighbors.\" he answered honestly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine gave a mocking laugh. \"Ah, isn't that cute? The little geek's lonely!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ didn't say anything this time and shrugged his shoulders at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lizard amazon frowned slightly. \"What, got nothing more to say?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, he did not respond. Jasmine's frown turned into a scowl. No matter what she seemed to do, the pitiful little human just wasn't afraid of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScowl still in place she began to walk forward toward RJ. Said human actually felt a bead of sweat roll down his face. Jasmine's harassment had always been verbal. But right now, she looked liked she wanted to upgrade that to physical. RJ's eyes darted across the hallway. He had nowhere to go and if the verifiable wall of black scaled muscle got her claws on him, he wouldn't be able to do anything.</span></div></div>",

I won't bite,\" She says in a playful manner, you enter her home, as the door automatically shuts behind you.<br>\r\nIt was basically what you can expect from a mad scientist's home: Pipes all over the walls and ceiling; glass orbs with electricity inside; and unknown devices on every table and countertop.<br>\r\n\"Sit on the couch over there! Do you want tea, coffee, anything? I just gotta fix this gizmo here, before talking with you.

WithDorothy's 8-foot height, he was at eye level with her ample chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowling and cursing under her breath, Dorothy rubbed her eyes. \"I'm fine. Just some eye-strain after playing video games for so long. Stupid to not take a break...\" She blinked a few times; R.J. could see a red tinge to her yellow feline eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly noticed <i>his</i> eyes hurt, too; they were even tearing up. They must have been playing that game for hours...his legs hurt from sitting so long, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, maybe that's enough video games for now...ouch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==One Eye-Wash Session Later==<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the ocular ordeal, the pair decided to shelve gaming for the moment. After VERY pointedly telling him not to touch anything, Dorothy had taken R.J. on a tour of her lab. It turned out the place wasn't as haphazardly set up as it looked: every boiling beaker and flickering screen was labeled, the more dangerous hardware...which was admittedly most of it...sectioned off and marked with warning signs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nR.J. had even started to see patterns in how everything was arranged--safer, less hazardous experiments were strewn around the kitchen and living room; more dangerous set-ups were walled off in special closets or, most ominously, Dorothy's bedroom. (THAT room was locked behind a steel bulkhead and needed a keycard; Dorothy said whatever she was working on within was \"classified\" and refused to include it in the tour. R.J. knew better than to pry about it.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tour eventually took them to a workbench tucked away against the living room's back wall. Taking up most of the station was a contraption resembling a scaled-down jet engine set on a swiveling mount--almost like it was meant to <i>aim</i> at a target. Its generator let out a low hum as if powered on, but the row of sceens nearby were showing steady, low readings. It was inactive, then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, now THIS is a marvel!\" Dorothy beamed, patting the barrel. \"It can alter the atomic structure of its target; reducing the space between atoms but otherwise keeping it unchanged. Whatever it targets gets smaller and denser!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nR.J. had been fascinated listening to Dorothy describe the contraption, but suddenly something clicked. \"Making it smaller and denser...wait; you mean it's a <i>shrink ray?</i>\" He couldn't help laughing--it sounded ridiculous, even knowing Dorothy's reputation. \"Pull the other one, Dorothy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what they told Jonas Salk, and he cured polio.\" Dorothy quipped, sounding a little offended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nR.J. put his hands up. \"Woah, easy. Curing a disease is one thing. But zapping stuff with some beam and making it smaller--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And denser! I'm reducing the space between the target's atoms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--<i>Smaller and denser</i> with the push of a button? Come on, that's comic book stuff! I get it; you're playing up the 'mad scientist' bit to mess with me--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothy stamped her foot and gave a petulant snort. \"Hmph! A skeptic, huh? Fine, time for a demonstration!\" She produced an apple from somewhere and set it up against a target. Shoving past R.J. she activated the device and fiddled with the controls, taking aim at the apple---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil the swivel mount sparked, the ray suddenly lurching and spinning erratically even as it charged up. Frantic, Dorothy pounded the controls--and got it to stop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Right when the ray was pointing at R.J.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt fired before she could kill the power, and R.J. was enveloped in bright light. He felt like he was falling....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nR.J. didn't know how long it took to clear the spots from his vision. What he DID know was that he wished he hadn't, because now he found himself looking at a pair of gigantic cheetah feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddamn it,\" he mumbled. Sighing, he looked up...to find Dorothy towering over him like a colossus, a worried but still smug look on her face. He could now see that she wore a bright red bikini under her lab coat. It hugged her hourglass curves quite nicely, and was so tight it looked like it was painted on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a bad view, but it wasn't worth being small as an ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still skeptical?\" Dorothy quipped, leaning down to smirk at the shrunken human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nR.J. took a step back. Some of the more vicious Anthros didn't have problems eating normal-sized humans; he'd barely be a snack right now. Dorothy hadn't hurt him, and this shrinking thing seemed to be an accident, but still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh; what happens now?\" he asked, trying to keep his tone light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, with your enhanced durability and strength, you're safer at that size than you think,\" Dorothy explained, squatting to get a better look at him. She giggled, \"You're cuter now, too! Anyway, you're kinda like Ant-Man, minus controlling bugs--tiny but tough. And that gives me some ideas...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Dorothy do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) For Science! - It turns out Dorothy has<br>\r\nsome tests prepared to properly test a shrunken volunteer's enhanced durability and strength. R.J.'s available and shrunken, so why not \"volunteer\" HIM for her research? It might even help find a way to un-shrink him sooner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) Unsanctioned Research - She COULD find a way to return R.J. to normal, or even just take notes...but Dorothy wants to \"research\" how fun playing with a shrunken human is--and she has plenty of \"experiments\" in mind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.) Scientific Ethics - Dorothy just wants to un-shrink R.J. ASAP for his own safety, putting any experiments aside.</span></div></div>",

She has black fur and red hair. As a cerberus, Naomi has three heads, each with a different personality. Naomi's right head wears her hair long and curly. The right head was known for being quite nice and even somewhat shy. Naomi's middle head wore her hair in a long and low ponytail. The middle was friendly and level-headed. But it was Naomi's left head that most knew her for. The left wore her hair shoulder length in micro braids. The left head was not unfriendly but rather assertive and opinionated. The three heads seem to switch personalities at random unless the situation was serious enough. It's completely unknown is she likes to eat humans or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next RJ recalled was, believe it or not, Sabrina's older sister: Anna- Anna was a 11'5\" wolfess with grey fur and black hair. Where Sabrina was rather plump, Anna was straight up obese. She works as a manager of a supermarket the Garden. Intelligent but rather gruff, Anna tends o distance herself from others. Sabrina had even said she hadn't spoken with her sister in several months and asked if RJ could check up on her when he got some free time. Sabrina never mentioned if Anna ate humans but given that Sabrina never brought it up, she must be okay. Then again, Sabrina hadn't talked to her in months...  </span></div></div>",

The largest Anthros RJ had ever seen where Jasmine and Zelda, who while not the tallest were still up there in the height department and made up with it in body size. Jasmine was practically a wall of reptilian muscle and Zelda had a belly big enough to fit atleast three grown men comfortably. Sabrina was the smallest Anthro he knew and she still dwarfed him utterly and she had said that Anna made her look like a runt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all of that, none of it prepared RJ for the Anthro who opened the door. He felt his eyes bulge slightly at the sight of his friend's older sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of him was a veritable mountain of an Anthro covered in grey fur. She was tall, easily dwarfing RJ and her head only a couple of inches away fro,m the ceiling. Her hair was black and long enough to reach past her shoulders. Her face was puffy, more resembling a chipmunk with stuffed cheeks than a wolf. She wore a red shirt that look somewhat strained and could only cover he massive chest. Resting under that was a wrecking ball of a belly that poked, despite the fact Anna was still inside her apartment, several inches past the door frame. Her arms and thighs were likewise large and thick but held in undercurrent of muscle to.

It wasn't like you thought she ever do this on purpose. I don't hold any of this against.\" He smiled at her. \"We'll figure something out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina smiled at his reassurance but then frowned. \"So how do you want to go down?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ tilted his head in confusion. \"What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina sighed again. \"I mean, do me to take it slow or...God...I can't believe I'm asking this...or do you want me to eat you in one gulp. I think I could manage that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd like to get this over with. However, you're the one whose got to eat me. I say you do whatever you need to.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina thought to herself for a second. \"What I might need to do is something a little more drastic...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" RJ stared at his friend in confusion. \"You're eating me. I think that counts drastic.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina's eyes glared at Anna's bedroom. \"Let's just say, I think you're not the one who needs to get eat. I think my sisters needs a lesson or two.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ's brow furrowed. <i>Is she saying, what I think she's saying?</i> he wonder. But before he could have asked what exactly Sabrina meant but Anna came back in, camera in hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get this show on the road!\" The elder wolfess said, excitement coating her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dejected he sat on his haunches, not even bothering to notice the stomach juices that were wicking up his pant legs and ruining his shoes. \"Gotta think cool RJ. There's gotta be a way outta this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Anna rubbed her stomach in triumph as she felt the little human pace back and forth within her. The most delicious part of the experience was always the fear, and the total dominion she had over another person as they thought about their impending doom squirming in her guts. Sometimes they made it out alive though, and considering that Sabrina seemed to be fond of this one Anna found herself hoping that RJ was lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as she wanted to just enjoy the sensation of RJ trying to escape from her fleshy prison there was the matter of the double shift she had just gotten home from and the amount of sleep she was missing. Reluctantly she turned around the corner to her bedroom and eased herself onto her massive mattress. The plump wolfess didn't have much time before she would have to be awake again and human meal or no she had to make the most of it. \"Talk to you later, small stuff. If you're still kicking. Got a long shift at the warehouse later today, then I'very got a three day weekend. If you're still alive maybe I'll let you out in time for Friday.\" Teasingly she pushed in on her belly, feeling the small human with her hands through the gut flesh on her abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ screamed as his world was flipped 90 degrees and the expansive stomach he was residing in suddenly became a lot more cramped. Two bulges, roughly hand shaped and similar to the appendage that had put him in this situation gently caressed his body. For a moment he forgot where he was and just lay flabbergasted in the deceptively mild digestive soup while the hands rubbed him up and down. Muffled though it was he made out the possible promise of freedom if he survived, which gave him a little ammunition to use against his growing pessimism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a few more minutes rolled by however a more expedient and much less uncertain path to safety presented itself, in the form of Anna snoring. If she was deep enough into sleep perhaps RJ could escape now, crawling back up her throat and trying to get help from Sabrina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut maybe if he just did as he was told and waited things out he could please Anna some way. Having such a big anthro on his side in this dangerous place was surely something that was worth the risk.</span></div></div>",

She adjusted her glasses and took a good look at RJ waving at her before she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" she said. \"A cute little human man. How convenient.\" RJ looked in confusion before Bernadette closed her eyes and bent down to his level, shaking her large belly and woolly butt as she showed her teeth. She was wearing nothing but a blue bra and jean shorts that might as well be a thong. \"Now,\" said Bernadette. \"Do you want to be cooked or swallowed whole when I eat you for breakfast.\" \"Eat me?!\" yelled RJ. Bernadette smiled and nodded her head. \"Of course, I haven't had breakfast yet and you look delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernadette then kicked open the door to her apartment and RJ gasped. Littering the floor were human skeletons. The sheep was carnivorous and she licked her lips as she rubbed her stomach. RJ was forced to run as Bernadette came after him. \"Yummy, yummy, yummy! Human's going in my tummy!\" Bernadette sang to herself as she ran forward. RJ couldn't believe how such a fat sheep could move so rapidly.

Her face then returned to that of a cold and merciless predator. She licked her lips before shoving R.J.'s head into her mouth. She gulped him down slowly, running her tongue along his face and arms as she swallowed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernadette, who had been watching with a smirk and folded arms; dropped her jaw out of shock. She'd thought it was just an act, she'd never thought for a split second that Sabrina would actually eat a human, let alone her friend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina turned around to face her with a slightly larger stomach, she was already on the heavy side, so it was kinda hard to tell that she had a human in her gut. \"Well? Are we done here?\" Sabrina asked nonchalantly as her stomach writhed and groaned while R.J. Struggled about in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... You ate him\" Bernadette said as she just stared in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said the only way you'd leave him alone is if someone ate him. Since I'm his friend I feel that I'm doing him a favor, you said it yourself, someone was going to eat him eventually, I'd rather it was me than some stranger or jerk that just felt like a snack.\" Sabrina stated<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisappointed and shocked, Bernadette turned ands slunk off back to her apartment. As soon as she was out of earshot, Sabrina looked at her belly, \"are you okay in here R.J.?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I'm not ok! You ate me!\" R.J. Shouted. \"I thought you were my friend! Guess your definition of 'friend' is different from mine since in your mind your doing me a 'favor' that ends wih my death!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RJ.

He plopped into an armchair that was still standing, laying his face in his hands. \"...well, this is certainly one of those landmark days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RJ, this is serious!

RJ couldn't make heads or tails of what Anna was thinking as she gazed along the cityscape with contemplative eyes, until finally she snapped her claws, smirking triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eating Contest.\" She finally spoke. \"Two weeks from now, there's auditioning for an eating contest going on downtown. It's sponsored by the ASL, so they'll take in anybody who's fat enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...what're you saying?\" Sabrina lead unsurely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll enter you into the contest saying that I'd fattened you up to enter. That'll explain everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell kind of a plan is <i>that</i>!?\" RJ sneered. \"If she wins, we'll have the entire city looking back at us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said she's gonna win?\" Anna rebounded. \"I used to work at these things all the time, and I know there's a ton of judging rounds that are watched only by officials.

The judges'll believe our excuse, and we won't have the public eye on our asses!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and Bernadette?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy. I've got some friends I can call who'll smash up her car and dump it over the city bridge. Once it pops up, all we'll have on our hands is a car accident and a dejected fighter.

I'm <i>not </i>gonna let that happen and ever go to bed knowing that you of anybody I knew was in there for some bullshit law when she was just helping out a friend. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina's mouth opened, but no answer came out. RJ could see plain on her face the ideas of confessing and going guilt-free or being locked away battled around in her mind, until finally she sighed in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I'll do it.\" She answered quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Anna nodded. \"We're set.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what now?\" RJ asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll call up my friends tomorrow morning, but I gotta know, Sabrina: did anybody see you here today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody but Bernadette. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, RJ, but you're gonna have company for a while.\" Anna noted, stepping into the center of the room. \"We can't have anybody seeing us yet, so we're gonna have to spend a week or two here until Sabrina looks less a vorer and more a fighter. That alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I guess I could make room.\" RJ agreed, even if he doubted there even <i>was</i> any for Anna. \"Might have to scrounge up some stuff so we can all sleep, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, that's not a problem.\" Anna rolled forward so she was laying on her own belly, her maw laying inside her cleavage like they were a pair of pillows. \"I'm my <i>own</i> bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and I could let Sabrina lay on by bed, with me on the couch, so I think we're all set.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so from here on, we're in action.\" Anna held out an open hand, her palm facing the ground. \"You guys in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ and Sabrina cast each other a final doubtful look before they, too, piled their hands atop Anna's. \"Deal.\" They said simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.

So what will it be; Helping me out to get to the bathroom, or leave me to let it all out for Zelda to sniff out,\" Sabrina growled, though in both a playful, yet serious manner. <i>PPpppffffffffffffftttt!</i> The quiet and soft fart insured Sabrina's threat, so you run back to get Anna for help and the two of you return, with Anna trying to hold in her laughter. \"RJ... pft!... I need you t-Ha-to get underneath Sa-Hehehe-Sabrina, so you can get into your roo-Hahahahahah!

Anna assists by lifting as much the wolfess's fat as possible. Starting to crawl, you manage to get under Sabrina's belly, hearing all of the gurgles, sloshing, and groans coming from it. Remembering you time in Sabrina, you felt hard for a moment, but you continue on, until you get into your room. \"It reeks in here! What did you ea-... Right, you had lamb. On with the mission,\" you state, before turning to your friend's backside. It was huge and without a moment's notice, you start pushing on it, your hands sinking into the flesh, yelling, \"I'm pushing, Anna. Pull!\" Anna quickly responses, by tugging her little sister and for a bit, Sabrina was stationary, but with a wet <b><i>fffrrraaapttTTT!</i></b>, Sabrina pops out of the doorway and waddles into your bathroom across the hall, closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As you wave the disgusting air way, Anna comes to you and whispers, \"How touching my sister's bum felt?\" As she said this, you immediately blush, and respond, \"Help yourself to anything in the kitchen. I'm going to open a window in my room.\" Anna giggles to herself as you turn around and accepts your offer. After cracking a window, you return to see all of  your food depleted and both you and Anna talk about things. Meanwhile, the both of you can hear grunting, farts, splashes and several flushing sounds coming from your bathroom. Later, a smaller version of Anna came out and the original says aloud, \"Finally someone can tell we're sisters, with the bigger boobs, hips, and ass.\" Sabrina blushes madly, as you boldly say, \"You still look the same, Sabrina. Just more cuddlier, ... and soft.\" After muttering the last part, Sabrina looks at you and says, \"Really? I'm not fat?\" \"It just temporary, until things cool off. I'll still like you, even if you physically change,\" you reply truthfully. \"Alright you lovebirds, knock it off,\" Anna interrupts. \"Like RJ said, we're still not out of the woods yet.

If an anthro doesn't condition her stomach to eat so much, so fast, she'll take forever to digest. It'll be so easy to tell that she's done no training...how will we explain how she got so big so fast and Bernadette's gone missing? Oh, and her coworker/friend and sister live in the same building as Bernadette?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ grimanced. \"Well...when you put it like that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina sighed. \"I'm just going to have to deal with being a little bigger.\" She said, resigned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Sabrina. Remember, you just have to look decent and win a few rounds and then take a dive. So, yeah, you'll get a little bigger by the time we're done. It won't be <i>that</i> bad. At worst, you'll be as big as me.\" Anna pointed out, a small grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina gave a light giggle. \"I never really did like being the runt...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so that's settled.\" RJ interceded. \"But what are we going to need?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food.\" Anna stated simply. \"We're gonna make a small feast. I've got enough stocked in my own apartment to feed a human army or three, so that won't be a problem. If anyone asks what I'm doing, I'm teaching you, RJ, how to cook.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't we have to worry about Zelda?\" RJ asked, nervously. \"She's always sniffing around my apartment, looking for me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna scoffed. \"Don't worry about her. Zelda only gets away with how she acts because you're human. Not that that's a bad thing but that means that she can bully you if you give her a reason. But when it comes to someone her own size, Zelda's a wimp. If she even comes around here, I'll scare her off just by being here.

I thought we were supposed to lay low?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only is Zelda a pushover, most of the others are scared of me. I'm one of the biggest tenants here and most don't know me that well. Whatever I'm doing, they'll clear the way just to stay in my good graces. It's Sabrina they can't see. It also helps that Bernadette kept to herself. She never really had friends and would go off on her own a lot.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna thought for a second before continuing. \"Oh yeah, that reminds me. RJ, I'll need you to help to get all the food and to me cook up everything and, once that's done, make Sabrina, here comfortable.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina blushed. \"W-What?!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ wasn't much better. \"What's THAT supposed to mean?!!\" He exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna held her hands up in defense. \"Calm down! What I mean is that while Sabrina's making a hog out of herself, you'll just have to rub her belly and back. Just to loosen her up a bit. What did you think I meant?\" Anna  finished, giving the two a teasing looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolfess and human looked at each other for a second, blushed harder before looking away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let-Let's just get the food.\" RJ said, highly embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took about three hours to get everything set up: an hour to get all of the food from Anna's apartment and another two to cook it all up. It was worth it, however. Sabrina was situated on the couch with plates and plates of food set before her. Fried chicken, microwave pizzas, tv dinners, hotdogs, hamburgers, etc. RJ noted that the food were all sorts of things you found in common grocery stores. Then he considered that Anna worked in one, so it really shouldn't have been all that surprised, to tell the truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you made too much...\" Sabrina drawled, her eyes traveling to each plate of food, noting how it filled up most of the room before her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna shrugged. \"Whatever you don't eat now, we'll just save for later in the day. It's not really a problem. Now get to it, sis!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Curious, Anna picks up a fried chicken wing and bit into it. \"Heh, you're right! Must be RJ's cooking,\" Anna mumbles as she's eating it. Pretty soon, Anna began to eat the same speed as her little sister, who was eating fast. \"How do you make more space in your stomach to eat?,\" Sabrina asked, in between bites. \"Simple, expel the air and gas you swallow by belching, or better yet, rip ass,\" Anna replied, in the same fashion as her younger sibling. To prove her point, Anna belches loudly. <i>\"Uuuuurrrrrrpppp!\"</i> Sabrina follows her sister's lead and lifts her fat butt to let a fart out. <i><b>FFFFFfffffffrrrrrrrrrraaaaapppttt!</b></i> This escalate things, that both wolves have abandoned using utensils and were shoving food down their gob. \"Hey, slow down! You guys are eating way too fast; you're going to get sick or eat something you shouldn't have!\" RJ shouts to the both of them, ignored by their gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all of the food was gone, both siblings were breathing slowly, and licking their chops. \"That was good!\" Anna moaned, before burping. <i>Brap!</i> Their bellies, bigger before eating, gurgled happily. \"You're right, that was delicious. RJ, what was it you want... RJ?,\" the wolfess spoke before noticing he wasn't there anymore. Both the human and wolf didn't have work, as it was the weekend, but Sabrina didn't hear any bathroom noises. Adding two and two together, both sister asked simultaneously, \"One of couldn't have, right?\" The answer appeared as tiny bugles on &lt;blank's&gt; gut. Whose tummy was it?</span></div></div>",

Before RJ knew it, he was deposited onto the floor of his apart, caped in slime, saliva and some bits of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina held her hands up to her face, shame clear in her expression. \"I-I-I I am so, so sorry RJ. Are you okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man quickly gathered himself up, expression unreadable. \"You know...I've heard the term 'feeding frenzy' but that was just plain ridiculous.\" His tone was even. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we got carried away.\" Anna remarked, grimacing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ nodded. \"Yeah, yeah you both did. Now, I'm going to take a shower. When I'm done, I'm going to make myself something to eat and we will forget this happened.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word or waiting for a reply, RJ strode off towards his room to get some clothes and quickly retreated into the bathroom.

I can't believe I didn't even notice that I ate him...what can friend am I?\" She mumbled the last bit sadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna gave a tired sigh. \"Well, I'm not too much better.

Well, at least you got the most of it I think.\" She patted Sabrina's gut for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina looked down at herself, still ashamed. \"A little too much if you ask me...\" <br>\r\n-------------------------- <br>\r\nIn the shower, RJ was currently just letting the warm water wash away his troubles and mulling over what just happened. <i>When they told me that anthros can eat, I never that it be like that</i>, he mused to himself. He wasn't really angry as so much as he was annoyed. Being eaten, then thrown up and covered in food had really soured his mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he knew that wasn't really Sabrina's fault and he wasn't about to take that out on her or Anna. When he got out the shower, he was still going to stick to the plan and help Sabrina digest all that. <i>Come to think of it, I'll probably have to do that for Anna, too.</i> At that thought he shrugged his shoulders, it wasn't that big a deal.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It smelt like death and following it, RJ sees Sabrina groaning in pain as she clutches her stomach, while her sister is trying to figure out what's wrong.<br>\r\n\"Thank god, RJ! It's been five minutes after you left when her stomach started to hurt. Any idea what's wrong, cause she's not allergic to anything, right?\"<br>\r\nLooking around, RJ picks up the food packaging and looks over it when his eyes spotted something on it. It was the expiration date and while it looked like any ordinary one, RJ's eyes bulged out.<br>\r\n\"Anna, when did you get this food?\"<br>\r\n\"Just a couple of days ago. Why?\" Anna answers back, curious at RJ's discovery.<br>\r\n\"Well, I might know the problem, as the food expired about a week ago!\" RJ exclaims, the wolf's eyes widen in horror, as Sabrina focuses on her stomach ache and releases deathly colon fumes into the already tainted air.<br>\r\n\"No wonder he sold me that stuff so cheaply! He's so dead when I get my hands on him!\" She yells in anger, when her little sister's stomach grumbles loudly, and menacingly as well.<br>\r\nRubbing her stomach, Sabrina loosens her backdoor finally from the pressure and starts ripping farts loudly, which one sounding wet.<br>\r\n\"Shit, literally! She's going to blow. Anna, help me get Sabrina into the bathroom!\" RJ shouts, Anna snapping to attention and helps the human lift her sister up.<br>\r\nPicking her up, they both lead Sabrina to RJ's bathroom, aware of the 'bomb' they're carrying.<br>\r\n\"Steady, steady, steady now. Sabrina, hold it in as long as possible until we're inside. Can you do that?\" RJ asks, Sabrina nodding her head, as the pain was too much for her to talk, tears forming in her eyes.<br>\r\nThey were halfway there when Sabrina's belly gurgled violently, followed by a sickening wet fart, that sounded like a shart, everyone's eyes widening.<br>\r\n\"Oh no! She's gonna blow!\" Anna cries out and roughly throws her sister into the bathroom, you with her.<br>\r\nPulling down her pants and panties, RJ didn't get a chance to turn around to run, when the albino wolf plops her rump on your toilet and noisily vacates her bowels. The smell was worse than her farts and RJ would of passed out, if not for his willpower. Jumping out of there, RJ shuts the door behind him so the smell wouldn't spread past the bathroom and attempts to catch his breath.<br>\r\n\"Remember to flush, Sabrina,\" RJ shouts, trying to be loud enough to heard through Sabrina's bowel orchestra.<br>\r\nOnce RJ and Anna breathing reached a level where they can talk, the human applauds the wolf anthro.<br>\r\n\"Nice *pant* throw, Anna.\"<br>\r\n\"No, thanks for *pant* not letting my sister *pant* shitting herself! God, it reeks here!\"<br>\r\n\"Be thankful for *pant* living here!\" RJ tiredly protests, before both parties start to laugh at the ridiculous of the situation.<br>\r\nOnce the laughter ended, both return to the living room and RJ grabs something to eat.<br>\r\n\"An extreme way to remind me to check the expiration date,\" The wolf bbw jokes.<br>\r\n\"Not funny and are you alright, Anna? You ate some that food too!\"  You worryingly ask.<br>\r\n\"I got an iron stomach. Had 10 humans go nuts in my gut and everything flowed smoothly,\" she answers confidently, until she see RJ look at her with horror across his face.<br>\r\n\"Sabrina has your back, so your good,\" she adds in, lessen RJ's panic to a degree.<br>\r\nWhat's next?</span></div></div>",

She'd even shot up by a foot and some, yet her face still clenched with each step as she pushed around a belly so big and round that he almost thought that she was still bloated from the late psychotic sheep, even though it sagged down onto the carpet in a massive balloon of pure blubber. Many pictures along the wall were pushed off their hooks as her stomach scraped along both walls of the corridor, with shoulders coning above that stood only inches away, but they also hoisted around a pair of breasts teetering as wide and plentiful that, on their lonesome, put her late waistband of yesterday to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't bothered to change out of her pajamas, being too sickened and winded from her new workout to bother as they were tugged up along her body only inches under her chest, with three deep wrinkles stretched in from her breasts' furthest points. She even made her glasses look too small, which were more awkwardly perched around the extra amount of girth that'd been pumped into her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi...RJ...\" She panted, tongue slopping out of her maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...Sabrina,\" RJ'd gotten out. It was Sabrina's voice, and her hair, and the albino pigment that bleached her body, but he was reeled away from looking at the blimp hoisting herself around his home as his long loved coworker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlopping her head around, she cleared her head up enough to see RJ much more clearly, and didn't seem all to pleased by the reality hanging off her body. \"Yeah, felt the same way in the bathroom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright? How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I just ate a gajillion calories in one night, so...\" An empty growl coarsed around in her belly, pushing up her throat in the form of a loud belch. \"...just peachy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, you'll get used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two looked back at the living room, where Anna was leaning against the wall. She had an impressed grin along her maw, but the two could still see she was pushing down a feeling of amazement fluttering around inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, sis, I'd never thought I'd live to see the day!\" She laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never imagined <i>I</i> would, either...\" More awakened, Sabrina lugged herself along the rest of the way down the hall. RJ stepped out of the way, watching the two until he could see that, although still a close call, Sabrina only stood a foot or so under her sister, but was getting close to having a shape that swelled out as much from her spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna planted a paw on her sister's shoulder. \"Listen, a few weeks of walking'll clear it up in no time. Soon enough, you won't notice a thing, save popping a few belt sizes here and there. Alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm long beyond the threshold of turning back, so,\" Sabrina shrugged. \"Might as well walk the rest of the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit?\" Her paw lifted away, smacking back down along one of her new lovehandles. \"Besides, this'll open up a whole lot of stuff for us.

R.K. struggled and tried to reach out of her mouth, but Bernadette sucked him further inside until only his legs were sticking out of the sheep's maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernadette licked all over R.J.'s body to savor his taste before she sucked in his feet and moaned in ecstasy. With one large gulp, Bernadette successfully swallows him, causing R.J. to land in her acid filled belly. Her already monstrous sized belly bulged further out before the sheep woman rubbed it and let out a thunderous belch. \"Ah,\" she said as she let out a slightly smaller burp. \"Human. The other white meat. That was a good breakfast. Now, I better get going to work.\" Inside Bernadette's massive belly, R.J. looked in shock. He had just been eaten and by a sheep woman. He could hear her insides gurgle as outside Bernadette locks her apartment door and walks out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernadette hummed to herself as she rubbed her stomach. \"Let me out!\" yelled R.J. as he pounded on the sheep's stomach walls. \"Please let me out!\" Bernadette belched again before tapping her belly. \"Sorry human, you don't understand how it works. Anybody I eat, stays eaten. Don't feel bad, the skeletons usually survive the trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the belly, R.J's skin was being burned as the heat got to R.J. He was even panting heavily because every time Bernadette burped, it took some of his oxygen away. R.J. kept pounding the stomach walls, but to no avail. Soon Bernadette reached the library where she worked. At the front desk was a large rat woman who looked as big as her and just as fat with gray fur and black hair worn in a ponytail. \"Whoa Bernadette,\" says the rat woman. \"You look bigger than usual today.\" Bumps appeared on Bernadette's stomach as the sheep woman giggled. \"Oh that. Just a human I ate for breakfast.\" The rat woman licked her lips outside. \"Lucky. Humans are so delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like R.J. was in trouble because he was getting hit with more acid as Bernadette kept walking. If this kept up, he'd be digested in no time. But R.J. remembered he had his cell phone in his pocket. Maybe Sabrina could help him. Wasting no time, R.J. dialed Sabrina's phone number.

She let her flabby, wooly stomach role out in all its glory and loosened her pants. The rat girl stared at the struggling lump with naked envy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone we know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah,\" Bernadette said, smacking her belly and watching it jiggle. \"He's just a neighbor from my building.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a human who lived in a building for anthros?\" the rat girl asked, laughing. \"Is he stupid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since he walked right up to my door to introduce himself, I'd say... Yes. It was awfully neighborly of him to give himself up as my breakfast though. I woke up late and I was afraid I'd have to go through this shift on an empty stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he's part of a new human delivery service?\" the rat girl said and both she and Bernadette burst out laughing. R.J. tried not to focus on their cruel laughter, or the ominous gurgles from all around him, or the tingling sensation of the stomach acid against his skin, or the fact that his clothes were already falling apart. All he focused on was getting a damn signal! Yet an hour passed and one never came. He couldn't help it, he started to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernadette was busy stacking a shelf with books when she heard R.J. sobbing. She couldn't help but laugh. It was so pathetic. \"Awww, widdle baby,\" she cooed. \"What's wrong? Don't like being digested in my big belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP!\" R.J. snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemme guess,\" the sheep purred. \"You're finally realizing that your phone won't work?\" R.J. kept quiet and her smile widened. \"Yeah, sorry, babe, but I forgot to tell you. My stomach doesn't have great reception. No body's ever managed to get a signal out. Sorry to disappoint you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't sound sorry at all. R.J. could hear the joy in her voice. She was reveling in this. The sound made R.J. enraged. She was killing him and found it funny!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET ME OUT! LET ME OUT!\" R.J. kicked and screamed, redoubling his efforts to escape Bernadette's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Urp</i>!\" The giant sheep let out a small burp into her fist. \"Hey--<i>urp</i>--cut it out! You're--<i>BRAP</i>--gonna give me--<i>Oooarrp</i>--indigestion--\" Bernadette made a fist and pounded against her chest as the gas built up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>UUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP PPPPPPPPPPPPPP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around her the library shook from the force of her belch. It echoed through the building. Anthros snapped up from their books in terror, some thinking it was an earthquake. At last it subsided and all eyes fell on the blushing sheep standing in the aisle. One anthro, an ancient, elderly owl raised a talon to her beak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owl shushed her then nodded matter-of-factly before turning back to her book. Everyone else followed her example and went back to reading, though a few anthros shot confused glances at Bernadette's backside as she went back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're,\" the sheep snapped. \"Hope you're happy human, cause you're not going--human?\" Bernadette paused. The screams and struggles coming from her stomach had stopped.  She tapped her stomach. \"Human? You still alive in there?\" No response. Bernadette snorted. \"Well that's what you get. Thanks for the meal, neighbor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Bernadette went back to work and carried out an otherwise uneventful shift. By the time she got home, R.J. was long dead. What the sheep had promised earlier proved true. His skeleton <i>did</i> survive the trip. Not that that was much comfort to R.J. in his current state. His bleached bones joined the cemetery of past meals cluttering the floors of Bernadette's apartment and was quickly forgotten, one snack among a lifetime's worth, nothing special at all.</span></div></div>",

Due to the size of it, she wasn't wearing pants or a thong but her fur made it acceptable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ looked up at her smiling face and saw her reddish brown and graying hair worn in a bun. She looked down at the tiny human and smiled as she wiggled her rear and her udder. \"Well, well, well,\" she said. \"So this is the human I've been hearing so much about. Come right in handsome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ nodded his head because she seemed friendly enough, so he walked right inside. What happens now?</span></div></div>",

She hasn't been able to hold down to a boyfriend due to her rather large appetite.

Because of this, most tend to avoid her. Barbara is not a party girl but she loves going out. Very into horror movies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, the two get along pretty well.

Reba's considered to be one of the best looking anthros in Furdale and that was saying something. She works as a up and coming defense attorney. So not only was she beautiful but she was also intelligent. But from what RJ had heard, Reba had just recently broken up with her boyfriend who had left her due to her being 'too clingy'. Reba was devastated. She had apparently taken to shutting herself in her room when not working. No one really knew how else she was dealing with situation. Supposedly, she was very nice if a little obsessive before she broke up with her boyfriend. Also, she's apparently never eaten a human before if only because she's never tried...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next resident was one Brenda Lane. Brenda is a obese, 12'7\" rat anthro with black fur and hair and blue eyes. Brenda is Zelda's childhood friend. She's seemingly unemployed and living off of Zelda's charity. Brenda is rough around the edges party girl. She's also apparently one of the few anthros who can out eat Zelda and the two's eating contests over the years took tolls on their figures.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The door opened briskly, revealing Reba wearing a black robe. The kitsune's hair was a tad messy, most likely from just getting up. In her hands was a mug of what smelled like to be coffee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat really got RJ's attention was just how tall Reba was. In all honesty, he wasn't too tall but he wasn't a shrimp but Reba was the tallest anthro he'd ever seen. He just came up to her waist. As his eyes traveled upwards, he took in the rest of her. The robe she was wearing did a pretty good job of hiding her form but RJ could still make out her generous hips and bust through the fabric. He also noted the nine tails moving to and frow behind her. Finally, his gaze arrived at her face. Framed by her waist length hair, Reba's face; rather slim and elegant with a dainty black nose. Overall, she was gorgeous and lived up to what he had heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for all that, Reba's eyes took the cake. The whites of her eyes were a little red, whether from waking up, crying OR lack of sleep, RJ didn't know. But what he did know was that those eyes were sizing him up. Two pools of amber met RJ's gaze and for a second he was lost. It was like Reba was staring into his soul. He soon however mentally kicked himself. He came here to introduce himself, not ogle! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire time, Reba watched, interested. Here was the human she had heard about who had moved to Furdale. At first, she laughed about. What kind of human would move to a place where they could be eaten at any moment? It was absurd. But sure enough, he moved in and now here he was at her door, looking all friendly. Kind of cute, really.She raised a brow as watched his face twitch a bit. <i>He's actually resisting?</i> she pondered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitsune were magical by nature, possessing abilities that most other anthros didn't. One of those was their almost hypnotic gaze. With just eye contact could almost enthrall another's mind. It was subtle, but that was what made it so effective. Most couldn't throw it off unless they had a decent amount of exposure to it or had enough will power. Reba doubted the human had much contact with her kind, so that meant he actually had some will power. That was interesting as it was surprising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ smiled up at her, surprising her again, and spoke. \"Hi, there. I'm RJ and I just moved in. I'm just going around and getting to know my neighbors.\" He offered her a hand to shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReba blinked. Did the human not realize how much danger he was in? She was bigger and stronger than him. Not too mention that her kind tended to eat his. Well, most of her kind. Reba had never eaten a human, mainly due to having never met one and she never felt like going out of her way to go after one. Could this be her opportunity? She hadn't eaten yet, so she was hungry and he would be filling. It was tempting... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, here was a young person she'd never met who seemed nice enough and wanted to get to know her. She didn't have too many friends and with her boyfriend (Asshole!) dumping her, she really had no one to talk to. Then there was the fact that the little human had thrown off her 'charm' very quickly. He was intriguing if nothing else. Besides, a friend sounded really nice right now... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaught between two options, Reba made a choice. She reached out for RJ hand and...</span></div></div>",

She continued to slurp up her human meal until she reached his feet. She gently removed his socks and shoes before gently lapping at his feet causing R.J. to writhe and shudder once again.

Checking his watch, he was still technically early despite being there for nearly half an hour. His heart was pounding hard, nervous as to whether or not his date was coming. It had taken him a lot of time and courage to ask her out, and he was overjoyed when she had said yes. The waiter came by the table again, looking a bit more annoyed than last time. He was a middle aged wolf anthro with grey fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to order anything now, sir? A drink, perhaps?\"<br>\r\n\"...I'll have water for now, but when she comes, can you bring out a bottle of wine?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course, sir. Which bottle would you care for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter talking with him for a few minutes, they decided on a bottle with quite the pricy label. As he walked away, he pulled out the chair opposite to you and walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, did I make you wait?\" RJ stood up fast to greet his date. <br>\r\n\"No, I haven't been here long. Please, have a seat. I hope you don't mind that I ordered us some wine.\"<br>\r\n\"That sounds perfect.\" As they sat down, the waiter returned and poured them glasses of red wine and left the bottle. RJ smiled and taped his glass against her's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you could come tonight,...\"<br>\r\nWho is RJ's date? </span></div></div>",

What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, RJ couldn't have cared less if she came in with her workwear on, but right then, he had to stamp down on his own foot to keep a straight face. By no means was Sabrina an unattractive girl, but when she really put in an effort to clean herself up, she was such a looker that RJ struggled to remember she was even an albino in the first place. With her fur fresh from the shower, her silvery hair was tied back into an intricate bun whose fringes almost mimicked the petals to a rose, a few bangs hanging before eyes that were painted by thick black eyeliner and mascara of a deep, pale purple. Topping off the ensemble was a crimson dress tied around her neck by a single loop, nicely fitting her figure even with her large gut hanging past her crotch, showing off enough of her sizable breasts that they were pretty much keeping the dress on themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I love it!\" RJ forced out, biting his lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina giggled, dampening her classy demure only a little. \"Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your orders, sir and madame?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRJ and Sabrina both flinched, seeing the wolf waiter from before obediently step up to their table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" RJ desperately looked through his menu, trying to find something appealing through all the French-sunding names. <i>Crap...crap...CRAP!</i> \"A...cheeseburger, side of fries?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, sir.\" The waiter deadpanned, taking his menu before turning to Sabrina. \"...and you, madame?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just go with the chicken tenders.\" She answered, politely handing him the menu herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, miss. Enjoy your evening.\" The waiter bowed, then slinked back to head for the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Sabrina awkwardly began, setting her hands on her lap and looking around. \"Glad to get away from beta, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...yeah.\" RJ replied, sipping from his water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemme tell you, I'll be amazed if Gatling 3 even gets ratings past the lower quarter.\" She continued, scratching her chin. \"The only time I'm gonna be happy about that game is when it's out of our servers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...definitely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina nodded. She opened her fingers up and stared down her claws, observing her manicure. \"So...anything you'd like to talk about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" <i>This is it, man, your chance to really pull her in. Say something!</i> \"How was your day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just fine!\" She answered merely, but RJ could barely hear her as he smacked himself in his head. \"Traffic here was pretty bad, but other than that, nothing to complain. You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh...not much, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina nodded, glancing around at her surroundings, again. \"...seen any good movies, lately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: To keep the evening going, after supper, RJ takes them somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Some form of disaster happens during their dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: RJ goes to the bathroom to compose himself, but on the way, he's confronted by another, more massive wolfess...</span></div></div>",

The Anthro world is just as modern as the human one but with the inclusion of the residents having more females than males and the fact that they're far taller, bigger and stronger than humans...there's also the fact that there is not technical law that says they can't eat humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b></b>Characters<b></b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMain<br>\r\nRon James Smith a.k.a. \"RJ\" <br>\r\nSpecies: Human <br>\r\nHeight: 5'11\" <br>\r\nAppearance: Somewhat thin, broad shoulders, not in shape but not fat either, brown hair and green eyes.<br>\r\nRJ is a twenty-something year old guy with a knack for computer programming and security. When he graduated, he got numerous offers in the human world to come work for them. However, he also got one from an online game publisher and developer, Tooth &amp; Claw Gaming to protect their servers from hackers and rival companies. They offered him double the pay from what anyone else had with one catch: he had to move to the Anthro world. RJ is a nice guy who's pretty smart and resourceful but doesn't have a lot of real world experience. Moving to Furdale might be the end of him if he's not careful.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther Characters <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i></i>Tooth and Claw Gaming<i></i> (RJ's workplace. Feelings about humans are typically apathetic but there are special cases)<br>\r\nSabrina <br>\r\nSpecies: Wolf Anthro <br>\r\nHeight: 8'1\" <br>\r\nAppearance: Very heavy set, albino (white hair, white fur, and red eyes) <br>\r\nOne of the lead graphic designers at T&amp;C Gaming, Sabrina is creative and friendly. One of the few Anthros in all of Furdale to actually seem to like RJ. She'd never consider eating him and the friendships the two have struck up has given RJ some protection from more hostile Anthros. Wonder if RJ will ever notice how she steals glances at him from time to time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda <br>\r\nSpecies: Gator Anthro <br>\r\nHeight: 8'9\" <br>\r\nAppearance: Curvaceous, grey scales/white underbelly, blue eyes <br>\r\nRhonda is part of the marketing department for T&amp;C. She's not too fond of RJ or humans in general. In public at the workplace, she tolerates him but lord forbid if she ever got him alone with no one watching... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison <br>\r\nSpecies: Tiger Anthro <br>\r\nHeight: 10'1\" <br>\r\nAppearance: Athletic build, typical tiger colors, brown eyes <br>\r\nAllison is head of the art department. Allison may seem friendly at first, but she's really human eater. She's tried asking RJ to lunch several different times. Luckily for him, work has called him away or Sabrina has stepped in to dissuade Allison.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrene <br>\r\nSpecies: Bear Anthro <br>\r\nHeight: 9'5\" <br>\r\nAppearance: Somewhat overweight, brown fur, black hair and brown eyes <br>\r\nIrene is a security guard at T&amp;C. Despite her appearance, she's pretty good at her job though rumor has it she's bent some rules before. RJ's never really had a lot contact with her outside of work, so it's unknown what she feels about him or humans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i></i>Furdale Towers<i></i> (RJ's apartment complex. He lives on the first floor. Due to work, he hasn't met everyone or been to every place in the building yet.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda <br>\r\nSpecies: Lion Anthro <br>\r\nHeight: 9'2\" <br>\r\nAppearance: Obese, blond fur, brown hair, brown eyes <br>\r\nThe landlady of Furdale Towers. While reasonable, Zelda seems suspicious of RJ because he's human. She's dropped a couple hints that if she thinks he's starting trouble or gets behind on his rent, she'll eat him. RJ generally avoids her when he can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia <br>\r\nSpecies: Hawk Anthro <br>\r\nHeight: 7'9\" <br>\r\nAppearance: Lithe figure, red hair, brown/white feathers, gold eyes <br>\r\nA tenet of the first floor and a biologist. Manic and overenthusiastic, she really wants to 'study' RJ. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine <br>\r\nSpecies: Lizard Anthro <br>\r\nHeight: 9'9\" <br>\r\nAppearance: Muscular, black scales/yellow underbelly, green eyes <br>\r\nA tenet of the second floor and a body builder. Jasmine is snarky and likes to constantly tease/mock RJ due to being a 'geek'. In turn, RJ just ignores her. However, everytime he does, it seems like Jasmine just get angrier. She's a big part of why RJ has never gone past the first floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRULES: <br>\r\n1. No toilet stuff. Please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Sex is allowed just don't turn this into smut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Vore is allowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Don't end the story too soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Try to keep the Anthros around adult age (18 and up). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n6.There can be male anthros but RJ should be interacting with females for the most part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n7.Feel free to add new Anthros. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>NEW:</b> 8. Feel free to add some other humans. Not a lot mind you, but giving RJ some new human friends or enemies, is welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAVE FUN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       <br>\r\n</td>",
