His house was miles from this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How am I going to get home without anyone seeing me?</i> he thought to himself.<br>\r\nHe made his way to the corner of one of the buildings and peaked around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis frozen heart skipped a beat when he saw...</span></div></div>",

He put his hands up, hoping to calm her down and not draw anymore attention to his current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you moving? Can you talk? Is this a dream?\" she rattled off rhetorical questions as she poked Josh's cold snowball body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yes! All of that...I mean no...you're not dreaming but...\" Josh stammered, \"I really need to get home and then get back to normal. Can you maybe give me a ride?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" the girl said, tapping her chin with a finger, \"I suppose I might be able to do that...but not right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's heart sank, \"Why not right now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because silly! It's rather warm out for a snowman! I think the best thing to do is to get you inside until after dark...<i>then </i> I can give you a ride. We don't want you melting too soon.\" she said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh hadn't realized it before, but it was rather warm for a snowman, which only added more questions as to how he got like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can stay in my house until then...\" she said, \"I'm Cindy, by the way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something about the girl that made Josh uneasy and in his current form he had to be sure not to take any risks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, Cindy...let's...\"</span></div></div>",
