You weren't sure if it was just them not bothering to call you something as cool as Maximus, or if it was them being malicious. Either way, it annoyed you. Though not as much as being stuck doing chores in Atlantis. You're a brown furred Pegasus with white spots, including one over one of your rather wide hips. You're told you're to young to go out on the kinds of missions the older elite go on, but you still figured you were strong enough for them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps now's a good time to recollect on your position. You're part of a group of creatures chosen by Poseidon to help the citizens that are accosted by the many monsters out in the world. Monsters like Hydras, Minotaurs, Centaurs, and all sorts of other monsters have been causing trouble out there. You were part of a species of very friendly, or, depending on who you ask, very tamable, monsters. When Atlantis got separated from the mainland, Pegasi and Pegasi alone occupied the city, and would grow to make it into a military-like bunker. It's filled with armor and weapons of all sorts. On top of that, many buildings were repurposed into the elite's convenience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the big guys went out to aid villages or hunt down monsters, the little guys like you stayed behind in Atlantis. When the chief wasn't putting you guys through the wringer in training, you cleaned up the many buildings and streets, farmed the fields, and washed the smelly cloths of the elites and also massaged them. Pegasi were fairly strong, even you were quite muscular given your age. But the monsters needed more than above average strength, so you could only grow until the time came to beat the beasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, you wore leather armor, wielding a wooden pole crafted to resemble a lance. Ahead of you was your trainer. She's a pink Pegasus currently wearing leather armor, and wielding a wooden sword. She towered over you, being perhaps 4x your size! This was Paula, one of the elites of the past generation. She was trying to make sure you're growing up to be a good boy when the time comes for you to fight. You thrusted your wooden lance forwards, her deflecting the blow with a swipe of her sword. She then slid her sword down the length of your lance as she advanced, before she stepped around you, and gave you a cheeky sword-smack to the rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumbled forwards, reaching a hand towards your pained backside, before turning around towards her, holding your lance up. This routine would seem to repeat a few times, her cheeks getting redder and redder. You were soon left panting, too weak to continue. It wasn't from any pain from her strikes, more from you running around. With that, Paula dropped her sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's it for today, bud,\" she said as she undressed from her leather armor. You sighed and lost grip of your lance, it falling to the ground. You were hunched over, hands on your knees as you were left panting. \"Stop by the fountain, bud. Then you'll be expected at your chores.\" She pulled out a list and handed it towards you, you looking up at her. You couldn't help but admire her form. She was, of course, muscular as hell, but she also bore some breasts even bigger than your head, and hips wider than your shoulder span. She could probably hide half of you within her assets if she wanted. \"I'd like to see you at the massage parlor. But be warned, I worked up a bit of a sweat myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a chuckle, she ruffled the top of your head, ruffling your mane before she walked off. You sighed. You knew she liked teasing you. You hadn't seen her tease other boys, but then again you didn't really watch her interact with anyone else. You were getting really fed up with the teasing. You didn't want to perpetuate this teasing, but she didn't exactly offer a lot of time for you to avoid it. Surely she'd punish you if she caught you dipping away from your \"responsibility\". Maybe you could avoid the massage parlor for now. Maybe, even, avoid it for a long time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elites weren't exactly private about some of the missions they'd receive from Poseidon. A few miles away from Atlantis, there was developing village on mainland. It was near shore, and it seemed it's trying to make itself into a bigger town. But it's suffered a few attacks. There's talk of Centaur raids and a large Minotaur nearby, but odds are the elite might respond to those calls. Maybe there are issues the people of the settlement could use help with? Or maybe you could slack off today...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If you just stick with a more small scale attack, you could probably avoid being noticed by one of the elites. First, you snuck into the armory. Well, \"snuck\", more like, at around this point the guards at the armory assumed the little guys that got inside were there to clean the goods. So, you took a chestplate, some grieves, and a lance, all iron. You would've grabbed something of sterner metal, but you already practiced flying with anything harder than iron, and your little wings weren't quite up to snuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dressing up and strapping your lance to your side, you snuck over to one of the borders of Atlantis. There was a specific gate the elites were supposed to go through for missions towards the mainland, that's where the guards made sure the proper elites went where they were assigned. You just needed to make sure some of the fliers didn't notice you. You flew away, forgetting to make sure some other Pegasus didn't see you fly off a restricted take-off zone, and you soared through the sea. You kept your head upwards to look out for any other Pegasi keeping guard, but it seemed you were safe in your travel. It took a lot of flapping, but soon you saw the shoreline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou touched down, planting your hooves against the ground. After that, your wings folded into rest, you allowed to cool down for a little. You stretched your arms and legs, them not needing much attention while you were flying. It felt good to extend your limbs after a bout of flight. After that, you marched towards mainland. As you did, you suddenly realized you had no idea which way this town was. If you flew upwards now, you'd probably get noticed by some of the elites flying in. Maybe if you march forwards a little, you can see some trail to this settlement. Maybe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you began walking...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It seemed the passage was safe. At least today it was. You were able to walk along the trail without resistance, and soon found yourself looking at a quaint settlement. There was some big fencing lining the small area, within the area the fencing surrounded were a bunch of tents that the travelers had to set up for now. Unfortunately, you knew that they're struggling to keep intact. This place was still developing, and was subject to frequent attacks. Despite this, you saw a pair of tough-looking wolf men each holding a sword  defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approached the duo, who each held their sword threateningly towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! No pegasi are to get into our settlement!\" one of the wolves said. You held up your arms defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\" you said. \"No, I'm here to help! I got separated from my pack and now I'm personally seeking out our clients. Just to talk, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pegasi are needed to help at a distance, here,\" the wolf said. You were vague on the details, but you heard a while ago some Pegasi went rogue and broke from the group and were somewhere out in Greece. You didn't know where exactly they were, the best anyone had was a vague idea. Did they have something to do with this place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are pegasi not welcome here?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... don't know?\" one of the wolves said, their weapons lowering in response. Most people would probably assume what you did to merely be an act, but you had this certain innocence about you, despite you kind of breaking all the rules back home. \"A bunch of our men were setting up a farm down by the beach when 3 o' you flew by and crop-dusted the place. It stunk so bad, the farmland became infertile!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh my...\" you responded. Three rogues, that sounds about right. Especially rude rogues like that... \"Look, they're not with us. They fled the guard one day and never came back. I'm sorry for what they've done, but milady will punish them, maybe more if we find out about everything they've done.\" With that, the two wolves put down their swords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll keep an eye on you,\" they said. \"Be careful.\" With that slight warning, you entered. It smelled nice in here, kind of like freshly cut grass. You continued inwards, and you heard a couple of people step out. And you considered your options. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently these guys noticed those rogues, if you got more information you might be able to narrow down their location and take them out. Those other pegasi were dealing with the officially posted jobs, so you may as well ignore those. Walking past the tents, you heard one bunny lady with bright red lipstick let out an \"ooo~\" at seeing you and begin to beckon you towards her, maybe she could use some help? There are also cases of some of the young ones losing their toys outside of the settlement. Maybe there's conflict between people? Surely there's something to do.</span></div></div>",

So, before you went to far, you pivoted and turned towards the bunny lady standing out of her tent. When you got close, you noticed more about her. She had that red lipstick, but she also had a fairly curvy figure. You weren't sure if she was quite like your captain, but she still looked very nice. Especially with the black dress wrapped snuggly around her. It really made her breasts and hips pop in her dress, the front half stopping just above her knees while the back half reached down to her calves. She looked pretty well off for someone asking for your help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?\" you asked, looking up at her. She, meanwhile, looked down at you with a... funny expression. It looked kind of like the face someone would make while looking down at a cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't seen a Pegasus so small before...\" she cooed. \"Yes, I've been waiting for something like you, kid~ I'm working on some lipstick, and I needed myself a lovely little subject to test it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it?\" you asked. As silly as helping someone out with their lipstick sounds, it's at least something you can do out here. \"Alright, I'm sure I could find someone that'd like to-\" You were cut off when the bunny gently grabbed you by the cheek, craning your head towards her as she leaned in close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you already have~\" she cooed. Your eyes widened in realization, only for her to lean in and plant a gentle kiss on your cheek, leaving the red stain shining prominently on your white fur. And at that, faster than you could protest, you felt a strange warmth in your chest as you looked up at her. It didn't feel like a fire, but it felt awfully close. Except instead of singeing, it pulled you towards her. She stood to full height, and already you were clinging to her leg, which the bunny giggled at. \"Alright, c'mon, cutie. We've got much more to test out here~\" With a hand gently tickling under your chin, she drew you into her tent, subtly closing it behind you. Once inside, you were hit with the smell of scented candles. She brought you to a carpet in the middle of the tent and knelt you down on it. And then, she grabbed a package of lipstick vials, and brought them over beside you, before kneeling before you herself, her still towering over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, kid, you're about to see some new charms at work,\" she said. She wiped her red lipstick off, before tapping through the vials, haphazardly choosing a new one. Eventually, she pulled out...</span></div></div>",

I've seen many boys get weak-kneed when they just glance at me,\" she said. \"You've been staring at me an awful long time.\" And then, she sensually ran the lipstick over her lips, painting them green. She smooched at the air in front of you, which only drove the fire burning in you brighter. You felt yourself drawn to those shining lips, watching as they got closer and closer... You didn't even realize at first when you felt those lips press against your cheek, leaving a rich green stain upon you. She pulled away, licking her lips a little. \"Now, what part of me do you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were at first confused about what she could possibly mean. Like? Part? Was it normal to like parts of somebody? However, that lipstick began worming itself into your mind. You felt your previous confusion begin to melt away. You began to feel a lot of your thoughts melt away in fact. Instead, your mind was drawn towards... them. You glanced towards her knees, her feet covered by her body. You whimpered a little, and tried to crawl around her to get a peek. The rabbit, meanwhile, watched you with a knowing grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Are you coming to peek at something you like?\" she cooed. Soon, you were looking behind her, glancing at her feet, which bore a pair of black socks. You could see her toes wriggle slightly, as if anticipating you looking at them. She, meanwhile, put on a predatory grin as she caught your blushing face looking down at her feet. She was sure her prey was ready to get gobbled up. \"Now what could you possibly want back there~?\" The lipstick may've drawn him towards those feet, but it certainly made him affectionate in one of several different ways. Just a question of how it manifested in you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want...</span></div></div>",

You figured this'd lead to either the settlement or some other township. In that case, you'd just turn around and head the other way. So, you began traveling, you figured, west on the path. It wound northwards a little, making you go northwest. Soon, the path went through a patch of trees, which was convenient. The closer you got to this settlement, the easier it'd be for one of those elite to notice you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went under the tree line, still walking. You were a fairly na\u00efve boy, so you didn't quite think to pay attention to anything beyond the road. Though, it seems the rest of the world would find it fit to teach you a lesson, as some unsavory characters hid by the trees. You were walking, just minding your own business, when you heard a rustle from one of the trees. Looking up, you saw a jaguar lady in a black cloak diving down at you. With your wings, you flapped away, the force propelling you from the predatorial pounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, you pulled out your lance and held it defensively in front of you, anticipating another attack. The jaguar, meanwhile, stood up to full height, easily twice your own. And now you were able to get a good look at her. You saw that she had toned, muscular legs, the likes of which you saw a few Pegasi use to either choke some poor guy out, or to pin theim in place while they grind their smelly bits into them. She bore leather armor, including torso padding that seemed to be shaped to more show off her large breasts, armor the likes of which you hadn't seen in Atlantis. You let out a blush at that. She had tall leather boots and short shorts, as well as black gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what do you think you're doing!\" you asked. \"You can't pounce some traveler like that!\" The cougar leaned back with little regard to what you have to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm... Not often I see a Pegasus as small as you...\" she notes with a noticable purr escaping her throat. You began circling her, keeping your lance raised. \"You know, the black market has a thing for rare breeds. We can track down weak Centaurs, weak Minotaurs... but you Pegasi are always seen out in the wild as muscle-bound titans.\" She lets out a light chuckle. \"And then you show up~ Mmm, I smell payday...\" You heard more rustling behind you, and stole a glance over your shoulder. You couldn't quite see who it was, but you felt a dark presence behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you seem scared, kid,\" the jaguar said. She leaned down a little, and now you could notice the leather armor was short, it able to expose her cleavage. \"I ain't gonna hurt you~ You just need to come along quietly...\" You had no idea how strong this lady was, and you weren't sure if battle would turn out well. Unknown to you, behind you was one smelly raccoon lady and one cuddly deer lady. Could you handle a fight now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, your defiance was quickly interrupted when a surprise bandit came in from behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caught ya!\" she cheered. You realized you were in the grip of a deer, her arms around your torso and her hoisting you off the ground. You began flailing, your wings flapping manically against the confines of the deer's grip. However, they flapped helplessly against her body while her arms made sure to pin your arms down as well. In your panic, you could scarcely hear the sound of your weapon falling onto the ground. While you flailed, the deer's hands wandered your body, gently groping your chest and stomach. \"Ooo, you're cushy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jaguar, meanwhile, giggled and approached, a smug grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you about to deny me?\" she asked.

Poor guy had his face sat on by her from dusk to dawn, passing out several times. The second she stood up from him, he was sent out to fight a gorgon while still sleep deprived and gasping for air. Nobody's seen him since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuddering at that memory, you do as you're told and head for the massage parlor. You hated this place the most of your chores. Especially when you get stuck with grunt duty, meaning every asshole Pegasus that couldn't make the elite got to boss you around and rubdown where they told you. Given that the grunts were mostly male, this duty often put you in disgusting positions that you were taunted for weaks to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly better was elite duty. It was similar to grunt duty, only the elites are less... vulgar in their requests. Plus, the elites were more of a mixed bag than the grunts, so you would have an equal chance of a female client than a male. They weren't that different in their requests, but at least there was the added perk of it being a woman's body you were feeling up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you were really lucky, Aphrodite's Arial Squadron would be in today. They were responsible for personally overseeing the goddess of love herself whenever she leaves Olympus. An all-female unit, they were given the nickname \"The Sky Sirens\" after their near uniform beauty and skill. Despite being quite possibly the best of the best, they were always the kindest to the recruits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, you could be tasked with the parlor staff themselves. Serving as a masseuse for the masseuses, it's arguably the lowest position in Atlantis, similar to being a slave to slaves. Anyone given this assignment is always mocked mercilessly for the next month. Thankfully, the staff know how hard it is to serve another hand and hoof, so they are generally nice to anyone saddled with it with easy tasks and almost never any raunchy requests unless the recruit consents. This is another mixed bag of genders like the elites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you make it to the parlor. The Pegasus at the desk, Lucy, was waiting for you. \"Ah, Maxi. Good to see you. I take it you've been assigned to us for today?\" You nod meekly. \"Well, let's see where you were assigned.\" She looks down her list until she finds your name. \"Ah, here we are.

He claims it's for her safety, though some suspect that he's trying to get some good favor with her. They also helped to keep the peace. But, of course, they also needed to be tended to occasionally. So, they stopped here at Atlantis, seeking out the massage parlor. It seems they got in while you were walking over. Lucy was already starting to lead you over to the public washroom, procured to accommodate clients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approached, and saw several lady Pegasi lying down on tables set up inside. The lot of them seemed more model-like than most of the lady Pegasi you knew, though you knew better than anyone not to underestimate them. The many Pegasi bore more pastel colors. One was pink, one was hot red, one was a sky blue... You saw about 4 of them in right now. They were all naked, predictably, though a few had hot towels draped on their backs. Still, that didn't stop you from seeing a few of their plump backsides, their tails hiked up. Despite you not being discrete in your entry, the ones that had their tails up still didn't seem to lower them. Instead, they looked over their shoulders at the new entrant, giving soft grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink Pegasus at the far right had a more sylphlike body, being fairly thin and also fairly curvy. The sky blue Pegasus beside her had an hourlgass shape to her, and wore purple lipstick. Next to that one was the hot red Pegasus, who was more pear-shaped, and bore a brown mane that seemed to drape over one side of her face seductively. And then there was the grass green Pegasus, who bore red lipstick and plump limps, while also having a backside comparable to Paula. The hot red one and the green one were the ones that had their tails hiked up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed and approached, feeling the urge to keep your thighs together, fearing their prying eyes will see something you know you don't want anyone to see. Now, you were one man, so you had to tend to them one at a time. Who though?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were already behind them as they lied down, so you approached the red one's sizable rear, and she seemed to take notice of that. She grinned and shifted a little, her butt wobbling a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for showing up, darling,\" she said. \"We heard good things about your technique! My poor rump's been awfully sore. Can you get on that?\" Oh dear, this old request. Then again, they were kind of... bigger than you were used to... Either way, you were in the thick of it now. You approached her backside and reached beside the table she was lying on. You pulled out a vial of massage oil and slathered it onto your hands. You stretched a little and cracked your knuckles, before approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cheeks lit up with embarrassment as your hands descended upon either cheek. And then you began squeezing. She lightly sighed and laid her hands on her arms, her tail lightly swishing. She seemed well behaved compared to the usual client. Often times someone got you to rub back here, that usually resulted in some squishing or you forced to smell some stink. Not helping matters was the fact that masseuses had to massage for either a specific amount of time or until the client says otherwise. Those that don't follow this rule get punished... Right now, the only annoying thing was the Sirens' tail lightly tickling your abdomen. Sure, it was pretty embarrassing to be touching someone like this, but things could be worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you didn't notice her legs lifting up ominously behind you. Suddenly, they snapped around your hips and you were yanked forwards. You let out an eep as you felt your hips beat against her booty... and your crotch rub in between her buttocks. For a moment, you lifted your hands up in the air, grasping at air as if trying to find something to grip onto. But all there was was tons of butt in front of you... tons of butt threatening to swallow up your most private of parts should you let it rise. You tried to step back, but you felt the Siren's thighs pull tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, dear, I'm not quite satisfied, yet~\" she said. Her thighs moved in such a way to rub your groin up against her backside, your little body squirming against her big butt. \"And I know you guys are supposed to satisfy your clients~ So please, continue.\" Nobody had done something like this to you before... You felt yourself threatening to plunge your organ into her, which caused your whole body to quiver. You wanted to step away, but right now you had a duty... Could you afford to keep rubbing? Or do you think you can whether any punishment?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You just need to force your body to ignore the erotic situation you've found yourself in. Unfortunately, you are betrayed as your cock begins to harden. It soon reaches full length and pokes the red pegasus in her rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my! It seems somebody likes his assignment.\" You hear her say from further up. \"I'm certainly flattered little man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush a shade of red deeper than her coat as you realize that she feels your erection poking her. You can only hope that she doesn't report you for this or you'll be facing whatever punishment the parlor manager has in store for something like this. Then again, she did say that she was flattered by your display, so maybe she'll like you enough to keep quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry ma'am. I didn't mean to do that. Just give me a little time to let that die down and I'll... off!\" You start before you are abruptly cut off ber her squeezing her thighs around you even tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now why would I want that? I already said I was flattered by your obvious sign of attraction. I want to feel more of it, use that as part of the massage. Do well and I might just introduce you to the other sirens. Please all of us and I can get you an audience with Aphrodite herself.\" She tells you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that would be a step up in the world, being called on by the goddess of love herself. You would be the most respected recruit in the academy. Taking her words to heart, you try to use your shaft to massage her rear as well, thrusting your hips to try and work with your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

You didn't know why, but Paula seemed to want you close to her for some reason, especially in weird situations like this... Lucy got up and began stepping deeper into the parlor, and you followed her. She led you deeper in, and stood next to the entry to one of the public washrooms. Well, these'd usually be public, but certain Pegasi like to pay extra to rent one of these out for themselves. Paula was one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped past Lucy, who waved you off as you went deeper into the washroom. In there, you gently stepped onto the tiled and wet floors, a gentle, warm steam having filled the room. You continued forwards, feeling a sort of haze wash over you as the steam blanketed around you. But you knew where the clients would usually lie down. You continued forwards, and saw a slightly risen part of tile, it shaped to resemble a knee-high table. You approached, the steam fairly thick in front of you. And soon, you saw her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying on the raised tile was Paula herself, four times your size. This parlor incentivized its clients to be nude, and nude she was. You could see her well defined muscles, looking thick enough to grind meat. These were contrasted by the graceful-looking wings sprouting from her shoulders, folded back, her soft white feathers looming over her back. You could see her breasts slightly squishing against the tile she rested upon, looking soft and pillow-y to you. Towards the rear of the tile was Paula's backside, strong legs, thick enough for squeezing, sprouted from a giant, thick butt, looking outright thicker than your torso. The only slight reprieve you had to the giant butt was the golden tail lightly covering it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon realized that you were just staring there, and quickly rushed to her side. As you got closer, you could see her soft face, strands of her thick mane draped over her, matted down with water. You weren't sure how effective her bath was, however, because even from here you could smell a few wafts of sweat. At your sudden burst of speed, Paula brought her head up and looked over at the source. She held a scowl, though you could swear you saw the corner of her mouth lift a little when she saw you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Punctual as usual,\" she noted. \"So glad to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean so glad to see your masseuse?\" you retorted. Paula shook her head and went back to lying down, softly sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All this training has gotten me tense,\" she said. \"The muscles've gotten all tense, y'know?\" You tried to hide the roll of your eyes. Being young, you didn't understand that you were the only Pegasus she trained, so you figured you'd have more reason to complain when it came to training. You were sure your poor butt could contest that. You approached and cracked your knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, where should we start?\" You saw Paula keep her limbs stretched out and spread, her various limbs trying to make room for your fingers. Her tail hiked up, and her wings stretched skyward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you mention it...\"</span></div></div>",

While there was never anything wrong with the massage itself, and the female soldiers would have really soft ones, more often than not, male or female, things went beyond a simple massage. Sometimes they would sit up and squash you, other times they would push you into the crack, on the rare occasion, they would flip over while your hand were placed just right so you ended up accidentally touching their private areas and making you rub there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place a hand on each cheek and begin to rub, eliciting coos and moans from Paula. \"That's as nice as ever Maxi. Don't be afraid to push hard.\" Taking her suggestion as a request,  you start to put your weight into your arms while you rub the giant cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Welcome to ancient Greece. This realm is known for housing all sorts of bizarre monstrosities. These realms house many animal-like creatures that're trying to go around and live their own lives, praising the Gods that gave them the land they walk on. Unfortunately, if you know Greek Mythology, you'll know the Gods are far from perfect. Terrifying monsters roam the land. Hungry monsters, smelly monsters... and worse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoseidon was responsible for a few of those monsters in his attempts to impress Aphrodite, so now he's created his own private forces to seek out those beasts and stop them as recompense for the monsters. Those elite are Pegasi, winged horses known for their physique and speed. You, however, are a very young Pegasus, meaning you aren't quite strong. Don't be mistaken, you are quite strong for your age, you're just not as strong as most of the elites. Much to your dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're growing, your trainer has you doing low risk oddjobs, typically humiliating or demeaning. A very common job for you is massaging the various elite. However, you can't help but feel the urge to really stretch your wings. You want to take up the armor or to grab one of their weapons and take charge, save some town and send some monster to Tartarus. Not stay here in Atlantis and tend to some smelly equines! But, will someone as small as you be able to defeat the powerful beasts your elite struggle with? Or will even some villager be able to knock you out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n1. Please keep all creatures animal-like. Even part animal part human creatures (like minotaurs or centaurs) should have the human part of them replaced with an animal.<br>\r\n2. Stenchplay, vore, and sex are encouraged. Blood, watersports/scat and detailed gore aren't, however.<br>\r\n3. Please maintain good grammar and good lengths to chapters you post.</td>",
