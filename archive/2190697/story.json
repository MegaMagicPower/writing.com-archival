You make your way to the house and crouch down to open the panel,it seems to be the average room you would see in a dollhouse except for one thing, there sleeping peacefully on the bed is your best friend Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This doesn't make any sense, how is she so small\" you go to reach for her to see if she is real but the voice commands you to stop and without any hesitation you do almost as if by force. \"Ill let you have your fun in a moment but first I need to tell you some rules. #1 These are actually the girls you know so and they have not been altered in anyway. #2 The girls are invincible but they can still feel the pain they normally would . #3 If you need something just ask. Now they wont wake up naturally so unless you or someone else wakes them up they will stay asleep, so when your ready go ahead and wake them up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the voice disappeared, \"he kept talking like there were more than one girl\" you think to your self, as you do that you notice four more panels. As you open them up you discover the sleeping bodies of four more girls, girls from your school. You recognize them all immediately, Emma, Sabrina, Molly, and Anna. You decide that it would be best to wake up Jessica first seeing as she knows you and trusts you. You wake her up by gently poking her on the back, she comes to and as she see's your massive figure she screams. It takes several minutes to calm her down and catch her up on whats happening, the two of you decide that Jessica will go around and wake everyone else up and at least try to inform them of their situation. After 10 minutes they are all standing outside the house on your carpet staring in awe as you kneel down in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What is your next choice</b>  </span></div></div>",

You smile and reach out your hand to grab her. As you wrap your hand around her tiny frame she lets out a terrified scream and begins to struggle. You squeeze your hand firmly just to get her to stop struggling. She is on the verge of tears when you tell her \"Jessica its me i'm not going to hurt you...it's okay.\" After she finally settles down you adjust your hand so that she can sit in the palm and begin to leave. But out of the corner of your eye you see Anna squirming around almost like she wants to come with, but she doesn't say anything so you leave to go find food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you head towards your kitchen Jessica asks about your parents and about her own. \"I actually don't know, I wonder how its going to go when they get home.\" Just as you say that the voice chimes in \"I have moved you, the girls and your house to a realm outside of space and time, so you don't have to worry about anyone else.\" As the voice says this you look out one of your windows and see an infinite white nothing, \"I guess he wasn't kidding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jessica go to the fridge and decide to have pancakes, after about 10 minutes of preparing and eating the two of you decide to head back to your room. when you get back to your room you open the door to see Emma screaming at crying Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What Do You Do Next?</b>  </span></div></div>",

How about I fuck you instead?\" With that, you start pulling on the nightgown that Emma is wearing. She starts really screaming, but can't resist you. Soon you've tugged it off, leaving her only in panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crosses her arms over her breasts, but even protected, you can tell they're big.

This affords you a great opportunity to check out her breasts. Even on her back, they keep their shape. They're large and firm and capped with pinkish red nipples made hard by the exposure to the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of attempts, you finally get a hold of the waistband of Emma's panties and are able to pull them down far enough to get a fingertip underneath them and tug them all the way off. Emma fights as much as she can, but she's unable to resist you completely stripping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you have her panties off,, you pin her legs and arms down so you can get a good look at her. Emma stops fighting and just puts her face to one side, eyes tightly closed. You and everybody else in school knew Emma was hot, especially by the way she looked in her cheerleader uniform. But seeing her right before you gives you a whole new appreciation for her hotness. Her breasts are simply fantastic, her stomach flat, her legs toned, and the tiny blonde strip between her legs proves she is a natural blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou admire her body for a few minutes before you finally decide to </span></div></div>",

Molly was a cheerleader as well and, though Emma's personality tended to put Molly in her shadow, Molly was just as attractive as Emma. And, from years of friendship, you knew Jessica was in fantastic shape as well (though you didn't have any 'hands on' knowledge, as Jessica had you firmly in the friend zone). Sabrina, though, was the class nerd. And Anna was one of those kids that nobody paid attention to.

She was shyer than normal, but you guess being shrunk to a tenth of her normal size probably was responsible for that. She tells you that her vision is fine without the glasses. So you decide that either being shrunk changed something about her eyes, or Sabrina is too scared to tell you the truth. Well, you'd get back to her later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing that you find weird and then arousing was that all the girls were wearing these white nightgowns that went to their ankles. Their was nothing inherently sex about the gowns. They weren't see through or anything. But when the girls stood up straight against the ruler, those nightgowns draped over the girls bodies, revealing big, firm breasts and tight bodies. This didn't surprise you as far as Emma or Molly were concerned. They were cheerleaders and although the uniforms they wore weren't too revealing, they did show you their body types. ANd you have been friends with Jessica long enough that you knew she had a fantastic body, even if she's always put you firmly in the friend zone. But Sabrina and Anna were complete surprises. Nobody ever thought of them as hotties. Sabrina didn't even qualify as hot nerdy Asian hottie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suspect that if people knew the kind of body Sabrina and Anna had been hiding in their oversized drab clothes, they would have definitely changed their views on those two young women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you had everyone measured, you got them to check out their house. They had food, silverware, plates, glasses electricity and running water, but no change of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch them running around, and decide that maybe you should take a closer look at them.
