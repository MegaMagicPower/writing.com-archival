The Doctor was pottering around as usual, fiddling with things and hmming and hawing. Barbera was off with Susan talking about something or other. They were supposed to be going home as usual, but it was anyone's guess where they'd end up. Ian was a little glad to away from Susan after her recent idea of 'a fun game'. Barbara seemed as collected as ever but then she hadn't 'won'! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chesterton!\" Ian's reverie was broken by the familiar sound of an agitated old man. \"Look at this! Quite remarkable! Hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ian looked at a small screen in a bank of equipment at a lot of squiggles which he couldn't understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm sorry Doctor; it's all greek to me!\" he admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"My dear boy! Look! This is a reading for Earth! Twentieth century! I do believe you are going home! Eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ian stared at the screen. He's heard this before, but not with any evidence, even if he couldn't make head nor tail of the evdence. Was this it? Were he and Barbara finally going home?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In a space between times a blue box fell endlessly and at it's destination a short angry Canadian huffed on a cigar and said \"I never liked you, and you you just over the line, bub. Say hello to the real me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Snikt*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRazor sharp claws burst out of the man's hands as outside an antiquated blue policebox materialised...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Fourth Doctor was making a lonely trip back from Gallifrey, when an unusual spike in tachyonic radiation was detected by the TARDIS scanners. \"Well, this looks like an adventure, a wormhole is opening.\" As he wraps his scarf around his neck preparing to investigate, a sudden jerk takes hold of the TARDIS. \"What, some kind of tractor beam?\" he scoffed. The TARDIS was drawn to the opening of the wormhole, as if a powerful electromagnetic force was pulling it in. In the control room, many of the systems of the TARDIS begin to fail while the Doctor feverishly tries to recalibrate the dematerialization field. Then, it is as if nothing happened. The Doctor looks around puzzled as to what had just happened. \"This is quite unusual, all systems are normal and appears that we've went through the wormhole old girl.\" A knocking on the TARDIS doors, grabs the Doctor's attention. He quickly glances over the TARDIS computers. \"A visit from the depths of space? This keeps getting exciting! Oxygen levels, Earth-like. Gravity, slightly on the Heavy side. And...multiple lifeforms outside, but inside a ship?\" The Doctor opens the door and finds that he is surrounded by numerous armed guards. \"WELCOME DOC!!!!!\" screamed a hideous flab of yellow skin. The monster walks up to the front of the crowd on a robotic spider-like platform. \"YOU have no idea how Popular you are here in Mojoworld! and I'm Mojo, writer, producer, and DI-rector!!!!\" The Doctor was at a loss, but regain his composure, \"This is a party for me, oh you shouldn't have but unfortunately I'm need to investigate a disturbance. Sorry got to go.\" The the TARDIS doors slam shut right in front of the Doctor as he tried to enter. \"OH DOC baby, YOU'RE NOT GOING Anywhere..GUARDS take Mister DOCTOR to his Dressing ROOM at ONCE!!!!!!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the X-Men where under going training in the Danger Room, when Professor Xavier called them. \"Attention all available X-Men, this is Professor X, I need you all to come to my office at once. It is of great importance.\" sounded the PA. Cyclops, Jean Grey, Storm, Beast and Wolverine where in the Professor's office within a flash. \"Yes Professor?\" asked Cyclops. \"X-Men, we have received a message from Lilandra of the Shi'ar Empire. She needs our assistance in an investigation and relief mission. Apparently an unknown discharge of energy has caused a disaster on one of their colonies.\" Beast jumped up on to the ceiling, \"Professor, will she send transport, I'm afraid the Blackbird is unable to travel faster than light?\" The Professor nodded, \"Yes, a star cruiser will come and pick us up in about an hour.\" \"No fight, darn. Well I'm ready to go.\" said Wolverine sarcastically. <br>\r\nJean walked up to the Professor, \"Sir, should we call in the rest of the Team?\" Professor answered,\"I believe we can manage without Rouge, Gambit, and Jubilee.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few hours, the X-Men and Professor X find themselves on Alstar 3, a mining colony orbiting a gas giant. \"Charles, it is good to see you and your X-Men again.\" Said Empress Lilandra. \"What was the cause of this disaster? Solar wind?\" asked Beast. \"According to the scanners and the royal scientists, it appears that a blast of tachyons hit the moon. Without an atmosphere, the tachyons were not absorbed thus resulting in a backlash of tachyonic radiation.\" commented Lilandra. \"Tachyons, aren't the type of particles that travel faster than light?\" asked Cyclops. \"Yes, and usually they normally don't do this unless...unless a wormhole has opened from another dimension\" Beast said with caution. \"Ok then, where's Capt'n Kirk?\" Wolverine remarked, \"cuz I think we have company.\" A flash of energy appeared, and out of the portal stumbled out the Doctor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Mojo appeared, \"LET THE GAMES BEGIN!!!!!! STARRING THE UNCANNY X-MEN AND IN HIS FIRST APPEARANCE, THE DOCTOR!!!!!!!!! Here on sunny Alstar 3, with a dimensional barrier to keep out those pesky Imperial Guard of the Shi'Ar. They must play to save the mining crew and EMPRESS LILANDRA, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Choose your side wisely DOC!\" </span></div></div>",

When Jean arrived a few days later, she disconfirmed Moira's theory that the energy readings she had taken were made by psychic energy. It wasn't difficult to scan for the energy, but it was proving almost impossible to identify. Over the next few days, Kurt and the three girls began to relax and, on the rare days of sunshine in the autumn, they were out enjoying themselves on the beach.  </span></div></div>",

Jean tried to stagger to her feet, her mind fighting back against the telepathic attack the Ood were using on her.

The silver arrow, now held in her hand, lengthened, becoming a spear. The fiery red bird shrunk, turning into Jean, but still with a fiery aura around her, and two fiery scimitars in her hands. They stared at each other for a moment, then, both of them charged. The diamond spear expanded, as the white-clad woman swept it towards Jean, who parried it with one scimitar, pushing it to the side as she swept the air in front of her, sending a wave of fire towards what Jenny assumed was Emma Frost. In awe at the battle, Jenny looked for an opening to get past the two combatants, and make her way towards wherever Emma Frost's mind was.   </span></div></div>",

He was wearing a long, brown coat, trousers, a shirt and trainers. \"Name's Bishop\" he said \"I was infiltrating a sentinel base, when I walked into this room, I travel in time to try and stop this future from happening\"  \"Someone's meddling with time?\" said the man \"That's bad\" \"Sorry, but you haven't told me your name\" said Bishop. \"Oh, sorry\" said the man \"I'm the Doctor\" \"Doctor Who?\" Bishop asked. \"Just the Doctor\" he said. \"I'm Rose\" said the woman.

The girl kicked one of the aliens backwards, wresting the gun from him and regrouping with the other four soldiers.<br>\r\n\"We have to blow the tunnel,\" said the lead soldier, indicating a detonator on the wall.<br>\r\nThe girl ran to it, pressing a button and then running down the corridor. You put your head down, as the explosion rocked the tunnel, sending an avalanche of rock down between them and Martha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor stood, looking at the rock wall. \"You've sealed off the tunnel,\" then, turning to the girl \"Why did you do that!\"<br>\r\n\"They were trying to kill us,\" said the girl<br>\r\n\"But they've got my friend,\" he said<br>\r\n\"She's collateral, he lost both his men. I'd say you've come out ahead,\" said the girl<br>\r\n\"Her name's Martha,\" said Donna \"And she's not collateral damage, not to anyone. Have you got that, GI Jane?\"<br>\r\n\"You're going nowhere,\" said the sergeant \"You don't make sense, you three. No guns, no marks, no fight left in you. I'm taking you to General Cobb. Now move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked, you talked with the woman <br>\r\n\"Do you have a name?\" you asked <br>\r\n\"Haven't had one assigned yet,\" she replied<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you know, then?\" asked Donna. You looked back at her. You admired her to-the-point attitude sometimes, but at others, her bluntness could come off as rudeness.<br>\r\nThe girl didn't seem to notice \"How to fight.\" <br>\r\n\"Nothing else?\" asked Donna<br>\r\n\"The machine must embed military history and tactics, but no name. She's a generated anomaly,\" said the Doctor. <br>\r\n\"That's so sad,\" you said, looking at the nameless woman. Mutants had it bad, but to be brought into existence without even a name to call yourself? You couldn't decide if that was better or worse than the situation for mutants.<br>\r\n\"Generated anomaly,\" Donna said thoughtfully \"\"Generated\" Well how about that? Jenny?\" <br>\r\n\"Jenny? I like that, Jenny,\" said the newly-christened Jenny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the tunnels opened out into a large open space reminding you of a theatre at home, but with similar chambers to the one Jenny had come out of lining the walls.<br>\r\n\"So where are we? What planet is this?\" asked the Doctor <br>\r\n\"Messaline,\" said the leader \"What's left of it, anyway. Wait here.\" <br>\r\nThe leader leaves, and returns with an older man. <br>\r\n\"General Cobb, I presume,\" said the Doctor<br>\r\n\"Found in the western tunnels, I'm told,\" said Cobb \"With no marks. There was an outbreak of pacifism in the eastern zone before we lost contact.\" <br>\r\n\"That's where we came from,\" you said \"My name is (your name), this is the Doctor, Donna and Jenny.\"<br>\r\nJenny smiled at you, as you included her in your introductions.<br>\r\n\"Don't think you can infect us with your peace-making,\" said Cobb \"We are at war.\" <br>\r\n\"Yes, I noticed,\" said the Doctor \"With the Hath. But tell us, because we've been out of circulation, eastern zone and all that, so who exactly are the Hath?\" <br>\r\n\"At the dawn of this planet, these ancient halls were carved from the earth. Our ancestors dreamed of a new beginning,\" Cobb had a vacant look in his eyes, as if he was imagining what he was speaking of \"A colony of human and Hath, living and working together.\" <br>\r\nYou couldn't help but draw parallels to your own experiences in Xavier's School for the Gifted, a school with a similar philosophy to this man's ancestors. <br>\r\n\"What happened?\" asked the Doctor<br>\r\nCobb's eyes darkened \"The dream died. Broken, along with Hath promises. They wanted it all for themselves. But those early pioneers, they fought back. They used the machines to produce soldiers instead of colonists, and began battle for our survival.\" <br>\r\n\"There's nothing but earth outside, why's that? Why build everything underground? The surface is too dangerous,\" Cobb replied, not elaborating further. <br>\r\n\"Then why build windows in the first place?\" asked the Doctor \"And what's this mean?\" he indicated symbols on the wall. <br>\r\n\"The rites and symbols of our ancestors,\" said Cobb \"Their meanings lost in time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobb leads the group over to a machine powering it up to show a holographic map of tunnels. <br>\r\n \"Does this show the entire city, including the Hath zones?\" asked the Doctor <br>\r\n \"Yes. Why?\" asked Cobb <br>\r\n \"Well, it'll help us find Martha,\" said the Doctor <br>\r\n \"We've more important things to do,\" said the leader of the soldiers that had brought them there \"The progenation machines are powered down for the night shift, but soon as they're active, we could breed a whole platoon from you two.\" <br>\r\n\"Hold on, I'm only 17,\" you say \"I'm way too young to have kids.\"<br>\r\n \"I'm not having sons and daughters by some great big flipping machine,\" said Donna \"Sorry, no offence, but you're not. Well, I mean, you're not real.\" <br>\r\nThat was Donna. Honest, but sometimes too honest.  <br>\r\n \"You're no better than him,\" said Jenny, sounding offended \"I have a body, I have a mind, I have independent thought. How am I not real? What makes you better than me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well said, soldier,\" said Cobb \"We need more like you, if ever we're to find the Source.\" <br>\r\n \"Ooo, the Source,\" said the Doctor \"What's that, then? What's a Source? I like a Source. What is it?\" <br>\r\n \"The Breath of Life.\" <br>\r\n \"And that would be?\" <br>\r\n \"In the beginning, the great one breathed life into the universe,\" it was the squadron leader that answered \"And then she looked at what she'd done, and she sighed.\" <br>\r\n \"She. I like that,\" said Jenny <br>\r\n \"Right. So it's a creation myth,\" said the Doctor <br>\r\n \"It's not myth,\" said Cobb \"It's real. That sigh. From the beginning of time it was caught and kept as the Source. It was lost when the war started. But it's here, somewhere. Whoever holds the Source controls the destiny of the planet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

As he did, more tunnels appeared on the map. <br>\r\n\"It looks like there was information here someone didn't want you to find,\" you said, looking at Cobb.<br>\r\n\"That must be the lost temple,\" said Cobb, what sounded like triumph in his voice \"And look, we're closer than the Hath. It's ours, and you've shown us the way.\" <br>\r\nCobb immediately started rallying the men to get ready to move. <br>\r\n\"Once we reach the temple, peace will be restored at last,\" said Cobb<br>\r\n\"Sorry, call me old-fashioned, but if you wanted to restore peace, couldn't you just stop fighting?\" asked the Doctor<br>\r\n\"Only when we have the source,\" said Cobb \"It'll give us the power to erase every stinking Hath from the face of this planet.\" <br>\r\n\"Are you being serious?\" you asked, looking at Cobb with an appalled look \"You can't just exterminate an entire species.\" <br>\r\n\"A second ago you were talking about peace in our time, now you're talking about genocide,\" said the Doctor. He looked more angry than you had ever seen him.<br>\r\n\"For us, that means the same thing,\" said Cobb<br>\r\n\"You've lost your way,\" you said \"You need to stop now, or I'm going to stop you.\" <br>\r\nThe Doctor didn't seem to hear you \"Well, you have to get yourself a better dictionary, when you do, look up genocide, and you'll see a little picture of me there, and the caption will read 'over my dead body.'\"<br>\r\n\"And you're the one who showed us the path to victory,\" said Cobb \"Take them, lock them up so they won't spread treason. And Doctor, if you try to stop use, I'll see that your woman dies first.\"<br>\r\n\"No, we're not a couple,\" said the Doctor, as the soldiers fell in around them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about her,\" said the leader, gesturing at Jenny<br>\r\n \"She's from pacifist stock, we can't trust her,\" said Cobb \"Lock them all up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldiers bring the four of them to a cell. Another number was above the door. <br>\r\n\"More numbers,\" said Donna \"They've got to mean something.\" <br>\r\n \"Makes as much sense as the Breath of Life story,\" said the Doctor <br>\r\n \"You mean that's not true?\" asked Jenny <br>\r\n \"It's not true,\" you said \"Generally legends tend to have some basis in fact, though.\" <br>\r\n\"Cobb might actually be able to do what he said he could,\" said the Doctor \"He might not, but we can't take that chance.\" <br>\r\n\"I can get us out of here,\" you said \"As well as incapacitate the guard at the same time, but I need you to trust me.\" <br>\r\n\"And go where?\" asked the Doctor \"We need to find out where Martha is first, then stop Cobb from slaughtering the Hath.\" He looked at Jenny, who was staring at him \"What are you staring at?\"   <br>\r\n\"You keep insisting you're not a soldier,\" she said \"But look at you, drawing up strategies like a proper general.\" <br>\r\n \"No, no,\" said the Doctor \"I'm trying to stop the fighting.\" <br>\r\n \"Isn't every soldier?\" asked Jenny <br>\r\n \"Well, I suppose, but that's...that's... Technically... I haven't got time for this,\" stuttered the Doctor \"Donna, give me your phone. Time for an upgrade.\" He pulled out his sonic screwdriver. <br>\r\n \"And now you've got a weapon,\" said Jenny <br>\r\n \"It's more like a tool than a weapon,\" you chimed in <br>\r\n \"But you're using it to fight back,\" Jenny smiled \"I'm going to learn so much from you. You are such a soldier.\" <br>\r\n \"Donna, will you tell her?\" said the Doctor, as he took the back off Donna's phone, and used his screwdriver on it. <br>\r\n Donna laughed. \"Oh, you are speechless. I'm loving this. You keep on, Jenny.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You hadn't known Martha very long, but knew that she had given up travelling with the doctor to live her own life outside of the TARDIS. It was the balance that needed to be struck between travelling with the Doctor, and having a life. Martha had given it up because it was too much for her, while Donna seemed to be travelling towards wanting to travel with the Doctor forever. For you, you didn't see either as the best option. You knew it would hurt the Doctor to see his companions grow older, only to die, with him not ageing a day. At the same time, going back to a normal life after everything you had seen while travelling with the Doctor wasn't a good idea either. Knowing it was all out there, and knowing that you couldn't ever travel there again. Like an old Japanese tale you'd heard once, of a spirit called Kue Kuatsu, who came to the real world to pick flowers for the moon, not knowing that once you leave the spirit world, you can never go back. The Doctor was like the moon, in a sense, always moving onwards, never looking back for long, never resting. Always on to the next thing. Martha wasn't the first person to have left the TARDIS crew, and she wouldn't be the last. <br>\r\n\"Where are you?\" asked the Doctor<br>\r\n\"I'm in the Hath camp. I'm okay, but something's going on,\" said Martha, who was surprisingly calm considering the situation. Another indicator of a seasoned TARDIS traveller \"The Hath are all marching off to some place that's appeared on this map thing.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, that was me,\" said the Doctor \"With both armies heading there, it's going to be a bloodbath.\" <br>\r\n\"What do you want me to do?\" asked Martha <br>\r\n\"Just stay where you are,\" said the Doctor, sternly \"If you're safe there, don't move, you hear?\" <br>\r\n\"But I can help,\" said Martha. There was silence for a second, then a dial tone. <br>\r\n\"Honestly, Doctor,\" you said \"Did you really expect her to just sit tight? When you take us onto the TARDIS, we might be ordinary people, but over the course of our adventures with you, we can't help it. We become heroes. And heroes don't sit tight while there's something they could do to save a few more lives.\" <br>\r\nYou were cut off, as they heard General Cobb speaking \"The doors that were closed will be open to us now. The door to the Temple, to the Source, and to victory!\"<br>\r\nCheers followed this. <br>\r\n\"Come the dawn cycle, we march,\" Cobb finished. <br>\r\n\"To war,\" shouted several soldiers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're getting ready to move out,\" said the Doctor \"We have to get past that guard.\" <br>\r\n\"I can help,\" said Jenny, before you could open your mouth. <br>\r\n\"No, no, no, no, you're not going anywhere,\" said the Doctor<br>\r\n\"What?\" asked Jenny, confusion and hurt in her voice. <br>\r\n\"You belong here, with them,\" said the Doctor. <br>\r\n\"I don't agree, Doctor,\" you said \"You look at her, and you only see the soldier, the weapon, one of Cobb's fanatics. I look at the same person, and I see the child that's seen too much. She doesn't know who she should follow, yet she was bred to follow orders. She's making an effort here, to be on your side, Doctor, and you need to listen, instead of closing your mind off to it.\"<br>\r\n\"Have you got that stethoscope?\" asked Donna, of the Doctor \"Give it here.\" <br>\r\nDonna took the stethoscope, and placed it in two places on Jenny's chest. <br>\r\n\"Now, you listen, and tell me where she belongs,\" said Donna. The Doctor did. Jenny looked very confused. <br>\r\n\"Two hearts,\" said the Doctor, and your eyes widened. <br>\r\n\"Does that mean she's... what do you call a female Time Lord?\" asked Donna<br>\r\n\"What's a Time Lord?\" asked Jenny<br>\r\n\"It's who I am, it's where I'm from,\" said the Doctor<br>\r\n\"And I'm from you,\" stated Jenny<br>\r\n \"You're an echo, that's all. A Time Lord is so much more,\" said the Doctor. There was fire in his eyes, but it was like the last embers before the fire went out \"A sum of knowledge, a code, a shared history, a shared suffering. Only it's gone now, all of it. Gone forever.\" <br>\r\n\"What happened?\" you found yourself asking <br>\r\n\"There was a war,\" said the Doctor, still addressing his words to Jenny, but shifting to include you, too. <br>\r\n\"Like this one?\" asked Jenny <br>\r\n\"Bigger. Much bigger.\" <br>\r\n\"And you fought, and killed?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes.\" <br>\r\n\"Then how are we different?\" asked Jenny<br>\r\n\"Look,\" you said \"I get you two are kind of having a moment here, but if we want to stop the fighting, I reckon we should get to it. I suggest you cover your ears.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to the cell doors, and screamed. </span></div></div>",

For once, Donna Noble was  speechless. <br>\r\n\"Look, I'll explain later,\" you said \"We've got more pressing concerns, like who heard that scream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor led the way, until they came to the bottom of a staircase with another number on a wall near it. Down another corridor, two soldiers stood guard. <br>\r\n\"I've got this one,\" Donna said, quietly \"I have picked up a few womanly wiles over the years.\" <br>\r\nYou had to put your fist in your mouth to stop from laughing out loud, as the Doctor put his hand on Donna's shoulder. He produced a clockwork mouse from his jacket, using that to distract the guards, so they could get past. However, while they were distracted, Jenny knocked them out. <br>\r\n\"I was trying to distract them, not clobber them!\" said an exasperated Doctor <br>\r\n\"Well, it worked, didn't it?\" said Jenny<br>\r\nYou searched the guards body, and brought up a holographic representation of the map the Doctor had made appear.<br>\r\n\"We'd better hurry,\" you say \"If they've uploaded the map, they must already be on their way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of them moved down corridors, The Doctor navigating. You took the opportunity to talk to Jenny out of earshot of the Doctor and Donna.<br>\r\n\"How are you doing?\" you asked Jenny, as they continued to walk.<br>\r\n\"I'm in peak physical and mental condition, thank you very much,\" said Jenny<br>\r\n\"No, not the soldier, how are you feeling about your situation,\" you say \"You've barely existed for a day, and that involved meeting the Doctor, something that would cause stress to a normal person. I just wanted to know if you're doing all right.\" <br>\r\nJenny was silent for a few moments \"I honestly don't know if I'm doing all right,\" she said \"All I was ever meant to know was that I was a soldier, meant to follow orders. Now, I've just found out that my dad and me are the last members of an alien race, and that he travels the universe. What you really want to know, is, if I'm going to turn on you later, and I can say I certainly will not. Whatever I was when I came out of that machine, I'm different now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor stopped halfway along a wall. Above it, was another number. <br>\r\n\"There's a hidden tunnel here,\" said the Doctor \"We might be able to use it to get there before Cobb.\" <br>\r\n\"There's another number,\" said Donna They're everywhere.\" <br>\r\n\"The original builders must have left them,\" said the Doctor \"Some kind of cataloguing system.\" <br>\r\n\"You got a pen? Bit paper?\" asked Donna \"Because, do you see, these numbers are counting down. This one ends in 4. The prison cell ended in 6.\" <br>\r\n\"Always thinking, both of you,\" said Jenny \"Who are you people?\" <br>\r\n \"I told you,\" said the Doctor \"I'm the Doctor.\"<br>\r\n\"The Doctor?\" said Jenny \"That's it?\" <br>\r\n \"That's all he ever says,\" said Donna<br>\r\n\"So you don't have a name either,\" said Jenny \"Are you an anomaly too?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh come off it,\" said Donna \"You're the most anomalous bloke I've ever met.\" <br>\r\nThe control panel pops off, revealing all sorts of sci-fi like circuitry. <br>\r\n\"Ah, here we go!\" said the Doctor, in a totally-not-obvious attempt to excuse himself from talking to Jenny<br>\r\n\"And Time Lords, what are they for, exactly?\" asked Jenny<br>\r\n\"For?\" asked the Doctor. The question seemed to surprise him \"They're not for anything.\" <br>\r\n\"So what do you do?\" asked Jenny<br>\r\n\"I travel through time and space,\" said the Doctor <br>\r\n\"Honestly, you make it sound so boring when you say it like that,\" you say<br>\r\n\"He saves planets, rescues civilisations, defeats terrible creatures,\" began Donna \"And runs a lot. Seriously, there's an outrageous amount of running involved.\"<br>\r\nThe door opens, just as they heard Cobb's voice behind them. <br>\r\n\"We should run,\" you said, as the four of you took off through the door, you hit an active panel on the other side, slamming the door shut. </span></div></div>",

(you) was one of my best students, but he left to explore the world.<br>\r\nDoctor: he explored more than that<br>\r\nX: oh, interesting. I would love to hear about it but it is a bit chilly out here, why don\u2019t we all go into my study?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The mirrors folded in, the back wheels got larger and a roof came over the top. Before long, there was a jeep standing there. <br>\r\n\"The latest in camouflage technology, there are machine guns built into the doors and the exhaust has spikes in it,\" Q continued \"This car is the only gadget I'm allowed to give you, 007, you've lost so much MI6 equipment, we can't afford to give you more, i'd ask you to bring this back in one piece, but I know you won't listen.\" <br>\r\nBond smiled. \"Good bye Q,\" <br>\r\nJames Bond walked out of the gadget room of MI6 headquarters. As soon as the doors closed behind him, Q walked to a book case at the back of the room and pulled out a book. The moment he did, the book case dissolved. As he walked through, it reformed behind him. A bank of computers sat in the middle of the bright room he stood in. These computers were well in advance of anything found in the Multiverse. But these computers were necessary to fly his ship between the realities. They would also pick up on any anomalies that disrupted the other realities, such as other Qs causing mischief. <br>\r\nQ frowned. One of the computers, showing the Marvelverse, had a small blip in it. It could have been nothing, but it was a disturbance in the time line, and he was sure it was by a Q. What were they thinking, the Q thought, their tinkering with time would draw the Time Lords into it. It was probably nothing to worry about, Q decided, most of the Time Lords were dead, save one. The Doctor. This every Q knew. Suddenly, Q saw the reason one of his kin had tampered with time. They wanted to draw the Last of the Time Lords in to destroy them. As much as the Q did not get involved with the Time Lords, this particular Q could not let one of his race commit genocide by killing the Doctor. The former MI6 Q set in the calculations for the jump from the Bondverse to the Marvelverse, then his Quantum Analysis Generally Gallivanting Apparition (Qagga) started to glow, and he sat down in a seat next to the computer bank, and waited patiently for the Qagga to land. </span></div></div>",

He wanted to create as much mischief as possible in the universe, and he knew that the best way to do that was through simple natural selection. All beings feared what they do not understand, and the Human Race were no different. The Q Lord made plans. He buried a device on the home planet of the Celestials, a race of powerful beings. When they found the device, they would run tests on it to see what it was, but these tests would take place on test subjects all over the universe. The by product of all this was that mutants were created, and they were immediately shunned by the populations of the planets they were created on. The Mischievous Q laughed with glee as he watched the course of time change. Normally, this type of time altering would have sparked a confrontation with the Time Lords, but, as the Q knew, the Time Lords were extinct. They were wiped out in the last Great Time War.
