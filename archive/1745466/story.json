You two are best friends.

It takes a while to convince them of what's happening but in the end they decide if you were making it up to get away with something you'd come up with something more believable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlanked by the bodyguards, You, Janet and the Queen leave the office and climb into a waiting limousine. The first stop is Janet's house, where she quickly gathers some clothes for the trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext the limo takes you home. Your mother is waiting there. Clearly she has been informed of what is happening and has started packing for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you coming too Mom.\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't just leave my job and I'd need to sell the house.\" She says. \"It's complicated.\"</span></div></div>",

You both burst out laughing at how ridiculous the other looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are both helped into the dresses chosen for you. Yours is a pastel blue and a very juvenile style, with athick ribbon tied in a bow at the back. Janet's is similar but pink. You smile, knowing that Janet hates pink. Finally, the outfits are completed with shiny black flat shoes, just as immature as the dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow all dressed, you are led back out to the queen.

You are saddened to find that your diaper is soaked. When you hop out of bed someone enters your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susan\" a familiar fmvoice scolds. \"Your diaper is soaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around and are shocked to find our mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!!?\" You exclaim in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this any way for a 12 year old to act!?\" Your mom questions you. \"Now come on, you have to get ready for your first day of middle school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What are you talking abo...\" You start when you quickly realize something's wrong. Your voice sounds much more juvinile. As you clamp your mouth shut, you realize that your breast are gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can scream, your mother grabs you by the arms and lays you on a changing mate. You are to freaked out to fight it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you are changed into training painties, your mother hands you a lunch box with pictures of princesses and leads you outside the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I don't wan't any more accidents from you.\" Your mother yells at you while you slowly walk to your bus stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo confused to question anything, You walk over to the bus stop. After a few minutes, Your bus arrives. When you enter it, You notice that there are no seats left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to the driver and say \"I don't see any empty seats.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus driver stands up and kindly says \" There's one back there\" as she grabs your hand and leads you to the furthest back seat as if you were a toddler. When you ari e to your spot, you are shocked to find a booster seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"there it is\" the bus driver says as she lifts you into the seat and straps you in. Luckily you are next to Janet. She seems a lot smaller than the last time you remember seeing her but at the same time seems to be about your height. She only seems interested about talking annoying her hair so you keepto yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel ridiculous siting in the booster seat and begin to sniffle. To calm yourself down you begin to suck your thumb. Once the bus arrives, the driver unbuckled you and leads you to the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk with Janet who seems a good 7 inches taller than you. When you both pass a group of boys she giggles while you stick out your tounge at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you enter the school. It seems very scary and there are lots of big kids. You feel glad that you remember to bring your favorite Teddy bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you find a locker with your name on it. Of course it was the only one with one, because the school was afraid that a small child would forget her combination. You open the locker and grab whatever you think you need for math. You grab some crayons, a folder with a Disney princess on it, a few bottles of glitter, and some stickers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou skip to you class and arrive a few minutes early. You see a few big girls who say how cute you look. This make you giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Janet arrives, She gives youva hug and says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Suzie, You've gotten so big. You're only a little more then a foot shorter than me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hug her more tightly until she instructs you to let go. You skip over to your desk and struggle to climb on it. Once you do you take out your reddy bear and snuggle it. While the teacher talks, you pour some glitter on your bear. The teacher eventually hands out a piece of paper that says some weird word (test). It gas some bubbles on it so you decide to fill them all in. Once you do, you play connect the dots untill you make a pony. To pass the time afterwards, You rest your head on the desk and suck your thumb. Eventually the teacher collects the tests and grades them. Soon she reads out the student's scores. Eventually when she gets to your name she says 0. You don't know what that means, but the other kids start laughing at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she should go back to preschool.\" one kid says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis makes you mad which causes you to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just a big doo doo face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only makes the others laugh louder. You begin to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Janet walks up to you and picks you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Suzie is a little cranky today.\" Janet says to the class ass you picks you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce both of you are outside, Janet starts to rock you while signing softly. Eventually Janet gives you some apple juice and and a binkey to suck on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Janet puts you down and brings you inside the class. You have a hard time walking so Janet bends down and grabs you by the hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class, You call over to Janet and say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Up, Up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okey.\" she replies <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the 3 3 year old you were, she easily lifted you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet carried you to your next class which was nap time. As you both enter, the teacher hands you a blankey. You clwaddle over to your cot and lay down. A couple minutes latter you feel the need to use the potty. You get up and walk to the little girls room. Inside was a training potty. You sit on it and wait for a few minutes. After that you figure it had been long enough even though you still hadn't gone. After a good rest you get up and feel the need to really go. You jump out of the cot and run over to the potty but another boy is already starting to enter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna go\" you cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the boy just shoves you and says, \"I was here first\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to cry and scream \"NO NO NO\" while stomping your foot. While you throw your tantrum, a wet spot starts forms on your skirt and around your feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet walks over to you and says \"Janet, did you have and accident?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to throw you tantrum as you scream,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm a big girl!!!\" *****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly wake up. It was all just a nightmare... Well, at least most of it was. You are disappointed to find that your diaper is wet. it's a good thing you were wearing a diaper. You climb out of the bed and yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's the last day before you start school in Calonia.

Come on let's go!\" The Queen calls back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately the school has uniforms. It would have been nice of the Queen has told you earlier but that's not the end of it. The uniforms are very hard to get on and off. The girl uniform is just a one piece shirt and skirt combination. The shirt is pink with yellow flowers on it. While it's elegant, it looks like it was designed for toddlers. The skirt is also pink with a baby blue ribbon. It's also very  frilly. The length is pretty dissapointing and doesn't do much for covering up your diaper. You understand that skirts make diaper changes easier, but the colors and overall babyish look of them are what really tick you off. The worst part though is that there is a zipper on the back of the uniform. This makes it impossible to take it on and off without help. Almost like a wedding dress. You can only guess that this is done to make sure that kids behave and use their diapers. Speaking off diapers, the school requires that all students must be put into extra bulky diapers in order to prevent leakage and so that the teachers won't have to clean up after every little pee pee accident.  The diapers are several inches thick and make it a chore to walk. Your legs are spread really far apart which makes waddling almost impossible to avoid.   Once you are finally able to get yourself situated inside of your uniform, you call for one of the maids to help you with your zipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the maid help you with your zipper, the Queen finds you and starts to go over what you need for school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you remember to pack up your book Susan? How about your Crayons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Queen.\" You tell the Queen. \"I've already packed up everything you asked for.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, here's your lunch.\" The Queen says as she hands you a lunch box. \"Oh and here.\" The Queen takes out a blue ribbon from her pockets and ties it into your hair. \"The bus should be here soon Susan. Hurry up or you'll be late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen practically pushes you out of the door. Once outside, the Queen grabs you by the hand and walks you to your bus stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what about Janet?\" You ask the Queen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We decided that it would be best to homeschool her until she is, um...better adjusted to our traditions.\" The queen tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you arrive at the bus stop, the Queen finally let's go of your hand. After a minute of waiting with her, the Queen says something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susan, the bus should just be a few blockes away. I have a meeting to attend to so I won't be able to see you off. Have a great first day of school honey.\" The Queen gives you a hug and walks back to the palace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see the bus now. It's a very bright shade of yellow and has pictures of teddy bears or something on it. You're beggining to have second thought about this. It's never to late to ditch school you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This has got to be the most embarrassing bus you've ever rode in.  The conversations the other kids on the bus you can hear are both childish and really boring.  There is no talk of gossip, of fashion, or even of cute boys.  It's just dumb stuff like, \"Look what my mom packed me for lunch.\" or \"Do you want to play at my house after school?\".  None of these kids are mature in the slightest. Eventually the bus stops at the school.  You look out the window and see...</span></div></div>",

You blush at the sight of some boys bear legs a realize they are one un-taping away from being naked. They're dealing with this too. You aren't alone. This thought gives you some joy, realizing that no one is going to make fun of you. You at least have that to look forward to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull out a slip of paper from your backpack that tells you where your homeroom is. You make your way around the school until you find your class. You peak inside and am glad to see that the room isn't that different than your old school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher, a friendly looking woman who you guess to be in her thirties, smiles and waves at you. \"Hello. You must be my new student.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrink back as the whole class looks at you. The teacher walks over and gently pulls you in. \"Don't be shy. now. Class, this is Susan. I'm sure you all know about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's the new princess!\" one student said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw it on the news,\" added another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are surprised and embarrassed. They all saw you at t.v. while you wet yourself. On the other hand, they apparently watch the news. That's a bit more mature than some of your friends back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, Susan is out country's princess. She's also new to our customs, so be nice to her as she is still learning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne girl raised her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mary?\" the teacher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I ask Susan a question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher turns to you. \"Susan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it true they don't make you wear diapers where you're from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. \"Yes. They actually make you stop when you're two or three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students eyes widen. The girl that asked you said, \"They make you? as in they force you to stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink. \"They don't make you stop here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher shakes her head. \"Nope. In fact, some people never stop wearing them.\" She blushes. \"But enough chit chat. It's time to get started with class. Your seat is in the second row.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waddle over to it and sort of zone out as you process this new information. Some of the people don't even stop wearing diapers? This place is so weird. But as you sit on the soft padding, you realize that this situation isn't nearly as bad as you thought. You still wish you weren't wearing a diaper, but it's not that bad if everyone else is doing it. Besides that, you are a princess and eventual queen. Having to wear diapers isn't such a terrible trade off for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour of pretty normal school dealings, you suddenly wet your diaper. No warning, no feelings of pressure. You just go and fill your diaper. You stifle a gasp. How could this have happened? Then you remember your dealings with the spa treatments and the pill that had side effects. This must be one, complete loss of your bladder control. You wonder in horror if that includes your bowls as well. You touch your diaper and feel it squish. It's even bigger than it was before, but can still take more. You look around and see that no one seems to have noticed. However, you notice that several other girls have wet diapers. What are they going to do about it, you wonder. Should you ask or just wait?</span></div></div>",

You block the sun with your hand as your eyes adjust to the sudden light, only to see what must have been the largest playground you might ever see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was tall. Really tall. It was like a McDonald's playground painted in baby blue and pink. The slides were long with a padding at the very end to prevent injury. Monkey bars made from metal and reinforced plastic, also with padding. A swing-set on the side where a diapered boy was pushing a diapered girl, almost like it was a date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the kids were laughing and playing. You watch, feeling somewhat alienated.

She lays you down on the leather mat and lifts up your skirt, revealing your wet, bulging diaper in between your thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begins to untape your diaper and clean you up.

You feel your face go red from the embarrassment of another person suddenly grabbing at your crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, only half full. Well, go have fun, then,\" the teacher says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there, a little dumbfounded, as the teacher goes to sit and supervise. You feel shame, but also some satisfaction and curiosity. You suddenly remembered that you're wearing school-bulk diapers, made to hold more so that changes were less frequent. That was way nobody raised their hand in class. You feel really weird and conflicted. You've been spared the embarrassment of getting changed, but now you have to walk around in a pee-filled diaper until it's full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to the playground and finally submit; this looks like a lot of fun. You take in a breath and move toward the playground, listening to the laughter and cheers from the other kids. <i>Teens</i> you force yourself to think. They're so unlike the teens you knew. Memories flood into your mind, of times when you were younger and would play in the McDonald's playground, crawling through the plastic and rope tunnels, going down the slide that seemed so large back then, goofing around with any other kid that happened to be there. This was like that, only fitted for someone your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawl up one of the towers, slipping and pulling your whole body, using your legs to lift yourself up in a way you hadn't done for a long time, making you feel small and a little giddy. You reach to top and see a long plastic tunnel. It's just big enough that you could stand up in a hunched over position. Again, you were reminded of being a five year old at McDonald's. Against your will, you giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you meander around in your memories, someone bumps into you. More specifically, they try to crawl up the tower and your butt is in the way, meaning their face collides with your padded rear and creates an audible squish noise. You tip forward and land on your hands and knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, I'm sorry,\" a boy says. You look over your shoulder to see a guy sticking his head up over the ledge you just crawled up. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush as much as the boy. You're trying not to think about how stimulating it was for a boy to stick his face into your diapered butt. \"I'm... I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy gasped and crawled the rest of the way up. You see that he's one of the boys who doesn't wear the shorts, meaning you can see all of his hairless legs, and you're forced to think about how close to being naked he is. \"Wow. You're the princess, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your whole body to him, but only nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy blushed a little harder. \"You're a lot prettier up close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp and feel your stomach flutter. \"I-I'm Susan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Tristan,\" he says back. \"Would you, ah, like to play with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a lot more joy at hearing that then you knew you should. You remember how alone and scared you were just fives minutes ago and how you wanted to cry. Not, all of a sudden, you want to cheer. You restrain yourself, though. \"Um, sure, I guess. What do you want to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grins. \"Well, if you want, we can go to the hidden corner and have a snack. Then we could ride the slide and swim in the pall pit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ball pit, you think. You hadn't noticed one before. More memories come back to you, all of them happy. \"Okay...\" you say slowly. You let him go past you and follow him, both of you crawling through the tunnels. He leads you to a cube shaped area with a window the overlooks the playground. It's so high up, you can see a great deal more of the city then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristan sits on his padded rear with a plop. You follow suit, except your diaper makes a squish noise beneath your bottom. He then reaches into the front of his diaper and pulls out a snack sized packet of Oreos. He laughs at the face you make. \"What's the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those were in you diaper!\" You shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh!\" He says. \"How else am I supposed to sneak snacks in here? It's not like the school uniform has pockets.\" He blushes. \"But I promise I haven't wet my diaper yet. I always put my snacks away if I'm about to. Most times I don't get to have snacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least you aren't <i>completely</i> disgusting,\" you say with a huff. He opens the pack and gives you some cookies. You feel weird again as you munch on the treat. This was the height of 'breaking the rule's for the teens here. Somehow, you still felt incredibly naughty for eating when it wasn't lunch time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Others don't come here often,\" Tristan said after he swallowed a cookie. \"So it's a great place to think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise a brow. \"What kind of things do you think about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed. \"Probably pretty silly stuff to you, not knowing our customs. I've seen pictures of the rest of the world, and I like to think about how much I'd like to be out there in one of your schools.\" He paused. \"I don't think I'd like it very much. Other kids seem scary there, like they are all bullies who don't treat people right. I couldn't imagine oogling over pretty girls unless I got to know them first. I was always taught you need to respect a girl before you date one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind has frozen in shock at his response. You aren't sure what to think about it. You desperately want to believe he's immature and doesn't know what he's talking about, but you know in your heart that what he just said was what you had always wanted in a boy; a guy who would treat you nicely. You begin to wonder if the teens here aren't as immature as you thought, just raised differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you okay?\" he asks. You suddenly realize that you were sniffling. What was happening to you!? Your feeling all sorts of things you knew you shouldn't be feeling and wanting to cry at things only babies would cry at. But... you suddenly know why you're crying. You're thinking of all the boys you had broken up with because they had gotten bored and how much you wanted them to last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's that spa treatment and pill again, you think. It's making you think more innocently and more reactive to your feelings. You wipe your eyes and say, \"I'm fine. I'm just thinking about how right you are. I wish that...\" you stop yourself before you say anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks at you with confusion and maybe a little pity. \"Well, uh, want to go to the ball pit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sniff again and smile. \"Sure.\" You follow him again and he leads you to a slide. \"Ladies first,\" he says. You giggle and go down. The rush you feel is amazing, like what you'd get at a water park slide. You suddenly realized how much you missed playgrounds, and you're disappointed when you hit the plastic padding at the end. You're happy, though, after climbing around like a toddler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristan comes down and the second he lands, he grabs your hand and pulls you along along, both of you almost falling since you're wadding in the super thick diapers. He take you to a structure behind the playground, the ball pit. \"Come on!\" He shouts. The ball pit is swimming pool sized to compensate for the size of the babies- er, people- playing in them. You have to climb a flight of stairs to get to the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" Tristan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" you half ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gives you a push and you fall into the balls face first. You aren't hurt, but you are annoyed. You hear him jump in. You reposition yourself in the balls, the familiar sound of them rattling pleasant to you. But you have other business. You pick up a ball and throw it at Tristan, knocking him in the face. \"You jerk!\" you shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're not hurt,\" he laughs. He pick up some balls and throws them all at once at you. \"Now come on and fight back or I'll bury you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin and begin to chuck the plastic balls at him while trying to dodge his attacks. You're having so much fun, you've completely forgotten that you were ever embarrassed, though you wet diaper is still a firm reminder of a few things. Halfway through one throw, you stop and groan. Your stomach churns and, before you know it, you've messed in your diaper as wet it some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you okay?\" He asks at your pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... messed my diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods. \"Well, hurry and get changed, then. There's only fifteen minutes of recess left.\" He takes your hand and leads you out of the ball pit. Your face is red once you're out. Your full diaper is very visibly sagging and sloshing now with each waddling step you take. You feel the warm poop and pee rub against your crotch. You find that you're sobbing all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I feel like I've lost control of everything!\" You cry. \"This isn't like my home at all! Teens aren't supposed to where diapers and use them like babies But even worse is that I'm getting used to it.\" You sniffle. \"I love this playground, and the attention I've been getting, and you sweet you are. But <i>I'm</i> not the one deciding to do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulls you into a gentle hug. \"I know I'm not like boys where you're from, but I get it. It's frustrating to not have control. Do you want me to come with you to get changed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it a moment...</span></div></div>",

Seeing how everyone is staring at you makes you feel even more nervous, so nervous that you begin to pee yourself.

So after putting the two of you down for your naps I paid a little visit to the spa and had a few of the extra deluxe treatments myself. I had actually intended to make myself the same age as you two but unfortunately they took off more than expected regressing me further than what I planned. However I am okay with my new age, I have my youth back but more importantly I am more than young enough to be able to wear diapers again\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're wearing diapers now too?\" you asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" she said and reached down lifted up the bottom of her dress to reveal she was wearing a diaper similar to their own underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting her dress fall back down she continued, \"Not only am I wearing them I need them now too. As I'm sure you already guessed I'm no longer potty trained at this age and given our country's laws I won't be for quite some time. Nor do I want to be since like Princess Susan I've taken quite a liking to them. Anyway after leaving the spa I had my new nanny change my wet diaper and put me down for a nap so I wouldn't be cranky for tonight's dinner. I myself just woke up half an hour ago and had a quick snack on the way here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah why are you here exactly?\" Janet asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the two of you won't be surprised when I reveal the new me at the party. It will be quite a shock to more than a few to see their host is now a diapered toddler. But it shouldn't be too bad given I already told of Susan's predicament.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really paying attention to what she was saying you grin as you now have another baby friend to play with.

The Queen then effortlessly pushed a couple of large solids into the seat of her diaper, the brown logs mushing up against her bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around in her now full padding she addressed her two guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem I just made a big poopie in my diaper and now require changing\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two guards bowed, \u201cYes your highness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh she made a stinky in her pants\" you giggled to your friend while clapping your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh you gotta be kidding me...\" Janet groaned at seeing another person turn to the baby side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the guards quickly came over and picked up the toddler. However you were surprised when instead of carrying her to the changing table the man propped the Queen over his shoulder. He then lifted up the back of her dress so he could pulled back her diaper and peek inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that her dress was momentarily out of the way you could plainly see a huge bulge in the back of her padding<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are they even bothering to check? You already told them you need a change and plus we can smell you from way over here\" Janet pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true; you could smell a faint odor in the air which could only be coming from toddler\u2019s diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I asked them to treat me like a baby regardless of what I say or do, except for special circumstances. Since I\u2019ve committed to this second babyhood I want to make the most out of it, I wanna have the full baby experience especially when it comes to the diapers\" the Queen explained as she continued to have her diaper checked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more seconds of staring the guard nodded before letting the waistband snap back, \u201cYep you definitely made a boom boom you\u2019re majesty. Time to change your diaper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then saw him gesture to the other guard who then handed him a diaper bag with a royal crown symbol on the front. He then started to carry Queen Charlotte over to the changing table when the infant ruler suddenly spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I wanna be changed on the bed\u201d she commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard complied with her request and laid the two year old down on the foot of the bed you and Janet shared, pulling out a changing matt from the diaper baby and moving the Queen onto it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget my binky\u201d she reminded the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bodyguard nodded before reaching into the bag and pulling out a pink colored pacifier. Popping it into the infant Queen\u2019s mouth she began to eagerly suck on the rubber nipple while he removed the changing supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet seeing what was about to go down and disgusted by the idea of seeing someone else\u2019s poop backed away while you on the other hand crawled forward to get a better look, resting on your hands and knees. You were curious and wanted to see what it looked like when another person got their diaper changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as Charlotte obediently raised her legs as the guard untaped and opened up her dirty diaper. The moment the front came down the smell intensified and you could see a couple of squished brown turds nestled in the seat. Giggling at the sight of her poo poo you watch as the padding was removed and set off to the side. He moved onto the next part of the change grabbing a handful of baby wipes and began to generously clean her rear. Charlotte just sucked on her pacifier and moved her legs about randomly as her bottom was wiped. She didn\u2019t appear the least be fazed even when the man moved between her legs and cleaned her private area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the soiled baby wipes into the used diaper he then wrapped it up into a neat little ball which the man swiftly handed to the other guard to dispose of. After dusting the baby girl\u2019s bottom with sweet smelling powder the man pulled out a fresh disposable diaper and slid it under her butt. Charlotte smiled behind her pacifier as the guard taped her up, kicking her legs in satisfaction at the feeling of a new diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch with smile as the newly diapered Queen rolled off her back and stood up on the bed. She lifted up the front of her gown to admire her crinkly undergarments for a few moments before letting it drop back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment your best friend asks a question that gets your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a second they just changed her so why does it still stink in here?\u201d Janet asked confused by the stinky smell that was still in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering your own diapers you and Janet quickly check yourselves to find out that Charlotte wasn\u2019t the only poopy pants in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out it\u2019s\u2026</span></div></div>",

Her cheeks appear more vibrant than her typical complexion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Janet?\"  You ask innocently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour friend refuses to answer. She's looking down, avoiding eye contact with the other occupants of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou catch the guards exchanging glances with one another; they both approach Janet. One of the guards kneels down to Janet's height, who is unable to flee due to the presence of the other guard. Bypassing any decency for the poor girl, the first guard lifts up Janet's skirt, and peers into her diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as I thought, the fussy one pooped herself.\"  The guard complains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Janet began to tear up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can...can you at least change me in the other room?\" Janet chocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same guard sighed.

You saw how she was acting earlier. It's because she's going from the life of a teenager, to the life of a child. The whiplash is affecting her negatively. If she were put into the lifestyle of an infant: pacifiers, diapers, breastfeeding and all; childhood would seem better by comparison. Then the two of you could play without worry or care.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure at first, but the Queen was certainly skilled at persuasion, even as a toddler.

Trust me when I say you\u2019ll enjoy being a baby more than an adult; you get to take long naps, watch TV and play all day, drink from a baby bottle, and make poo poo in your diapers as much as want and someone else change you, just like I did a while ago\u201d she grinned listing off all the great perks of being a toddler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet blushed as she had to admit all of that sounded really good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toddler Queen then turned her attention back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd as for you, I\u2019m actually a little proud that you rejected my earlier proposal Susan. It shows that you\u2019re willing to think of other people\u2019s feelings before your own and that\u2019s a mark of a great ruler. If I ever decide to step down from the throne I\u2019m sure you\u2019d make a great Queen\u201d she said causing you to beam at the praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t count on it happening anytime soon. I rather like sitting on my throne especially with added cushioning of my diapers\u201d Charlotte said as she plopped down on her rear and lifted up the front of her gown to once again inspect her padding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still find it kind of weird that despite being back in them and now being a two year old you\u2019re still Queen of this country\u201d Janet said with disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please, there have been plenty of kings and queens throughout history who succeeded to their thrones before they were out of diapers\u201d the Queen retorted sticking out her tongue in a childish manner, \u201cAge, or rather lack of it, has never been much of an obstacle to high office.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill feels weird\u201d Janet replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that you interjected; having had something important you wanted to talk to the Queen about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm Queen Charlotte\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou and your friend don\u2019t need to be so formal around me, just call me \u201cCharlotte\u201d from now on\u201d she smiled showing off her baby teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Charlotte can I ask you a favor?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, you are the Princess after all.

Since you both had shorter legs now covering the distance was a lot more exhausting, the two of you a little out of breath when you reached the Beauty Spa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon getting there you see that the same female from before is manning the front desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww there\u2019s our cute baby Queen and Princess\u201d the stylist cooed at the sight of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there something I can do for you your highness? Do you want to be even younger?\u201d she asked then added quickly,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean you\u2019re already young enough for diapers but I think you\u2019d look absolutely adorable as an infant rather than a toddler. Either way I would just love to get the chance to change you my Queen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for the compliment but I\u2019m perfectly happy being two years old and for your information I had my diaper changed not too long ago. It\u2019s actually Princess Susan here and her friend here who want to get younger, they want to be my age\u201d Charlotte explained to the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm that\u2019s going to be tricky since each treatment takes off 2 to 10 years. I suppose if we do only a little bit of each treatment we can take away 3 years\u201d she answered after doing some internal calculations in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stylist then clapped her hands and two employees quickly appeared to take you and Janet away. You and she were carried to the room where the mud bath was and stripped of your gowns and diapers. You blushed at being totally naked before being placed in the mud, Janet being lowered into the spot right next to you. You both were scrubbed from head to toe with the mud for five minutes before being removed from the bath. Instead of being cleaned off you two were then quickly whisked away to the sauna and placed inside. Like before it was very warm and relaxing and the hot heat dried up the mud that was on your bodies causing it to flake off. Again you were only allowed to stay in for five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter exiting the steamy chamber a nearby employee took a small bathtub and towel and began to clean both of your naked bodies. Both you and Janet definitely felt younger then when you first came in. You could feel a loss in height and you felt chubby in certain places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this was happening Queen Charlotte toddled into the room and had one of the employees bring in a mirror for you to look into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking at your reflections you both realized you had become\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though had that happened you would have only had to wait twenty four hours before being old enough for the term toddler\u201d the Queen explained then added with a smile, \u201cOn the bright side you both don\u2019t have to attend school now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just glad we didn\u2019t end up as newborns\u201d Janet remarked as she fingered her belly button, amazed by her new chubby baby fat and larger belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also marveled at your new younger body, happy that you were now physically a baby again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spa employees then proceeded to diaper both you and Janet, putting on one that was a smaller size then your previous ones due the regression shrinking your waist lines. As they did so they made comments about what cute and adorable baby girls you were making the two of you blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey how exactly does that classification wook again?\u201d Janet asked surprised by the slight lisp she now had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeah I wanna no too\u201d you said also being curious and also having trouble with some words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGladly, now as you know the term \u201cBaby\u201d can refer to any child between birth and age 4. However the stages of babyhood are as follows: Newborns are babies from birth to two months of age, Infants are babies from two to twelve months of age, Toddlers are babies from one year to four years of age. And Kindergarteners are five years and up\u201d Charlotte finished explaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow you sure know a wot\u201d you replied in wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Queen after all so I\u2019m required to know a lot of things. Plus I studied early child development when I attended the university and was top of my class\u201d she stated proudly with a smug look, placing her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte then let out a small \u201ceep!\u201d as one of the spa employees, the female stylist lifted the back of the infant ruler\u2019s dress and started feeling her diaper, \u201cSorry your highness but I need to see if you made a tinkle or stinky.\u201d The two year old Queen obediently remained still as it happened, liking the way the section of padding covering her crotch was squeezed which resulted in a light squishing sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a little wet but not enough to warrant a change\u201d she concurred before letting her dress fall back down while Charlotte giggled at the surprise diaper check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile both you and Janet were now dressed in fresh new crinkly padding along with a gown similar to the Queen\u2019s. However unlike you and her Janet didn\u2019t get a tiara since she wasn\u2019t royalty. Seeing that we were done here Charlotte gestured with her hands and the two guards from earlier reappeared along with a third guy, each of them pushing a baby stroller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake us back to Princess Susan\u2019s room\u201d she commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly obeying the guards lifted their ruler up and placed her in one of the strollers before turning to face you and your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Janet allowed yourselves to be strapped into the other two strollers, feeling happy that you didn\u2019t have to walk all the way back to your room. Being pushing along was really fun and both you and Janet giggled as you took in the sights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll too quickly the ride came to an end as in no time at all you reached the door to your room, the guards quickly unstrapping the three of you and setting you all down on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was free to move around the Queen turned to address the trio of guards, \u201cYou three go back to your usual duties. If we need anything we\u2019ll ring for the nanny\u201d she ordered while you snickered at the double meaning of the word \u201cduties\u201d since two of the guards had recently cleaned up Charlotte and Janet\u2019s doodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair gave a quick bow to the toddler Queen before walking away down the hallway and disappearing out of sight around a corner.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She loves how young she got and that she now needs diapers again. She didn\u2019t even cry when she used her diaper for the first time or make a fuss when she was changed by one of the maids. However fair warning she will have to cry from now on to get our attention when she needs something, like food or a new diaper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u201d was all you could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet nodded her head agreement, surprised that another grown up had albeit accidently joined them and now preferred babyhood over adulthood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess we now have a baby sister to wook after now\u201d Janet replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is gonna be fun, now I get to wook after and take care of my mommy\u201d you exclaim enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently your mom caught what you had said and from the way she clapped her hands together happily approved of the role reversal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe nanny will do the most of the looking after and taking of.

Janet checked hers and also found nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince it isn\u2019t you and it isn\u2019t Janet then by process of elimination you realize it must be Charlotte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to the young Queen and lift the back of her dress, the toddler not even saying anything about your invasion of privacy. Pulling back the waistband of her diaper you peek inside and see and huge brown turd squished between her butt cheeks. You were surprised not just by the size of the poo she made but also at the fact she did number two so soon after last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who made a stinky\u201d you say letting it snap back into place and taking a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep I felt the urge a while ago and just let it all out.

You giggled at the cute action once again being reminded what a cute toddler the Queen made. It almost like just her speech was adult and everything else<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know even though you\u2019re a Queen I didn\u2019t expect woo to have so many \u201cdoodies\u201d in one day\u201d you say causing Charlotte to laugh and clap her hands, while Janet let out a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that surprising, toddler can have as many as 4 or 6 poops a day regardless of if they\u2019ve eaten\u201d she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at that fact but still wonder when it\u2019ll be your time again to make a number two in your pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo are you going to get changed now or what? Cause you\u2019re kinda stinking up the place\u201d Janet pointed out, wrinkling her nose at the smell coming off the infant ruler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI kinda of like it\u201d you say taking another whiff of the stinky odor in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile your baby mom continued to play with her toys, not caring or interested in the dirty diaper drama the three of you were having.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte looked at you then Janet, her looking thoughtful as she weighed her options. She probably should get changed into a clean one to get rid of the smell like Janet wanted and to avoid getting a nasty rash because of her poopie. On the other hand she was a baby and also the Queen and didn\u2019t have to listen to her.

Also she\u2019s gonna be the one taking care of all us now that we\u2019re regressed below five.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking some more she remembered something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh and before I forget I should tell you my nanny\u2019s name is Rebecca\u201d Charlotte told you and Janet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stinky toddler then toddled to the middle of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m now going to summon her, though I\u2019m going to do it in the traditional baby way so you might want to cover your ears\u201d she warned as she inhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shared a confused look with Janet just as the infant ruler began to cry loudly at the top of her lungs, the both of you covering your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte cries grew louder as actual tears streamed down her face which turned slightly red. You and Janet were then surprised when the baby Queen flopped down on her back and began to kick her legs in impudent rage, looking for all the world like an actual baby who needed her diaper changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nanny came rushing into the room a couple minutes later. She was a beautifully tall short black-haired woman in her early twenties wearing a traditional black maid outfit with a white apron. You thought she kinda bared a little resemblance to Mary Poppins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, my what\u2019s all this then?\u201d she asked in a British accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Janet quickly point to Charlotte who was still crying loudly and fussing on the floor. Seeing the baby Queen unhappy the nanny quickly strode over, \u201cUh oh what\u2019s wrong your highness?\u201d she asked again picking the toddler up and looking her in the face, \u201cTell nana what\u2019s the matter\u201d she cooed. Instead of responding Charlotte continued to cry and fuss in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow being this close to the girl the nanny caught wind of a strong odor coming from the baby\u2019s padded rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I know that smell\u201d she replied as she turned the two year old around. Lifting her up high by her armpits so her bottom was right in front of her she leaned closer to sniff the back of her diapered butt just to be sure. However right as she did so Charlotte squeezed her legs together and let out a fart right in the nanny\u2019s face as she pooped out another fairly big turd, the seat of her diaper pushing out even more and the bulge in the back growing bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrinkling her nose at the gassy release the woman smirked, \u201cOof smells looks like somebody made a big stinky in their pants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI poopie\u201d Charlotte choked out between sobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the young girl close to her chest Rebecca rubbed her back to comfort her, the toddler\u2019s cries lessening with each pat \u201cI know, don\u2019t you worry your majesty nana\u2019s gonna take care of your icky poo poo right away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte responded by sticking her face into the woman\u2019s shapely bosom, rubbing her cheek needily against one of the mounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I know what you want\u201d she said undoing the front of her shirt to revealing a nursing bra, guiding the baby ruler\u2019s mouth to one of the nipples, \u201cThere you go your highness drink as much as you want\u201d Rebecca coaxed as Charlotte began to greedily nurse on her boob. To Charlotte the breast milk tasted all the sweeter when she was drinking it while her diaper was filled with her warm poo. Once she finished Rebecca quickly redid her shirt before propping the baby over her shoulder and burped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled at the loud belch while Janet remained silent, too busy taking in the sight before her. For some reason she liked what she was seeing, a part of her wishing she was there with Charlotte in the same situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay we better change that stinky diaper of yours my Queen before you get a rash\u201d Rebecca said carrying her over to the changing table and laying her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou toddled over to the table eager to see Charlotte get changed for second time in the past hour. You were surprised when Janet came with you, standing beside you with a curious look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that you both wanted to watch the nanny brought over a chair for the two of you to stand on, allowing to see eye level with the table. Wasting no more time Rebecca undid the tapes on the Queen\u2019s pamper, pulling down the front to reveal two very large and smelly turds. You and Janet pinched your noses at the smell coming from the brown solids, watching as the lady prepared to remove the soiled padding. Before she could Charlotte started to squirm and kick her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI gotta go tinkle\u201d she called out loud enough for all to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later a stream of yellow liquid flowed out from between her legs and started soaking the inside of the open diaper. Charlotte gurgled and giggled in true babyish fashion as her pee wet her poop and be absorbed by the padding underneath. When she finally finished relieving herself Rebecca just smiled as she pulled the now puffy and yellowed dirty diaper off to the side. Grabbing the baby wipes the nanny wiped her cute baby butt in typical fashion before dropping the soiled wipes in the used garment. Unfolding and sliding the new diaper under her bottom she began to apply a vigorous helping of baby powder to her crotch and rear. You saw her go the extra mile and gently rub the powder into her skin with her fingers before pulling the front up between her legs and taping up both sides of the pamper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd there you go your highness a fresh new diaper\u201d Rebecca commented as Charlotte kicked her legs in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting the beaming two year old off the table and setting back down on the floor, she then busied herself with wrapping up and disposing off the Queen\u2019s old diaper in the nearby pail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh nothing like a fresh diapy\u201d Charlotte grinned as she reached down, gripping the waistband of her diaper and tugging it side to side as she yanked it up a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Janet quickly climb down from the chair and approached the baby girl who now reeked a bit of baby powder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly cow you have got to be the biggest baby ever\u201d Janet remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you\u201d Charlotte grinned at what she considered to be a compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did she know that Janet actually meant it to come off that way, suddenly having these weird feelings for the infant ruler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what should we do now?\u201d you ask the toddler Queen, eager to do something new as a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I think I\u2019ve made it enough about me with all this diaper changes\u201d Charlotte chuckled, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you decide what we should do next Susan. After all we still have plenty of time before the royal banquet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned at being given the choice and looked around the room, seeing your baby mom still happily playing with her toys. You also noticed a large flat screen TV set up in the corner of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some serious thought you decided that you all should\u2026</span></div></div>",

Luckily, you don't have to suck the pacifier in front of everyone, and nobody can tell that your diaper is full.<br>\r\nQueen Charlotte, of course, can smell it. Apparently she did just that, becouse she says \"We have no time right now, but after the arrival at the royal palace you can have your diaper changed by one of the palace maids.\"<br>\r\n\"Will you not be the one who will do it?\" suddenly intervenes Janet.<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\" she responds \"I'm still the queen, after all.

I was introduced to your tradition and, as you can see, I'm diapered.\"<br>\r\n\"Princess ...\" says another reporter, the one you heard talking before \"...we noticed the lock.

She looks over her shoulder and sees the Queen smile \u2013 while her diaper grows warm and wet.

To the reporters she says:<br>\r\n\u201cThe Princess stated that pink is not her favourite colour, but as you can see I was able to convince her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat makes the reporter laugh out and Susan blush. More photos of the cute, blushing princess are made before the Queen allows one last question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess Susan, please we know that the country you lived so far has other traditions. Will it be difficult for you to adapt \u2013 or is it okay for you to be back in diapers and wait a couple of years to before you are treated like an adult?\u201d One reporter asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are a bit distracted by the warm, wet and messy diaper you are wearing, so you answer quickly \u2013 too quickly.<br>\r\n\u201cOh I hate the diapers and it is insane I have to wear one.\u201d You say, luckily not very loud, so only the reporter that stand very close to you and the Queen can hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reporter is very surprised and the grip of the Queens hand tighten at your shoulder, before she pulls you back and push a pacifier in your mouth. \u201cNot anther word.\u201d She warns you, before she smile for the reporters and give your padded behind a little slap.<br>\r\n\u201cThe words of a tired baby in a full diaper, please don\u2019t not take her last words serious. I think it is time for the Princess to go home and take her nap. Thank you Gentlemen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore cameras are clicking, when the Queen takes your hand and lead you to a big limousine, while you suck on your pacifier to calm down. Janet follows behind and is shaking her head.<br>\r\nA maid, who waits in the car straps you into a car seat, while the Queen and Janet sits down in front of you. You are jealous at Janet, since she is has much more freedom than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Susan, please be more careful what you say!\u201d The Queen says, calm and controlled, but clearly disappointed. Millions of boys and girls are wearing and using diapers and are treated like you \u2013 and you say that is insane?! We have to wait what the press will print before we can think about ways to solve the mess you created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am sorry.\u201d You whisper around your pacifier. \u201cI wet myself and got distracted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is not an excuse. I noticed it right away when you went in your diaper, but you had clear instructions and clearly did NOT follow my orders.\u201d The Queen says and looks out of the tinted window for the rest of the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you arrive at the palace.

She is touching your shoulder, waking you up.<br>\r\n\u201cGood afternoon, princess.

You hated to stand in front of 15 strangers in a pink onesie and a messy diaper and when then \u2013 when you wet yourself on top of all this, it was simply too much for a 14year old girl. You gulp down the last sip if the tasty hot chocolate and slam the cup back on the table.<br>\r\n\u201cThat was NOT my fault, dammit! I had a long day, my diaper was FULL and WET and all those people with their STUPID QUESTIONS!\u201d<br>\r\nYou huff and fold your arms in front of your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prime minister is dead silent, while her eyes follow the thin line of hot chocolate you have created on her desk. Obviously the cup has not been completely empty.<br>\r\n\u201cOh my dear.\u201d She sighs and starts to clean up the mess you have created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I am sorry for that.\u201d You say quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are sorry for your behavior now, or for the behavior in front of the press?\u201d Lady Kent asks, while she piles up documents that needs to be re-printed and re-signed now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor\u2026 this.\u201d You say stubborn, and because you feel a bit guilty you say: \u201cI\u2019ll l help you!\u201d Quickly you get up and lean over the heavy oak-desk. You try to pick up the good papers, but when they are almost out of reach you seek support with your hand \u2013 tipping over the glass of water from the minister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe careful!\u201d Lady Kent has just said, but it is too late and now even her dress is wet \u2013 fortunately, only from water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I am sorry \u2013 again.\u201d You blush and step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, Lady Kent takes your hand and guides you to the corner of the room.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease do not spank me.\u201d You whisper and a weak smile appears on the minister\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I will not do that, I just want to make sure you cause no additional damage until the Queen picks you up. Still, I will write her a little letter and give her a recommendation for your \u2013 education.\u201d She makes you stay with the nose in the corner of the room and goes back to her desk.<br>\r\n\u201cFor your corner time I like you to think about this: Is a full diaper a reason to be rude and break rules?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know the answer already, but you still chew on your bottom lip and feel bad. Lady Kent has been very kind and you ruined the work of hours, within seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand in the corner for about 15 minutes before you head a knock on the door and Queen Charlotte comes in. She is surprised to find you in the corner.<br>\r\n\u201cLady Kent, can you explain this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe explanation the Lady gives is fair and detailed and she hands over a little piece of paper to the Queen. You wonder what she had written, but you do not need to wait long.<br>\r\n\u201cYou suggest to diaper her thicker and change her less often?\u201d The Queen summaries the short text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour highness, the young Princess has a bit of a temper and used the condition of her diaper as an excuse for her bad behavior.  Maybe she only needs to get used to it.\u201d Lady Kent says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cannot see if the Queen is nodding or not, but finally you are allowed to come back, out of the corner.<br>\r\n\u201cSo you haven\u2019t talked about a solution to calm down the press?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI needed to calm down myself and the princess was not helping with that.\u201d Lady Kent says, blushing a bit herself. \u201cI think the two of us find a solution, without the Princess. She seems not to be ready to make wise political decisions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could not blush more, when the Queen takes your hand and lead out of the office of the prime minister. Outside she stops, looks down at you and says:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You interrupted the Prime Minister, throw a tantrum about your diaper, denied that what happened at the conference was your fault, blaming our tradition for it, and ultimately made a mess in Prime Minister's office, all in few seconds. I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t burn the palace down in a fit of anger.\"<br>\r\nYou are about to speak, but Rose interrupts you at once, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear any excuses, princess. You will be punished for what happened both at the conference and in the office.\u201d<br>\r\nAfter have said that, she reaches you and begins to undress you.<br>\r\nYou are too ashamed to do anything, so you let her undressed you without resisting. She stops when you are left only in you diaper.<br>\r\n\u201cNow bend over the changing table.\u201d she orders.<br>\r\nYou nervously obey her. When you are in position, you can\u2019t see her anymore, but you can hear she is taking something from a wardrobe.<br>\r\n\u201cI warned you, haven\u2019t I?\u201d she says, reaching you again \u201cAbout the fact that I\u2019m not afraid to use the carpet beater on naughty buttocks?\u201d<br>\r\nYou begin to gulp deeply, fearing what is coming.<br>\r\nShe unfolds your diaper and lowers the back part of it. Your crotch is still covered by it, but your bottom is now fully exposed.<br>\r\nAnd then a heavy wrack hits it. You feel your bottom on fire, after a single swat. You have never been spanked with an implement before, and you really hope this is the last time. Every single swat makes your butt burn like hell. After the third swat, you are already crying.<br>\r\nDuring the punishment, you can feel your tummy go empty, as you wet the diaper still in position over your crotch.<br>\r\nFinally, she gives you the last swat. She spanked you 14 times with that carpet beater.<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you\u2019ve learned you lesson, princess.\u201d she says, putting the carpet beater down, and waits that you calm yourself down.<br>\r\nShe then let you lay on the changing table and proceeds changing you diaper. The new diaper she puts on you is much thicker, and you can barely close you leg with it on.<br>\r\nAfter re-dressing you with your onesie, with your surprise Rose hugs you tightly, whispering \u201cIt\u2019s over now, princess. You deserved your punishment, but all is now forgiven.\u201d<br>\r\nShe helps you coming down from the changing table, then says \u201cYou can now go to play with your friend. You will surely find her in her room.\u201d<br>\r\nAfter telling you the location of Janet room, she let you leave the nursery.<br>\r\nYou politely say goodbye to Rose, then look for Janet\u2019s room.</span></div></div>",

To be honest I never had so much freedom before. I have a VIP card that gives me permission to eat what I like, to use the adult-bathrooms \u2013 those that have a toilet, you know \u2013 or get my diaper changed. They even bought me a games console.\u201d She looks very happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you have used your diaper?\u201d You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet smiles but shake her head. \u201cNo, I preferred the toilet \u2013 but I guess that is not an option for you, is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you shake your head. \u201cI think they want me to use the diapers.\u201d You say, quiet sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, let\u2019s play something.

I am sorry. I really do not recommend it, but if it is an emergency.\u201d Janet says and gives you her VIP-Card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really hope it works, as you waddle down the hallway, reaching for a bathroom.

She was not in, but when I found one, I noticed that they have numbers on them. So I could not take the next one, because she would notice that one is missing.

On the table there is a white lace tablecloth, whose decorations are really a masterpiece.<br>\r\nThe room itself is very well decorated, with  scenes of battle and ancient daily life that were frescoed on the walls. It must be a very ancient room. There is even a wood burning fireplace, but it\u2019s extinct.<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the royal dining room.\u201d the queen explains \u201cIt has been restored, of course, but it is still like when it was built. This is in fact the oldest room in the entire Royal Palace, the only one left from the time of its construction dating back to seven centuries ago.\u201d<br>\r\nYou think that she is implying something like \u201cif you do damages here, you can expect a severe punishment\u201d, but you are not sure of it.<br>\r\nWhat you were sure of, instead, was your place at the table. Because while looking at the room you noticed an high-chair.<br>\r\nAs if to confirm this, the queen leads you to the high-chair, lifts you and then puts you in it.<br>\r\nAfter having settled you, Queen Charlotte sits down on the head of the table, over the only chair that wasn\u2019t made of wood, but of gold.<br>\r\nThe Queen then claps her hand, and four maid enter in the room, carrying trays. Two of them put a plate of caviar with slices of toast and a glass of champagne in front of the Queen, while the other two put a jar of homogenized and a bottle full of milk.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d you ask, looking at your plate.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s baby food.\u201d explains the queen \u201cOf course it\u2019s not the same of younger kids. It is designed to meet the energy needs of boys and girls of your age. The bottle is simply milk, not a special formula.\u201d<br>\r\nAs you reluctantly start to eat the baby food (at least is solid, in some way, and no one is feeding you), the door of the room opens with a slam.<br>\r\nOn the on the door, now open, a boy suddenly appears. It\u2019s quite tall, and a very handsome lad. Is very well dressed, and seems to be about 22/23 years old.<br>\r\n\u201cQueen Charlotte.\u201d he says \u201cI presume Calonian Royal House don\u2019t awaits for their guests to start the dinner these days?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know you were in the palace, dear.\u201d the queen says, calmly, but with an ice tone.<br>\r\n\u201cIt's not a problem, I don\u2019t hold a grudge.\u201d he replies, advancing in the hall. Without waiting for an authorization, he sits in front of you and snaps his fingers in the air, shouting without grace \u201cMaids! I\u2019m hungry! Bring me the usual!\u201d<br>\r\nAfter a couple minute, a maid enters with a plate, serving him with a big and inelegant bleeding rib of beef.<br>\r\nWithout even looking at you, he starts to eat.<br>\r\nCurious about this strange fellow, you ask him \u201cWho are you, mister?\u201d <br>\r\nHearing your voice, he looks at you. His eyes seem made of ice, and his gaze is sharp like a dagger.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess Susan, I presume.\u201d he says \u201cI\u2019m Richard, the noble heir of Calonian Grairven House, the most important noble dynasty in Calonia. We are distant relatives of the Royal House. And if it wasn\u2019t for you, my little princess, I would have been the next king. So at least show me some respect, little brat, or I will put you across my knees.\u201d<br>\r\nYou feel hurt in your pride. No one should talk to you in this way, and you want to tell him what you think of him.<br>\r\nBefore you can say anything, however, the queen herself intervenes, saying \u201cRichard, you may be a grown up an a noble, but even you can\u2019t simply threat the princess without my authorization.\u201d<br>\r\nHearing that, you smile. He notices you smile and, clearly upset about it, he says \u201cWhat are you smiling at, princess? You're just a stinky diaper wearer kid.\u201d<br>\r\nThat\u2019s the last straw!</span></div></div>",

With her hands she orders you and Richard to sit down again, what both of you do \u2013 with some resistance.<br>\r\n\u201cIf it is not possible to have the two of you in one room, we cannot eat together any longer.

You feel so save with the Queen in one room, but he is at your high chair in no time, grabs your ear and twist it.<br>\r\n\u201cThrowing your mush at me? I don\u2019t think so! You eat it yourself!\u201d He grabs you spoon and force it in your mouth, and another one, and another one. You have trouble to gulp it down in time, when he suddenly stops. Queen Charlotte is standing next to him and is holding his arm.<br>\r\n\u201cLet her go and leave is alone, Richard.\u201d She says with a calm voice. \u201cYou are hurting her ear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain in your ear is not that bad, but when he let it go it still stings. With delight you see him turn around and march out of the room.<br>\r\n\u201cBye bye Richard!\u201d You say with a cheeky smile, before you look back at the Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm,\u2026 he started!\u201d You say and wipe baby food from your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSusan\u2026 \u201c. The Queen starts, but stops and shakes her head. <br>\r\nShe goes back to her seat and slide down, looking defeated.<br>\r\n\u201cYou are behaving like 4 years old. Richard is a powerful noble and you will not be able to avoid him. Please Susan, I was so happy when I found you, because he will be a horrible king.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel very bad, while you look at the mess you have made on the old, wonderful table.<br>\r\n\u201cBut you found me. I will be Queen.\u201d You say, trying to cheer her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, in principle, but if you behave like this he will try to push you off the throne \u2013 saying you are not fitting in the culture or be a retard.\u201d The Queen looks very sad and pushes away her table.<br>\r\n\u201cMaids! Bring the Princess to her nursery, have Rose feed her and put to bed.\u201d<br>\r\nShe gets up, comes to you and gives you a kiss on the forehead.<br>\r\n\u201cI am sure your behind can not stand another spanking, but do not think I will forget this. Rose will know everything and come up with a suggestion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go pale as the Maids help you out of the high chair and take you by your hands, one maid on each side.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I am not finished! I can feed myself! I am a big girl!\u201d You shout over your shoulder and to your surprise \u2013 the Queen tells the maids to stop. She walks around you and bend down \u2013 but she is not letting you go back to the high chair. Instead the push a pacifier in your mouth and let the maids continue. \u201cNo shouting in the hallways.\u201d She says quietly and goes to her private rooms, while you are dragged to Rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the nursery, the maids tell Rose what had happened in the dining room. You are relived when they also tell her that the Queen does not want you to receive an additional spanking today. But when they leave you alone with Rose, you are not looking forward to the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose kneels down in front of you and looks into your eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Holding you in her arms, she took you toward a chair. You sigh, ready to yet another stupid spanking. While being carried, you notice that Rose in nowhere to be found.<br>\r\nThe queen sits down, but to your surprise she doesn\u2019t take you across her knees, but make you sit over them, holding you in a warm embrace.<br>\r\n\u201cSusan\u2026\u201d Charlotte says, with a sad voice \u201c\u2026 Rose told me what you have said to her yesterday night. You don\u2019t understand our tradition yet, and I don\u2019t blame you for this, really. But I want to be clear: we have not kidnapped you or holding you prisoner. This palace is not supposed to be a golden cage for you. You can open your wings and fly away, if you really want it.\u201d<br>\r\nYou listen to her without interrupting, wanting to hear where she wants to go with her speech.<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you asked last time, you were clearly just throwing a tantrum, and we were over a plane.\u201d the queen continues \u201cBut if you ask me with cold mind that you want to go home to your mother in the USA\u2026 I\u2019ll let you climb on the first flight.\u201d<br>\r\nYou want to reply, but before you could say anything Charlotte speaks again \u201cIf you decide you stay, you\u2019ll have however to accept our tradition. If you can\u2019t afford to embrace it entirely, we can make a deal to be a bit more lenient with you. But I must warn you: lord Richard would use that at his advantage to ascend the throne, creating the concrete possibility that all of this would be for nothing. These are your choices, princess.\u201d<br>\r\nYou think about it for a second, then say \u201cYou leave me three choices. To leave, to stay here fully embracing your stupid tradition, or to stay here only partially embracing tradition but with the concrete possibility to lose the throne.\u201d<br>\r\nThe queen nods, saying \u201cYes. These are your choices. I want you to think carefully, princess. No fit of anger, or tantrums. Think about it and give me an answer with clean and cold mind. I\u2019ll change you in a clean diaper, and we will have breakfast, since yesterday you almost skipped dinner. Then you\u2019ll give me your answer.\u201d<br>\r\nYour diaper is indeed quite wet after the night, and so you let her take you to the changing table.<br>\r\nCharlotte puts you down, unlocks your pink onesie and removes it, then takes you in her arms again and place you over the changing table. <br>\r\nWhile she removes the wet diaper, you say with red cheeks \u201cI never wetted the bed in ages.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYesterday it was a really stressful day, princess.\u201d Charlotte replies, while cleaning you with wet wipes \u201cThat and the sleeping aid contained in each baby meal combined made you wet your diaper.\u201d<br>\r\nYou decide to don\u2019t say anything about how stupid you think this is. <br>\r\nOnce you\u2019re clean, the queen applies baby oil over your privates and slid a clean diaper under your bottom holding your legs in the hair. She then takes your legs down and submerge your lower parts in baby powder, before taping the diaper close.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd princess\u2026\u201d she says, helping you down from the changing table \u201c\u2026 if you choose to stay here, I have to tell you that you\u2019ll be punished for all the bad things you\u2019ve said to Rose. She has your best interests at heart, and you were extremely rude to her.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMy best interests at heart!?\u201d you exclaim, skeptical and shocked \u201cShe spanked me with a fucking carpet beater!\u201d<br>\r\nThe queen sighs, and says \u201cSusan, stop the swearing, please.\u201d<br>\r\nYou try to calm yourself and take a deep breath, then saying \u201cOk, I\u2019m sorry. Where is she, anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s in her room. I\u2019ll speak to her before we go to have breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\nWith those words, she dresses you up in a red shirt with a matching skirt attached at it. It\u2019s the version of your size of a child outfit, but much more mature then the onesie, more for a toddler than for a baby.<br>\r\nCharlotte takes you by hand and lead you out of the nursery. She stops just out, in front of the door next the one you just walked through, and knocks at it.<br>\r\n\u201cRose, I\u2019m the queen. Can I come in?\u201d<br>\r\nYou hear a simple yes, and the queen opens the door.<br>\r\n\u201cWait here.\u201d she says, entering in the room closing the door at her back and leaving you alone in the hallway.<br>\r\nCurious as you are, you decide to eavesdrop.<br>\r\n\u201cRose, are you okay?\u201d the queen asked.<br>\r\nYou hear sobbing in response, followed by a soft voiced \u201cI\u2019m not! The princess hates me! I\u2019m not a good nanny! I\u2019m a failure!\u201d<br>\r\nYou feel a pain in your stomach in hearing that. She took your words much worse than you could have expected.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Rosie.\u201d the queen says, sweetly \u201cI\u2019m sure she was just overwhelmed by all the new things, and that she doesn\u2019t hate you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do I did wrong?\u201d Rose continues to sob \u201cI followed all the rules. I spanked her and explained what she did to get her punishment, but after that I comforted her. Maybe I\u2019m not fit for the role. I\u2019m just a stupid commoner, I shouldn\u2019t be here in the palace to raise a princess!\u201d<br>\r\nYou feel really bad now. You could have simply speak to her about how you were feeling, instead you threw a tantrum, shouted at her and called her and all of her countrymen stupid idiots. Thinking about it now, her reaction is quite natural.<br>\r\n\u201cRosie, please, take a hold of yourself.\u201d Charlotte said \u201cI\u2019ll take the princess to have breakfast. Use this time to regain your composure. If she choose to leave, you won\u2019t have to worry about her anymore. If she choose to stay, you two will have a heartfelt conversation. Ok?\u201d<br>\r\nRose seems to calm herself a bit, so you take a step back waiting for the queen. Shortly after the door open, and Charlotte appears in front of you.<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re proud of yourself.\u201d she says with a cold tone, closing the door \u201cYou made one of the kindest person on earth cry.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut she spanked me\u2026\u201d you try to reply, but the queen interrupts you.<br>\r\n\u201cSo what? What do you think? That she enjoys spanking you? Rose follows tradition, but I assure you that she would be much more happy to cuddle you than to spank you. For all the things you have done another nanny would have gave you a much more severe punishment. If you had been in the care of Samantha, the nanny that  raised me, you wouldn't have been able to sit for a month. Even if you choose to leave, I expect at least that you give her an apology.\u201d<br>\r\nYou lower you head, feeling bad for her. You still think that spanking kids is wrong, and that this entire tradition is stupid indeed, but you unleashed your whole frustration over a faultless person.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll give her a proper a apology, I promise.\u201d you say, still looking at your shoes.<br>\r\nCharlotte nods, and taking you by hand once again takes you to the dining hall.<br>\r\nShe takes you to the high chair when you had your dinner yesterday. While she sits down on her chair, a smiling maid comes to you with a tray with a bowl of mush and a baby bottle. <br>\r\nShe puts the tray on the table and says \u201cHello, princess. I\u2019m Liz. I\u2019m here to feed you.\u201d<br>\r\nYou sigh, and looking at the queen you ask \u201cDid she really have to do it?\u201d<br>\r\nThe queen replies \u201cI can ask her to let you feed yourself, but you have to ask it politely.\u201d<br>\r\nYou sigh again, and say \u201cCan I feed myself, then?\u201d<br>\r\nThe queen shakes her head, replying \u201cThis is not polite at all. You have to ask permission to feed yourself and promise to Liz that you won\u2019t make a mess with your food, and you have to say you\u2019re still grateful for her offer to feed you.\u201d<br>\r\nYou\u2026</span></div></div>",

Trust me, I know former maids of his family\u2019s manor.\u201d she says \u201cIt\u2019s a violent man, that doesn\u2019t hesitate to whip his servants like in the middle-age or to eliminate those who thwart him.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEliminate?\u201d you ask, gulping.<br>\r\n\u201cNot physically.\u201d she states \u201cBut he ruined a lot of families thanks to his malevolent influence.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHow can he have so much influence? He\u2019s a monster.\u201d you say.<br>\r\n\u201cHis family is rich and noble. We are a very happy country, princess, but no country is perfect. Not even Calonia is completely immune to corruption.\u201d  she explains \u201cAnd you saw it yourself: he is a handsome lad. In private, like at your dinner before, he acts like the savage he is, but in public he acts elegant and sophisticated, using his charm on those who speak to him, especially women. He\u2019s like a shark in a goldfish pool.\u201d <br>\r\nWhile she speaks, you reach a conclusion: you have a goal now, which is not letting Richard ascend to the throne. This doesn\u2019t mean you will simply fully embrace Calonian traditions, you have yet to think about it.<br>\r\nYou are still making your considerations, when Rose says \u201cNow, about the punishment ...\u201d<br>\r\nYou turn pale once again. You are at least happy that she won\u2019t spank you.<br>\r\n\u201c... normally, I would have make you give a polite apology (with a red bottom on display) to the one you have been rude to, but since we\u2019re talking about Richard, I will not do that.\u201d she says \u201cAnd you were provoked, so I will be lenient with you. But you must learn to react to provocations like a princess, and not like a street thug.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat will happen?\u201d you ask to her.<br>\r\n \u201cNow you will have the rest of your dinner, and your dessert will be a bar of soap.\u201d she states \u201cThen you will go straight to the crib to sleep.\u201d<br>\r\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what happens. Rose feeds you with baby food, using a spoon to take it to your mouth. She is very delicate in doing it, but she does not stop until you have eaten all of your mush.<br>\r\nShe then proceeds to wash out your mouth with soap.

While inserting the key in the keyhole with force, breaking it, she tell to you \u201cIf you want, I could take a photo of you two next time. I\u2019d love to print it and hang in the nursery a picture frame of the cutest princess in Calonian history.\u201d<br>\r\nYou deeply blush hearing her words: you can feel they are sincere, but you have almost the sensation that they are words meant for little kids.<br>\r\nShe then proceeds to remove your onesie, putting you in the pink romper you wore during your nap.<br>\r\nShe gently puts you in the crib, gives you a kiss on the forehead and says \u201cGood night, princess Susan.\u201d, before turning the lights off and leave the room.<br>\r\nIt has definitely been the most intense day of your life.

She straps you down to your diaper and opens it.<br>\r\n\u201cIt is okay little one. Some dinner food put babies into a very deep sleep, so they do not have to wake up when they need to pee or.. do something else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel very exposed to lie naked in front of her, but you still catch her words.<br>\r\n\u201cYou drug kids to use their diapers in the night? That is\u2026 bad.\u201d You say, before you can say something rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose rolls her eyes and shake her head, while she wipe you down and slide a fresh diaper under your behind. The new diaper is as thick and wide as the old one and you make a sore face when you look forward to waddle around for another day.<br>\r\n\u201cWe do not drug babies. We have baby food to help the little ones to relax. It is for stressful days, like the one you had yesterday - and helped you to have a restful sleep. No adult would start to wet the bed with a mild sleeping aid like this. It only works on minors, like you, princess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words make you feel small and you sulk a bit, while she applies a great amount of anti-rash cream on your behind and tapes the diaper close.<br>\r\n\u201cIhhh, I feel messy. Why have you used so much cream on me?\u201d You ask Rose as she helps you up and starts to put a new onesie on you. It is again pink, and this one has a little fairy on the chest. Rose adds a new lock to the zipper and helps you down from the changing table.<br>\r\n\u201cI am sorry princess, but it is the intention to make you feel a bit messy. You need to get used to the feeling and accept that you are not an adult jet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sulk more and earn a hug and a kiss on the forehead from Rose.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, poor princess, don\u2019t look so sad.

As I said, the cream will help in that, but you must also learn patience, because If you mess yourself during a formal occasion I will not be there to instantly change you.\u201d<br>\r\nSo that is their plan: a thick diaper, full of anti-rash cream that will make you feel like you are messy, even if you are clean. Then, when you really mess yourself they won\u2019t change you right away to make you feel the increased messy sensation and teach you patience, sure that you won\u2019t get a rash just because of the cream. It\u2019s a machiavellian plan.<br>\r\n\u201cDid you came up with this or is the Queen who did?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you went to sleep, I discussed with the queen about your behaviour.\u201d she explains \u201cWe discussed and we reached a solution. She suggested the large quantity of cream, I suggested to not change you right away.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo it\u2019s like receiving a double punishment. It\u2019s unfair.\u201d you complain.<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t complain so much if I were in you.\u201d she replies \u201cThe queen suggested to use a large quantity of cream and to give you numerous enemas, I suggested to not change you right away and to give you a bedtime spanking every night for a month. We reached a compromise that you should find acceptable.\u201d<br>\r\nGulping, you realize she is right. Enemas and bedtime spankings sounded much worse.<br>\r\n\u201cWe love you, princess.\u201d she suddenly says, catching you by surprise \u201cWe only want the best for you. Our discipline is for your own good. I hope you understand that.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, and without even realizing it, you hug Rose.<br>\r\nAs the maid hugs you back, the door suddenly opens.<br>\r\nBoth of you turn to the door, and you see the queen, who is holding a newspaper.<br>\r\nQueen Charlotte is almost always the personification of calm, but now she seems frustrated.<br>\r\n\u201cLook at the newspaper!\u201d she exclaims, without shouting but with a tone of voice higher than usual, leaning forward the newspaper. <br>\r\nYou try to catch it, but Rose take it first, doing a gesture of no with her finger in your direction.<br>\r\nShe then opens the newspaper, reading aloud:<br>\r\n\u201cThis is what Princess Susan stated yesterday after her landing in Calonia: &lt;&lt;<i>Oh I hate the diapers and it is insane I have to wear one.</i>&gt;&gt;. If this is what the princess really thinks, is she really fit for Calonian throne? A noble of our country, lord Richard of House Grairven, made this statement about it: &lt;&lt;<i>A stranger will never be worthy of the throne. This Princess proved to be a spoiled child. She will never handle the country like a Calonian would do. I only hope that the people and the queen herself will see the truth.</i>&gt;&gt;. As all our readers know, lord Richard is a true Calonian, ready to do everything for our country. We can only ask ourselves if the future of the country belongs to us or to a child that despise our traditions.\u201d<br>\r\nRose closes the newspaper with an angry move.<br>\r\n\u201cThat filthy rat!\u201d she exclaims, clearly angry \u201cHe must have ran to the newspaper\u2019s headquarter right after the dinner.\u201d<br>\r\nYou look at the queen, unsure of what to do about it.<br>\r\nNoticing your look, Queen Charlotte says to you \u201cWith the problem of the press, I had come to a conclusion with the prime minister.

You look over to Janet and while your best friend enjoys the sun you let go and fill the seat of your diaper.<br>\r\n\u201cGosh I can\u2019t believe I am doing this!\u201d You think by yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation is not the biggest issue, but the knowledge to sit in a messy diaper is too much for you. You quickly get to your feet and say to Janet:<br>\r\n\u201cHey I\u2026 I need to get changed. I guess we see each other after lunch?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, if your highness has time for her best friend. Otherwise I continue exploring the palace.\u201d Janet says and gives you a high five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waddle through the hallway and spread your legs as far as you can, to avoid and contact of your behind with the mess in your diaper. Like this it takes a bit longer, but finally you arrive at the nursery and find Rose, waiting at the crib with a big bottle of formula.<br>\r\n\u201cAh Princess, right in time for your lunch and naptime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile weakly and stop.<br>\r\n\u201cSure, that was the plan, but\u2026 \u201c.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what princess?\u201d Rose asks, before she notice that your diaper is more swollen and hangs a bit lower. She comes to you and pat the seat of you diaper. \u201cOh, did you have an accident, Princess?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake her hand off and make a face. \u201cUags, Rose! Stop that! Yes, I peed and just went number two in the diaper \u2013 and it is disgusting! I want to get out of the diaper, NOW!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s an old saying from another country. It means you have to ask, not to exact.\u201d<br>\r\nStubbornly, you say \u201cYes, yes, I will use please instead of I want. Now, please, change me!\u201d<br>\r\nShe sighs heavily, before stating \u201cNo, princess. It was my intention to change you, but since you cannot ask it politely, you will stay in that diaper during your lunch and your nap.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? You cannot be serious!\u201d you loudly exclaim, stomping your right foot on the ground.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a shame, Princess, because you had started the day quite well.\u201d Rose says \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid that you just earned yourself a maintenance spanking after your nap. Now, will you calm yourself down and take your bottle or do I have to give you a punishment spanking right away?\u201d<br>\r\nYou hate the sensations of your dirty diaper, but you realize you are behaving like a spoiled brat. You calm yourself, than say to Rose \u201cI\u2019m sorry, miss Fletcher. I got carried away.\u201d<br>\r\nShe seems a little relieved and reply \u201cI know it\u2019s hard for you to adapt, but you must understand that the condition of your diaper is not an excuse for bad behaviour.\u201d<br>\r\nShe comes close to you, and begins to undress you, leaving you only in your wet and dirty diaper. You are then leaded to your bottle, and Rose watches you as you suck it.<br>\r\nAfter that you finished your formula, she kindly dress you up with a romper. It\u2019s not the same one you wore yesterday. This is one is bright red, with a two big inscription wrote with blue letters: \u201cGood princesses get hugs\u201d is written on the front, while \u201cNaughty princesses get spankings\u201d is written on the back.<br>\r\nShe then proceeds to put you in the crib. The dirty diaper make you very uncomfortable, but you fall asleep anyway.<br>\r\nAfter a while, Rose wakes you up.<br>\r\n\u201cNaptime is over, Princess.\u201d she says, smiling \u201cTime to waking up.\u201d<br>\r\nRose is very delicate in helping you out of the crib and in taking you on the changing table.<br>\r\nShe delicately changes you diaper, with a kind smile.<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Fletcher ...\u201d you say, blushing \u201c... I\u2019m sorry for before. I like you, you are very kind, even if you are so strict and stern.\u201d<br>\r\nRose doesn\u2019t open her mouth. She remains silent till she has finished your diaper change. For this, you are afraid she is mad at you, but after the diaper change procedure is over and she has helped you coming down from the changing table, she hugs you very tightly, saying \u201cOh, princess. I\u2019m so happy. I thought that you hated me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI do not hate you.\u201d you reply \u201cYou are very strict and I don\u2019t like the whole diaper thing, but I know you genuinely care about me.\u201d<br>\r\nWhile you are still hugging each other, you hear the door knocking.<br>\r\nYou are sure that is the queen, but no one enters.<br>\r\n\u201cWho is there?\u201d asks Rose, looking at the door.<br>\r\n\u201cMaid Sophie.\u201d answers a voice beyond the door \u201cI have a message of Queen Charlotte for Princess Susan.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m listening!\u201d you yell. You would prefer to keep to a minimum the number of person that has saw you naked. <br>\r\n\u201cCan I come in?\u201d asks Sophie.<br>\r\nBefore you can answer, Rose puts a pacifier in your mouth, and exclaims \u201cOf course, Sophie. Come in.\u201d<br>\r\nAnd so Sophie comes in, while you are standing in the middle of the room wearing only a very thick diaper and with a pacifier in your mouth.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess ...\u201d she says, looking at you without even noticing your nudity \u201c... the Queen informs you that she is sorry, but she cannot come to see you because she is very busy. She also says that she wants you to join Miss Spencer in her room.\u201d<br>\r\nWithout waiting for an answer, she leaves the room.<br>\r\nRose removes you pacifier and continues to dress you, making you wear what looks like a pink kindergarten smock. If possible, is even more childish than the onesie.<br>\r\nWhile she is dressing you, you ask her \u201cWho is Miss Spencer?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe is the palace teacher.\u201d she explains \u201cShe teaches to young princes and princesses to correctly behave during formal occasions. I\u2019m sure she will start to prepare you for your interview.\u201d<br>\r\nAfter being dressed, you go straight to Miss Spencer office (Rose told you the way).<br>\r\nYou arrive in front of a door that have a very severe style, with the words \u201cPalace Teacher\u201d engraved on a metal plate.</span></div></div>",

She is in her early forties and wears an elegant office suit. You notice that she is the first women you have seen that is wearing trousers.

Still, you have earned three demerits within two minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are demerits, Miss Spencer?\u201d You ask her, while she keeps walking around you. She touches your padded behind and the little lock on your onesie and keep shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDemerits are minus-points. I am a teacher and cannot waste my time punishing you. That is not my job. Instead I protocol each major mistake you make and tell Miss Fletcher what punishment you have earned.\u201d Finally Miss Spencer has stopped walking around you and lead you to the little table.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease sit down, so we can begin.\u201d She says and flip open the chalkboard. It is written full with information about Sir Richard on the right side and with basic information about the culture of the country.

Oh no, you had three points, princess. By now you have 5. You earned two for your respect-less seating position and one because you just complained.\u201d Your teacher says and smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have the feeling, that she will not become your friend very soon.<br>\r\nYou press your lips together and try to stay calm....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

House ... Grimm?\u201d<br>\r\nMiss Spencer shakes her head, replying \u201cKing Gregory, first king of Calonia, was a member of House Penrose. House Grimm rose two centuries later.\u201d<br>\r\nYou bite your bottom lip, irritated that you have already answered wrong to the first question.<br>\r\nShe makes you some questions, about Calonia and about Richard and his family. Every answer you give is not completely wrong, but it always has a big imprecision.<br>\r\nAt the end of the relatively short number of questions, Miss Spencer is not amused.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess ...\u201d she says \u201c... you are not stupid, or you wouldn\u2019t have remembered so much. But you are clearly inattentive. You had a tendency to daydreaming in class in your old country, hadn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, realizing she is right. Still, you are sure that not even Betty Harris (the most smarty-pants girl in your old class) could have remembered everything just after 5 minutes<br>\r\n\u201cYou have earned other two demerits for your negligence.\u201d she states, writing in her binder \u201cThat makes a total of nine.\u201d<br>\r\nAs you suppress the urge to tell her to stick her demerits in a certain place, she continues with the lesson, explaining what led Calonian old leaders to introduce what is now known as \u201cCalonian Tradition\u201d.<br>\r\nAs she continues to explain, you feel a need in your bladder.<br>\r\n\u201cUmh, Miss Spencer, I need to be excused.\u201d you say, as you usually did in your old school when the need manifested itself.<br>\r\nYou immediately remember that you are in Calonia and that it\u2019s not how this works. The teacher, in fact, writes something down in her binder once again, and then says \u201cAnd that makes 10. Princess, we are talking about our traditions and you ask to go to the bathroom? What should I think? That you are inattentive of that you are mocking me?\u201d<br>\r\nYou deeply blush, as you simply release your bladder, wetting your diaper.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d you stammer \u201cI\u2019ve done now.\u201d<br>\r\nShe nods \u201cVery well.

Some of them look like they are hundreds of years old, so I did not dare to touch them, but some look quiet new \u2013 and the best part is, some are small enough for us!\u201d<br>\r\nAt first you smile, until you remember the lock at the collar of your smock.<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t get the dress off and Rose will get suspicious if we break the lock again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet looks sad, but nods.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, okay, but as soon as you got rid of that lock, we try on dresses!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou agree on the spot and fortunately Janet has found out more, while you suffered under Miss Spencer.

Are they real?\u201d You ask and lift up a sword. By the weight alone, you know that it is real.<br>\r\n\u201cIf they consider this a sport?\u201d You ask Janet and she shrugs. \u201cI think so. They have tons of them and armour and training-weapons, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you pick up wooden training weapons and start to fight against each other.

You try the same with her and after a while the two of you are sweating and out of endurance.<br>\r\n\u201cStop! I give up!\u201d you pant when Janet hit your behind two times in a row. Janet stops and put the swords back to the wall.

Miss Spencer was hear over an hour ago and told me that you did well for the first lesson for somebody from another country. Further she asked me if you made a fuss when I gave you the enema she has chosen punishment for your demerits. Since then I am looking for you and was about to call the guards. What didn\u2019t you come back to me after your lesson right away \u2013 and where have you toe been? You two look quiet exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush and tell Rose where you have been. She is a bit shocked when she hears that you have been playing around with the weapons.<br>\r\n\u201cThere is a sign saying that no children are allowed in the training area! You could have hurt yourself badly!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we are no\u2026 oh, for you, we are children.\u201d You realise and even Janet looks guilty.<br>\r\n\u201cI am very sorry Miss Fletcher, we have not been aware that it is forbidden for us \u2013 and we only used the wooden swords.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose sighs and gives you and Janet a tight hug.<br>\r\n\u201cAt least that. Oh my little girls, you need to be more careful. You can have all kind of toys. Just ask for it and we can give you toy-swords that are safe \u2013 and I would dress you in something more suitable if you like to do sports.\u201d She says to you and takes a critical look at the sweat drenched smock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJanet, as punishment for playing with the swords you are not allowed to play videogames until tomorrow.\u201d Miss Fletcher says. \u201cI know you are a guest, but you need to be careful as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she looks at you.<br>\r\n\u201cYou, princess will receive a spanking before you go to bed, but since you will have the maintenance spanking anyway, your spanking will be extra long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head and look at your feet. \u201cOkay, thank you Miss Fletcher.\u201d You say obediently, hoping to get less slaps if you show respect.<br>\r\n\u201cCan I take a shower?

Before bed you\u2019ll get your enema and the long spanking.\u201d Rose explains.<br>\r\n\u201cBut in this way I will mess myself during the night.\u201d you argue, but almost whispering.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the idea, princess.\u201d she states.<br>\r\nJanet puts an hand on your shoulder, saying \u201cWell, I leave you with your nanny. See you tomorrow, sister.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not my nanny!\u201d you exclaim.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d intervenes Rose \u201cI\u2019m not your nanny? Princess Susan, I feel offended.\u201d<br>\r\nYou deeply blush, immediately saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was joking, nanny Rose.\u201d<br>\r\nRose laugh out a little, then she holds out her hand toward Janet.<br>\r\n\u201cYour card, please.\u201d she demands.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d asks Janet.<br>\r\n\u201cI will turn the access to your gaming console off. It\u2019s your punishment, remember?\u201d<br>\r\nA bit reluctantly, Janet gives the VIP card to Rose. The maid then puts the card in a device similar to a portable cash dispenser, before turning it back to your friend.<br>\r\nYou and Janet say by to each other, and Janet leaves you with Rose.<br>\r\nThe maid lead you inside the nursery, opening the door inside the room, the one that was never opened. She then takes you across it.<br>\r\nAs you suspected, is a bathroom. It\u2019s walls are of the purest white you have ever seen. Inside, a colossal bathtub is placed in the middle of the room. There is a lot of wardrobes too, that you think contains bubble baths, towels and everything that is necessary for a bath. However, there is no sign of a shower, not -of course- of a toilet.<br>\r\n\u201cUmh ... where is the shower?\u201d you naively ask.<br>\r\nRose giggle, answering \u201cVery funny, princess. Now, let\u2019s get you undressed so I can bathe you.\u201d<br>\r\nShe opens up the water faucet, and while waiting for the water to fill the bathtub, she begins to undress you. Taking off your smock (after unlocking it), she says in a playful tone \u201cNaughty, naughty. You dirtied the dress. Now nanny Rose have to wash you up.\u201d<br>\r\nYou are too ashamed to say anything, even when she touches the front of your diaper, saying \u201cYou had an accident. Don\u2019t worry. You will be cleaned in less than an hour.\u201d<br>\r\nWhen you are finally naked, Rose takes you up and she puts you in the bathtub. She gives you a rubber ducky, and says \u201cPlay with this as I proceed to clean you.\u201d<br>\r\nYou politely take it, since you don\u2019t want to give her a reason to punish you further.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, princess.\u201d she suddenly says, while bathing you \u201cYesterday evening I forgot about your bath. The queen scolded me for that and she was perfectly right. I promise it will not happen again.\u201d<br>\r\nYou simply nod, while your hopes of washing yourself without her slowly sink.<br>\r\nShe rubs you everywhere -<i>everywhere</i>-, then takes you out of the bathtub and proceeds to dry you off using a towel.<br>\r\nAfter the procedure is completed, she leads you back to the nursery\u2019s main room. There, she proceeds to dress you up. First, she diaper you, then she puts you in a jammies (that, despite being quit childish, is the most mature think you wore during your time in Calonia).<br>\r\n\u201cDinner time!\u201d she exclaims, lifting a glass of baby food and a bottle of milk.<br>\r\nShe spoons feed you, then gives you the bottle. Deciding to not complain at all (you will be severely punished, so why worsen your situation?) you eat all your baby food and drink all the milk. Rose is clearly satisfied with that.<br>\r\nShe smiles, and says \u201cSince you will be punished for other things and in other ways, and since you have eaten all your food like a good girl, I\u2019ll let you have a dessert.\u201d<br>\r\nYou are almost scared, thinking that it will be something meant for a baby like usual, but she gives you a cup of chocolate ice cream with a spoon.<br>\r\n\u201cYou can feed yourself with this.\u201d she says, without losing her smile.<br>\r\nQuite happy yourself, you proceed to eat the ice cream. It\u2019s tasty and sweet.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Rose!\u201d you tell her, once finished \u201cIt was delicious.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThank you princess.\u201d she replies. She then suddenly stops to smile, adding \u201cNow, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s punishment time.\u201d<br>\r\nYou gulp, knowing that the enema won\u2019t be pleasant.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s really necessary?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid it is.\u201d she simply reply.<br>\r\nShe takes you back to the bathroom, next to a bar holding an enema bag. She undresses you and then inserts the tube liked to the enema bag in your rectum. It\u2019s a totally unpleasant sensation, but it\u2019s not painful. When the bag is finally empty, Rose removes the tube and puts the diaper back on you.<br>\r\n\u201cAll done, princess.\u201d she states, and lead you back to the main room once again.<br>\r\nShe sits on a chair, patting on her knees.<br>\r\n\u201cOver my lap, princess. Let\u2019s make this over with.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you ... I don\u2019t know, taking something away from me? Like you did with Janet?\u201d you try to ask, fully aware that she will say no.<br>\r\nIn fact, Rose shakes her head \u201cDon\u2019t be silly. Janet is a guest. You are now a Calonian child, an you will be punished accordingly to tradition. Over my knees, princess. I will not say it again.\u201d<br>\r\nReluctantly, you lay yourself over her lap. The maid open up your diaper, taking down the back part but leaving the front part at its place.<br>\r\nShe then proceeds to spank you. The spanking is quite long, as she announced before, and you are almost surprised that you haven\u2019t wet yourself during it. Of course, you started sobbing quite soon.<br>\r\nWhen her hands finally stops, you are exhausted.<br>\r\nRose tapes the diaper back close, and helps you getting on your feet.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s over, princess.\u201d she kindly says, hugging you \u201cNow you can have your bedtime.\u201d<br>\r\nShe puts you in a romper, the same embarrassing one that you wore during your nap after lunch (\u201cGood princesses get hugs\u201d written on the front, \u201cNaughty princesses get spankings\u201d written on the back).<br>\r\nAt the end of all, Rose puts you in the crib, and sing for you a sweet lullaby till you are asleep.<br>\r\nThat night ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Beside an enormous thick diaper and a pacifier gag you are naked. Hands and feet are tied to the high chair and the diaper is obviously used.<br>\r\nOn the throne sits Lord Richard and on each sides he has one wife.<br>\r\n\u201cI think it is time that little Susi crawls around the market place again. Somebody bring me a collar and a leash.\u201d<br>\r\nA maid is coming seconds later and give the requested items to him, the maid is Rose.<br>\r\n\u201cYou majesty, should we change the baby before you take her for a walk?\u201d she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard slaps her across the face and pushes her to the ground in anger.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy should you do that?

Your hands search for your friend, the stuffed rabbit. When you find him, you hug him tightly and cry.<br>\r\nWhile you sit there in your crib you notice that your diaper is no longer dry, but very wet and messy. This makes you cry even more passionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door of the nursery is opening and Nanny Rose comes in, she must have a kind of baby phone. She switch on a little lamp and comes closer.<br>\r\n\u201cHush baby, what is wrong?\u201d She asks stroke you back.<br>\r\nWith tear filled eyes you come to your knees and hug her tightly. When you break loose from her Rose wipes your tears away and holds a tissue for you to blow your nose.<br>\r\n\u201cI had a nightmare.\u201d You whimper into Rose\u2019s bosom. Suddenly you realize that she is only wearing a thin nighty of white silk. You blush and try not to have more tears fall on it, but she holds you in place and hushes you.<br>\r\n\u201cI had a nightmare about Lord Richard. He cannot become King, he will beat you and turn my life into hell.\u201d You sob.<br>\r\nRose is hiding a little smile, you look so cute with your stuffed rabbit in your hand and your dropping diaper, but she takes you serious and stroke your hair. \u201cHe will not become King if you work hard and I know you will, Princess. You will become Queen and we will be very proud of you.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod your head and feel a little better.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you like another bottle with a bit more sleeping aid?\u201d<br>\r\nYou want to say no, but if you are honest, it is a good idea, so you nod your head and wait for Rose to bring it to you.<br>\r\nYou lie down in your crib and suck on your bottle, while Rose hums softly and stroke your hair.<br>\r\nShe used a bit more sleeping aid, like she said and your eyes quickly become heavy. When you almost drift off you take the bottle out and say: \u201cI am poopy.\u201d<br>\r\nRose giggles and nods her head. \u201cI know princess and it is very brave that you don\u2019t ask to be changed.  \u2013 I change you in a few hours, little one.\u201d She says softly.<br>\r\nYou nod your head and finish the bottle.

A princess must follow an healthy schedule. Waking up at the right time is a part of it.\u201d answers the Queen.<br>\r\nShe helps you getting out of the crib, and instantly you remember that you are wearing a very wet and messy diaper.<br>\r\n\u201cCan I get changed now?\u201d you ask, looking in Rose direction. She is right next to the changing table.<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, princess.\u201d she replies \u201cBut I\u2019m not the one that will do it this morning.\u201d<br>\r\nAs she finish to talk, the queen puts a hand on your shoulder, saying \u201cCome on, Susan. I don\u2019t want you to get a rash.\u201d<br>\r\nShe leads you to the changing table and lift you on it. Once on the soft surface of the changing table, you ask \u201cWeren\u2019t you too busy to change diapers, ma\u2019am?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFirst of all, stop calling me ma\u2019am. I don\u2019t\u2019 expect that you call me mommy, but you can call me Charlotte.\u201d she replies \u201cAnd I stated that I would have been often too busy, it\u2019s true, but not always.\u201d<br>\r\nShe removes your romper and makes you lay on the changing surface, then ends her speech with \u201cYesterday I was very busy and I hadn\u2019t almost the opportunity to see my little princess. This morning I want to make up for.\u201d<br>\r\nHaving said that, she proceeds in changing your diaper. Except when she putted the diaper on you the first time on the plane, she has never changed you. Maybe two days ago you wouldn\u2019t have noticed it, but now you realize that Rose is much better at changing diapers than the queen is. In fact, queen Charlotte seems a little more insecure and the entire procedure is slower.<br>\r\nAfter you are changed into a fresh diaper, the queen helps you come down from the changing table.<br>\r\nShe then sits on a chair, saying \u201cNow, you can come over my lap.\u201d<br>\r\nYou instantly go pale, and you stutter \u201cBut \u2026 but \u2026 but I didn\u2019t do anything. Why do you want to spank me?\u201d<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Rose scolds the queen, saying \u201cYour Majesty, you cannot tell a little one to come over your lap without specifying the position where you want her. You scared her for nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d says Charlotte, blushing \u201cI\u2019m not that expert in this. Susan, I was saying that you can come to sit on my knees.\u201d<br>\r\nRelieved, you reach the queen and sit over her lap. She hugs you a starts to cradle you in her arms.<br>\r\n\u201cIs Rose going to spank you for this, Charlotte?\u201d you ask her, clearly joking.<br>\r\nThe two women burst out laughing, and Rose says, joking too \u201cOf course. I spank every naughty royal than resides in the palace.\u201d<br>\r\nThe maid then passes to the queen your breakfast, and she proceeds to spoon feed you.<br>\r\nAfter you have finished the baby food, Rose passes to the queen the bottle of milk. Holding you with her left arm, Charlotte gently puts the teat of the bottle in your mouth with her right hand.<br>\r\n\u201cSuck it all, my little angel.\u201d she says, smiling.<br>\r\nIt\u2019s quite humiliating to be suckled with a bottle, but you cannot deny that is quite relaxing.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud of you.\u201d the queen states, during your breakfast \u201cThe maids reported to me what you did yesterday in the laundry. I\u2019m impressed, just like them. And your teacher had complimented you, though you learned some demerits. As icing on the cake, you got punished just once, and not six times like the day before. When I look at you, I see the future of the country.\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, and when she removes the bottle you reply \u201cTo be honest, Charlotte, I\u2019ve received three punishments, just at the same time.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDetails.\u201d she says \u201cBut now I\u2019m even more proud. Honestly always rewards.\u201d<br>\r\nAfter a moment of silence, she add \u201cI\u2019m afraid I have to go now.\u201d<br>\r\nYou hug her, don\u2019t wanting to let her go. <br>\r\n\u201cPlease, stay with me.\u201d you whisper.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d love it, really. But I must go. The country needs me.\u201d With this words, she puts you down and leaves the room.<br>\r\nOnce again, you are left alone with your nanny.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to get dressed.\u201d she states.<br>\r\nShe then dresses you with a less babyish dress than usual.<br>\r\nThe dress is in fact a white cardigan, full of red ribbons and bows, and with an heart printed on the chest. It\u2019s frilly on the neck and around your bum, but is accompanied by a pair of red trousers that ends in a very VERY frilly part. For the first time, she doesn\u2019t put the lock on.<br>\r\n\u201cYou can go to play with Janet.\u201d says Rose, once you are dressed \u201cWhen you have the chance, come to see me. I will unlock Janet\u2019s card so she can play with videogames.\u201d<br>\r\nBut you don\u2019t move, and tell Rose \u201cI would like to stay here a couple more minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish, princess. I\u2019ll clean the bathroom. If you need me, simply call me.\u201d<br>\r\nAnd she disappears in the bathroom. For the first time, you are left completely alone.

With the locked on rompers and onesie this was not an option for you, especially not when you went to bed in a wet or full diaper.<br>\r\nThe last attention your private parts got haven been on the changing table, by Rose or Charlotte and you find it deeply humiliating that you started to get aroused when they wipe you down with wet wipes or rub oil between your legs. You decide that it is time to take pressure off the system, not to end on the changing table and grind your private parts against the hands of your caretaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around the room and find the play area suitable for some naughty fun.

Do you think we allow little girls to have naughty fun, so easily?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug, placing dump. \u201cOnce you said that you would prevent naughty fun, when I have been a bad girl. But I have been a good girl. I do not wear the lock any longer and got praised a lot. I think I deserve some playtime with my little kitten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose smiles about the cute expression for your private parts, but quickly shakes her head.<br>\r\n\u201cI am sorry, but that was a misunderstanding. We will ALWAYS prevent unauthorized manipulation of your private parts. You are too young and unexperienced to decide what your little body needs. We decide that for you or use it as a special treat, like ice-cream, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are shocked by that stupid logic. \u201cAre you telling me, that I am not allowed to masturbate \u2013 but YOU will make me cum from times to times, as a treat? That is sick!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose feels offended and misunderstood. \u201cIt is a part of the tradition and a key element of your education. You cannot deny that boys and girls can be easily controlled when you control their sexual needs and you must admit that the\u2026 frequency little ones would masturbate is insane. For that reasons we use it as a treat and in very, very rare cases as a punishment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou huff and fold your arms in front of your chest.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what does that mean for me?

Since you didn\u2019t know about the first of the two things, I will lenient about it. Mittens will not be followed by a locked onesie. And for your language you can be grateful that I don\u2019t resort to mouth soaping after having warmed up your bottom, since you should know about it.\u201d<br>\r\nYou feel a little humiliated, in been given a lesson during a spanking.<br>\r\nAfter some more slaps, she lets you stand up, puts your clothes back on you and, shaking her right forefinger in your direction, she adds \u201cThe next time you\u2019ll have unauthorized naughty fun, your spanking will be with the hairbrush, and not with the hand like this time. And next time you use foul language, you will not avoid the soap. It\u2019s that clear, princess?\u201d<br>\r\nStill sobbing, you nod.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess \u2026\u201d she adds, more sweetly \u201c\u2026 we are not bigots. We know that naughty fun \u2026 masturbation \u2026 it\u2019s a natural thing. You haven\u2019t been punished because we think that it\u2019s bad or sinful, or we wouldn\u2019t use it as a reward. It\u2019s because little ones need supervision, and cannot simply play with their body like adults do.\u201d<br>\r\nIn hearing her words, you calm yourself a little. <br>\r\n\u201cSo, I can ask you? And you will \u2026 well \u2026 you know.\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n\u201cAs I said, it\u2019s a reward. So you can ask for it if you have been a good girl. Be aware, however, that I can say no, even if you\u2019ve been good.\u201d<br>\r\nAfter havingsaid that, she takes a pair of mittens from a wardrobe. They are thick, pink and with kittens printed on.<br>\r\n\u201cHands forward.\u201d commands Rose.<br>\r\nGulping, you put your hands forward her. The nanny then puts the mittens at your hands.<br>\r\n\u201cGreat.\u201d you think \u201cNow I\u2019m completely unable to use my hands.\u201d<br>\r\nThey are not locked, but are so thick that you cannot remove one of them without using both hands. And since you can\u2019t use none of them, you are completely unable to do anything. Perhaps with Janet\u2019s help, however \u2026<br>\r\n\u201cNow you can go to find Janet.\u201d Rose adds, interrupting your thoughts \u201cAnd please, princess, don\u2019t do anything obvious and stupid, like having her removing them for you. I would know it, and you will both be in trouble.\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, realizing that your idea wasn\u2019t so ingenious.<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Fletcher \u2026 will everyone know that I had naughty fun in seeing me in mittens?\u201d you ask her, realizing that is not a think you would everuy servant in the palace to know about.<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone will probably perceive it, but most servants will simply deduce that you threw something at me and you\u2019ve been punished for that.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOk, someone will understand that I\u2019ve been that type of naughty while other will simply think I\u2019m a brat. Much better.\u201d you think, ironically.<br>\r\n\u201cIf you behave during the rest of the day \u2026\u201d concludes Rose, winking at you \u201c\u2026 I will not inform the queen about what happened. It can be our \u2026 little secret.\u201d<br>\r\nYou hug Rose, and then bye her and leave the nursery, looking for Janet.<br>\r\nWhen you reach her room and knock, she answers with a quite angry voice.<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJanet, it\u2019s me, Susan.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCome in!\u201d<br>\r\nYou enter her room, uncertain of why she is so angry. It can\u2019t be for the videogames, can it be?<br>\r\nYou look at your friend, who is waiting for you with her arms crossed.<br>\r\n\u201cJanet? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? WHAT\u2019S THE MATTER?\u201d she yells \u201cHow could you!?\u201d<br>\r\nSeeing that you don\u2019t really understand what the problem is, she reaches you, grabbing by your shoulders and giving you a firm slap on the bottom.<br>\r\n\u201cThat man!\u201d she says, calming a little \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you told me about this Richard?\u201d<br>\r\nYour skin goes pale, while you answer \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make you worry.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m your best friend!\u201d she says \u201cYou cannot simply hide to me that a man is trying to getting your throne!\u201d<br>\r\nYou are ashamed of yourself, thinking that she will never forgive you for this lack of trust, but she hugs you instead.<br>\r\n\u201cI love you!\u201d she exclaims \u201cI will protect you, always! You are my best friend!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJanet, I\u2019m sorry \u2026\u201d you stutter.<br>\r\n\u201cHush, Susan.\u201d she replies \u201cI\u2019m sorry too, I overreacted. But I heard two maids talking about him, and my blood frozen in my veins. I will not let him hurt you!\u201d<br>\r\nYou hug her tightly, and you simply spend a couple minutes like that.<br>\r\n\u201cI think you need to distract yourself a little.\u201d she states, after a while \u201cI have an idea.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it?\u201d<br>\r\nShe gives you a warm smile, answering \u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I mean, you do not know much about the country and she still treat you like you should know everything y heart \u2013 I mean, that is unfair!\u201d Janet says and want to hold your hand, when she notice your mittens.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what have you done to earn those?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush bright red and hide the mittens behind your back. \u201cWhy do you think I did anything? Maybe Rose put them on me, because she thought they are cute?!\u201d You try to convince her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet raise a brow and giggles. \u201cHey Princess, it is me, Janet, you cannot trick me. What have you done?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it is technically possible, you blush even more, while you stammer. \u201cShe caught me\u2026 I... shit Janet, do I have to tell you everything? \u2026. She caught me\u2026 scratching a certain kind of itch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet needs a second before she understands, but then she is laughing out hard.<br>\r\n\u201cOh Susan, you naughty little girl! I can\u2019t believe you let her caught you doing\u2026 that. Maybe I should find somebody else for my little prank?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly calm down and steer the conversation back to the prank.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, what is the plan? It cannot be too mean, since \u2013 I was told \u2013 Miss Spencer was not so bad \u2013 for Calonia standards.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet tells you that she found out that the teacher has a bedroom in the palace and since Calonia is so safe, she never locks her door. \u201cMiss Spencer is working like a clockwork. Every morning she is either teaching or taking long walks, therefore her room is free for about 4 hours, until she is back around lunch time. Her underwear is in her bottom-drawer and I still know where the baby-supplies are\u2026 .\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do not get it right away, so Janet helps you out.<br>\r\n\u201cWe swap her panties against diapers. So she either go commando or wear a diaper herself. I think that is more than fair after she treated you like a little girl in her class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are afraid to get caught, but the plan sound good and it is not like you hurt her or destroy anything. You simply throw all her underwear into the laundry-box and she will have them back a few days later, no damage and no harm.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, we do it, lets go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow Janet through the hallways until you stop at a door with the sign \u201cMiss Spencer\u201d. With those signs you can easily track down anybody in the palace. On your way some maids giggles when they saw you with the mittens and you have the feeling that all of them know why you wear yours. \u201cIf they are for throwing stuff or masturbating I would pick for the second myself.\u201d You think by yourself and try to hide the mittens whenever somebody cross your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Janet says is the door unlocked and to your embarrassment did nobody stopped you when you walked around with a big box of diapers in your arms.<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, why must I carry the diapers? You wear them as well?\u201d You complain, but Janet shrugs.<br>\r\n\u201cIt was my plan and you should be happy that the big box distracted the people from your mittens.\u201d She grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Miss Spencer\u2019s bedroom you find some awards like \u201cBest Teacher of the Year\u201d or \u201cChampion of Ice-Skating\u201d, something you would have never expected. Other than that, the room is not very personnel and you have the feeling that she was another apartment outside of the palace.<br>\r\nJanet\u2019s plan works fine. Yes, she took off your mittens, so you can fold all the diapers in the wardrobe, but before the two of you leave the room, she put them back on. You hope that Rose will not notice that \u2013 and it was not\u2026 okay, it was to do something forbidden, but at least not the same forbidden thing like before.<br>\r\nWith all underwear gone and the drawer full of diapers you and Janet check the room a last time to make sure you have left no evidence of your prank. When you leave the room again\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.\tYou ask Janet to get you ice-cream with her VIP card<br>\r\n2.\tThe two of you explore the castle further<br>\r\n3.\tYou run straight into somebody.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As soon as you turn the corner, however, you violently bump into someone, instantly hearing a yell and the rumor of a fallen laundry basket.<br>\r\nWhen your sight returns clear, you see a blonde maid, with terrorized puppy eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m really sorry!\u201d she yells, almost crying \u201cI didn\u2019t see you! Please, don\u2019t whip me!\u201d<br>\r\nBefore you can ever realize what is she saying, a man touches her shoulder. Is a man in his later thirties, with black hair and brown eyes. He is dressed in an elegant suit, with a pair of white gloves that particularly stand out.<br>\r\n\u201cElizabeth, you\u2019re making a scene. The princess is not going to whip you. No one is. Collect the laundry, apology, and continue with your business.\u201d he says, with a flat tone of voice.<br>\r\nThe maid does as she has been told and leaves.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d you ask, once that you and Janet are left alone with the man \u201cWhy she feared that I could whip her?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, princess.\u201d he replies, in his flat tone \u201cElizabeth is new here. She worked for House Grairven since a month ago.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGrairven!\u201d exclaims Janet, looking at you \u201cIt\u2019s his House, right? The House of that Richard.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, now fully aware of the fear of the maid, since you know that in House Grairven servants are whipped. You then look at the man with white gloves. It\u2019s the first male servant you\u2019ve seen, and you are curious about him.<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you, exactly?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess \u2026\u201d he says, looking at you like he\u2019s examining you \u201c\u2026 you will address to an adult saying Mr., Ma\u2019am or Miss, unless the adult hasn\u2019t given you permission to do otherwise, or the adult concerned will feel free to give you a spanking.\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, then say \u201cExcuse me, Mr., can I ask you who you are?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Benedict Harper. At your service, princess.\u201d he says.<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a male servant.\u201d you state \u201cI\u2019ve only seen maids so far.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThere are male servants in the palace, although in the minority compared to the maids.\u201d he answers \u201cBut I\u2019m not one of them. I\u2019m the Butler.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t butler the name of male maids?\u201d asks Janet, giving voice to your thoughts too.<br>\r\n\u201cMy dear, disregarding girls \u2026\u201d he replies \u201c\u2026 the Butler it\u2019s not a footman. A footman is the male equivalent of a maid. The First Footman is in charge of all footmen, the Housekeeper is in charge of all maids, and they both answer to the Butler.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWow!\u201d you exclaim \u201cSo you are the boss of all palace servants!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou can say that, yes.\u201d he answers \u201cHowever I don\u2019t consider myself a boss, rather an overseer.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo you \u2026\u201d you begin to say, with a naughty grin, but he interrupts you immediately.<br>\r\n\u201cIf you are about to ask me to remove your mittens because I\u2019m in a higher position than your nanny, you can forget about it.\u201d he states, perfectly seeing through your intentions.<br>\r\n\u201cBut you are the Butler.\u201d you exclaim, in a cute way that makes Janet giggle (she is watching the scene, amused) \u201cYou should obey me. I\u2019m the princess.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMy lady, the only person in this palace that can give me a direct order is the queen herself.\u201d he claims, then adding \u201cI also inform you that I\u2019m one of the four servants with the full authorization to spank you if you misbehave, the others are the Housekeeper, the First Footman and the Maid in charge of the nursery.\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush EXTREMELY deeply picturing yourself laid over this man knees with your bottom fully exposed. You\u2019d die of embarrassment.<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Benedict \u2026\u201d intervenes Janet \u201c\u2026 can I ask you something?\u201d <br>\r\nHe nods, saying \u201cI haven\u2019t much time left to spend with you, but I can answer to one question.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy that maid hadn\u2019t sued Richard? He abused her.\u201d she asks. You think it\u2019s a very smart question.<br>\r\n\u201cSuing him? With what charges? The ways of disciplining the servants are left at the noble\u2019s discretion. It\u2019s perfectly legal to use a whip to do that.\u201d he explains, making you angry.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? It\u2019s not illegal? That\u2019s impossible! So every noble can do that?\u201d you shout. The scene that you had in your nightmare, where Richard had beaten Rose, still fills you with anger.<br>\r\n\u201cTechnically speaking, yes. But as far as I know, only House Grairven does that. The others nobles tend to punish their servants in more \u2026 human ways.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI refuse to believe that Charlotte \u2026 I mean, the queen \u2026 hasn\u2019t done anything to change that!\u201d you exclaim.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, Calonia is technically an absolute monarchy, but with a lot of similarities to a constitutional monarchy. The queen has a great power, but cannot simply decide everything. The most important reforms must be approved by the Elder Council. If her powers were absolute, she could have simply had lord Richard exiled from the country and your path to the throne would be without obstacles.\u201d explains Harper. <br>\r\nJust as he finishes to talk, you add, lowering your head \u201cAnd as the Elder Council is made of nobles, and House Grairven is one of the most important noble houses in Calonia, Richard could do everything he wants once on the throne.\u201d<br>\r\nMiss Spencer told you about the Elder Council yesterday. <br>\r\nHarper nods, saying \u201cHe would have limitations too, but he would be enough influent to make serious damages to the country.\u201d<br>\r\nYou greet Harper, and then leave the corridor with Janet.<br>\r\nBefore you can say anything about the situation, Janet says \u201cTry to imagine the face of Miss Spencer today during our afternoon lesson. I\u2019m curious to see if she will really wear a diaper.\u201d<br>\r\nShe is trying to distract you, to don\u2019t make you think about your duties. And it\u2019s effective.<br>\r\n\u201cOur lesson?\u201d you ask her, while walking \u201cToday you\u2019re coming too?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d she confirms \u201cI\u2019m interested in the country that my best friend will rule one day. And I\u2019m curious about the result of our little prank.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI think we should go back to the nursery now.\u201d you say \u201cNanny Ro\u2026 I mean, maid Rose told me that she wanted to unlock your games console.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet giggles, saying \u201cNanny Rose, uh?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMaid! I said maid Rose!\u201d you exclaim, blushing.<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d she jokes \u201cAnother month and you will begin to call her mommy.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNah, that\u2019s the queen \u2026\u201d you begin to tell her, suddenly realizing what you\u2019re saying and adding \u201cWait, I didn\u2019t say anything. Forget about it.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet continues to giggle, as you head to your nursery. You even wetted yourself during the morning, and you hope that Rose will change you.<br>\r\nOnce at the nursery, you meet Rose. She \u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It does not look like you haven been THAT naughty again, but please tell me why?\u201d Rose demands.<br>\r\nYou bite down on your bottom lip, knowing that you can never tell her about the prank you played on Miss Spencer you consider to tell her a lie or simply stay quiet. You choose the second option.<br>\r\n\u201cI am sorry Miss Fletcher, it is a secret and I cannot tell you.\u201d You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mixture of anger and credit is shown on Rose\u2019 face, but as your nanny she cannot accept you to be disobedient. \u201cVery well, it did not had naughty fun but insist to keep quiet about the real reason. I hope it is worth it, because I have to punish you. Not telling me the truth, even hiding the truth by staying quiet is intolerable. I would gag you for the rest of the day with a pacifier, but since you have a lesson later today I need to do something else\u2026 I wash your mouth with soap, before and after lunch.\u201d You want to say that this is unfair, but then you remember the spankings you had and the enema and decide that from all the possible punishments you know, this is the least painful or humiliating.<br>\r\nYour mouth is washed out with soap, what is still very unpleasant, especially since Rose feed you your bottle of formula right afterwards. The taste of the \u2013 normally delicious \u2013 formula is ruined by the aftertaste of the soap and is takes you much longer to nurse from the baby bottle. As promised your mouth is washes out a second time right afterwards and therefore you drool heavily, when Rose put you to bed for your nap.<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Fletcher, I am very sorry.\u201d You say, before she put a pacifier in your mouth and dim the lights.<br>\r\n\u201cI hope so princess, I am disappointed that you do not trust me.\u201d Your nanny says.<br>\r\nShe look down at you for a minute, before she goes to the wardrobe and comes back with new mittens. They are bright pink, with a white cat in the shape of an M and, to your great dismay a little lock.<br>\r\nShe put them on your hands and ruffles your hair.<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I cannot trust you, I need to make sure you keep them on. And this ones leave no imagination about the reason you wear them.\u201d She grins and leaves you alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the twilight of the nursery you look at the mittens and sigh. \u201cSo the \u201cM\u201d tells everybody the I was\u2026 masturbating.\u201d You think and hug your stuffed rabbit. \u201cHey Mister Rabbit, do you think I should have told her about the prank? \u2026 Me neither, I cannot wait to see Miss Spencer\u2026 .\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring your nap you wet your diaper a bit more, but Rose does not seem to mind that, when she checks you after your nap. You do not dare to ask her to be changed and rather waddle into the corridor to meet Janet.<br>\r\n\u201cHey Susan, sorry for laughing at you, it was just\u2026 bizarre.\u201d Janet apologizes.<br>\r\n\u201cI know it is strange, but hey. Did you wet your diaper when you were laughing so hard?\u201d<br>\r\nNow Janet is blushing and nods slightly. \u201cA little bit. I asked a maid to be changed and she really suggested I should wear the diaper for longer and come back when it is worth to change her. Can you believe that?!\u201d<br>\r\nInstead of an answer you show her you new mittens: \u201cHa, and can you believe this?\u201d<br>\r\nJanet rubs your back while the two of you walk on to the classroom and knock on the door. When you are allowed to come in you find\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.\tMiss Spencer with a visible padding under her suit.<br>\r\n2.\tMiss Spencer and Ben the Butler<br>\r\n3.\tMiss Spencer with a dress (Commando)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sit down at you desks.\u201d<br>\r\nLooking at the desk where you sat yesterday, you see that another identical one is standing next to it. You do as you\u2019re told, internally laughing at seeing her padded.<br>\r\n\u201cNow, princess, you will explain to Janet yesterday entire lesson. You have 5 minutes.\u201d she states, while obviously looking at your mittens.<br>\r\n\u201c5 minutes? But the lesson took 1 hour and half!\u201d you protest.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and you will summarize it.\u201d she says, writing down something on her ring binger.<br>\r\n\u201cWonderful.\u201d you think \u201cDemerits already.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m waiting, princess.\u201d she says.<br>\r\nYou look at Janet and begin to summarize yesterday lesson.<br>\r\nWhen you are finished, Miss Spencer shakes her head. \u201cNo, princess. That wasn\u2019t acceptable. You focused on meaningless details and forgot about the important parts. Also, you did not punctuate the words well. It is a very important thing to keep in mind.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess \u2026\u201d you say, with an ironical tone \u201c\u2026 I earned demerits for it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI was going to give you three demerits, but since you insist on being so sarcastic, I\u2019ll give you five. Plus the one that you earned complaining before, for a total of six.\u201d she explain.<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you going to ask anything to Janet?\u201d you ask her \u201cOr are you going to test only me?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJanet can listen to the lesson and is free to ask questions if something is unclear to her, but since she is a guest, she will not be tested.\u201d is her answer.<br>\r\n\u201cSusan \u2026\u201d Janet whisper to you \u201c\u2026 I know you are frustrated about your situation, but I will be glad if you stop to try to get me in trouble too.\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, realizing that you are doing what she is saying.<br>\r\n\u201cYou should focus on your studies, princess.\u201d the teacher says \u201cAnd not on \u2026 naughty things.\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, knowing what she is talking about. In an unconditional reflex, you try to hide your mittens.<br>\r\nDuring the lesson, Miss Spencer gives you numerous information, included a lot of thing that will be very useful for the interview.  She tests you often, and she is pleased at most of your answer, but you made some mistakes.<br>\r\n\u201cGood but not excellent.\u201d she states, writing in her binger \u201cYou\u2019re inattentive.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent? How can one be excellent? I couldn\u2019t answer perfectly to all questions! It\u2019s impossible!\u201d you complain.<br>\r\n\u201cImagine that I\u2019m the reporter that is questioning you.\u201d she says, in a calm tone \u201cIf you reply something wrong, even to a single question, the entire interview would change. And what do you think? That you can simply say \u201cI\u2019m sorry, can I try with another one?\u201d ? No, princess. You\u2019ll have only a chance. If you waste it, the entire strategy will crumble.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet nods, adding \u201cI think \u2026 she is right, sister. I begin to understand why she was so \u2026 strict.\u201d<br>\r\nThe word strict was clearly said in place of \u201cmean\u201d. <br>\r\n\u201cYou should take example, princess.\u201d she says, looking at Janet \u201cYour friend seems a quicker learner than you.\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, thinking that she has not to remind you that. You\u2019re fully aware that Janet is smarter than you.<br>\r\nIn an impetus of pride, you exclaim \u201cEven Betty Harris is smarter than me, but she is an unbearable smarty-pants with no friends!\u201d<br>\r\nYou have formulated the sentence as a direct following to your thoughts, so it doesn\u2019t make perfect sense.<br>\r\n\u201cSusan, you have no much friends yourself, remember?\u201d intervenes Janet, shutting you up. <br>\r\nMiss Spencer shakes her head, saying \u201cA smarty-pants, uh? But I bet her grades was better than yours.<br>\r\n\u201cOf course! She was always licking teachers\u2019 asses!\u201d you exclaim, immediately regretting saying that.<br>\r\n\u201cFive demerits for bad language, princess. That makes 13 in total.\u201d says the teacher, writing down on her binger, before adding \u201cYou think that you are less smart then other people. It\u2019s right, princess? It\u2019s not true. You are smart. Smarter than most of the students I teach to. You only need to applicate yourself more.\u201d<br>\r\nYou are left without words. This is the first time she addressed you kindly.<br>\r\n\u201cThe lesson is over for today.\u201d she states, at the end \u201cWe only need to discuss about your \u2026 little prank.\u201d<br>\r\nBoth you and Janet go pale. Have you been discovered so easily?<br>\r\n\u201cThe Butler, Mr. Benedict, saw you just around my room. He told me about it. And shortly after I found that my underwear was missing. So, I made the math. As you can see, I was forced to wear what you left in my room.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWe are \u2026 sorry, Miss Spencer.\u201d you stutter. <br>\r\n\u201cYou should be.\u201d she says \u201cAnd I think you both need a punishment for this.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat punishment?\u201d Janet asks.<br>\r\n\u201cJanet, since you are a guest, you will not receive a Calonian punishment. I simply expect that you write 100 times on a paper that you should not do pranks. You will write it tonight and you will give it me tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\nYour friend nod, a little ashamed. <br>\r\n\u201cAnd for you, princess \u2026\u201d she adds, giving you a piece of paper \u201c\u2026 you\u2019ll get15 demerits for your prank. With the13 you gained during the lesson, you have 28 demerits today.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTwenty-eight?\u201d you exclaim \u201cRose will kill me!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou should have thought about it before.\u201d Miss Spencer simply states, dismissing you. So you and Janet leave the room.<br>\r\n\u201cThat Butler!\u201d you exclaim, once alone with your friend \u201cHe snitched on us!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI think that you can be grateful that he hasn\u2019t spanked you, Susan.\u201d she replies \u201cHe could have done that, remember?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me think about it.\u201d  you say, blushing \u201cI would be too embarrassed to even look him again if he does something like that.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet puts an hand on your shoulder, saying \u201cI wetted myself more during the lesson. What about you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMe too.\u201d you confirm, blushing once again \u201cI think we should go to Rose and get changed. Then I will submit to my punishment.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you opening Miss Spencer the note this time?\u201d she asks you.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not eager to know what 28 demerits involve.\u201d you answer, before adding with a smile \u201cAnd I want to enjoy your first diaper change.\u201d<br>\r\nYou laugh together, while going to the nursery once again.<br>\r\nThere \u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She unfold it and sighs deeply. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to know how you managed to earn such a high number.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm, Miss Fletcher, would you mind to change my diaper first. I could not use the bathroom during the lesson and it was a bit longer than I thought.\u201d Janet steps in and give you a few minutes before you are told what punishment you will receive. Strangely you do not feel better about it and regret that you haven\u2019t checked the note before. How you boil in your own fear, not knowing what will come.<br>\r\nAt least the diaper change of Janet is quit entertaining for you. Rose lifted your friend on the changing table and is about to give her a quick and professional diaper-change, when she suddenly stops. \u201cOh dear, we better take care of your hair first.\u201d Rose says and when she goes to a low cabinet you can see that Janet has some stubbles \u201cdown their\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem, I can shave it off later! Really!\u201d Janet says, but Rose is very quick and applies a cream from a little jar and says: \u201cNo worries my child, with this cream you do not need to worry about public hair for the next 2 to 3 years. The Princess got the same when I changed her the first time.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT?\u201d You and Janet yell out simultaneously.<br>\r\n\u201cSo it will not grow back for 3 years?\u201d Janet asks and looks quit sad, she had the idea about shaving it into a heart when she is back home \u2013 something she has to postpone now.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, public hair only cause hygienic issues, so we eliminate it from the beginning. Most woman keep using the cream later one as well.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet sighs and lay back, while Rose tapes her in a fresh diaper and helps her off the changing table.<br>\r\n\u201cOff you go, except you like to watch your friend getting punished.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way Rose is saying that leaves no doubt that she think, that Janet should better leave. Therefore Janet hugs you and wishes you luck, before she leaves to play some video games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow for you princess. Miss Spencer suggest some public humiliation. Further, she is writing that you would not masturbate if your diaper would be messy \u2013 what I agree with.\u201d Rose says and helps you on the changing table.<br>\r\n\u201cYou are quiet wet little one. \u201c She says, when she takes away out diaper and replace it with a new one. It is the same thick one that force you to waddle already, but now she add two booster pads in the middle to make it as thick as a pillow. \u201cThis is already part of your punishment, little one. I am sorry, but on the positive side I can say that the worst part will be over when you go to bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the golden clock at the wall and count three hours, two if you are lucky, before you receive dinner and be put in the crib. \u201cI am really sorry for pranking Miss Spencer and I am sorry for not telling you the truth, but Janet was involved and I wanted to protect her.\u201d You say, trying to soften your punishment on the last meters.<br>\r\nRose nods her head: \u201cIt is good that you feel sorry now, but at the same time I am disappointed that you are now blaming Janet. Even when she was involved or it was her idea, you should resist the urge to be naughty, that would have saved both of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose wheels in the rack with the enema-kit, but today it looks much fuller that yesterday.<br>\r\n\u201cToday you receive 2qt (2L), that is also the reason why you have the booster pads. The diaper has to last until tomorrow morning.\u201d She explains and pushes the hose up your behind. While the warm water filly our colon Rose applies a mass of anti-rash cream on your private parts and is extra careful NOT to cause you stimulation on your most sensitive bits. She know you want to find release, but you are faaar away from earning it.<br>\r\nAfter the water is all inside your behind, Rose tapes the diaper close and puts some lockable plastic pants over them. They are clear and pink and the word BRAT is printed on the behind. It is designed for pure humiliation.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay princess, now the final parts and we can begin out walk.\u201d Rose says. She put a tight fitting camisole over you that is only long enough to hide your little breasts, before she adds a baby bib with the words NAUGHTY BABY printed on it. The last item are baby reins that she buckels over your chest.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease go on hands and knees, so we can walk around the garden, Princess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are shocked. In the mirror you can see your reflection. The super thick diaper that will be wet and messy within minutes, the little top with the reins. Arms, bells and legs are naked and cannot think about leaving the room like this. \u201cNo, I cannot go out like this! No way!\u201d You say and look at Rose.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease Miss Fletcher, I know I was a bad girl, but this is too much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you arguing with me Princess? I can ask Benedict to give you a spanking in the garden, by the fountain, with all maids watching?!\u201d Rose says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT? NO! I mean\u2026. Oh please\u2026 .\u201d You already have tears of shame in your eyes when you go down on hands and knees. \u201cPlease go quickly, I want to be back as soon as possible.\u201d You beg Rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose is not the limiting factor on your way through the hallway and into the garden, it is your tummy. In the beginning you crawl quickly, but then you have more and more cramps and helplessly fill your diaper. While you expel the water and\u2026 other stuff you cannot move on and Rose has to wait for you. Like a puppy she pat your head and rub your back to comfort you. A few maids walk by and even while none of them is saying a word you notice that they walk slower and stare at you.<br>\r\nAfter you have filled your diaper you crawl much slower, with the extra weight between the legs. The plastic pants hold the squishy mass against your skin and you whimper with every meter you make.  In the garden you try to speed up again, but then Rose stops and hold you back with the baby reins.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Elisabeth, nice to see you. I thought you go home right after the lesson to get some new\u2026 clothes.\u201d Rose greets Miss Spencer. Your teacher is sitting on a bench with Benedict and enjoys a joyful conversation.<br>\r\n\u201cOh Rose, Yes you would think that, but I wanted to know what kind of punishment our dear princess receive \u2013 and now I can see it with my own eyes. I am very pleased, Rose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenedict walks around you and nods his head. \u201cYes indeed, I hope she will learn her lesson after this experience.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a dog you pull at the reins and thankfully Rose walks on. You do not say a word and pretend to be invisible, but when you are back in the nursery you sit down on your soaked diaper and cry out.<br>\r\n\u201cI can never face them again!\u201d you howl.<br>\r\nRose takes the reins and the bib off and hugs you tightly. \u201cHush Princess, You don\u2019t want to know what punishments Queen Charlotte had to endure, back in that days and now everybody is respecting her.\u201d<br>\r\nYou need a while to calm down and Rose is hugging you and comforts you until you nod your head and try to get back on your feet \u2013 what is not working.<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t walk with that diaper.\u201d You sob. \u201cMiss Fletcher, can you please change me into a fresh diaper? I promise to be good, but this diaper is just too thick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose rub your back. In theory she only has to feed you and put you to bed, but the little stroll around the garden was very humiliating for you and very stressful. Well earned, but stressful! She decides to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe it was a little similar, yes, but Rose really cares about you, and that\u2019s the main difference. She would never do something like that to just free humiliate you.<br>\r\nWith a loving hand, she undress you and gives you a nice bath, before putting on you a fresh diaper. It\u2019s a thick one, but without booster pads. <br>\r\nShe then proceeds dress you in a purple romper (that same that you wore during today\u2019s nap) and to feed you, and then puts you in the crib, before turning the lights off and leaving the nursery.<br>\r\nYou hug your stuffed friend, Mister Rabbit, and begin to fall asleep.<br>\r\nAs you are about to flee in dreams world, however, you hear voices outside the door.<br>\r\n\u201cYour majesty, can I ask what are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\nThat\u2019s Rose.<br>\r\nThe queen\u2019s voice replies \u201cBenedict told me about the princess behaviour.

I bet that you still remember my hairbrush.\u201d Samantha replies \u201cAnd I still hope that you\u2019ll let a true Calonian ascend to the throne instead of that girl.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about Richard!\u201d Rose exclaims \u201cYou traitor! He would ruin our country!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSamantha, Rose, you are both dismissed.\u201d the queen says, sternly, before adding \u201cRose is in charge of the nursery, and with her methods she will rise a beautiful queen. Times change, Samantha.\u201d<br>\r\nIf they say something else, you don\u2019t hear it, because you fall asleep.<br>\r\nWhen morning comes, you are awakened by Rose. She is smiling at you.<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, my little sunshine.\u201d she says.<br>\r\n\u201cEvery morning that I awake seeing you is a good morning, nanny Rose.\u201d you reply. That came quite spontaneous, but you think that could have sound a little obsequious.<br>\r\nShe smiles again, and helps you getting out of your crib, saying \u201cOh, my princess. You are so cute.\u201d<br>\r\nShe checks your diaper, but you\u2019re dry. With yesterday enema, you were almost empty when you went to sleep.<br>\r\nAs Rose is about to take you out of your romper, the queen enters in the room.<br>\r\n\u201cThere is my naughty princess.\u201d she says, smiling a little \u201cI hope that you\u2019ll be on your best behaviour today.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI promise!\u201d you exclaim \u201cI\u2019ll do my best! I\u2019ll be an obedient girl and I will focus during today\u2019s lesson! I\u2019ll make you both proud of me!\u201d<br>\r\nAs you say that, you think that Calonian tradition is far from being accepted by you, but you\u2019ll try to stay out of trouble for today.<br>\r\nThe women looks at each other, and then hug you simultaneously.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, my little sunshine!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s my girl!\u201d say Rose and Charlotte respectively.<br>\r\n\u201cUrgh! That\u2019s enough! You two are choking me!\u201d you yell, but in a cute voice.<br>\r\nThey release you, laughing.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve been quite naughty.\u201d the queen concludes \u201cBut since seems that you\u2019ll be good today, everything it\u2019s okay.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, at least you have done nothing too shameful.\u201d adds Rose, looking sideways in the queen direction \u201cFor example, you haven\u2019t thrown a glass full of wine to the queen during a royal banquet and were putted in mittens in front of all guests.\u201d<br>\r\nThe queen\u2019s cheeks become the colour of a freshly spanked bottom, as she exclaims \u201cRose! That\u2019s private!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, your majesty.\u201d the nanny says, giggling a little \u201cI was trying to make the princess feels at ease.\u201d<br>\r\nThe queen leaves the room, saying bye to you and throwing a stare at Rose.<br>\r\nAfter this little show, Rose removes your romper and puts you in the most childish onesie that you have ever seen. It\u2019s like a little kid jammies, blue and in the shape of a unicorn, very large and with a hood that had ears, eyes and a horn.<br>\r\n\u201cRose!\u201d you exclaim \u201cI\u2019ll die of embarrassment!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, princess, don\u2019t say that. It\u2019s so cute.\u201d she says, clearly convinced about what she\u2019s saying.<br>\r\nShe completes the procedure putting a lock on. It\u2019s obvious, since you have been really bad yesterday.<br>\r\nAfter being dressed and having your breakfast, you go to Janet's room. Together ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It seems to be a good idea and maybe lowers the number to demerits you will earn today.<br>\r\nIt is still early in the morning and very quiet. You hear birds chirp and only see one maid, wiping the floor.<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Princess Susan, good morning Janet.\u201d The maid greets you as you walk by them. You sigh a sigh of relieve that her behaviour has not changed, since your shameful stroll around the garden, the evening before.<br>\r\nIn front of Miss Spencer\u2019s door it is absolutely quiet. You are about to knock, when you and Janet hear laughing behind the door.<br>\r\n\u201cBen, let me go I need to get changed.\u201d You hear Miss Spencer and footsteps.<br>\r\n\u201cOh come one, you can in bed for a couple more minutes.\u201d You hear the deep voice of the butler Benedict.\u201d You look at Janet with big eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cThey are a couple!\u201d You whisper in excitement.<br>\r\n\u201cOr they just had a good night.\u201d Janet grins and the two of you put your ears back on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBEN! Stop that, you naughty boy, I need my underwear.\u201d You hear Miss Spencer.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? You look so cute in your diaper.\u201d Benedict is chuckling.<br>\r\nYou hear something like a slap and a door is slammed close, probably the bathroom door.<br>\r\nJanet and you are about to knock on the door now, but you hesitate and continue listening. Somebody is walking around the room and then a door is opened and you can hear heels.<br>\r\n\u201cHa, finally back in real underwear.\u201d Miss Spencer says in a triumphal voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoy it honey, you know I put your ass in a diaper as soon as you go to bed.\u201d Benedict says and Miss Spencer giggles like a schoolgirl. \u201cBen, you are so naughty!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but still it is you that get the bottom spanked.\u201d He laughs out. Her next words are muffled and Janet makes kissing noises beside you. You hold back a smile, nod at her and finally knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a few seconds before she answers. \u201cYes, please.\u201d Miss Spencer says and you and Janet walk into her room.<br>\r\nThe windows are open, the bed is made and the butler is nowhere to see. \u201cThey are super quick.\u201d You think and smile at Miss Spencer.<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Spencer, we came to apologise for the prank we played on you and that you have been forced to wear a diaper yesterday. We are very sorry and promise that we will never prank you again, so you don\u2019t have to wear a diaper again.\u201d You say in a controlled and super serious voice. Janet beside you begins to turn red and you pray that she can hold back her laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately Miss Spencer is avoiding looking at you, since she is blushing herself. Her eyes fall on the bathroom door and you can almost feel the butler standing behind it and supressing a laugher as well.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you princess Susan, thank you Janet that is very mature of you. I will see you in the classroom in an hour.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod your head and the hood fall over your head. This makes Miss Spencer smile. \u201cPrincess, the onesie you wear is the cutes ones I have ever seen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly you pull the hood back and leave the room, followed by Janet.<br>\r\n\u201cTime for pancakes!\u201d Janet claps her hand and overtakes you. \u201cEnjoy your bottle, princess!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile weakly, but you are not really jealous. Rose is always preparing great tasting formula and mush for you. Okay, you miss to bite on something and have to chew, but other than that you cannot complain. You only hope that Rose will stay your nanny and she is not replaced with that mean women you have heard outside in the hallway. Almost at the door a horrible thought pops up in your mind. \u201cDamn it, Rose shall never become sick or go on leave, or visit friends,\u2026 oh no. There are various reasons why she could leave me alone for a few days \u2013 or weeks \u2013 and I am sure the queen cannot take care of me herself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought in mind you let Rose feed you your breakfast, before you go to your classroom.<br>\r\nIn front of the classroom you first meet Janet and then\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One is a boy, the other is a girl. They are about your age.<br>\r\nThe boy is wearing simple red sweatpants, with a visible padding under them. He\u2019s also wearing a white long sleeved shirt, that would have been quite mature, if not for the printed part. On his chest is in fact printed a red heart under a sentence written in blue letters: \u201cMommy\u2019s baby boy\u201d.<br>\r\nHe is quite a nice looking boy, but the first word your mind come up with in seeing him is not \u201cnice looking\u201d, but \u201ccute\u201d.<br>\r\nThe girl, instead, is wearing an exact copy of the onesie that you were wearing during your landing in Calonia. Her, however, is not pink, but yellow, and without any lock. <br>\r\nShe has a big pair of glasses, with very thick lenses. So thick that you have difficulties in seeing her eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cLet me introduce you to the others children that resides in the palace.\u201d says the queen \u201cWilliam and Meredith Kent. They are the prime minister\u2019s children.\u201d<br>\r\nYou greet them, and they greet you back.<br>\r\n\u201cThey normally have morning lessons with Miss Spencer. Since she is busy today\u2019s afternoon, you will attend class with them for today.\u201d the queen explains, before say bye and leave.<br>\r\nAfter you are left alone, the boy named William come closer to you, saying \u201cSo you are the princess. You are not ugly as I thought. In fact, you are not ugly at all.\u201d<br>\r\nShould this be considered a compliment? You are not sure about it.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you are not so bad yourself.\u201d you reply, a little unsecure. You have never met a boy about your age still in diapers, after all.<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d he replies, quite full of himself \u201cWe are the children of the prime minister. We are not babies like you are.\u201d<br>\r\nBefore you can say anything, the girl next to him intervenes, with a very shy tone of voice \u201cBut William ... I mess myself every night, and nanny Melissa always says that you are the bigger wetter in the country.\u201d<br>\r\nWilliam instantly turns red as a tomato and turns to her, exclaiming \u201cSis! That\u2019s not a thing you should say to strangers!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t I? Why? It\u2019s the truth.\u201d she says, lowering her head \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve messed up again.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet immediately steps in, saying \u201cYou should apology to her!\u201d<br>\r\nHe simply shakes his head, replying \u201cShe the one that have embarrassed me. Why should I be the one to apology?\u201d<br>\r\nIgnoring him, you reach Meredith, saying \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Meredith, right? I\u2019m Susan. It\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d<br>\r\nWithout the slightest notice, she hugs you tightly, saying \u201cI\u2019m glad to meet you too. I hope that we\u2019ll become great friends.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHey, back off!\u201d Janet suddenly exclaims, putting an hand on your shoulder and moving her away from you \u201cShe\u2019s mine!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUmh ... Janet?\u201d you whisper to her \u201cDon\u2019t you think that you are a bit too ... possessive?\u201d<br>\r\nRealizing it, she deeply blush, telling Meredith at once \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I have a tendency to overreact.\u201d<br>\r\nIn response, Meredith hug her too, saying \u201cNo problem. I want to be your friend too.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet becomes crimson, and you try to do your best for not laughing.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m ... Janet, by the way.\u201d she says, trying to not been rude to Meredith.<br>\r\nSuddenly, you all hear a stern voice \u201cChildren! I\u2019m waiting for you. You\u2019ll all get demerits for not entering straight in the classroom.\u201d<br>\r\nMiss Spencer, of course. Not wanting to upset her more, you all enter the classroom.<br>\r\nThe office is now much similar to a classroom, having four desks instead of one or two. For the first time, you notice a door hidden in a corner of the room. You are sure that it lead to a warehouse full of desks.<br>\r\nYou, Janet and William go straight to the respectively desks, while Meredith reaches miss Spencer.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, miss Spencer. I wanted to make acquaintance with the princess and I distracted her. You should give her demerits to me, instead.\u201d she says.<br>\r\nYou blush, not believing in your hears.<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d you exclaim \u201cIt\u2019s my fault that I got distracted, not yours! And if you want to blame someone for it, you should blame your brother!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d he asks, whit a loud tone of voice.<br>\r\n\u201cSilence!\u201d intervenes miss Spencer, almost -almost- yelling \u201cI\u2019m the one who decide who\u2019s getting demerits, and for this little show you all will get extra\u2019s. All three of you.\u201d<br>\r\nOf course, Janet is exonerated in the demerits system, since she is a guest.<br>\r\nMeredith sits at her desk, and the lesson begins. During it ...</span></div></div>",

With her four students Miss Spencer is teacher I wider range and does not focus on your enemy Richard or the history of Calonia only. This way you learn something about the surprisingly strong economy of the country and that the country is famous for their innovators.<br>\r\nThe worst part of the lesson is math. That seems to be following you, no matter in what country you live.<br>\r\nWilliam is average smart, but clever enough to raise his hand whenever he is sure to know the right answer. Miss Spencer let him give the answers and leave him alone for the rest of the lesson. Meredith is very shy, especially with Jane and you around and does not raise her hand at all \u2013 a strategy that does not work with Miss Spencer.<br>\r\n\u201cMeredith, can you please give the answer to my question.\u201d Miss Spencer calls her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeredith blushes and looks down on her papers. \u201cI\u2026 I am not sure, maybe 6?!\u201d She almost whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spencer knows that Meredith can do better and keep pushing her. \u201cMeredith, please. Give me an answer and mean it. Do not fraise it like a question.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl with the heavy glasses bite down on her bottom lip and starts to fidget on her seat. \u201cBut I do not know it for sure, Miss Spencer.\u201d She starts to write down another calculation, but Miss Spencer is pushing more.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease Meredith you know the answer. Just tell it straight ahead!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam, who sits beside his sister leans over and whispers something to her. Meredith seems surprised, but repeats his words. \u201c5, I am sure it is 5!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spencer sighs and shakes her head. \u201cNo it was 6, from the beginning. You need to concentrate better and trust yourself. William, one demerit for whispering, Meredith five demerits for asking me instead of answering.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? But five points mean\u2026 .\u201d Meredith looks around in panic and tries to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Miss Spencer turns her back to the group of you William leans over to his sister. \u201cYou get a spanking on your hiney.\u201d He says in a singsong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeredith hisses at him and slaps his arm \u2013 what is seen by Miss Spencer.<br>\r\n\u201cMeredith! 5 demerits for hitting your brother!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeredith jumps up and starts to pleas: \u201cNo Miss Spencer, you know what Nanny Melissa does when I have 10 demerits! It was his fault alone, he is an idiot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour teacher shakes her head and point her finger at Meredith\u2019s chair. \u201cSit down young lady, you only make it worse right now. And the longer you talk back to me, the more points you will earn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam giggles, while his sister stand beside him, with her arms folded across her chest. \u201cNo Miss Spencer, this is unfair!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeredith, one point, two points, three points\u2026. I can continue until the lesson is over\u2026 four points.\u201d Miss Spencer keeps counting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan cannot stand this any longer and pokes her in the side. \u201cSit down Merry, she will continue forever. You cannot bet her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Meredith sits down and the lesson continues. She is angry at Miss Spencer and refuse to give any more answers, until Janet and Susan can convince her to at least try it, but by that time she had earned 8 more demerits. When the lesson is over, Miss Spencer ask Susan, William and Meredith to stay a bit longer, while Janet can leave.<br>\r\n\u201cYou get your notes for your nannies. Princess Susan, you only earned 9 points today, what is a great improvement. Stop whispering with your neighbors and you can press that number further down. William, you did very well and only earn 4 points. Please be nicer to your sister that will help her and yourself.\u201d She give both their notes, before she turns to Meredith: \u201cMy dear, It was obviously not a good day for you. I am not sure if it is because of the princess and her friend, but you have to work on your self-assurance when it comes to giving the right answers. Your little outburst was simply stupid and I am sorry that it took you so long to understand this. In total you have earned 29 demerits. Please give this note to your nanny right after the lesson.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeredith is pale when she walks out of the classroom. William seems carefree and walks on, while Janet and Susan try to cheer her up.<br>\r\n\u201cHey Meredith, it will not be so bad. At least it will be over tonight \u2013 hm, isn\u2019t that the rule?!\u201d Susan tries.<br>\r\nMeredith shakes her head and sobs. \u201cNo, nanny Melissa will put a lock on me and extend the punishment over days. She is super strict when we misbehave. Oh I was so stupid! You know, she gives enemas after ten points and I hate those, which is why I wanted Miss Spencer to take back some points.\u201d<br>\r\nSusan nods her head and rubs her back.<br>\r\n\u201cI understand that. Will it help if we talk to her?\u201d<br>\r\nMeredith shakes her head. \u201cNo, she will punish me according to the 29 points, no matter if you talk to her or not.\u201d She sighs and turns to leave. \u201cI better go now, or I earn a punishment for being late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan and Janet look after her, feeling very sorry for her.

It\u2019s not fair!\u201d you insist saying.<br>\r\n\u201cI see, you\u2019ve met the prime minister\u2019s children.\u201d she states, beginning to understand \u201cWilliam the bold and Meredith the shy.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a bully!\u201d you say \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t his nanny punishes him for it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be too harsh on him, princess.\u201d Rose replies, rubbing your back \u201cWilliam and Meredith always quarrel, and William is quite eager to get her in trouble with mischief. But I assure you that, despite his demeanor, he cares about her. Years ago he risked his life to save her when she fell in a well. As for the punishment question \u2026 have you talked to Melissa about it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t, Meredith told us it would have been pointless.\u201d Janet intervenes.<br>\r\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have avoided her punishment for her demerits, it\u2019s true. But I suggest you to talk to Melissa about what happened. You know, Meredith cannot prove her words alone, since they are worth as William\u2019s, but if the princess and her best friend testify \u2026\u201d she concludes, with a grin \u201c\u2026 William the bold will face some consequences.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, smiling \u201cYou\u2019re right! That\u2019s what we must do!\u201d<br>\r\nYou reach Janet, but Rose cough.<br>\r\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you forgot anything, princess?\u201d she says.<br>\r\n\u201cUhm? No?\u201d you try.<br>\r\n\u201cThe note with YOUR demerits, princess.\u201d Rose states, in a very strict voice.<br>\r\nBlushing, you give her the note.<br>\r\nShe opens it up, and smiles.<br>\r\n\u201cNine demerits? And for minor things. That\u2019s my little angel.\u201d she seems happy, but she suddenly stops to smile, adding \u201cStill, since they are more than 5. The maximum you can get to avoid a punishment is 4. So, I have to give you a spanking.\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush and calmly nod you head, knowing that is better to make it quick.<br>\r\nTo your surprise, however, Janet steps in, saying \u201cMiss Fletcher! Don\u2019t punish her! It was my fault if she was distracted.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJanet, I don\u2019t need \u2026\u201d you begin, but she interrupts you.<br>\r\n\u201cHush, little unicorn, I\u2019m talking to your nanny. Miss Fletcher, for this time, you should punish me instead of her.\u201d<br>\r\nRose seems shocked, and it takes a while for her to say \u201cJanet, if you take the guilt and accept to be punished in her place, I will not give you a non Calonian punishment, but I will spank you bare. Are you sure about it?\u201d<br>\r\nShe seems determined, adding \u201cI made her waste the occasion to get 0 demerits. It\u2019s my fault, and my conscience would keep me awake at night if I let her be punished for this.\u201d<br>\r\nYou cannot believe your hears. Is she serious?<br>\r\n\u201cVery well. Since you are so determined, I will punish you instead.\u201d Rose says, sitting at her chair \u201cCome here, Janet.\u201d<br>\r\nYou look at the scene, almost alienated. Janet gives you a wink, before reaching Rose.<br>\r\nThe maid pushes Janet over her lap, takes down her pants and her diaper comes down as well. <br>\r\n\u201cHave you ever been spanked, Janet?\u201d your nanny asks her. <br>\r\nJanet shakes her head, replying \u201cNo, miss. Never.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI thought so. I hope this will be a lesson to you.\u201d<br>\r\nAnd with these words, Rose gives a firm slap over your friend bottom. You see Janet winces as the hand makes contact. It happens again, and again. This is the first time you see someone else getting spanked, and you are not sure you like it. Maybe watching it is more painful (metaphorically speaking) that being over Rose\u2019s lap.<br>\r\nAfter some other smacks, Rose lets Janet getting up. The maid re-dresses her, and then gives her a hug.<br>\r\n\u201cThat was very brave, Janet.\u201d she says \u201cYou are a wonderful friend for the princess.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet smiles too, happy that it\u2019s over. You\u2019re almost jealous: you usually start to cry after few slaps, but Janet endured her entire spanking without shedding a tear.<br>\r\n\u201cYou can go to your friend\u2019s nursery. Melissa would be eager to listen to you. But after that you will return here to have your lunch. It\u2019s that clear, princess?\u201d says Rose, looking at you.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, nanny Rose.\u201d you reply.<br>\r\nYou and Janet quickly search for the other nursery in the palace. When you find it, you knock at the door.<br>\r\n\u201cCome in.\u201d a voice says. Is the voice of a woman.<br>\r\nYou enter. The nursery is very similar to yours, but without golden things.<br>\r\nThere are two persons inside. One is Meredith. She is wearing a very skin-tight blue onesie with the sentence \u201cI\u2019m a naughty girl\u201d embroidered at the belly. You notice a lock on it. And her padding is really massive. You know what that means: a thick diaper with booster pads. She is crying and doesn\u2019t even notice you, while sitting on a changing table.<br>\r\nThe other is a very tall woman (about 6,5 ft) with long brown hair, dressed exactly like Rose. It\u2019s clearly Melissa, that stands in the center of the room.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess Susan.\u201d she says, seeing you. Her voice is melodious, but her tone is strict. \u201cWhat do I owe the pleasure to having you in my nursery?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWe are here to talk about William\u2019s behavior.\u201d you state.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d she replies.<br>\r\nAnd you proceed to tell her everything that happened during the lesson.<br>\r\nWhen you finish, she shakes her head \u201cThat boy. He\u2019s always a trouble.\u201d<br>\r\nShe then looks at the door that obviously lead to the bathroom, exclaiming \u201cWilliam! Come here this instant!\u201d<br>\r\nThe door opens, and William enter, dressed as before.<br>\r\n\u201cHave you done punishing Meredith, nanny Melissa?\u201d he asks, before noticing you and exclaiming \u201cPrincess? What are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe told me about your attitude, little one.\u201d she says, pointing a finger at him \u201cHer words matches with Meredith\u2019s. So, I have confirmation that you\u2019ve been a bully today.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo! They\u2019re lying!\u201d he yells, stepping back. Not so tough, uh?<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t like bullies. Not a single bit. You will be punished, Willy, and Merry will watch it. The princess and her friend can stay too, if they want.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are not sure if you like to see another punishment after you watched Janet receive a spanking only a couple of minutes ago. Beside you, you see Janet nodding her head eagerly and so you nod as well.<br>\r\n\u201cNO! They can\u2019t stay! They can\u2019t see me naked! I am a boy!\u201d William shouts and steps back further until he hit the door to the bathroom and stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanny Melissa follows him and pulls him to the changing table by his ear. \u201cYou are a little boy and got your poor sister into trouble in front of the princess and her friend, it is only fair that they can be sure that you receive a proper punishment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeredith hops down from the changing table and hols her bloated belly.<br>\r\n\u201cNanny Melissa, if it is clear that it was his fault, can I use the potty to expel\u2026 the enema?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst the tall nanny tells William to start undressing, while she kneels down and wipe a last tear from Meredith\u2019s face. \u201cSorry little one, but you disobeyed your teacher and only for that I would give you an enema. I know you do not like them, but that is exactly why they work as a punishment for you, better than a spanking or a mouth-soaping.\u201d<br>\r\nMerry nods, but looks sad, until her nanny takes off the lock from her onesie.<br>\r\n\u201cBut I will change you before bedtime and you do not have to wear the lock, not at all.\u201d Her nanny says and gives her a light kiss on the forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime William is standing in front of the changing table and covers his private parts with his hands. His face is red and he looks like a little boy that exactly knows what is waiting for him.<br>\r\n\u201cI still think they should leave.\u201d He says as his nanny takes her seat on a wooden chair and pats her lap. \u201cI know that you think that little boy, but I tell you now for the second time that they will stay. Now be quiet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnwillingly Willy lay over her lap and tries to hold back his tears as long as he could. But nanny Melissa is slapping his behind hard with a brush and he quickly melts and starts to cry like a baby. When the short, but hard spanking is over he has issues to stay straight and hold his red behind. By this he forgets about his private parts and Janet and you can see that he is as hairless as all \u201ckids\u201d are. You giggle and Janet is blushing a bit while she stares at his privates. Merry stands beside you and smiles weakly. It is good for her to see that her brother gets what he deserve, but her tummy is causing her trouble and before her brother is lifted on the changing table she starts to fill her waiting diaper, blushing deep red.<br>\r\n\u201cI am sorry.\u201d She whimpers when you and Janet look at her.<br>\r\n\u201cNo need for that, I had it yesterday as well.\u201d You say and rub her back. Merry smiles and lean against you, while you see, with upraise that William is strapped down at wrists and ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeredith sees the question in your faces and whispers to you.<br>\r\n\u201cHe has the tendency to fight and kicked in the past. That is years ago, but our nanny still straps him down to make sure he behaves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam has his eyes closed and avoids to look at you, while his nanny prepares an enema-kit. It looks funny when she comes back and slides the hose up his behind. You giggle, until you remember that you must have looked the same.<br>\r\nWilly moans, as the water fills his colon and starts to fidget on the table.<br>\r\n\u201cLook! LOOK!\u201d Janet whispers to you and point at his\u2026 manhood, it is getting erect and quiet impressive \u2013 for what you can say.<br>\r\nJanet is laughing out hard now, until nanny Melissa turn to her and warns her.<br>\r\n\u201cHush little girl, that is common for little boys. The water is pressing on his prostate, what cause the erection. It is not that he likes it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease do not look!\u201d William begs and for the first time you feel a little bit sorry for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all water is in, he is put in a diaper, as thick as the one of his sister is wearing and dressed in a black romper with the word \u201ctroublemaker\u201d on his chest. You think it looks kind of cool, but it still marks him as a naughty boy. And that after he always tries to look as mature as possible.<br>\r\n A lock is put on him and soapy pacifier is pushed into his mouth.<br>\r\n\u201cYou will keep the paci in all day, except when you are feed. Maybe you learn that your big mouth can get you in trouble. The lock stays on you for the rest of the week and that diaper stays on until breakfast, tomorrow!\u201d his nanny says.<br>\r\nWilliam looks angry at Janet and you, but nods his head and begins to suck on the soapy pacifier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now Meredith has filled her diaper, but the pain is gone and she thanks Janet and you. \u201cHey, thank you for coming around. I hope he will not be so mean to me for a while \u2013 and I will be less shy around you, since I know you are so nice to me.\u201d She hugs you first and then Janet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam waddles to the corner, sits down on a thick play-carpet and hugs a teddy bear. He looks kind of cute you have to admit and Janet keeps starring at him the whole time, with flushed cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay the show is over, I think you better to back now, or I get in trouble with Nanny Rose.\u201d Nanny Melissa says and gives you and Janet pat on your padded behinds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the hallways, Janet seems stirred up and wants to talk about Willy\u2019s punishment and his\u2026 reaction to the enema. \u201cDid you know that would happen? I had no clue. Gosh it was so cute to see him blush\u2026. .\u201d<br>\r\nShe keeps talking until the two of you reach your nursery, where you stop her. \u201cJANET! Do not freak out. He is still a brat and will seek for revenge. If you find his.. thing so fascinating I suggest you look for another boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm sorry, maybe you are right, I got carried away. And he is in diapers all the time, what is cute, but not helpful if it comes to... you know?!\u201d Janet says, scratching her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you are blushing as well. Janet is only a few months older than you and is thinking about sex! \u201cHello? I am sorry to say that, but either you wait until you are back home or you get used to it. All minor boys wear diapers what means until\u2026 18 or 21?? Get used to it or look for an older one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Janet looks disgusted. \u201cSure, as if I would let a twentysomething years old touch me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the conversation is over and she goes for lunch while you enter the nursery.

She\u2019s a pale woman, quite small and curved. The first thing that you come up with seeing her is the word \u201csurly\u201d. She hasn\u2019t the elegance that Rose and Melissa posses, she seems more like a standing rock. Ever her dressed is different. She is not dressed as a French maid, like Rose and any other maid you\u2019ve seen in the palace, but she seems more like a Victorian governess. Her severe expression and tiny rounded glasses are the icing on the cake to that impression. Could she be \u2026 ?<br>\r\n\u201cGood lunch time, princess.\u201d she says, in a total flat voice that conceal a stern tone.<br>\r\nHearing her voice, you are sure of it now. She\u2019s Samantha the woman you heard last night. She has told that she raised the queen, and scolded Rose for being \u201ctoo nice\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I think I don\u2019t know you, Ma\u2019am. Where is my nanny?\u201d you tell her, trying to keep a cordial tone.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m nanny Samantha.\u201d she replies \u201cI wanted to speak with you, so I told maid Sophie that miss Amelia, the Housekeeper, was looking for Rose. She told Rose about it, and now I\u2019m here and she is not. The oldest trick in the book.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCan I ask why you wanted to see me, Ma\u2019am?\u201d you say, in your flattest tone. Janet meanwhile stays quiet, not fully understanding what\u2019s happening.<br>\r\n\u201cYou can call me nanny Samantha, princess.\u201d she says, avoiding your question.<br>\r\nYou are tempted to answer something like \u201cIn your dream, old witch!\u201d, but you realize that maybe is just what she wants, so she would have a reason to punish you. Instead, you say \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ma\u2019am, but I\u2019m not ready for it, since I don\u2019t know you at all. My only nanny is the maid in charge of this nursery, miss Rose Fletcher.\u201d<br>\r\nYou have the impression of a bad look from her. You are quite sure that\u2019s because you saw through her scheme.<br>\r\n\u201cYou brat! Are you mocking me?\u201d she exclaims.<br>\r\nBefore anything can happen, you feel a warm hand touching you shoulder, and a familiar voice that exclaims in a stern tone: \u201cMrs. Samantha, unless you have the queen explicit permission to be here, I ask you to leave the princess alone and to leave the nursery that it\u2019s in my care, at once.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I have the permission, Rose.\u201d she replies, looking at your nanny \u201cHaven\u2019t you thought about the possibility that the queen has told me to replace you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI know queen Charlotte too well to think that she has gone mad.\u201d that totally unexpected answer from Rose, said in a very calm tone, make you and Janet giggle.<br>\r\nSamantha\u2019s cheeks turn red, and she is clearly angry. Without saying anything else, the leaves the nursery.<br>\r\nRose tremble a little, and you see her lean on the changing table. She says something to herself, but you manage to hear it: \u201cDammit. I almost wetted myself.\u201d<br>\r\nYou resist the temptation to laugh at that, and you simply ask her \u201cAre you alright, nanny Rose?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I am.\u201d she replies \u201cJanet, it\u2019s the princess\u2019 lunchtime. Can you leave us, please?\u201d<br>\r\nJanet nods, and after giving you a hug she leaves the nursery.<br>\r\nAs she closes the door, Rose run to you and hug you tightly, saying \u201cHas she been mean? I will speak to the queen about it, and \u2026\u201d<br>\r\nShe starts to say a lot of words, but they go more confused as she proceeds to talk.<br>\r\n\u201cUmh \u2026 Rose? Were you afraid of her?\u201d you ask her.<br>\r\nShe nods, replying \u201cI have unpleasant memory about her. She was queen Charlotte\u2019s nanny. She punished us a lot of time. We haven\u2019t spent so much time with her, since my mother was a housewife and took care of us. My mother was very strict, stricter than me, and so was Charlotte\u2019s mother, but they were fair. She wasn\u2019t!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHold on a second, Rose.\u201d you interrupt her \u201cDid you grow up with queen Charlotte?\u201d<br>\r\nShe blush a little and, letting you go, she says \u201cYes. We are childhood best friends.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you work here as a maid? If you are the queen best friend, why aren\u2019t you in an higher position?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n\u201cCalonians don\u2019t look good at favoritism. A commoner like me working in a high position? It would have been impolitic.\u201d she explains \u201cAnd yet, once ascended to the throne, Charlotte tried to make me Prime Minister. But I\u2019m not a politician. I would have caused a political incident in three days. She tried everything to keep me in the palace, and we found a position that suited me, something that makes me happy and where I\u2019m capable of.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBeing a nanny?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\nShe rubs your hair, answering \u201cExactly.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo you must know a lot of the queen\u2019s mischiefs?\u201d you say with a grin.<br>\r\n\u201cWe were like you and Janet. I know more about it that everyone else. But I will not say anything to you.\u201d she replies, smiling.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, nanny Rose.\u201d you beg her, hugging her.<br>\r\n\u201cI said no, princess. But \u2026 maybe something can slip out from my lips time to time.\u201d she concludes, giving you a wink.<br>\r\nYou giggle, as she takes your bottle of formula. In order: she then feed you, she undresses you and puts you in a white romper. After that, she puts you in your crib.<br>\r\n\u201cNanny, I wetted myself during the morning.\u201d you say \u201cCan\u2019t you change me?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAfter your nap, princess.\u201d she replies \u201cWhen I wake you up, we have a lot of things to do. First, I will change your diaper. Then, you will receive you maintenance spanking, since you have earned the lock. We will then discuss about the dress you will wear during the interview. After we are finished with that, you can go play with Janet.\u201d<br>\r\nYou feel tired, so you simply nod and fall asleep.<br>\r\nDuring your nap, you have a dream \u2026</span></div></div>",

You want to take him out again, but your new nanny stops you.<br>\r\n\u201cWe do not touch something that is in the trash can, are you a tramp or a princess?\u201d She slaps your hands away and pulls you to the changing table by your ear. \u201cLet\u2019s see how wet you are, you big baby!\u201d she slide two fingers into the leg band of your diaper and wiggle them around a bit.<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a potty princess, but I think a few hours longer in your wet diaper will do you no harm.\u201d<br>\r\nShe strips you out of your romper, takes out some lockable plastic pants and slides them up your legs. \u201cYou may think I forgot about your spanking, but I have not. I never forget to spank little brats.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill bend over on the changing table she straps down your hands with leather-cuffs, what leaves you stretched and helpless. \u201cPlease, nanny Samantha, nanny Rose only spanks me over the knees with her hand.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI know, and that is the reason why you are such a brat.\u201d<br>\r\nYou feel a slap on your padded behind, but feel not much pain.<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, the stick is not working on with thick diapers, but it works wonders on legs.\u201d Nanny Samantha snickers and let the stick slam down on the back of your legs, leaving a dark red line.<br>\r\nYou scream out in pain and start to cry immediately. \u201cOuch! No, please stop, I cannot stand that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the old and evil nanny does not stop. She keeps striking you with the stick until your legs are red and purple and show the first signs of bruises. By then you have almost past out in pain and lost all control over your body. You cry, drool and snot is running down your face and you have peed and messed yourself.<br>\r\n\u201cYou are so pathetic. You will never be a good queen.\u201d Nanny Samantha says and opens the cuffs. Yu slide down the changing table and lay on the floor like an infant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI give you five minutes to get your ass up, while I prepare your breakfast. I think a mixture of oatmeal, prunes and castor oil will do you good.\u201d The nanny says, grinning from ear to ear.<br>\r\nYou are still in serious pain and cannot react to her mean words. When the time is up she drags you to the high chair, where she straps you in and force feed you a great amount of disgusting mush.<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, that will help you to fill your wet diaper, my little stinker.\u201d She grins and force another spoon into your mouth.<br>\r\n\u201cOh please, I cannot eat anymore. It is too much, Nanny Samantha.\u201d You plea, but she force the next spoon into your mouth and grins. \u201cOh, it will all end in your tummy, either by the spoon or a force feeding kit. That is like an enema, but the hose goes down your throat. I have the obligation to ensure that you get your vitamins.\u201d<br>\r\nYou whimper and fidget around in your wet and messy diaper \u2013 not looking forward to mess it more in a few minutes\u2026 . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess? Princess Susan, time to wake up. Naptime is over.\u201d You feel the soft hand of Nanny Rose on your shoulder. Waking up from the nightmare feels like a cold shower, but you are very happy to be awake and look into the friendly face of your beloved nanny.<br>\r\n\u201cI had a nightmare.\u201d You whimper. You see your friend, Mr. Rabbit and hug him tightly. You have missed him already and now you are happy that he is still with you and not in the trash.<br>\r\n\u201cPoor baby, but you still will get your spanking, I am sorry.\u201d Rose says and helps you out of the crib.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that you have sweated a lot and during your nightmare you had a little messy accident.<br>\r\nRose notice that, when she takes you over her knees. She rubs your behind a bit and asks you if you prefer a spanking on your legs, since you are messy.<br>\r\n\u201cNO! Not on the legs, that hurts terrible.\u201d You shriek out, remembering the stick.<br>\r\nRose shrugs and gives you a light spanking over your diaper. It is not painful, only humiliating. The worst part is, that is spread the mess you have made around.<br>\r\n\u201cPuh, now you need a back, little one.\u201d Rose says, when she helps you on your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bath is so nice that you forget about the nightmare completely. You even dare to ask Rose to allow you some naughty fun, but she denies that. \u201cNot as long as you wear a lock, little one.\u201d<br>\r\nYou pout, but understand and while she diapers you nice and fresh you tell her about your nightmare. She is listening carefully and hugs you tightly, when you are diapered and dressed.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, poor Princess\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Like in my nightmare?\u201d you ask her.<br>\r\n\u201cNot as much, but pretty close.\u201d she replies, suffocating a gulp \u201cI still remember when she paddled us in the throne room in front of an important guest from another country.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd \u2026\u201d you begin to say. You have an hesitation, fearing the possible answer, but you have to ask it: \u201c\u2026 there isn\u2019t any possibility that she will replace your, right? Not ever temporary like when you have to leave for a while?\u201d<br>\r\nRose smiles and gives you a caress on the cheek, saying \u201cThat will never happen, haven\u2019t I promised you this? She will never replace me, I know the queen too well. She doesn\u2019t like Samantha either, she doesn\u2019t fire her just because Samantha was very loyal to Charlotte\u2019s father. But she would never let you in her care. And I even spoke to queen during your nap to prevent that witch to even be a temporary substitution. If I have to temporary leave the palace or I fall sick, you will be transferred in the third nursery of the palace, the biggest one, along Meredith and William, under the care of nanny Melissa.\u201d<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t like the idea to go in her care, since she\u2019s almost a stranger, even less to stay in the same room as William, but you think it\u2019s a far better solution than Samantha.<br>\r\nYou hug Rose, saying \u201cThank you very much, you\u2019re the best nanny ever.\u201d<br>\r\nShe keeps stroking your hair for a few more minutes, before saying \u201cNow, princess, no more sad thoughts. It\u2019s time to talk about dresses.\u201d<br>\r\nShe lifts you up, and leaves the nursery carrying you in her arms.<br>\r\n\u201cRose!\u201d you exclaim, blushing \u201cI can walk, you know? And where are we going, anyway?\u201d<br>\r\nRose takes up your hood (she putted you back in the blue unicorn onesie you wore during the morning), pushes a pacifier in your mouth and replies \u201cHush, my little unicorn. I know you can walk, but wanted to carry you a little. As for your question, we are going to the royal walk-in closet.\u201d<br>\r\nShe continues to walk, with her \u201clittle unicorn\u201d in her arms. She stops in front of a big door. You look at the plate on it (every single door in the palace seems to have a plate) and you see the words \u201cRoyal walk-in closet.\u201d<br>\r\nThe maid opens the door and walks in. You look around, amazed.<br>\r\n\u201cThis is not a walk-in closet!\u201d you exclaim, removing your pacifier and looking at the enormous number of clothes present in the biggest room you have seen in the palace so far \u201cIt\u2019s an entire house!\u201d<br>\r\nYour nanny puts you down, before giving you a very firm slap on the backside.<br>\r\n\u201cOuch!\u201d you exclaim, more for the surprise than the pain, since you are heavily padded \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cReally, princess?\u201d she replies, sternly \u201cDid a grown up told you that you could remove your pacifier?\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, realizing that she is right. Instantly, you pull the pacifier back in your mouth, sucking it.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m swrry\u201d you mutter.<br>\r\nRose smiles, and takes you to a couch. She makes you sit on it and proceeds to unlock your onesie.<br>\r\n\u201cI will put the lock back once we are finished.\u201d she says \u201cDon\u2019t hope that I\u2019ll forget it.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, aware that her specification was unnecessary. It was made just to remember you that yesterday you\u2019ve been bad and earned the lock. She then finally removes your pacifier.<br>\r\nAfter this, the maid leaves, disappearing at your eyes even if remaining in the same room. She returns after a while, carrying a lot of cute dresses.<br>\r\nThey are very different one from another, but they all remember you the dresses of a fairy tale princess. The are quite childish, but much more mature than the babyish outfits you now usually wear.<br>\r\nRose is very patient during your dress-time. She helps in both dress and undress you, and writes in a notebook everything that she finds fitting and everything she believes it\u2019s not appropriate for the interview. For example, you liked very much a frilly green dress with a long skirt, but Rose told you that it wasn\u2019t a good idea to completely hide your diaper during something that was meant to show that you fully accepted the tradition.<br>\r\nAfter testing a lot of dresses, you begin to get bored, and say \u201cIsn\u2019t this enough? I tried a lot of dresses. I\u2019m quite tired of it.\u201d<br>\r\nBut she shakes her head, replying \u201cNo, princess. I\u2019m sorry, but you have to try all the dresses I took here.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t wanna!\u201d you exclaim, in a quite childish way.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, you were very well behaved today, so you weren\u2019t punished during the day, you received just the maintenance spanking. I am much more lenient, and fair, than Samantha is, it\u2019s true, but you will not throw a tantrum at me.\u201d she scolds \u201cI really love you, but you will behave or I will punish you. Are you going to be my little angel or do I have to take out my brush?\u201d<br>\r\nYou go pale, instantly replying \u201cI\u2019m sorry, nanny Rose! I will behave, I promise!\u201d<br>\r\nShe gives you a smile, and the dressing up trial continues.<br>\r\nWhen you are finally finished, Rose has decided the perfect outfit for the occasion: a very elegant yellow dress, with a long skirt made of tulle.<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone will see my diaper.\u201d you complain \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s the best option.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s an elegant dress, that fits for a royal. It\u2019s not childish, so you can have a grown up composure, but the skirt made of very transparent tulle will show everyone without doubts that you are wearing a diaper. And it\u2019s yellow, so if you wet yourself during the interview no one will notice it.\u201d she explains.<br>\r\n\u201cIt would be a problem if someone notices it?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all, since kids are expected to use their diapers. But you will feel more at ease knowing it.\u201d she replies.<br>\r\nYou smile, happy of this solution.<br>\r\n\u201cYou can now go to play with Janet.\u201d she concludes, dressing you up again in the unicorn onesie and putting the lock back on \u201cI\u2019m sure she is waiting for you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think we can call Merry too?\u201d you ask her.<br>\r\nRose nods, and says \u201cYou can ask to nanny Melissa. She will tell you if Meredith is free or not.\u201d<br>\r\nYou hug and bye her, and look for Janet.<br>\r\nOnce together, you go knocking at Meredith\u2019s (and William\u2019s) nursery.<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d asks Melissa, from the other side of the door.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess Susan and Janet.\u201d you reply \u201cCan Meredith come to play?\u201d<br>\r\nNanny Melissa than says \u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She is pressed in a normal diaper and pink onesie with a kitten on the chest. It looks very alike to the one you have been wearing a couple of days before. As Nanny Melissa has promised she is no longer wearing a lock and jumps into your arms. \u201cHi Susan, I mean Princess Susan, nice to meet you.\u201d She says in cute way.<br>\r\n\u201cYou can call me Susan, no worries, where is William?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, he is still a bit\u2026 handicapped.\u201d Merry grins and step to the side, so you can see William while his nanny helps him out of a playpen.<br>\r\nHe is wearing a pink romper, which hardly hides his thick diaper. At his collar he wears a lock and he waddles slowly to the three girls with a sour face.<br>\r\n\u201cCute romper! Janet teases him and makes him blush.<br>\r\nHe walks between you, Janet and Merry and set the pace \u2013 the slow pace. \u201cVery funny Janet. That is my punishment for looking under Melissa\u2019s skirt. She told me that, if I am so interested in female clothes, I can wear some.\u201d That makes all you girls laugh out and he blushes even more.<br>\r\n\u201cSo you are wearing Merry\u2019s romper?! Oh great!\u201d Janet tease him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam would like to slap her, but holds back. Since yesterday he received three spankings and acts much more submissive \u2013 at least until the four of you enter Janet\u2019s private room.<br>\r\n\u201cWOW! You have a game console? Let us play!!\u201d He jumps up and down until he lost his balance and lands on hands and knees.<br>\r\n\u201cOnly if you do not break anything!\u201d Janet says and starts the TV. For the next hour the four of you take turns playing, but then William gets bored and starts to get naughty. While you play against Janet he sneaks up to you from behind and grabs your breasts. It is only for a short moment, but distracts you so much that you drive your virtual car against a wall.<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Stop doing that!\u201d You yell at him. He apologises and let you restart. But only a few minutes later he does the same with Janet, who does not take it lightly. She jumps up and pushes him \u2013 what has no effect. \u201cI will tell you nanny what you did!\u201d She threats him \u2013 and again he apologises, only to do it with his sister a minute later.<br>\r\n\u201cSurvey completed!\u201d He calls out. \u201cFirst place goes to Janet, then Merry and the princess has the smallest ones, barely anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would have never thought that the remark of a stupid boy hurt so much, but it does. Embarrassed you lay down on Janet\u2019s bed and pouts. You could cry, but do not want to give him the pleasure to see that. You stay like this until somebody lay down next to you and rub your back.

She\u2019s like the big sister of our group.\u201d replies Meredith.<br>\r\nJanet seems to like that nickname, because she smiles and says \u201cCome around big sister Janet, kids. I\u2019ll expose my idea.\u201d<br>\r\nYou sigh and reach her, followed by the others two.<br>\r\n\u201cI have explored the palace a lot these days.\u201d Janet explains \u201cAnd I noticed that every door has a plate that says what\u2019s behind it. Every door \u2026 except one.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh? What do you mean?\u201d you ask her.<br>\r\nShe giggles a little, before answering \u201cI found a door with no plates. Instead, on the door was placed a big red sign, with only the words \u201centrance strictly forbidden\u201d. I\u2019m now very curious about what\u2019s inside.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut Janet \u2026\u201d says Merry \u201c\u2026 strictly forbidden doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t go inside?\u201d<br>\r\nWilliam sighs, replying \u201cFor being someone so smart, you are often very slow at catching things, Merry.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWilly! Behave and be polite with Merry!\u201d intervenes Janet \u201cOr big sis Janet will punish you.\u201d<br>\r\nYou giggle, thinking that she has identified herself too much in the bis sister part.<br>\r\n\u201cNow I will go to the bathroom.\u201d concludes Janet \u201cWhen I\u2019m back you\u2019ll tell me if you agree with my idea.\u201d<br>\r\nSaid that, Janet leaves the room. After a while, she\u2019s back.<br>\r\n\u201cAll done.\u201d she proclaims, making you blush. You would ask her to unlock the onesie like she did the first day, but you realize it wouldn\u2019t be a clever idea with two witnesses, even if friends.<br>\r\n\u201cHave you used the potty, big sis?\u201d Meredith asks her.<br>\r\nJanet shakes her head, replying \u201cNo, Merry, I used the toilet.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat big bottomless thing full of water?\u201d Meredith says, touching her glasses \u201cDoesn\u2019t it swallow children?\u201d<br>\r\nHearing this, you try your best to don\u2019t laugh. Merry is shy and cute, and you don\u2019t want lo laugh in her face. Still, it\u2019s difficult to don\u2019t laugh at a 14 years old girl that believes that the toilet eats children.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Merry, bis sister has a lot of things to teach you.\u201d says Janet, touching her shoulder. She then looks at you all, asking \u201cSo? Who will come with me?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll come!\u201d William immediately says \u201cI never say no to an adventure!\u201d<br>\r\nYou instead hesitate. Yesterday evening you gave your word to Rose that you would have behaved during the day.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I promised to nanny Rose that I would have been a good girl today.\u201d you say.<br>\r\n\u201cI promise that all the time.\u201d intervenes Willy \u201cAnd I always do the opposite.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you always end over nanny Melissa\u2019s lap.\u201d adds his sister.<br>\r\nHe turns red, and tells to Meredith \u201cSis, could you please stop to say embarrassing things when I try to act tough?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo, little unicorn?\u201d insists Janet, looking at you \u201cAre you coming or not? Are you a brave princess or are you scared of the children-eater toilet too?\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, and your wounded pride makes you exclaim \u201cIn your dreams! I\u2019m coming, of course!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Merry states, stuttering a little \u201cIf someone sees us, we\u2019ll get in trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the funny part.\u201d Janet says, making a naughty grin \u201cNot being caught. The risk is part of the adventure.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy for you to say.\u201d you intervene \u201cYou don\u2019t get our punishments.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s this what makes you falter? Very well. I take an oath. If we are caught, I solemnly swear that I will request that your own punishment shall administered to me too, whatever it may be.\u201d says Janet, in a very dramatic tone.<br>\r\nYou smile and nod, and so do William and Meredith. <br>\r\n\u201cOk. So we are a team.\u201d concludes Merry.<br>\r\nYou all leave the room, following Janet.<br>\r\nShe leads you down, at the basement\u2019s door.  The incriminated door with the sign stands right at it\u2019s left.<br>\r\n\u201cLook my back, you three.\u201d orders Janet, as she takes the lock pick out of her pocket.<br>\r\nWith a rapid movement, she unlocks the door and you all get inside.<br>\r\nYou find yourself in a long, narrow and dark corridor. You begin to walk in it, and after a while Meredith says to Janet \u201cBig sis, can you old my hand? I\u2019m scared.\u201d<br>\r\nAs Janet takes Merry\u2019s hand, you feel something that you don\u2019t understand. Immediately, that feeling makes you say \u201cCan you hold my hand too, Janet?\u201d<br>\r\nShe sighs, saying \u201cWhat are you? Five?\u201d<br>\r\nBut she takes you hand too.<br>\r\nAt the end of the corridor, you find yourself in an illuminated room. It seems a storage room. Its full of boxes.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are those?\u201d Merry asks, looking at the boxes content.<br>\r\n\u201cThey seem \u2026 they ARE erotic magazines!\u201d you exclaim.<br>\r\nBoth Janet and William throw themselves over the boxes, while you and Meredith wait.<br>\r\n\u201cSusie \u2026\u201d she whispers at you hear \u201c\u2026 I heavily wetted myself in the dark tunnel, before.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMe too.\u201d you admit, blushing.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat exactly are those magazines, anyway?\u201d she asks.<br>\r\nYou are fully aware of what they are, but you don\u2019t want to affect her innocence, so you shake your head saying \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\nAs you ask yourself why erotic magazines are so hidden (maybe to hide them to children?) and Janet and William eagerly leaf through the magazines, you hear footsteps coming from the corridor.<br>\r\n\u201cShit!\u201d you think, looking around for another exit. But you are blocked here.<br>\r\nYou turn back, and you see \u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And look at the maid. \u201cI am sorry, but you are wrong. We have permission to be here. I am Princess Susan and these are my friends. Queen Charlotte herself gave us permission to explore every corner of the castle to help me familiarize.\u201d<br>\r\nThe maid looks surprise and her hands starts to nervously lay with the hem of her short French maid skirt. By now William and Janet came to you and Meredith and support you.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we should be aware of everything, what includes this room. It was a bit confusing, that the door has no sign, but now we understand.\u201d Janet says, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid blushes and accidently lift her skirt with her fiddling hands, presenting a slightly used pull-up. She cannot be out of diapers for that long. William is turning red and supress to point his finger at her and laugh, Janet and you are nut better. Only Merry is so busy to stop her feet from running away that she is missing the little surprise the maid is hiding under her skirt.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it would be strange to put a precise sign on the door, wouldn\u2019t it? The maid giggles \u201cI mean, what would it say? Queen Charlotte\u2019s secret porn-collection?\u201d<br>\r\nThe four of you stare at her with open mouths, surprised by her words.<br>\r\n\u201cSo they ALL belong to the Queen herself?\u201d You ask.<br>\r\n\u201cI am sure not only the queen comes here from times to times, but she asked to receive one sample from each adult magazine that is produced of imported. She must have a\u2026 special interest in them.\u201d The maid says, blushing, before she turns to leave.<br>\r\n\u201cI better go now, I need to change\u2026 something\u2026 in\u2026 ah\u2026 it does not matter, bye!\u201d She says and walk off, back down the dark corridor.<br>\r\nAs soon as you hear the door closing you laugh out and hold you tummy. \u201cOh my gosh, this all belongs to the Queen, I would have never guessed it!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd have you seen her training pants? I bet she is already leaking by now!\u201d Willy calls out and almost loses his balance, with his own super thick diaper.<br>\r\nYou think about the poor maid and her special underwear. You have never thought about it, but it cannot be unusual that young adults that just earned the rights to wear panties suffer under accidents after being in diapers for 18 to 21 years. You only hope that you do not lose your potty training until you are finally allowed back into panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the maid is gone, you and your \u201cCrew\u201d dig further through the magazines. After a long time of hesitating, even Merry starts to look at them. It is interesting for you to see her reaction on the different kind of kinks. While Willy seems to drool on every magazine and every naked woman he can find she looks distressed by all the naked flesh and especially the naked men.<br>\r\nYou need to hold back when she stops at one magazine and flip every single page of it, announcing: \u201cThis is not so bad, there are only girls in it.\u201d While you can hold back her brother is different. He waddles to his sister and take a close look at the magazine: \u201cReally Sis? This is a homosexual magazine for girls. Those are lesbians.\u201d<br>\r\nMerry blushes and put the magazine back with shaking fingers.<br>\r\n\u201cI want to leave. Can we go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilly moans out in frustration and even Janet seems pissed off. \u201cReally Merry, I do not think we can come here every day. We should look around as long as we can.\u201d<br>\r\nMerry sighs and wants to pick the next lesbian magazine, but then she remembers her brother\u2019s words and leaves it. After a while she finds a magazine about Pet Play and flip through the pages, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know some of the magazines from your own country, or at least the kind of magazine, like Janet does, but even you look around and snoop into some rare fetish magazines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point you think it is time to leave, before somebody else is searching for you or the young maid comes back after finding out that you lied to her. \u201cLet\u2019s go back. I am sure we cannot trick another maid.\u201d<br>\r\nYour friends agree, even when Willy would love to take a few magazines with him, but he has no place to hide them with his romper and therefore he has to leave them behind. You walk down the corridor and reach the door. Quietly you sneak out and close the door when you notice\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We thought that it should have been locked, so we were going to look for a maid to tell her about it.\u201d<br>\r\nWhat an incredible liar. Now even if the queen says that she saw you coming out from there you have an excellent alibi.<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d says Charlotte. She isn\u2019t at ease. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, then. But you should go play somewhere else. Now, if you excuse me, I have to read some \u2026 books about \u2026 interhuman relationship \u2026 in the royal secret archives.\u201d<br>\r\nYou take a bow and bye her, leaving her alone. Followed by your friends, you leave that palace zone, just after seeing Charlotte enter in the forbidden door.<br>\r\nOnce you are in a safer place, known as Janet\u2019s room, you all laugh together.<br>\r\n\u201cThe queen was \u2026 busy, uh?\u201d you say, giggling a lot.<br>\r\n\u201cSo? Wasn\u2019t the juice worth the squeeze?\u201d Janet asks to you.<br>\r\nYou instantly nod, without even thinking about it.<br>\r\n\u201cWe lied to the queen and she believed us!\u201d Merry intervenes \u201cWhile you were talking I felt a great fear. I even wetted myself a little, and now I think my diaper is on the verge of leaking.\u201d<br>\r\nYou are amazed at how easily she says things that you find extremely embarrassing.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what about you, Willy?\u201d Janet says, giggling \u201cYou weren\u2019t changed at all after your enema, right?\u201d<br>\r\nWilliam deeply blushes, exclaiming \u201cJanet! That was a low blow! Yes, I\u2019m in a full diaper, but you shouldn\u2019t declaring it to the world.\u201d<br>\r\nEven William is much different about this matter than you are. Yes, he acts in a more mature way and feels embarrassed at hearing certain things, but he never tries to deny the truth about the usage of his diapers of about his punishments. For a boy so good a lying, it\u2019s almost a contradiction.<br>\r\n\u201cSo we have two heavily wet children. And the third one?\u201d Janet looks at you whit a grin.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks.\u201d you lie.<br>\r\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you wetted yourself in the corridor too, Susie? You told me that.\u201d Merry intervenes.<br>\r\nYou blush at her affirmation, thinking that she is totally unable to lie. Her brother perfect opposite.<br>\r\nJanet giggle again, but then hugs you, saying \u201cI\u2019m joking, Susan. You\u2019re my best friend, right? I will not make fun of your situation.\u201d<br>\r\nYou hug her back, with a smile.<br>\r\nSince it\u2019s dinner time, you say goodbye to Janet, as well to Merry and Willy. In the blink of an eye, you are back at your nursery.<br>\r\nThere, Rose asks about your afternoon. You tell her that you had a lot of fun and that you at end befriended not only Meredith, but William too.<br>\r\n\u201cVery good, I\u2019m happy to hear it.\u201d she comments, of course unaware of your adventure in the forbidden room.<br>\r\nShe takes you out of your onesie and of your dirty diaper, before giving you a nice bath. After bathing you, she dresses you up in a fresh diaper and then in the white romper, she proceeds to feed you with baby food and milk, and the puts you in the crib.<br>\r\n\u201cGood night, princess. Tomorrow is the last day before the interview. If you behave well like today, I\u2019m sure tomorrow will be a great day too.\u201d she says, kissing your forehead and then leaving the nursery after turning the light off.<br>\r\nYou hug Mister Rabbit tightly, saying \u201cWhat do you think, Mister Rabbit? The day after tomorrow I have the interview. Will I manage to do it? Really? You think so? You are a great friend.\u201d<br>\r\nAnd you fall asleep.<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\nRose touches you shoulder with strength, shouting \u201cWake up, Princess! The palace is under attack!\u201d<br>\r\nYou instantly jump on your feet, exclaiming \u201cIt\u2019s that so? Come on, my friends! We\u2019ll defend the palace!\u201d<br>\r\nFollowed by Rose, Mister Rabbit, Janet, Meredith and William, you leave the castle using the main door. Outside, the royal knights are fighting against an horde of ninjas. Lord Richard himself is waiting for you, with a bastard sword in his hands.<br>\r\n\u201cCome, princess!\u201d he shouts at you \u201cShow me if you are a worthy opponent\u201d\u201d<br>\r\nRose gives you a rapier, saying \u201cThis belongs to the Royal Dynasty. It\u2019s called Light Bringer.\u201d<br>\r\nTaking the rapier, you attack Richard with all of your strength. He\u2019s a good swordsman, much more expert than you are.<br>\r\n\u201cSurrender, little stinker!\u201d he exclaims \u201cI will be king!\u201d<br>\r\nYou are about to collapse, but then you hear Meredith shouting \u201cDon\u2019t surrender, Susie! I\u2019m with you!\u201d<br>\r\nWith renewed vigor, you fight again, disarming Richard with a precise cut.<br>\r\nThe evil man kneels before you, saying \u201cI\u2019ve lost. You are the next queen.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I am!\u201d you exclaim \u201cAnd as the next queen, I sentence you to diaper punishment!\u201d<br>\r\nRose drags him at a bench, puts him over her knees and begins to spank him with a hairbrush. Meanwhile, Melissa reaches them with an extremely thick diaper in a hand and booster pads in the other.<br>\r\nYou raise Light Bringer to the sky, as the crowd cheers you up.<br>\r\n\u201cLong live queen Susan!\u201d<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\nYou feel someone touching your shoulder, and you wake up, illuminated by the morning sun.<br>\r\n\u201cRose?\u201d you say, once you\u2019ve focused on her \u201cWhere are we?

She said that some magazines where put in the wrong place and some pages are kinked. I would ask you to tell her that it was not me, but you with your friends, while you have been exploring the castle.\u201d She blushes and looks at her feet.<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, I have just started as a maid and Mr. Benedict already gave me a final warning for ruining one expensive carpet. If the Queen now tells him, that I spend my time reading kinky magazines, I am in real trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her you see Rose with wide eyes, shaking her head. She does not say a word, but it is clear to you, that she now knows where you and your friends had FUN the day before. You gulp hard and does not know what to say. Before she pause stretch too long, your nanny steps in.<br>\r\n\u201cFor sure the princess will explain everything to the Queen and tell her that it has been her and her friends, not you, the obedient maid that snooped around in the Queen Private collection. Do not be worried Alice, we will take care of everything.\u201d She rubs the maids back and managed to calm her down. Before she push the petite women, that again played with her short skirt and expose her training pants out of the door, she stops her: \u201cAlice, please do not talk to anybody about this. You see it is a BIT unusual that the kids have been allowed to enter that room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice nods and quickly leaves the room, to change her trainers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess Susan, you had FUN in the Queens private library? Are you kidding me?\u201d Miss Fletcher scolds you and lift you on the changing table. She roughly push you down and quickly change your diaper. You expect her to give you a spanking, but the pressing time does not allow that. With a fresh diaper on she pulls you up and look at your face, from a distance of a few centimeter: \u201cPrincess, after being such a very good and obedient girl you do such a naughty thing. I will talk to Nanny Melissa and make sure Willy and Merry receive a proper punishment. Janet will lose her game console for a few days and you, you will have a talk with the Queen and ask her for a hard, but fair punishment.\u201d Your face lose its color by her words, but she is not jet done with you. \u201cWhatever the Queen think is good, will be increased by me, because I am very disappointed that you lied to me AGAIN. You know that you would receive a sound spanking and go back in your wet diaper IF you would not have such an important day.\u201d She sighs deeply and see that you already have tears in your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Baby, it will be okay. I am sorry, it is cruel to know that you will be punished later, but we do not have time now. I still love you and I am sure you will be a great Queen \u2013 one day \u2013 but you crossed a red line and it will be interesting to see that Queen Charlotte thinks about this.\u201d She ruffles your hair to calm you down a bit.<br>\r\n\u201cWe do not want to anger the queen, before she speaks to the press, therefore you will tell her everything after the interview.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut isn\u2019t that lying as well? Not telling it to her now?\u201d You sob, sniffing quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes it is, but I take that one on me. She needs to concentrate on the press, like you must now remember your training. You now get a light breakfast and will be dressed up. You know a lot about Richard and with the dress it will be obviously that you embrace the tradition. If you can, if would be great if you could wet your diaper during the interview and do not say a word about it \u2013 as if it is a natural thing for you.\u201d Rose suggested and helps you off the changing table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation about the interview distracts you from the later coming punishment. Rose keeps refreshing your memory while you nurse on the baby bottle and are guided to the dressing room, where four maids wait to help you with your preparation. With a full bladder and all the lessons from Miss Spencer refreshed, you walk to the Queen.<br>\r\nYour dress has a perfect fit, your hair is pulled back into two youthful tails and you have a decent makeup that makes you look even more innocent, but still has a degree of perfection, suitable for a princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Charlotte is wearing an elegant dress herself and smiles at you when you enter, guided by Rose. \u201cGood morning Susan, you look great and I am sure you will do very well.\u201d Charlotte says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush, but nod your head. Rose is right, you should not anger the queen right now, with the reporters waiting in the next room. She takes your hand and without further hesitations lead you through the next door.<br>\r\nA speaker announce the Queen and you and before you can count the number of reporters you find yourself on a small throne, next to the queen in a big one.

You remember what the queen said, that is a full interview for one of the most important newspapers in the country. It obvious the were few, for a single newspaper they are even too much!<br>\r\n\u201cI welcome the envoys from Calonia\u2019s Echo.\u201d the queen says, looking at the woman in the middle of the small crowd \u201cCalonian Royal House it\u2019s always happy to open the door of the Royal Palace for your magazine.\u201d<br>\r\nThe woman nods, in a solemn way, answering \u201cWe are grateful of this, as always.

I found the perfect mediation between an old and respectable style of life and the strong economy and the high technological development really interesting. I see why it\u2019s a wealthy country.\u201d you reply.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd about of traditions?\u201d she asks \u201cWhat do you think of them?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAbout the diapers, right?\u201d you reply \u201cI fully accept your tradition, as you can see.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting, because after your landing here, another newspaper reported that you said these words: \u201c<i>Oh I hate the diapers and it is insane I have to wear one</i>.\u201d. Should we assume it\u2019s a lie? Or is it all true?\u201d she continues to press you.<br>\r\nQuickly, you consider your options: say it\u2019s a lie would mean sling mud at the newspaper concerned, accordingly making an enemy. It\u2019s not a good idea.<br>\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a lie, I concede this.\u201d you decide to say \u201cBut I was very tired and was the first time I wore a diaper since I was little. That wasn\u2019t my real thoughts, but a quick answer of a tired girl in a full diaper. I was so tired I could have said I was a boy named Trevor.\u201d<br>\r\nYou can hear the men in the room laugh a little at your answer, but not Daphne. She remains a block of ice.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very interesting way to see the facts, princess.\u201d she continues \u201cBecause after your arrival you were wearing a lock on your onesie. You stated that it was put on you because you threw a tantrum about the color of your dress, but it\u2019s an interesting coincidence that you arrived with a lock and saying just a few seconds later that you hated diapers. It is not plausible to think that the queen putted the block on you because you tried to fight the tradition, rather than the color of the dress?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not a journalist, she\u2019s a goddamned inquisitor!\u201d you think, before answering \u201cI\u2019m aware that it\u2019s legitimate to think that, but I assure that my tantrum was about the color of the onesie. As you can see, I\u2019m not wearing a pink dress today, because I hate it. And just to be clear, I threw a very wild tantrum, that is why the queen spanked me and putted me the lock.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe spanked you?\u201d she asks \u201cAnd how did you reacted to that?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m used to be spanked, my parents did that all the time.\u201d it\u2019s your answer, which is a big lie, since the queen gave you the first spanking of your life \u201cAnd so does nanny Rose during my permanence at the palace when I misbehave. I\u2019m sure that it\u2019s a good discipline method, and I immediately understand the errors of my ways when I\u2019m spanked. So, I\u2019m grateful to the queen and to nanny Rose for it.\u201d<br>\r\nThe second part of the sentence is a lie too, since you still think you are too old to be spanked.<br>\r\n\u201cCan you tell us about this person you just mentioned, princess? This Rose?\u201d she asks you then.<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Rose Fletcher. She\u2019s my nanny. I really love her, since she is very kind and really cares about me, but she\u2019s also very strict and punishes me every time she thinks I deserve it.\u201d and your entire sentence, this time, it\u2019s completely true.<br>\r\nJust as you answer to that question, you feel an unbearable throe at your bladder. You completely let it go, wetting your diaper in front of everyone.<br>\r\nEveryone in the room notices that, and you can clearly hear a photographer tell to a man with a notebook \u201cHow cute, the princess just went number one in her diaper.\u201d<br>\r\nYou are aware that what you just did it\u2019s not only normal, but required, but you feel the same full of shame in peeing yourself in front of strangers. Their comment about \u201cnumber one\u201d doesn\u2019t help you in feeling at ease.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, you were not born in Calonia.\u201d Daphne states, then adding \u201cWhat do you say about all those that claim that only a true Calonian should inherit the throne?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s talking about Richard.\u201d you think \u201cThis is my occasion to talk about him.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t true of false Calonians, in my opinion. There are only Calonians that accept the tradition and Calonians that don\u2019t accept it.\u201d you reply \u201cFor example, I met lord Richard Grairven. It\u2019s obvious that he\u2019s smart, and undoubtedly he\u2019s an handsome lad. But the tradition, OUR tradition, says that the closest alive relative of the ruler will one day inherit the throne. Lord Grairven lost that opportunity when the queen found me, and if he is a true Calonian as he claims to be, he should accept it as it\u2019s the tradition.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou are putting yourself against one of the strongest men in the kingdom, princess.\u201d Daphne states \u201cTell me, did you just peed your diaper because you are scared of facing him?\u201d<br>\r\nShe\u2019s trying everything to make you say something wrong, you can feel it. This interview it\u2019s not relaxing at all, it\u2019s a total stress.<br>\r\n\u201cI went number one in my diaper, miss Adams, because I accept the tradition.\u201d it\u2019s your answer \u201cAnd that\u2019s the only reason.\u201d<br>\r\nShe then proceed in asking you about your political opponent, and you answer to all question using the numerous information that Miss Spencer gave you: you talk about the past of his family, about the violent bloodline of the Grairven, about the fact that Richard\u2019s great great grandfather had to complain about the tradition, and concluding that Richard is known for whipping his servants: it may be legal, but it\u2019s a barbaric thing to do that challenge modern common sense.<br>\r\n\u201cOne last question, princess.\u201d concludes Daphne \u201cIf you would be placed alongside lord Richard for a picture, who do you think the people will notice more?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI know lord Richard it\u2019s handsome, denying it would be stupid. And I also know that compared to him I\u2019m just a diaper-wearer kid.\u201d you simply state, then adding \u201cBut think about it: he\u2019s in his early twenties. No one should make the error to forget that he may look handsome now, but a few years ago he was still in diapers too. And almost certainly it\u2019s not so long that he received his last spanking from his nanny.\u201d<br>\r\nYour last answer makes laugh all the men, and even Daphne smiles.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for your time, princess.\u201d<br>\r\nWith these words, the troupe leaves the palace, and you are left alone with the queen.<br>\r\n\u201cYou were great, Susan!\u201d she exclaims, hugging you \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you! That Daphne was really inquisitive with her questions, and was without doubt a very difficult interview, but you managed it!\u201d<br>\r\nAs she lets you go, you nod, happy yourself. You then remember something.<br>\r\n\u201cCharlotte, I need to tell you something.\u201d you say, lowering your head.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it, sweetie?\u201d she asks, looking confused.<br>\r\nYou are about to tell her what\u2019s happened (and you will, since lying now would be a terrible idea), when something flash in your mind: Janet\u2019s oath!<br>\r\n<i>\u201cIf we are caught, I solemnly swear that I will request that your own punishment shall administered to me too, whatever it may be.\u201d<br>\r\n</i>Should you say this too to the queen, or skip it during your report of the facts? You don\u2019t want her to get in trouble, but it\u2019s true that it was her idea after all.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Janet is your best friend and without maid Alice your little adventure would never been discovered, but now it is too late. The only thing you can do is take as much of the punishment on yourself and leave Janet out as much as you can. She has already lost her game console, what is tough, for a gamer like her.<br>\r\n\u201cQueen Charlotte, when you found us yesterday in front of the forbidden door\u2026 It was using messing around with some of your magazines, not maid Alice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe facial expression of the Queen slips. She feels embarrassed and is disappointed at the same time.<br>\r\n\u201cSusan,\u2026 How could you do that? Nosy or not, at least after finding out it is MY personnel collection you should have left the room right away, but you kept reading adult stuff and maybe even laughed at your kinky queen?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you go pale and shake your head: \u201cNo, majesty, I would never do that. I know magazines like this from my country, like Janet does. Willy was interested and Merry was embarrassed like a little kitten, nobody laughed at you about your\u2026 hobby. I know Rose, Miss Fletcher already talked to Nanny Melissa, but I kindly ask you to punish me the most. I should have stopped everybody, but I was interested to look through the magazines myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen search for the next chair and sits down on it.<br>\r\n\u201cReally Susan, which is something I would never see happening. The room is always locked and you still broke in and looked through forbidden stuff. I have to punish you as strict as possible to make sure this never happens again.\u201d An idea crosses her mind and she bites down on her bottom lip.<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe Rose is really too soft on you. Maybe you need a stronger, stricter hand, like I had in my childhood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see where she is aiming for and starts to shake your head.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, please not another nanny. Rose it perfect and she is capable to discipline me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am not sure. You keep breaking the rules over and over again. Yesterday all looked fine and now I find out you did something horrible. Maybe I should hand you over to Nanny Samantha, at least for a couple of days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go down to your knees and literary be her on your knees. \u201cPlease do not do that! I had nightmares of her and I heard she is cruel and unfair!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen looks down at you. She has bad experiences with Nanny Samantha herself, but if nothing else helps?!  Or would it be enough to give Rose a long list of punishments for Susan?<br>\r\n\u201cSusan,\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But since she is very young and inexpert, we will ask to the one in charge of her, and in charge of all servants: we will ask Mr. Benedict.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe Butler?!\u201d you almost yell \u201cBut he\u2019s a male! I don\u2019t want to be punished by him!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say that he will punish you. He\u2019s considered extremely strict but fair by all the servants. He will come up with the best suggestion for your punishment. And if he thinks that he should punish you himself, you will simply accept it, princess. You\u2019ve been very naughty, and can\u2019t expect that I let you decide your own punishment.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, aware that she is right.<br>\r\nCharlotte takes your hand and lead you through the palace\u2019s corridors.<br>\r\nShe stops in front of the laundry door, just to open it and enter.<br>\r\nInside, maids and footmen are busy doing their chores. Mr. Benedict Harper is standing in the middle of the room, giving instructions left and right.<br>\r\n\u201cBen, I need to speak with you. Can you spare a moment?\u201d she says.<br>\r\nThe Butler nods, and after having given a last instruction to the servants, he follows the queen and you outside of the laundry.<br>\r\nCharlotte tells him everything, and he listens with a very professional expression.<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you decided to let me decide the princess punishment.\u201d he states, once the queen has finished to talk.<br>\r\nThe queen simply nods, as he looks at you with analyzing eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cIn my opinion, you shouldn\u2019t let her in the care of Samantha.\u201d he says, and you breathe a sigh of relief \u201cThat woman is unfair, and everyone in the palace knows that.\u201d<br>\r\nThe queen seems relieved herself. She didn\u2019t like that idea either and seems happy with the Butler\u2019s judgement.<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Fletcher it\u2019s ok for her. The good answers you said she gave during the interview confirms it.\u201d you begin to smile, but he then adds \u201cIt\u2019s however true that Miss Fletcher, although strict, is quite soft. Maybe a short period of time, two or three days would be enough, under the care of another nanny would be a good idea.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you suggesting, then?\u201d the queen asks him, not sure of what he means.<br>\r\n\u201cI suggest to transfer her for a three days under the care of nanny Melissa alongside the Prime Minister\u2019s children. She is quite stricter than nanny Rose is, and will be quite humiliating for her to be punished under the eyes of her friends, especially under the eyes of a boy.\u201d he explains.<br>\r\n\u201cIn the same nursery as William?!\u201d you exclaim, blushing \u201cNever!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIf you prefer, princess, I can give you a bare bottom spanking right here in the laundry and ask maid Alice to change your diaper in the middle of the garden. I\u2019m sure that will work too.\u201d he states, making you instantly hush. You think that this is at least better than be given in the care of Samantha.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Ben.\u201d the queen says to him \u201cYour advices are always smart.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI do what I can, my queen. If you need me again, you know how to find me.\u201d and with these words, he leaves.<br>\r\nCharlotte takes your hand once more, and leads you straight to Melissa\u2019s nursery.<br>\r\nShe knocks the door, and you hear the voice of Merry\u2019s nanny answering \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cQueen Charlotte.\u201d the queen simply says \u201cCan I come in?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, your majesty.\u201d the tall nanny replies.<br>\r\nThe queen opens the door, and lead you in.<br>\r\nInside, Meredith and William are both in the playpen. They are crying and hugging each other. Merry is wearing a pink onesie, with the words \u201cUnruly baby\u201d printed on the back, while Willy is wearing a red and childish drop-seat pajama, and the drop-seat itself is closed with big buttons and with the words \u201cBad boy\u201d on it. They are both wearing a lock. It\u2019s obvious that Rose already informed Melissa about what happened and she has already punished the two for it.<br>\r\n\u201cYour majesty, princess.\u201d she greets you \u201cWhat I can do for you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou will take care of the princess for three days, starting now.\u201d Charlotte explains \u201cShe\u2019s under punishment for what she have done alongside her friends. She hasn\u2019t been punished yet, and I demand that she should be treated like the leader of the group.\u201d<br>\r\nMelissa takes a bow, while Merry and Willy look at the scene with wide open eyes, and says \u201cIt will be my pleasure, your majesty.\u201d<br>\r\nThe queen leaves the room, and as the door is closed, nanny Melissa takes you by your ear.<br>\r\n\u201cNow, naughty princess, we will have a little discussion about your behavior.\u201d she says, and drags you near a chair. She sits on it and pats her lap.<br>\r\n\u201cOver my knees, princess.\u201d she orders to you, while taking up an old wooden hairbrush from the near bedside table.<br>\r\n\u201cBut nanny Melissa, Willy is watching.\u201d you complain, and Meredith intervenes too \u201cPlease, nanny Melissa. We can wait in the bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHush!\u201d the nanny exclaims \u201cAnother word from any of you and I will take the bar of soap. I gave you an order, princess.

They just have stopped crying and you do not know for how long they have been sobbing before you entered the room. Afraid to be punished like you have never been punished before you step back and look over your shoulder to the door. \u201cNo,\u2026 you cannot punish me. Rose is my nanny, only she can do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanny Melissa sighs and gets up from her chair. \u201cPrincess Susan, Mr. Harper is the head of all nannies and had made a decision. Liking it or not, Miss Fletcher will not question him and neither will I. Maybe I am not such a softie and forgiving, like Rose is, but I will be fair and a much better choice than Nanny Samantha. Now come to me or I need to add more to your list.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still step further back until you hit the door.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease not, I was such a good girl all yesterday and some magazines are nothing that is new to me. There is no reason to punish me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, The Queen herself told me to treat you like the head of this little adventure and like this you will receive the same treatment as Willy and Merry PLUS something on top.\u201d She says and reach out with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sink down to your knees and begin to sob. \u201cBut do not throw away Mr. Rabbit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanny Melissa comes closer and picks you up. \u201cHush, I will not take away your favorite stuffy, I will get him as soon as you are in your crib to make sure he watches you during the night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are very happy to hear that and even surprised that she knows your stuffed rabbit. She and Rose must talk a lot. With Willy and Merry watching, she strips you down completely and takes you over her knees. She is using a spanking paddle that looks scary, but does not hurt much more than a hand. It is only louder, what makes it more humiliating. In the end, your behind is pink, but does show no sign of bruises. You are crying like a baby in the end, but you have expected that. From her lap, Melissa carries you to the changing table and straps you down, before she get the enema-kit and slide a quit wide hose up your behind. It has two little balloons. One for the outside and one for the inside, which are pumped up. It feels quiet strange, but does not hurt.<br>\r\n\u201cThis will prevent the hose from coming out, I want you to hold the water in for a long time to make sure all your naughtiness is washed out.\u201d<br>\r\nThe water begins to fill your colon and you like to argue, that your naughtiness is in your mind and not in your behind, but you do not want to risk a mouth soaping.<br>\r\nIt takes quite a while until all the water is in and Melissa let you wait even longer before she put you in a thick diaper with three booster pads and pink romper with a sad looking sun on the chest. For sure you get the lock as well and a pacifier is strapped into your mouth that has a hose attached.<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a feeding gag. I want to make sure you drink enough and use your diaper like a good little girl.\u201d Melissa explains and put you into an adult size version of a baby bouncer.<br>\r\n\u201cIn a few minutes you will fill your diaper and a while later you will for sure wet yourself. The bouncer will make sure you feel that and keep the diaper pressed against your crotch.\u201d Melissa explains and gives you an initial push down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bounce up and down and look over to Willy and Merry. The pacifier in your mouth prevents you from saying anything, but the sibling see you bouncing and whisper to you as soon as Melissa left the room.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry for the bouncer. You will not be able to find a comfortable position in it.\u201d Willy says. He seem to know the bouncer quiet well.<br>\r\n\u201cBut do not worry, as soon as your diaper is full, she will put you in the crib and you can relax. Is Janet now getting this treatment as well?\u201d<br>\r\nYou shake your head and he looks relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later your bowels are empty and you diaper has turned into a squishy sponge between your legs. The formula in the force feeder was not tasting as good as the formulas Rose had feed you so far, but maybe that was part of the punishment. You have been happy when the bag was empty and you could relax your yaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Melissa comes back and helps you out of the bouncer.<br>\r\n\u201cI see you used your diaper good, now you can go to bed. I am sorry, but the punishment will continue tomorrow, you have just been too naughty. But for today you are done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had wheeled in a bid crib and to your surprise you find yourself in it, together with Merry and Willy. \u201cAnd I have your little friend as well.\u201d Melissa says and give you Mr. Rabbit. \u201cHe will make sure you do nothing naughty during the night.\u201d You hug him tightly and smile behind your pacifier.<br>\r\n\u201cGood night babies and do not do anything naughty, I have you on the baby monitor.\u201d Melissa warns and leaves the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay next to Merry, while Willy lies on the other side of the crib. All three of you have thick and full diapers on and you all hug your favorite stuffies. Merry hugs a doll, while Willy hugs a big teddy bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have never shared a crib and wonder if this could be a funny night?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She is very brave and always protect me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s Teddy!\u201d exclaims William \u201cIt\u2019s a very kind bear and always comforts me when Nanny Melissa punishes me.\u201d<br>\r\nYou take out Mister Rabbit too, saying \u201cHe\u2019s Mister Rabbit. He is a true gentleman, and always believes in me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think of your owner, Teddy?\u201d you say, moving Mister Rabbit like he is the one who talked.<br>\r\n\u201cI like Willy.\u201d William replies, like if Teddy is speaking \u201cHe\u2019s very mature and tough, but sometimes he needs me to calm himself down, especially when Nanny Melissa uses the hairbrush.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you, Mister Rabbit?\u201d intervenes Meredith, moving Betty \u201cYou surely know a lot about the princess. Can you tell us how many diaper changes she gets in a day?\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, but decide to keep with the game, and so you make Mister Rabbit reply \u201cBetty, dear, I\u2019m sure you are a gentlewoman, so you shouldn\u2019t ask things that are so private. But I assure you that she needs a lot.\u201d you stop to move him, and add \u201cMister Rabbit! That\u2019s private!\u201d<br>\r\nMerry giggles, and then makes the dolly says \u201cOh, you are very funny, Mister Rabbit. And can you tell us if there is someone in the palace that the princess dislikes?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThere is one, of course.\u201d you make him say \u201cShe can\u2019t stand Samantha, the unfair nanny.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMister Rabbit, do you know Janet too?\u201d William makes Teddy say \u201cThere\u2019s anything you can tell to Willy about her?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe is a very smart girl.\u201d you make your stuffy reply \u201cAnd she\u2019s my owner best friend. Please, tell William that if he tries anything funny with her, the princess will have him spanked.\u201d<br>\r\nWilliam blushes, as makes Teddy reply \u201cAnd who will spank him, Mister Rabbit? Your owner?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, she will try everything to get him in trouble with nanny Melissa. And I\u2019m sure your owner knows well her laps.\u201d you make him say.<br>\r\nMerry intervenes, adding \u201cBut I\u2019m sure everyone will get along in the end.\u201d<br>\r\nShe made the doll say that, of course.<br>\r\nAs you are about to reply, the door of the nursery opens, and Nanny Melissa enters, wearing a nighty.<br>\r\n\u201cAm I wrong, or I said you three to sleep?\u201d she says \u201cPlaytime is during the day, not during the night. Night is made to sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut we couldn\u2019t have fun today!\u201d you complain.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s because today you were grounded.\u201d she replies, sweetly \u201cNow, please, hug your toys and sleep. Or must I sing you the red lullaby?\u201d<br>\r\nBoth Merry and Willy immediately say \u201cNo, no, nanny. We\u2019ll sleep!\u201d<br>\r\nCurious about it, you ask \u201cWhat is the red lullaby, nanny Melissa?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a special lullaby. It is made of the sound of bottoms that turn red. It works wonders to kids that don\u2019t want to sleep.\u201d she explains \u201cDo you want to hear it, princess Susan?\u201d<br>\r\nRealizing that is a colorful way to threat a spanking, you shake your head and say \u201cNot necessary, thank you. I\u2019ll sleep.\u201d<br>\r\nMelissa smiles, and leaves the room again. You say goodnight to the siblings, and fall asleep.<br>\r\nIn the morning, you feel someone waking you up. As you open your eyes, you realize two things: first, nanny Melissa is touching your shoulder to wake you up; second, you are hugging Meredith, who\u2019s still asleep. Blushing, you immediately let her go, saying to the nanny \u201cPlease, Nanny Melissa, don\u2019t say this to her.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I? You were so cute.\u201d she says, removing you from the crib \u201cBut if it\u2019s so important to you, I will not say a word about it.\u201d<br>\r\nYou smile, as she wakes up both William and Meredith.<br>\r\nOnce all of you are awake, she reaches the changing table and says \u201cNow, it\u2019s diaper changing time. Princess, you can come first.\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, and complain to her saying \u201cYou\u2019ll change my diaper in front of them?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, when I say something to you, you will obey me without complaining, if you don\u2019t want to get a mouth soaping.\u201d she says, sternly \u201cThis is your only warning for these three days. Come here this instant!\u201d<br>\r\nDefeated, you lay on the changing table. She undresses you, removes your dirty diaper and cleans you up. Before putting a new diaper on you, however, she lifts your legs up, in what is commonly referred as \u201cdiaper position\u201d, and gives you five fast and very hard spanks with her hand. They are strong, and the surprise emphasizes them more.<br>\r\n\u201cOuch!\u201d you exclaim \u201cWhy did you spanked me?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt was only a maintenance spanking, princess.\u201d she explains, continuing the diapering process \u201cThis is how I give them. You will receive three of them, today. This was the first, the second will be administer after today\u2019s nap and the third before bedtime. This is how Nanny Melissa treats naughty children that misbehaved and earned the lock.\u201d<br>\r\nRemembering that Rose gave your maintenance spankings only after your nap and over your diaper, you realize why Melissa is considered stricter than her.<br>\r\nOnce finished, she repeats the entire process (spanking included) with both Meredith and William.<br>\r\nWilliam looks embarrassed, just like you. Meredith, however, seems at ease with you looking at her.<br>\r\nOnce all of you are diapered, Melissa dresses you up. Meredith is putted in a yellow onesie with the words \u201cMy Nanny spanked me\u201d printed on the chest, just over the printed photo of a pair of red buttocks. William is putted in a light blue one, with a heart with a sad face printed on it. And you are putted in a pink one, with the printed words \u201cLeader of a crew of rascals\u201d. She has putted locks on all of you.<br>\r\nThe outfits mark you as naughty children, without even the necessity to see the locks. Rose wouldn\u2019t have done this.<br>\r\nAs you enjoy your breakfast, Nanny Melissa explains \u201cYou two will now go to your morning lesson with Miss Spencer. You, princess, will instead attend your class as usual in the afternoon.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat will I do till then?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\nShe replies \u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201eYou can spend time with Janet.\u201c Nanny Melissa says to your surprise. You could not be happier, after spending all afternoon, strapped in the baby bouncer, the day before you look forward to have some fun with your best friend.<br>\r\nSmiling from ear to ear you waddle into the hallway and almost knock on Janet\u2019s door, when you remember her oath. \u201cOn no, what will she say if she sees me like this?\u201d You ask yourself and hesitate. One maid is walking by and giggle about the sentence on your onesie. When you see a second one coming with Mr. Benedict Walker, you knock quickly and step in.<br>\r\nJanet is sitting on her bed, reading a book. Her short skirt shows of a regular diaper, that looks so tiny compared to yours.<br>\r\n\u201cHEY! Susan, what is going one? They took away my game console and forbid me to see Merry, Willy or you. What the hell happened?\u201d<br>\r\nYou sigh deeply and give her the full story. At first she is very angry that you haven\u2019t told the queen or the nannies about your oath, but the more you tell her, the quieter she gets.<br>\r\n\u201cOh man, I am not sure if I should be grateful or angry. I mean, I told you I take the same as you do and tell the Queen it was my idea.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes you did, but you are not\u2026 you are a guest and should not fall under the same rules as we do.\u201d You explain, trying to be as polite as possible.<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I am not one of you guys? Because I am just a visitor?? Damn it Susi, we are best friends and you tell me I am not part of your inner circle???\u201d Janet gets angry and throw her book across the room.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you are my bestie and I l\u2026 like you a lot, I don\u2019t want to see you getting spanked or\u2026 for god sake, Janet, you don\u2019t know what you are asking for!\u201d You defend yourself, but Jane has a different point of view. She pushes you out of the way and storm out into the hallway. With your thick diaper, you have issues to follow her. She is turning to the right and goes even faster, while she aims for the official office of the Queen.<br>\r\n\u201cJanet stop! You can\u2019t run in there and interrupt her, maybe she has important business going on!\u201d But Janet is unstoppable. She knocks twice and before you can reach her, she enters the office and close the door behind her. You almost stumbles into it, when you finally reach it.<br>\r\nOut of breath you knock on the door and wait for a reply.<br>\r\n\u2026.<br>\r\nNothing!<br>\r\nYou knock again and this time you hear Queen Charlotte. \u201cJust a minute please.\u201d<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\nThe minutes must be a very long one. At least it feels like you spend fifteen minutes outside of the office and step from one foot to the other.<br>\r\nFinally the door opens and Janet leaves the office, smiling proudly and holding a note in her hand.<br>\r\n\u201cI will be punished by Nanny Melissa, just like you and the others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you can\u2019t! I already took the blame!\u201d You insist and enter the Queens office.<br>\r\n\u201cYour majesty, you did a mistake!\u201d You blur out. \u201cJanet is my guest and she cannot be treated like a common Calonian girl.\u201d<br>\r\nThe Queen looks amused, and put aside her pen.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincesses Susan, what a surprise to see you here, after I haven\u2019t allowed you to enter and neither allowed you to speak.\u201d<br>\r\nYou gulp hard and bend out head. \u201cI am very sorry my Queen, but Janet is my best friend and I cannot see her suffer for my mistakes.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, but she explained to me that it was her idea and now the INSIST on being punished like you and your little friends. I have to say this is a rare case, but it somebody begs me to be punished, I like to grant that wish.\u201d The Queen explains and writes down something on a note, that she gives to you.<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, for you it is easy, since you are a citizen of this country. For Janet we made exceptions, but no that she begs to be treated equal, she will at least be punished like one of you.\u201d She giggles. \u201cShe only ask to keep her videogames that was her only condition.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see that the decisions are made and will not be reversed. A short look at the paper further tells you, that you will have your mouth soaped very soon. Fearing further NOTES from the Queen you politely leave the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside you look around for Janet\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You begin to walk through the corridors, thinking about the note the queen gave you: an instruction for Nanny Melissa to give you a mouth soaping. You are not eager to that, and you are even much less eager to see Janet getting punished. What will she receive? A spanking, an enema and a thicker diaper (maybe with booster pads) for sure. But the shameful onesie and the lock? Will she receive that?<br>\r\nYou are completely absorbed in your thoughts, and don\u2019t notice a person coming from the other side of the corridor: you bump into the other person. The impact that follows make you lose your balance and fall on your butt, covered by the diaper. The knock made you even release your bladder, so you wet yourself.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t see you.\u201d you apology, trying to getting up.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, well. If  it isn\u2019t the little stinky princess \u2026\u201d<br>\r\nYou freeze, recognizing the voice. You look up, and with your dismay you see lord Richard himself.<br>\r\n\u201cYou!\u201d you angrily exclaim \u201cWhy are you still in the palace?\u201d<br>\r\nHe doesn\u2019t even reply to your question, he simply take you by your hear forcing you to getting up. He looks at you with is icy and sharp eyes, and with a voice much similar to a roar than a human voice, he says \u201cThis morning, in today\u2019s publication of Calonia\u2019s Echo, I read the interview you granted yesterday to them. Stupid girl, how you dare mocking me in front of the press?\u201d<br>\r\nYou are about to yell, but he grabs you by your cheeks with his right hand, covering your mouth.<br>\r\n\u201cLet me tell you a secret, naughty wet pants.\u201d he whispers \u201cGrairven family doesn\u2019t give a fuck about the tradition. I was potty trained when I was 3 years old.\u201d<br>\r\nHe begins to drag you along the empty corridor, adding \u201cNow I will teach you a lesson that you\u2019ll never forget about respecting the nobles of this country. We will find a more secluded area and I will have a long talk with you. Sorry, I correct myself: I will have a long talk with your buttock. I promise that you will not be able to sit down for weeks after I have finished with you.\u201d<br>\r\nTears begin to run from your eyes: you feel so impotent in front of him. Is not like in your dreams.<br>\r\nJust as he\u2019s almost dragged you away from the corridor, you hear a strong voice from behind your back, that says in a very firm tone: \u201cRelease the princess this instant, or you will answer to the queen about it.\u201d<br>\r\nYou immediately recognize the deep voice of Mr. Benedict, the Butler. You\u2019ve never been so grateful to meet him.<br>\r\n\u201cYou are one of the palace\u2019s servants.\u201d Richard says, looking above your head \u201cI am a noble, you idiot. Now scram! I have a private affair with the princess.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cScram? Or what?\u201d Benedict replies \u201cYou\u2019ll whip me? I am the Butler of the Royal Palace, not a servant of your manor. Raise a finger on me and be sure that I will sue you, and before that I will defend myself.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDefend yourself?\u201d Richard laughs \u201cI am the best fencer in the country. A servant cannot beat me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI am aware that I can\u2019t compete with you.\u201d the Butler simply replies \u201cBut if we fight, be sure that everyone in the palace will run here to help me. I\u2019m the Butler, and in the Palace my words are credited as the queen\u2019s herself. Do you really want to show to the entire country your true face, my lord?\u201d My lord was said in a defiant tone.<br>\r\nRichard roar, and lets you go. He turns around and leaves, telling to you \u201cWe will meet again, potty pants.\u201d<br>\r\nJust as he has left, your turn to the Butler.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright, princess?\u201d he asks.<br>\r\nWithout answering, you run to him and hug him tightly, crying and saying repeatedly \u201cThank you, thank you, thank you \u2026\u201d<br>\r\nHe seems insecure, it\u2019s obvious that he\u2019s not used to be hugged.<br>\r\n\u201cHush, princess. It\u2019s all okay now.\u201d he says, with his usual deep voice but with a kinder tone \u201cI can bring you back to your nursery, if you want.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, stopping your cry but still sobbing a little, as the Butler lift you in his arms and begins to carry you to Melissa\u2019s nursery.<br>\r\nAs you enter in the nursery, you see Melissa standing in the middle of the room, and Janet in the baby bouncer, with a pacifier in her mouth.<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Benedict? Princess?\u201d the nanny says, quite astonished \u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\nThe Butler explains to her what happened, and then leaves you in her arms.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, little princess.\u201d she says, hugging you as Benedict leaves \u201cDo you want me to call here nanny Rose? I\u2019m sure she can comfort you better than me.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, and the tall nanny leave the nursery. You are left alone with Janet.<br>\r\nYou look at her. She is in the bouncer and with a visible heavy padding. She is obviously wearing booster pads, that mean she got an enema too.<br>\r\nHer outfit \u2026</span></div></div>",

I am sure that you regret it now?!\u201d You talk to your friend.<br>\r\nWith the strapped in pacifier Janet cannot say anything that would be easy to understand. At first she shakes her head and tries to look proud, but then a cramp hits her tummy and she wince like a little puppy. Her pacifier makes soft smacking noises, when she starts to suck on it to distract herself from the inevitable. Her hands tighten around the straps of the baby bouncer and she closes her eyes, while your hands sneaks to her padded behind.<br>\r\nEven through the diaper, booster pad and romper, you can feel her fill her diaper while she expel the enema. She wince even more when she opens her eyes and see you, standing behind her.<br>\r\n\u201cIt is okay Janet, you are so brave.\u201d You try to calm her down, walk around her and hug her.<br>\r\nHanging in the baby bouncer she is a bit smaller than you and you feel warmth spreading out in your chest, while you hug her and rub her back. It feels good to be the one that cares for others, especially for your best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Princess, I see I am not longer needed.\u201d Nanny Rose calls from the door. You let Janet go and run to your nanny. \u201cOh you are needed! Lord Richard caught me and dared to beat me up!\u201d You feel fresh tears again while you hang on your nanny and tell her what happened. Telling it to Rose feels good, but there is a burning question that you must ask. You let go off Rose and step back: \u201cWhy is he in the palace, he should be banned forever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose sighs and nod her head. \u201cIn theory you are right, but we have no proof about what had happened beside Mr. Walker\u2019s and your word. That might be enough for US, but not for the public. And he will for sure involve the press if we banish him from the palace. I am sorry to say that, but if he does not attack you in public, we cannot do much besides watching you all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh great, now I have no more freedom at all.\u201d You think, but stay quiet and nod your head.<br>\r\nWhile you think about the unfair situation Nanny Melissa helps Janet out of the bouncer and put her in a high chair. Your stomach growls and you notice that it is already time for lunch. Obedient you let Rose lift you in a second high chair and allow her to hold your bottle of formula, while Nanny Melissa holds the one for Janet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo I have to take a nap? I am not tired\u201d, you complain and feel a little cramp. \u201cAnd I need to use the bathroom for number two.\u201d You need to try it with Rose, but you have expected her answer, especially in front of Melissa.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry little one, you will use your diaper, like ALWAYS.\u201d She says, the last word more to Melissa than to you.<br>\r\nMelissa grins and lift Janet into the wide crib of Willy and Merry. A second later you lie beside her and look for Mr Rabbit. When you found him, you hug him and blush, when you see Janet\u2019s facial expression.<br>\r\n\u201cUhm\u2026 do you think it is childish to have a stuffed, best friend?\u201d You ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet has to think about this, but finally shakes her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJanet, should I look for your stuffie?\u201d Rose offers. Janet\u2019s face slips and she looks down, while she shakes her head slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRose and Melissa know immediately what is going on and react on the spot.

Hesitating and blushing, she takes a fluffy sheep from Melissa and look at her with big, grateful eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cIt is okay baby. No need to be ashamed.\u201d Melissa comforts her.<br>\r\nShe even give her a kiss on the forehead, while Rose kisses you.<br>\r\nHugging your stuffed animals the two of you fall asleep.

You look around, and you see Meredith lying next to you, while William is lying next to Janet. The crib feels quite small, now, and all of you are crammed in it. You blush when you understand what the warm sensation is: Merry is not hugging her dolly, but you.<br>\r\nExactly in that moment, a hand touch your shoulder.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, I saw you open your eyes. Wake up, please.\u201d<br>\r\nIs the voice of Rose. You smile, as you turn your head to her. <br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, nanny.\u201d you say, then adding \u201cAre you here to take me back to our nursery?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFirst of all, princess, it\u2019s not morning, but afternoon. This was your nap, remember?\u201d she replies \u201cAnd no, you\u2019ll stay in nanny Melissa\u2019s nursery today and tomorrow, and only then you will return to mine.\u201d<br>\r\nMelissa is here too, and immediately adds \u201cI read the queen\u2019s note that was in your pocket, princess. Why haven\u2019t you tell me about it?\u201d<br>\r\nYou go pale, replying \u201cI forgot, nanny Melissa! Please, trust me! Richard made me forgot about it!\u201d<br>\r\nRose takes you out of the crib, after casting aside Merry\u2019s arms, and as she proceeds to awake the others three, nanny Melissa says to you \u201cI believe you, princess. Lord Richard has the tendency to make everyone so angry that your forgetfulness is understandable. Despite that, you\u2019ll get your mouth soaping.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMouth soaping?\u201d says Janet, still yawning \u201cWhat has she done?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems that the princess forgot her manners while talking to queen Charlotte, this morning.\u201d Melissa explains \u201cAnd her majesty herself requested a mouth soaping for this.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAemh \u2026 can I have my diaper changed, first?\u201d you ask, but the tall nanny shakes her head.<br>\r\n\u201cFirst, the mouth soaping, then the diaper change and last but not least the spanking.\u201d she explains.<br>\r\n\u201cSpanking?\u201d Rose intervenes \u201cYou mean maintenance spanking, right?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Rose, I mean a punishment spanking.\u201d Melissa states \u201cThe mouth soaping is the punishment requested by the queen, and the spanking will be for shaming her caretaker, that\u2019s me, with her behavior.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s really necessary? I mean \u2026\u201d Rose begins, but Melissa interrupts her.<br>\r\n\u201cRose, I respect you, really. But I don\u2019t accept that another nanny tells me how to run my nursery.\u201d<br>\r\nRose blush a little and nod, as Melissa takes you next to the sink.<br>\r\nYou stayed silence, aware that you could only worsen your situation.<br>\r\nMelissa wash your mouth with soap, then removes your dirty diaper, and as she stated she concludes the entire procedure giving you a spanking with the noisy but not much painful spanking paddle, before putting you in a fresh one.<br>\r\nYou cry and run to Rose, who hugs you.<br>\r\n\u201cMelissa is right.\u201d she whispers \u201cYou earned that, but it\u2019s now over.\u201d<br>\r\nYou stay in her arms, while nanny Samantha changes all three of your friends and gives a maintenance spanking to both Willy and Janet. When it\u2019s Merry\u2019s turn, she receive a punishment spanking too.<br>\r\n\u201cEight demerits are not that much, but still too much.\u201d Melissa scolds, during the spanking. You realize is a spanking for her morning lesson with Miss Spencer.<br>\r\nWhen the procedure is over, she puts all of you back in your locked punishment onesie, the same of the morning.<br>\r\n\u201cYou are all free to go.\u201d concludes Melissa \u201cMerry, Willy, you will both return here for your dinner. Princess, I expect to see you here after your lesson. Janet, you are completely free. You can come here after dinner to sleep with your friend or you can go back to your room. Be aware that I will remove the lock only tomorrow in both cases.\u201d<br>\r\nAs Merry and Willy leave the room, however, a woman enters in the nursery.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt.\u201d she says.<br>\r\n\u201cNo interruption at all, Lady Kent.\u201d Melissa replies with a bow. Rose bows too.<br>\r\nIt\u2019s the prime minister. You haven\u2019t seen her since the mess with the chocolate.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, the queen and I have been informed of what happened with lord Richard.\u201d she says \u201cSo we\u2019d like to give you a escort for your movements.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAn escort?\u201d you exclaim, blushing \u201cI don\u2019t need it, really!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your decision, little one.\u201d lady Kent replies, with a kind voice \u201cI\u2019m sure that you will be grateful for it in very little time.\u201d<br>\r\nShe then turns to the door, saying \u201cYou can come in.\u201d<br>\r\nAt her command, a woman enters in the nursery. She has short blonde hair and is quite tall, even if not as much as Melissa, and wears a thin silver armor that to you seems quite anachronistic. At the left side of her belt, she carries a rapier, similar to the one in your dream, while in the right side she carries a scary looking black handgun.<br>\r\nWithout waiting a second, she completely kneels before you, and says with a determined voice \u201cPrincess Susan, my name is Eden Langdon, of Calonians Royal Knights. I vow to you to serve you and protect you from your enemies, and to give my life for you without regrets if it will be necessary.\u201d<br>\r\nAs you look at her, not knowing what to say, the prime minister intervenes \u201cWe thought that a woman would have been less problematic for you. But I assure that we would have chosen her even if it wasn\u2019t a problem. Eden is the best gunner and one the bests fencer in the country.\u201d<br>\r\nEden is still kneeled, and you decide to say \u201cYou \u2026 can get up,  ma\u2019am.\u201d<br>\r\nThe lady knight gets up, but replies \u201cNo need to call me that. I\u2019m at your service, my lady.\u201d<br>\r\nIn hearing her calling you \u201cmy lady\u201d, you blush. Rose notices that and can\u2019t avoid to giggle.<br>\r\nAfter having greeted the nannies and lady Kent, you leave the nursery to go to your lesson, followed by Janet and the knightess.<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, now I have a guardian angel, too.\u201d you sigh, during the path, telling to Janet \u201cShe will tell everyone if I do something naughty, if she doesn\u2019t spank me herself.\u201d<br>\r\nTo your surprise, Eden intervenes saying \u201cNo, princess. Your discipline is not my concern, only your safety is. If you do something naughty, I would not punish you, nor I will report it to anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo you can\u2019t punish her?\u201d Janet asks (nanny Melissa removed her pacifier before letting her go).<br>\r\n\u201cI can.\u201d she replies \u201cAnd I will in a specific occasion: if she endangers herself.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIf I endanger myself?\u201d you ask, skeptical.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, my lady. If you endanger yourself you would lacking respect toward my duty to protect you, so I will punish you on the spot.\u201d she explains \u201cThat means that if you put yourself in danger, I will spank you wherever we are, in your nursery or in the middle of the palace.\u201d<br>\r\nPicturing you on this strong woman knees, you blush, thinking that would be much worse than be spanked by Rose or Melissa, especially if in front an audience.<br>\r\nFinally, you reach Miss Spencer office.

I thought we have a lesson with Miss Spencer?\u201d You almost whisper. Janet beside you has a similar facial expression and gulps hard. \u201cHi.\u201d She says. Both of you are already happy to have Eden behind you, no matter who that man is, he will not be able to hurt you\u2026 .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood afternoon Princess Susan, good afternoon Janet, girlfriend of Princess Susan.\u201d The man greets you with a little nod of his head. He use the paddle to point at the tables and ask you to sit down.<br>\r\n\u201cWe already waste enough time. Can you tell me why you are two minutes too late?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the clock on the wall and see the pointer jumping to 13:02.<br>\r\n\u201cSir, we are only a minute late, because\u2026 I do not know why. You see I have a guard now and it took a bit longer to organize ourselves. And, by the way Janet is my friend, not my girlfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man makes an angry face and let the paddle crash on the table.<br>\r\n\u201cDO NOT TALK UNSELL I TELL YOU SO!\u201d He booms and flip the white-board open. In HUGE letters you see a name: MARCUS GRAIRVEN.<br>\r\n\u201cThis is my name, but you will only call me Sir, simple enough for you to remember. I do not tolerate smart mouthing or any other kind of misbehavior. Further I like to make sure that naughtiness is cured on the spot and not ONLY later. For that I have the paddle, for example. I will use it when you misbehave to make sure you do not forget why you get punished.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Janet, who looks totally in shock.<br>\r\n\u201cUhm, Sir! Does that mean that we earn no demerits?\u201d You ask, just to be sure you understand him correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, I have not said anything like this. You need to listen more careful, please get up and bend over your desk.\u201d Mr Grairven says. The name rings a bell and suddenly you understand.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you the brother of Lord Richard?\u201d You ask, while you bend over your desk.<br>\r\nYou prepare for a slap, but when the paddle hits you, it still hurt a lot. It is obviously not the same kind of paddle that Melissa use. This one is quiet, but hurts a lot. He gives you 5 slaps with it and your behind burns under your diaper. Wetness spread around your crotch and you notice, that you are wetting yourself.<br>\r\n\u201cFive slaps for coming late, smart mouthing and talking without permission, three times.\u201d He counts out and let you back to your seat.<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Janet, now I is your turn.\u201d He point his finger at Janet. \u201cJANET!\u201d He shouts after Janet did not move at the first call. Janet jumps up and lay flat across her table. She receive two slaps. One for coming late and one for needing two calls to react.<br>\r\nJanet is harder than you, but even she has a tear running down her face when she is allowed to sit down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that horrible start it is getting a bit better. He is teaching history and repeats some stuff you have learned from Miss Spencer already. That helps you a lot and he has no reason so spank you further. After a little break he continues with math and asks you to calculate complex functions without using a calculator of making notes.<br>\r\nWhile Janet has no big issues with this, you have major issues. You find yourself using your hands to remember numbers and to write down tiny number on your paper.<br>\r\n\u201cI see you have issues princess. I wonder how you passed an interview and even manage to talk bad about my cousin when you have problems to count to three without using your hands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew it!\u201d You call out in your mind, but stays quiet.<br>\r\nTo distract him from your lack of math-skills you raise your hands and wait patiently from him to call you.<br>\r\n\u201cSir, could you tell us where Miss Spencer is and when she is back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Grairven sit down on the edge of his big table and smiles.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, I am pleased to hear that you are concerned, since you are the reason she is on sick leave. Miss Spencer has a bladder-infection and is in too much pain to teach. I am not an expert with the female illnesses, but it I was asked to teach you for a couple of days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne the one hand you feel sorry for her, but on the other hand you know that you are only the reason she wore a diaper once. While the other times was have been triggered by her and Mr. Benedict\u2019s \u201cactivities\u201d. But this is something you will not tell the mean substitute teacher.<br>\r\nYour plan to distract him has still worked and he end the lesson without spanking you more\u2026at least that is what you think.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, Janet, I thank you for your attention, now you only need to receive your regular spanking and you may go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRegular spanking Sir? But why?\u201d You blur out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wear onesie with locks, so you are naughty little girls. And naughty little girls get maintenance spankings by the end of my lessons. You now receive one extra-slap for talking without permission.\u201d He grins and grab his paddle. You do not know how long he will spank you and this time he is not counting either. He just keep slapping your behind with the paddle until you cry and sob. \u201cEDEN!\u201d You call out in pain. \u201cProtect me!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knightess, that have been standing by the door like a statue walks up to Mr Grairven and stops his hand. \u201cSir, you are crossing a line. Control yourself or I will make you pay.\u201d<br>\r\nAll color vanish from his face, but he is a Grairven and does not miss a chance to be cruel. \u201cJust two more, then it is over.\u201d He says in a thin voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your dismay, Eden let him go. She looks at you and apologizes. \u201cI am very sorry princess, as long as it is a normal punishment I cannot stop him, it is part of his job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and bite down on your bottom lip, while he slaps you two last times.<br>\r\nWhen you get up from the table you waddle to Eden and hug her. The warrior looks a bit surprised, but lay her hands on your shoulders and let you cry at her armored chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet is not spared either, but he is less harsh with her and counts down from ten while he spanks her. It is still hard for you to see your brave friend starts to cry. When she is done, she comes to you and take your hand. \u201cWhat a bastard.\u201d She whispers and pushes the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, but you forgot your notes.\u201d He calls from his desk with a sickly sweat voice. You and Janet walk to him to take your notes. On your way out you open yours and gasp in shock. \u201c20 demerits? After he already spanked me?\u201d Janet has 12 points and does not feel better. To avoid further trouble the tree of you walk to the nursery and hand the notes over to Melissa.<br>\r\n\u201cThe substitute teacher is the cousin of Lord Richard. He is cruel and spanked us AND he gave us demerits. This is unfair!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa checks your red and pink behinds for serious damage, before she decide about the notes\u2026 . <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A teacher can discipline pupils as he see fit. That means that he is free to give you both paddling and demerits.\u201d<br>\r\nYou lower your head to, adding in an angry tone \u201cBut he\u2019s a Grairven! The cousin of Richard! Why the queen has let him be the supply teacher? It\u2019s unfair!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUnfair \u2026\u201d nanny Melissa says, with a sigh \u201c\u2026 you say that a lot, princess. Think about it: does it seem fair to you that a qualified teacher is denied a job only for his surname? He was strict, maybe too much strict because he probably had hold a grudge for the interview, but he taught you correctly, hasn\u2019t he? Now, princess, please tell me: do you want to become a wise ruler, or a tyrant that eliminate anyone she doesn\u2019t like?\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, looking at her. With anger, you realize she is right.<br>\r\n\u201cSo, my demerits \u2026\u201d you whisper, almost beginning to cry.<br>\r\nMelissa smiles, then takes both notes and, with a decided movement, she rips in two both of them, before throwing them into the trash can.<br>\r\n\u201cAs I said, he is free to give you demerits, but I don\u2019t feel obliged to listen to a Grairven.\u201d she says, giving you a wink.<br>\r\nShe then takes a blank piece of paper and write something on it. When she is finished, she says \u201cYou will give Mr. Grairven this paper, tomorrow. It\u2019s a paper with my signature that specify the maximum number of paddling he can gives you. As your nanny (even if temporary), I\u2019m fully in charge of your discipline. If he crosses the line, your escort will be allowed to stop him.\u201d<br>\r\nShe puts the paper down, and you immediately hug her, saying \u201cThank you, nanny Melissa.\u201d<br>\r\nThe nanny hugs you back, saying \u201cAs far as I know, Merry and Willy are in the garden. You can have fun with them for the rest of your afternoon, before returning here for your dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI can have a regular dinner?\u201d Janet asks.<br>\r\nMelissa nods, replying \u201cIt\u2019s your choice, Janet. You can have a regular dinner than return in your room, have a regular dinner then come here to sleep with your friends, come here to have a dinner like them then return to your room, or come here to have a dinner like them and sleep with them too. The choice is yours. As I said, however, I will only remove your lock tomorrow, and your little friend, the fluffy sheep, will stay in the nursery.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo I can hug Miss Snowflake only in the nursery?\u201d Janet asks, making you giggle.<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Snowflake?\u201d you say, incapable to stop giggling \u201cIt\u2019s that her name?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have a problem with that?\u201d she replies, looking at you with a fake resentful tone \u201cIt\u2019s more original than Mister Rabbit.\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, saying \u201cHey! Don\u2019t offend him! He\u2019s very sensitive!\u201d<br>\r\nMelissa giggles herself, then says \u201cYou\u2019d better go, now.\u201d<br>\r\nYou both greet the nanny and leave then nursery, trying to reach the garden.<br>\r\n\u201cEden, can I ask you something?\u201d you ask to your escort during the path.<br>\r\nThe knightess nods, replying \u201cOf course, my lady.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWill you follow me everywhere, without taking breaks? It\u2019s not a too heavy task?\u201d you ask her.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, do not insult me, my lady.\u201d she replies \u201cIt\u2019s my duty to follow and protect you. I do not consider it a heavy task at all. It\u2019s however true that I need breaks too. I need to drink, eat and go to the bathroom. I\u2019m a human and not a robot, after all. I\u2019ll leave you in the care of your nanny at dinnertime and I will return at your side after your breakfast, when you are ready to leave the nursery. The same I will do for lunch: I will leave you in the nursery for lunchtime and return after your nap.\u201d<br>\r\nYou breathe a sigh of relief, now knowing that she will not watch you during your diaper changes. It would have been quite shameful.<br>\r\nYou reach the garden, trying not to think to your wet diaper. You could have asked to nanny Melissa for a change, but you knew it would have been pointless, so you decided to don\u2019t ask at all.<br>\r\nIn the garden, you instantly sees two different couples of people. One couple is Merry and Willy, that are playing rock-paper-scissor or something similar. On the other side of the garden, instead, you see a quite old woman, that you immediately identify as Amelia the Housekeep, even if you haven\u2019t seen her before, that is talking to Alice, the young maid in training pants. The sensation is that the Housekeeper is scolding the maid for something.<br>\r\nYou should really go to the siblings, and you will, but before that wouldn\u2019t be interesting to eavesdrop at the conversation between the two women, even if aware that the Housekeep has the authorization to punish you?

What has distracted you?\u201d Amelia asks, with her fists pressed against her hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice blushes and is looking very uncomfortable. \u201cI\u2026 I am very sorry Ma\u2019am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe had that, but what was distracting you\u2026 oh no,\u2026 let me guess, it is still distracting you, isn\u2019t it? That is the reason why you press your knees together and step on your toes all the time. You look like my grand-daughter when she need to pee. Jesus, then go to the bathroom if you need to pee, but finish your job!\u201d Amelia scolds Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 no, I do not need to pee. I need to go to the supply room.\u201d Alice admits, blushing even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe housekeep sighs and lift the young maid\u2019s skirt, revealing some soaked training pants.<br>\r\n\u201cAlice, again? How often did you changed yourself during the day? Three times? Have you ever made it to the bathroom in time? Did you left the queens bed unfinished, because you were almost leaking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan feels sorry for the young maid, but cannot hold back a smile. Slowly she takes a few steps to look at the next flowers, while the maid nods her head.<br>\r\n\u201cI made it trice, but yes, this is the third little accident I have. I planned to get changed quickly, but then there was another maid in the supply room and I was too embarrassed to grab fresh trainers. I am so sorry Ma\u2019am.\u201d A fresh tear run down her face and she quickly wipe it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHush little one, it is okay. It is hard for some young adults to adapt to the new situation. Still, you cannot provide bad results and risk to ruin the palace carpets. You will wear REAL protection until further notice and let yourself get changed by\u2026 \u201c. The old woman looks around the garden and sees Willy and Merry. \u201cYes, why not. To make sure you are properly protected you will have Nanny Melissa change you, when needed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT!?, BUT?!  I am an adult.\u201d Alice shrieks out, but stops when her boss poke her soaked padding against her crotch.<br>\r\n\u201cNot jet Alice. Follow my order or you have to quiet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was enough for Susan and she is too far away to hear more, but she sees when Alice walks away a few seconds later. When she reach Janet, William and Meredith, she tell them everything and all of them giggle.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think I can watch her getting changed?\u201d Willy grins and is about to waddle off, but his sister hold him back. \u201cDo not dare Willy if she tells Amelia that you spied on her all the maids will supervise you and report every mischief to Melissa.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Eden. To your luck, she did not follow you like a dog, but took a position in the middle of the garden, overlooking everything and always ready to reach you within seconds. She is a perfect bodyguard and you are happy that she did not judge you for the little games you play \u2013 at least she is not saying anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your three friends play catch me and hide and seek, but you play the second game only for two rounds, since Eden is always watching in your direction and expose your hideouts.<br>\r\nFinally it is time for dinner and Janet split off the group. She promise to come back later, but likes REAL food better than mush and formula.<br>\r\nBack in the nursery Eden officially hand you over to Melissa and wish you a good night.<br>\r\nOne by one, Melissa feed you in the high chair, before she allows you to hold your own bottles. At that moment Janet is coming back and giggle at the picture of her three friends nursing from baby bottles.<br>\r\nYou think that Melissa will put you all to sleep now, but then she checks all your diapers and shakes her head. \u201cThree wet ones and two messy as well, PLUS you all stink of sweat and dirt. I think you all need to be bathed before you can go to bed.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet is giggling, as long as Melissa checks her as well: \u201cFour wet ones and four stinking kids. You all need to bath!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she mention the coming diaper change you wonder if Alice has been lying on the same changing table a few hours before \u2013 and if she will come around to get changed later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa still think about the challenge to change and wash four babies. She decides to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s this the reason you always says inappropriate things? It\u2019s because you like it?\u201d<br>\r\nUnderstanding the veiled threat, you decide to shut up.<br>\r\n\u201cNanny Melissa, you aren\u2019t \u2026\u201d Willy begins to say, but the nanny interrupts him.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s the only solution.\u201d she explains \u201cAll four of you will enter in the bathtub together, so I can wash all of you contemporary and diaper you more quickly.\u201d<br>\r\nYou, Janet and William all blush. They have already seen you naked, but only for few seconds (a spanking and a change), not for the duration of an entire bathe. Merry, as always, seems not having problem with it. She has the modesty of a real kid.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure of it.\u201d Janet says, but Melissa shakes her head.<br>\r\n\u201cYou chose to come here after the dinner, so you have no words in the matter, little one. You are under my care for tonight.\u201d the nanny says.<br>\r\nShe starts taking you at the changing table: she undress you and removes you dirty diaper, cleaning you up and putting you down while you are still completely naked. She repeats the procedure in the same manner first with Meredith, then with Janet and last with William.<br>\r\n\u201cCome, babies. You all need a nice bath.\u201d Melissa says, smiling and leading you all in the bathroom.<br>\r\nYou wait as she fills the tub with warm water, and try not to look at your friends.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ready.\u201d nanny Melissa says \u201cYou can enter, now.\u201d<br>\r\nWithout waiting a second, Janet takes a rush and enters in the enormous bathtub (like the one in your nursery, seems more like a small pool) with a dive.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s so nice!\u201d she exclaims.<br>\r\nAs she has done that, however, the nanny takes her by her shoulder and gives to her wet bottom three hard spanks.<br>\r\n\u201cNo diving in the bathtub.\u201d she scolds \u201cIt\u2019s big, but it\u2019s not a pool.\u201d<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t like seeing Janet getting spanked, but decide not to say a word and enter in the water yourself, walking slow. Merry immediately follows you, and the so does Willy.<br>\r\nWhen all of you are in the bathtub, Melissa takes a chest and overturns its contents in the water: they are all rubber bath toys, like rubber ducks and other animals.<br>\r\n\u201cYou can play with them, while I wash you up.\u201d she says, taking a sponge and beginning to rub William\u2019s back.<br>\r\nYou and Janet both blush, as Willy and Merry takes the rubber animals in their hand. <br>\r\nWilliam is trying to concentrate himself over a dramatic battle between a rubber crocodile and a rubber shark. He\u2019s clearly trying to concentrate on it to remove his focus from Janet naked body, and despite that you see that a few times he looks at her sideways.<br>\r\nMerry is instead staging a funny conversation between a rubber tortoise and a rubber dolphin. She seems at ease, and lets Melissa wash her everywhere without a fuss. You think that she is very cute, but you immediately remove that thought.<br>\r\nAfter a while, nanny Melissa exclaims \u201cAll done. My babies are all clean and fresh now.\u201d<br>\r\nShe let you all getting outside of the water, and then proceeds to dry you off all with a towel.<br>\r\nOnce you are all dry, she lead you all back in the nursery main room and puts you on the changing table.<br>\r\nShe then proceeds to gives you your maintenance spanking, followed by the actual diapering. Once she has finished, she does the same with all of your friends, including Janet.<br>\r\n\u201cIf I had chose to return in my room, I would have avoided the maintenance spanking?\u201d Janet asks, after the slaps and while the nanny is diapering her.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, little one.\u201d Melissa explains \u201cYou would have received your maintenance spanking tomorrow morning. Since this was the last punishment day, and you all behaved very well today, tomorrow you all will wear normal clothes without locks and you\u2019ll not receive maintenance spankings. You would have, if you hadn\u2019t receive yours tonight.\u201d<br>\r\nAs the she had finished diaper Janet, she dresses you in cute rompers. They are all 4 completely identical: yellow and with a sentence printed on the chest.<br>\r\nIn seeing the sentences, you understand they are new, because all of them has the personalized sentence \u201cMy name is () and I\u2019ve been naughty\u201d.<br>\r\nThey have all of your names, so yours is \u201cMy name is Susan and I\u2019ve been naughty.\u201d while  your friends have the respective names.<br>\r\nOnly in a second moment you see that all of you have a printed sentence on the butt too: \u201cWell spanked one.\u201d<br>\r\nAs she finishes to put your romper on, she whispers to you \u201cTomorrow you\u2019ll be still under my care. When you\u2019ll go to bed tomorrow night, the following morning Rose will take you back to her nursery.\u201d<br>\r\nMelissa puts all of you in the crib, whispering \u201cGood night, my little angels.\u201d and giving all your stuffed friends to all of you: Mister Rabbit the stuffed rabbit to you, Teddy the stuffed bear to Willy, Betty the doll to Merry and Miss Snowflake the stuffed sheep to Janet.<br>\r\nYou friends fall asleep, as Melissa turns the light off and leaves. You are about to fall asleep yourself, when you hear Melissa\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n\u201cAlice? Are you here again?\u201d she says <br>\r\n\u201cUmh \u2026 nanny Melissa \u2026 I need \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI know what you need, little one.\u201d Melissa replies \u201cA diaper change and a motivational help. I only ask you to be quiet, because the children are sleeping.\u201d<br>\r\nThe door slowly opens, and the light turns on again. You pretend to sleep, and just be content to listen. You have to focus, because they are almost whispering.<br>\r\n\u201cYour diaper isn\u2019t wet, Alice, it\u2019s soaked.\u201d the nanny says \u201cAre you sure you are 19? Not even the princess pees so much.\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, and continue to listen as the maid replies \u201cI am, I am! Please, nanny, quick.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHush, Alice. Be quiet.\u201d Melissa scolds. You know she is changing her.<br>\r\nAfter few moments, you hear five swats, and you instantly know what happened.<br>\r\n\u201cOuch! What was that for?\u201d Alice exclaims.<br>\r\n\u201cKeep your voice low or I\u2019ll begin again.\u201d Melissa scolds her \u201cThis was motivational help. If you have problem behaving like an adult, maybe if next time I punish you like a kid you\u2019ll do better, right?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no! I will behave, I promise!\u201d Alice says.<br>\r\n\u201cI really hope so.\u201d Melissa says, finishing to diaper her \u201cYou are not a kid anymore, so don\u2019t aspect any leniency from me.\u201d<br>\r\nAfter that, you really fall asleep.<br>\r\nIn the morning, Melissa wakes you up.</span></div></div>",

She stands beside the taller woman and blushes, while she looks at her feet.<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning princess, I hope you and your friends does not mind. We have an assistant today. Maid Alice is\u2026 transferred away from the house-maids for a while.\u201d<br>\r\nMelissa does not go into further details. She does not tell to you kids, that Alice waited so long to get changed the evening before that she had leaked in the royal chamber and left a spot in the queen\u2019s carpet \u2013 like the Housekeep Amelia had feared and warned her about.<br>\r\nYou are still too tired to worry about all this or to complain. You are busy to wiggle out from Merry, which had again snuggled up to your side and drools on your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Alice helps you out of the crib and carries you to the changing table, with some effort.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you can handle her?\u201d Melissa asks the maid that struggles a bit with you.<br>\r\nYou have to say, as embarrassing as it is, that Melissa and Rose can carry you like a little baby, it feels better being carried by a girl that has issue to keep the balance, while she tries to lift you on the changing table.<br>\r\n\u201cI am\u2026 fine.\u201d Alice gasps and let you fall on the padded changing table.<br>\r\n\u201cOuch.\u201d You rub your behind and denies it, as Melissa push Alice away and double checks that you are fine. \u201cI guess you are not strong enough for that. Why don\u2019t you prepare the breakfast for them. I left you some instructions beside the fridge.\u201d<br>\r\nAlice looks sad, but obeys and leaves the room. You feel sorry for her when Melissa provides you the last morning maintenance spanking and put you in a fresh diaper. The sound of the spanking wakes your friends up and Janet pushes Willy off her. Like his sister he had snuggled up to the person beside him. You are sure he likes Janet and that it was not a coincident that his had was lying on her chest, when they were still sleeping.<br>\r\nYour friends are treated like you, except Janet. She does not receive a spanking and is asked if she likes to stay in diapers or go back to trainers.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I think I go back to trainers. As much as I hate it, I will have to leave in a few weeks and don\u2019t want to forget how to use the toilet.\u201d She is praised by Melissa for her mature decision and just jump off the changing table, when Maid Alice comes back, carrying a tray with four bottles and four bowls of mush. To see Janet in trainers irritates her so much, that she stumbles and almost let the tray fall down. In the last second she manage to balance it out and put it down on the tray of a high chair. She sighs deeply, but then blushes and grab her padded crotch.<br>\r\nNanny Melissa is just putting a training bra on Janet and give her a sexy dark blue dress that shows off her long legs, but she still notice the young maids behavior.<br>\r\n\u201cI saw that Alice. It is so easy for you to lose control?\u201d Melissa says, while she close the zipper on Janet\u2019s dress.<br>\r\nAlice blushes and presses her knees together. \u201cWhat? No, I am fine.\u201d She lies. \u201cUhm, why is the girl in trainers and not in diapers, is that allowed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa sighs and walks to the young maid, that steps back and almost push the tray with the bottles off the high chair. \u201cSTOP where you are.\u201d Melissa warns her and grab her padded crotch. \u201cJust as I thought. Do you have been checked for a medical issue or is it only the lack of willingness?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice blushes and pulls the nannies hand away. \u201cI\u2026 I just needs a bit more training and\u2026 I am easy to distract. Please do not fire me. Mrs Amelia says this is my last chance \u2013 and I really don\u2019t want to go back to mommy\u2026 I mean, my mother\u2019s house. She always had me in locked plastic pants and forbid me to potty train before I turned 18. Please Nanny Melissa, please keep me!\u201d She is already crying and plays with the hem of her skirt again, showing off her wet diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa might be strict, but she is fair and feels sorry for Alice. Usually parents encourage their kids to gain control over their bowel and bladder in little steps, starting when they turn 16 or 17. To expect that a young adult stays dry and clean, when he or she was forced to use the diaper until the day before is simple unrealistic and not fair. \u201cDo not worry. I get you back into panties in no time. Or in panties for the first time, whatever is true, but do not lie to me or I punish you like a naughty little girl, understood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice nods and wipe away her tears.<br>\r\nMelissa turns to you kids and announce.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay everybody, this is important. Nobody is losing a word about this. Alice is a good girl and will be a good maid, when she gets the chance. If we all help her, she will do fine and we have a new friend. Does that sounds good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam, Meredith, Janet and you agree to support the young maid, and not only because you all feel a bit guilty that you have tricked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it is time for breakfast and\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why is she in training pants, and dressed like this?\u201d<br>\r\nYou resist the urge to giggle, when Melissa sternly says \u201cAnother word and I\u2019ll take the soap, Alice.\u201d<br>\r\nThe maid goes pale, and replies, stammering \u201cSorry, sorry. Please, don\u2019t do that.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Now, to answer your questions, Janet is not a Calonian, she\u2019s a guest with a VIP-Card. That\u2019s why she is treated quite different from the other kids. God, Alice, I think you are the only maid in the entire Palace that didn\u2019t know about her.\u201d<br>\r\nThe maid blushes, and taking a bow says \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Janet. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Alice. It\u2019s not a problem.\u201d Janet replies \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s a ... pity ... to waste food. So I think I\u2019ll have breakfast here.\u201d<br>\r\nYou try not to laugh as you noticed that your friend went redder and redder with any word she said.<br>\r\nAs she finishes to talk, Meredith jumps at her and hugs her from behind, saying \u201cYou\u2019re so mature, big sis!\u201d<br>\r\nIn doing so, however, her big glasses fall from her face to the ground, and for the first time you see clearly her eyes (she removed them sometime, but you had never the occasion to look at her closely): they are dark blue, the deepest blue you have ever seen, like two sapphires. <br>\r\nImmediately, Merry puts a hand over her eyes, saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Please, don\u2019t look at me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMerry, still with this problem?\u201d Melissa says with a kind voice, looking at her \u201cYou have beautiful eyes, stop covering them.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThey are not!\u201d she exclaims, beginning even to sob \u201cThey are too dark! Susan and Janet will see them! I don\u2019t want that!\u201d<br>\r\nYou put a hand on her shoulder, saying \u201cMerry, you don\u2019t need to be ashamed for that. They are part of you, like it or not. I can assure you they are good looking, they aren\u2019t too dark.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet touches her shoulder too, adding \u201cI really like dark blue. Have you seen my dress?\u201d<br>\r\nShe begins to calm down, and Willy decides to intervene too, saying \u201cSis, please, stop sobbing. We all like you.\u201d<br>\r\nAs he says that, you think that William is a very strange boy: mischievous and arrogant, but also kind and caring. It\u2019s a strange combination that you haven\u2019t seen in any other boy before.<br>\r\nFinally, Merry calms down, and you pick up her glasses, holding her out to her.<br>\r\n\u201cHere. Your glasses.\u201d you say.<br>\r\nMeredith removes her hand, and look in your eyes with hers.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d she says, taking her glasses and putting them back on.<br>\r\nOnce the situation is solved, Melissa puts all of you in four different high-chair. One after another, she proceeds to feed you all. Once she has spoon fed you, she gives you all your bottles, letting you suck at it.<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t hold back a giggle in seeing Janet be spoon fed and then seeing her sucking at a baby bottle. You have already seen it once, but this time it\u2019s not a punishment, so it feels way more cute.<br>\r\n\u201cNow, it\u2019s dressing time.\u201d Nanny Melissa says, taking you out of your high-chairs once you have finished.<br>\r\n\u201cAlice, there are three dresses in the wardrobe. Can you please take them?\u201d she says, pointing at a great wardrobe with her finger.<br>\r\nAlice nods, and does as has been told to her, while Melissa removes the rompers she had put you three back in four your breakfast.<br>\r\nYou gulp when you see Alice coming back with a little stack of clothes with three lock on top of it.<br>\r\n\u201cNanny Melissa!\u201d you exclaim \u201cI thought you said we wouldn\u2019t have putted us in lock today! Were you lying?\u201d<br>\r\nWithout a notice, Melissa takes your shoulder and makes you turn your back to her, before giving you two smack on the top part of the legs.<br>\r\nYou let go a exclamation of pain (they weren\u2019t much strong, in reality), as she scolds you \u201cNever accuse a nanny to lie, princess! That\u2019s very rude!\u201d<br>\r\nWhile you are rubbing your legs, she explains \u201cI told that you wouldn\u2019t have lock because the punishment for the bravado in the forbidden room it\u2019s now finished. But you received a note from the queen herself, princess, and Willy is in his last day of punishment for bullying his sister in class.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the third lock?\u201d Merry says, gulping \u201cI\u2019ve been good, I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat was just precaution.\u201d she says \u201cIt was ready if needed. But it is not. You\u2019ll be not be put in punishment clothes today, Merry.\u201d<br>\r\nMelissa then proceeds to remove once again your rompers and dress you up. Willy is put in the black romper he wore during the first phase of his punishment (maybe to symbolic close a cycle), the one with the word \u201cTroublemaker\u201d. You are instead put in a black onesie with the Play Station logo, the PSN trophy symbol and under it the printed sentence \u201cTrophy unlocked: Getting a spanking from nanny\u201d. It\u2019s quite original, you have to admit it. Janet burst in laugh in seeing that. You are then both put in locks. Meredith, on the other hand, get dressed in a white onesie without lock and with the printed sentence in black letters: \u201cThe fairest of them all\u201d.<br>\r\nOnce finished, Melissa says \u201cOk. You are all free to go, now.\u201d<br>\r\nHearing that, you realise something and says \u201cWait a minute! I landed here on Monday morning, and I spent here 5 complete days plus the landing day. So today is Sunday!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, princess. None of you have lessons, today.\u201d the nanny confirms.<br>\r\n\u201cBut you said to give the supply teacher the note today.\u201d you reply.<br>\r\nFor the first time, you see Melissa blush, as she replies \u201cI lost time cognition and I made a mistake. No one is perfect.\u201d<br>\r\nMerry then hugs you, saying \u201cI\u2019m happy! We will spend the entire day together!\u201d she blushes and calms down, then adding \u201cIf ... if you want me, of course.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course we want you, Merry.\u201d Janet says \u201cWilly is free to join, too.\u201d<br>\r\nWilliam nods, and Meredith smiles.<br>\r\nYou walk toward the door, smiling, but the nanny stops you.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll await the arrival of miss Langdon, princess. She\u2019ll be here any moment now.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, and while waiting for Eden, you ask Melissa \u201cIt\u2019s anything interesting we can do?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou can go to the tournament between the Royal Knights. They\u2019ll open the training area in the morning. Or you can play like usual. Be aware that if you want to go to the tournament, you must be on your best behaviour and stay in the spectator area.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, and you leave the nursery as Eden comes to pick you up.<br>\r\nOnce outside, Merry and Willy tell to you that Miss Spencer has been taken to the hospital after their lesson, so they haven\u2019t met Marcus Grairven yet.<br>\r\nYou try to reassure Merry, who is scared of him, saying that it will be only for tomorrow.<br>\r\nWith Eden behind you and your three friends, you decide:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You look up at Eden and wonder if she would like to see the tournament. It would wonder you if not and it would be interesting for you as well. For sure there are plenty of people, maybe even some new friends to meet.<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys, let us go to the training area and watch the tournament.\u201d You suggest.<br>\r\nWilliam, Meredith and Janet agrees with you \u2013 and even Eden smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the training area three rows of benches have been places around the square in the middle. It is not like a boxing ring. Only white lines separate the fighting area from the spectators.<br>\r\n\u201cUhm is this save?\u201d You ask Eden, when you notice that there is only one meter between you and the line. The fighters would be right in front of you, swinging weapons and beating each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNormally it is perfectly save. No viewer ever has been wounded seriously, but if you want to be sure we can go to the second row and block the first, so you still can see something.\u201d Eden suggested. At first you liked the idea, but very quickly the room fills and you notice that you will force visitors to leave if you insist on blocking a full bench, just for your comfort.<br>\r\n\u201cI think I am fine.\u201d You say and hold Janet\u2019s and Merry\u2019s hands. They sit at your sites, while Willy sit next to Janet and holds her hand as well. Eden stands behind you and hushes people away that come to close for her liking. Everybody respects her and follows her orders.<br>\r\nVery soon the first match starts. It is grappling without weapons, what surprises you, but Eden explains, that a knight needs to be able to fight with or without weapons.<br>\r\nThe first fight is over when the man in blue shorts had the one with the red ones in a dead-lock and that knights gives up. They do not hit each other in the face and do not make each other bleed, what you like very much. Still is interesting to see, especially since they do not separate light from heavy knights and not even male from female. You cheer when a very agile knightess in shorts and sports bra win against a much taller and heavier knight.<br>\r\n\u201cWOW! She is good!\u201d You call out and ask Eden if she knows the knightess. \u201cYes, we often train together.\u201d She says.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you win against her?\u201d You dig further, since the tournament has a little break and the setup is changed. \u201cMore often than I lose.\u201d Eden says and you nod in respect. She must be very good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next part is more of what you have expected. The knights are heavy armored and wear swords and shields. On the Shields, on the top of the helmet and on the breast-plate they have stuff like modeling clay. In the matches, they try to hit those with their swords. The knight that damages all three areas, wins.<br>\r\nThose matches look like from a historical movie. Swords bang against each other and the knights even kick and slap each other. It is only due to the armors, that they get not wounded.<br>\r\n\u201cThis is only for the best. An amateur would accidently hit an unprotected area and could even kill his opponent.\u201d Eden explains.<br>\r\nShe is more and more absorbent by the matches and pays less attention to you and your friends.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, this is great, but I want to test something.\u201d You whisper to Janet.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, wat is the plan?\u201d She asks, grinning.<br>\r\n\u201cYou go to the bathroom and I follow you after a minute.\u201d You grin.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd Eden?\u201d Janet is not sure if she likes the idea. It is her first day in normal clothes.<br>\r\n\u201cWe can come back and bring her ice cream. They sell it by the entrance and you will get it for free, with your VIP-Card. I only want to quickly check what is behind the door at the end of the garden. I never checked that door. Have you?\u201d Janet shakes her head and finally nods her head. \u201cOkay we do it.\u201d<br>\r\nShe turns to Eden and snaps her fingers to get her attention. \u201cMiss Langdon, I quickly go to the bathroom and get us some ice-cream, okay?\u201d Eden nods and Janet disappears in the mass of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute you turn to Eden as well.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Eden, can I help Janet. She will have issues to carry all the ice. It is just over there, you can even see it from here.\u201d You point at the ice-cream stand that is\u2026 partial visible behind all the people.<br>\r\n\u201cYou can enjoy the fights of your colleagues, I am back in a minute.\u201d<br>\r\nThe moment is perfect. The knightess from before just enters the area and greets her opponent.<br>\r\n\u201cBut you need to be back immediately.\u201d She says.<br>\r\nYou wink at Merry and Willy and follow Janet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought she would follow us.\u201d You say to Janet, who stands beside the ice cream stand.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, she is still watching you. You need to run from here and hope that we make it to that door before she finds us. Are you sure it is a good idea?\u201d<br>\r\nYou shrug. \u201cWhat can happen? We are in the palace. Lord Richard is not in the town, according to Alice and I have made no further enemies so far. There is no sign at the door that it is forbidden to enter. I think we do no harm. And when we are back we still buy her ice cream.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet agrees, after thinking about is. Then she counts down from three and the two of you run up the stairs and into the long hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you\u2026</span></div></div>",

You look behind you, too make sure no one is looking at you. Saw that, you open the door and go through it, followed by Janet.<br>\r\nYou and Janet find yourself in a new area. You look head, and you see a big grass field, that seems a football field or something like that. It\u2019s like the garden an open area, delimitated by high walls. Next to the field, you see a small building. It\u2019s very small, and the palace it\u2019s so big that you are not so surprised that it contains even a smallest building inside it.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, a sport facility!\u201d exclaims Janet \u201cIt\u2019s interesting. The small building must be the locker room.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo there is an outside facility for more common sports, not only the training room.\u201d you say, reflecting aloud.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to see it more closely?\u201d Janet asks, getting a little nervous \u201cBecause I think we should go back to your escort. She will be mad, I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe said she doesn\u2019t care if I\u2019m naughty, as far I don\u2019t endanger myself.\u201d you reply \u201cAnd I\u2019m not doing anything dangerous.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet seems convinced: she nods and begins to walk toward the small building.<br>\r\nYou walk alongside her, looking at the sport facility: it\u2019s huge, and you wonder who really use it.<br>\r\nTogether, you and your bestie reach the door or the locker room. You open it and enter.<br>\r\nInside, you see that\u2019s it\u2019s not a locker room, but a small sports hall, with locker rooms and a basketball court.<br>\r\n\u201cSo they play football and basket in this country, apart that medieval games.\u201d you comment, thinking about the knights tournament.<br>\r\nYou are looking around, in curiosity. You smile seeing Janet looking at the male locker room\u2019s door.<br>\r\n\u201cJanet!\u201d you call her, after a while \u201cI think it\u2019s enough. We should go back to the training area. Eden sure is looking for me.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet nods, and you exit the building together. You walk through the football field and finally reach the door you wanted to see behind, returning in the garden.<br>\r\nYou are still giggling with Janet, when you see a woman in shining armour coming in your direction. Is obviously Eden, and she seems upset.<br>\r\nTrying to seem carefree as usual, you greet her saying \u201cHi, Eden. Were you looking for me?\u201d<br>\r\nWhen she has reached you, she simply says \u201cMy lady, do you care to explain to me why you stealthily moved away from my field of vision?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUmh \u2026 to have some fun?\u201d you reply \u201cBut it\u2019s nothing, really. You could have waited for me in the training area.\u201d<br>\r\nHer eyes seem to flame for a moment, then she grabs you by both your shoulder and begins to shake you (without using much strength), scolding you.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing? NOTHING? Princess! Do you realize that you slipped away from me without telling me anything?!\u201d she says, in a very strict and strong voice, but without yelling.<br>\r\n\u201cEden, I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re mad at me, but I haven\u2019t done anything dangerous, really.\u201d you say, trying to calm her down.<br>\r\n\u201cYou were wondering around the Palace without an escort!\u201d she says, finishing to shake you \u201cIn my opinion, that is very dangerous!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Eden, don\u2019t make a scene. Nothing happened.\u201d you say.<br>\r\n\u201cBut it could have happened!\u201d she sternly replies \u201cIf you wanted to wander around, why haven\u2019t you simply told me so? Haven\u2019t I said that I don\u2019t care if you do something naughty, since your education is not my concern? You did not trust me on the matter?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust you, really. It\u2019s only that I \u2026 acted without thinking.\u201d you confess. Your naughty part had simply overwhelmed you. During the entire scene, Janet is silently watching at her own feet.<br>\r\n\u201cSo you have put yourself in danger because you didn\u2019t think about it? That\u2019s it!\u201d Eden exclaims, and takes you in her arm.<br>\r\nShe lifts you with her left arm, holding you perpendicular to the ground grabbing you by your side, under her arm, that is pressed over your belly. She\u2019s literally carrying you like a surfboard. You thought that Rose and Melissa could carry you even too easily for your age, but in Eden arm you feel light like a real toddler.<br>\r\nYou are so surprised that you aren\u2019t able to say anything and to even think where she is taking you. She then stops, puts you down and, still holding you by an arm, she sits down in a bench in the middle of the garden.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my lady, but now I will take you over my knees.\u201d she says.<br>\r\nYou blush, and begin to yell at her \u201cIt\u2019s not fair! No! I didn\u2019t do anything dangerous! Please, not in the middle of the garden! The maids are watching!\u201d<br>\r\nShe simply ignores your protests and drag you over her knees. She then uses a key to unlock you lock (you\u2019ve seen Melissa giving something to her this morning, you now know what it was), removes your onesie and takes down the back part of your diaper.<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Not bare!\u201d you cry, in vain.<br>\r\n\u201cMy lady \u2026\u201d she says \u201c\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, but I said you that there was only one thing that would have made me spank you, and you did it. And I also said that I always punish little girls on the spot.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUmh \u2026 miss Langdon I think \u2026\u201d Janet tries to intervene, but the knightess interrupts her immediately.<br>\r\n\u201cI suggest you to be quiet, miss Janet, or you will be next.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet blushes and quieted herself. You feel a little betrayed, but you instantly forgive her when you receive the first slap, that is followed right by another.<br>\r\nYou cry out in pain: she is using only her hand, but every slap sting more than Rose\u2019s carpet beater, and you are quite sure she is not using all of her strength.<br>\r\nThe spanking itself it\u2019s quite painful, but nothing is worse than the passing maids\u2019 comments: \u201cWhat a naughty princess.\u201d \u201cI hope she will learn this time.\u201d \u201cWow, the lady knight really knows how to spank.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s turning red quite fast, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cI bet that the princess friend is next.\u201d<br>\r\nYou sob, and continue to say \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Eden. Really, really sorry!\u201d<br>\r\nAfter some other slaps, she stops. She puts the back part of your (now wet) diaper back on you, the puts you back in the onesie and puts back the lock too.<br>\r\nAs you are free to stand up, you immediately hug her, saying again \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Eden! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d<br>\r\nShe seems surprised, and takes a while for her to hug you back and whisper \u201cHush, princess. It\u2019s over, now. I promise that I will not report this to your nanny, ok?\u201d<br>\r\nWhen you have finally calm down yourself, you ask \u201cCan we go back to the tournament?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Eden replies \u201cThe final part should not be started yet.\u201d<br>\r\nYou take Janet hand, and you go back to the training area followed by Eden.<br>\r\nOnce there, you sit down next to Meredith and you hug her tightly.<br>\r\nShe seems surprised at first, but then ugh you back without questions.<br>\r\nThen \u2026</span></div></div>",

You added laxative in the children\u2019s meal! That is only for when they are blocked up, not for normal circumstances! You were so jealous of Janet\u2019s pull-up that you did that? Did you really thought that I wouldn\u2019t have noticed that an ingredient in the storage of MY nursery was disappeared?\u201d she scolds, as she spanks.<br>\r\nThe spoon leaves big red marks on Alice bottom, and you think (you rather hope it, to say the truth) that is a punishment not meant for children, but only for cases like this.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, nanny! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Alice cries out.<br>\r\nBut Melissa doesn\u2019t stop and continues to paddle her with the wooden implement.<br>\r\n\u201cYou should be grateful that I don\u2019t report what happened to the Queen herself. She would fire you instantly. And be sure that the princess and her friends will know what you did when they wake up. You will submit to every punishment they think you deserve. And after that you\u2019d better hope that the princess doesn\u2019t suggest firing you, in the end.\u201d Melissa continues to scold.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, please! You cannot let four children punish me!\u201d Alice yells \u201cStop, please! You are hurting me! How can you criticize lord Richard for whipping his servant when you do the same?\u201d<br>\r\nMelissa gives her three more slaps, before letting her get up, then replies \u201cYou realize that you did a thing possibly dangerous for the throne heir? And that you received a spanking for it - a very severe spanking, it\u2019s true, but a spanking. And I had let you decide if take it or leave the Palace. Do you think that lord Richard lets any choice? He simply whips his servants, with a true leather whip, on the back, at the slightest error they make. So, please, you can leave if you think the punishment it\u2019s too much, but don\u2019t compare us to that sadist.\u201d<br>\r\nStill sobbing, Alice hugs Melissa, then immediately hugs her back and cuddles her a little.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, nanny \u2026 I \u2026 I \u2026\u201d the maid sobs.<br>\r\n\u201cHush, hush, Alice. The important thing it\u2019s that you learned from your errors.\u201d Melissa says, kindly \u201cYou will now wake up the children, will apology to them and ask them for a punishment.\u201d<br>\r\nAs the nanny lets her go, you close your eyes, pretending to be still asleep.<br>\r\nAlice waddle toward you and wakes you all up. You pretend to awake only in that moment, but you are still quite sleepy, so pretending it is not difficult. Meredith and William both wakes up, yawning, and they blush noticing the critical condition of their diaper.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I wetted myself more than usual.\u201d it\u2019s simply Merry\u2019s comment, while Willy says \u201cI don\u2019t usually mess myself when I sleep. That\u2019s strange.\u201d<br>\r\nWhen Janet wakes up, she feels much wetter then all of you, and yellow stain was formed between her legs, on her romper.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d she exclaims \u201cI wetted myself and even \u2026 messed myself?\u201d<br>\r\nShe begins to cry, saying \u201cWhat\u2019s happened? I\u2019ve never done this before! I\u2019m so ashamed.\u201d<br>\r\nMelissa puts a hand on her shoulder, saying \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Janet. It\u2019s not your fault. You will not be put in diapers for this, I promise. Now, Alice has something to tell you.\u201d<br>\r\nYou all look at the young maid, even if you already now what it is. She blushes, and seeing that she doesn\u2019t say anything, Melissa gives her a slap on the bottom, saying sternly \u201cAlice! Speak up!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOuch! Kids, I\u2019m sorry. I was jealous of Janet\u2019s trainers and I wanted to get a payback for tricking me in the forbidden room, so I deliberately prepared four meals, put too much sleeping aid and added laxative. I\u2019m sorry, and I will accept any punishment that you think it\u2019s fitting.\u201d<br>\r\nThe four of you look at each other, while Melissa takes you all out of the crib.<br>\r\nYou have an idea and, seeing your friends\u2019 expressions, you immediately know they are thinking the same, so you say \u201cOh, we will forgive her. But she has to change our diapers herself and wear a punishment onesie for the rest of the day. It's still quite a while at dinner time, so she has a lot of occasions to make anyone in the Palace see it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Change you? But \u2026\u201d she doesn\u2019t finish her sentence because a slap on the bottom gave by Melissa stops her, making her say instead \u201c\u2026 I mean \u2026 of course, princess.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJust to be clear \u2026\u201d Willy adds \u201c\u2026 I resisted the temptation to make fun of your diaper, to be nice to you. If this is the payment, I will never be gentle with you again.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Willy.\u201d Melissa replies \u201cAfter the punishment, all is forgiven. That is how it works. It\u2019s rude to hold a grudge.\u201d she then looks at Alice, saying \u201cAnd you\u2019d better be very delicate and accurate in the changing procedure, or at any mistake you bum will suffer.\u201d<br>\r\nWhile saying this, she takes up the wooden spoon again, concluding \u201cA mistake, an immediate spank. It\u2019s that clear?\u201d<br>\r\nAlice nods, and \u2026</span></div></div>",

She whimpers and sobs, when she walks to the changing table, with her legs as wide as possible.<br>\r\n\u201cCan I take a bath when that filthy thing is off?\u201d She begs.<br>\r\nMelissa nods and rub her head. Alice takes her under the arms and lift on her the changing table. It gives a squishy, wet noise, when Alice drops Janet on the changing pad and Janet whimpers.<br>\r\nImmediately Melissa slaps Alice\u2019 behind with the spoon. \u201cBe more careful. She is already leaking and in discomfort. When you make her fall on her behind she suffers more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice rubs her behind and takes Janet\u2019s romper off. It goes directly in the hamper to be washed. Janet\u2019s training pants look awful. They are discolored and swollen. You would like to hold Janet\u2019s hand, but William is faster. He is already at her side and hold her hand. \u201cIt is okay, I look like this all the time.\u201d He smiles down at Janet.<br>\r\nFor a second you wonder if he only is at her side to stare at her naked breasts of even further down, but he is really nice and keep his eyes on Janet\u2019s eyes and talks to her, while Alice does her best to clean up the teen girl\u2019s crotch.<br>\r\nShe needs a while and receive another slap from Melissa. \u201cPlease hurry, you have three other babies that need to get out of their diapers.\u201d She reminds the maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Janet is done, she is allowed to go to the bathroom and wash herself.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about us?\u201d You ask, wanting to take a bath as well, but Melissa shakes her head.<br>\r\n\u201cWe better wait a bit. I make an exception on Janet, but to be honest I fear that you might mess yourself more during the day. The laxatives could still be in your system. Janet can run to the bathroom when she feels a bit of pressure, while you three will be stuck in your diapers. I wash you before it goes to bed again, I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sulk a bit, but agrees.<br>\r\nWilliam is the next in the row and Alice giggles when his manhood becomes erect, when she cleans him up with wet wipes. Melissa spanks her again and tells her, that this is a perfectly normal reaction and a nanny would not laugh about it.<br>\r\nWilliam grins from ear to ear, while Alice cleans him up. The lack of skills makes the cleanup much longer and he obviously enjoys the attention Alice has to grand his\u2026 private parts.<br>\r\n\u201cCan you please clean up my little Willy? I am sure he is still a bit dirty.\u201d He grins.<br>\r\nAlice nods her head, but is stopped by Melissa and another slap on her behind.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t let him trick you. He is perfectly clean and will make a mess on his belly if you continue, if you know what I mean. Put him in a fresh diaper and send him to the play corner. All the naked girls drive him crazy I see.\u201d<br>\r\nWilliam is a bit frustrated, but let Alice put him in a fresh diaper, before Melissa dress him in a normal onesie. It is not a punishment onesie anymore and has a smiling prince on the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeredith is the next and Alice is getting better. She has practiced with Janet and is getting much faster. When is it your turn, she is very fast and good with the wipes. Still, she use more than Melissa or Rose and you get quite excited. You are happy that it is not as obviously as with William, but Melissa stops Alice, before she can give you something you have not earned jet.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease stop Alice, our princess face is all flushed and her\u2026 crotch is getting puffy. I think it is enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh deeply and Melissa give you an angry look. \u201cPrincess, you do not want to be punished today, do you?\u201d<br>\r\nQuickly you shake your head and let Alice diaper you.<br>\r\nJanet is back and wears a short summer dress, which barely hides her trainers. This is her little revenge on Alice that is now stripped down to her diaper and bra.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay little ones, choose an onesie for Alice.\u201d Melissa says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all stand around a selection of onesie in Alice\u2019s size. One is a quite simple, one is almost sexy, with a lace-cut on the chest and on the back. The put in the back goes down to the waistline, which would make the diaper visible. Last put no least you have an only fashioned red one with a flap at the bottom. It has the words \u201cNaughty big Girl\u201d on the chest, but the BIG is crossed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you and your friends select the\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Melissa closes the zip, and makes her take a turnaround to show to you the finished job. On the chest there is the words you saw before: \u201cNaughty big Girl\u201d with the word \u201cbig\u201d crossed out. Only now, however, you notice that there is a sentence on the flap too: \u201cWarning: Loading in progress\u201d. You giggle, knowing that everyone in the palace will understand what the maid have under the onesie, even if it not seen.<br>\r\n\u201cNow, Alice, you can go to Mrs. Amelia to say how happy you are in helping me in the nursery. An be sure to don\u2019t run in the hallways.\u201d Melissa says, gently pushing her outside the nursery.<br>\r\nThe young blushing maid leaves the room, passing by a woman in a silver armour.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d Eden asks, looking at Alice backside as she moves away.<br>\r\n\u201cWe only had a little talk about her behaviour.\u201d Melissa replies \u201cYou can pick up the princess.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNanny, why I am the only one still in punishment clothes?\u201d you ask her before leaving. In fact, Willy is now dressed normally, while you have been put back in punishment clothes (a quite simple blue onesie, with the words \u201cPotty mouth\u201d printed on the chest, over a printed wet bar of soap, and a lock).<br>\r\n\u201cJust this afternoon, then you\u2019ll go back in normal clothes too.\u201d she replies \u201cYou sassed the queen, princess. It\u2019s a very naughty thing, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod your head, while thinking that is quite unfair. You simply spoke without permission, you haven\u2019t told her to fuck herself.<br>\r\n\u201cCan we go play?\u201d Merry asks. As Melissa nods, she smiles.<br>\r\n\u201cI expect you three to come here for your dinner.\u201d Melissa says \u201cJanet is welcomed to, of course.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTomorrow morning I can go back to Rose\u2019s nursery?\u201d you ask. Once again, Melissa nods.<br>\r\nHappy, you greet her and leave the nursery, followed by your friends.<br>\r\nBefore leaving, however, you have noticed that the nanny gave to Eden a key (for your lock, certainly) and a pacifier.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d you ask, after walking for a while.<br>\r\n\u201cI suggest to continue the exploration.\u201d Janet suggests \u201cThe palace it\u2019s enormous, and there are still areas that we haven\u2019t explored yet.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI thought that you would suggest to play videogames.\u201d you say, quite surprised \u201cYou are a gamer, aren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\nJanet nods, replying \u201cI play all the time when your are busy, Susan the very important princess. While you are all free, I prefer spending time with you in a more \u2026 interesting way.\u201d<br>\r\nAll of you agree, and decide to explore the Palace more.<br>\r\n\u201cNear the basement there is a room where servants never go to.\u201d William adds, while walking \u201cWe can see what\u2019s behind it. As far as I now, it\u2019s not a forbidden area.\u201d<br>\r\nYou agree, suddenly intrigued. The four of you the walk toward the basement zone, to reach the door.<br>\r\nObviously, Eden follows you, but doesn\u2019t say a word.<br>\r\nDuring the path, you notice that some servants (mostly young footmen) look at Janet. You can see why: your tall and gracious friend is dressed in quite revealing outfit, that (the icing on the cake) makes everyone understand that she is not wearing a diaper.<br>\r\nYou feel so jealous right now: your bestie is in the spotlight, while you, the princess, are behind her with a punishment onesie on and hoping to don\u2019t mess yourself too soon.<br>\r\nYou are still absorbed in your thought, when Merry takes your hand.<br>\r\n\u201cCan I \u2026 hold it?\u201d she asks, blushing.<br>\r\nYou blush too, but nod.<br>\r\nYou finally reach the door in the basement area. You are still thinking about opening it, that you hear a loud boom from the other side, like if someone just exploded.<br>\r\n\u201cYou are an idiot!\u201d you hear someone shouting, with a male voice \u201cHow much potassium did you add?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe quantity I thought was right, dumbass!\u201d a female voice replies \u201cIf your calligraphy was legible, I would have added the quantity you had written.\u201d<br>\r\nEven more intrigued, you open the door and go in, followed by the others.<br>\r\nYou find yourself in a strange place, similar to a laboratory. It\u2019s strange, because it has a lot of modern technology in it (like a modern biology lab) but with ancient furniture and decorations.<br>\r\nInside, there are two persons near a table with broken glasses on it. They are so caught up in arguing with each other that they don\u2019t even notice you. They are both in their later twenties, and both of them have the hair of the strangest colour you have ever seen: bright silver.<br>\r\n\u201cYou were obviously spanked too little in the past years!\u201d the male yells \u201cOr you would have developed more discipline!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, what about you, then?\u201d she replies \u201cMommy always spanked you a lot, but you are still a complete loggerhead. Maybe you should go back in diapers and let the grown up work.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s you that wetted the bed since you were 22 and needed night-time protection! Slacker!\u201d he shouts.<br>\r\nSuddenly, Eden coughs aloud, catching their attention.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s now? The Palace\u2019s magician need to concentrate!\u201d the female yell in your direction, but suddenly freeze.<br>\r\n\u201cThe princess?\u201d she says, blushing \u201cWe are sorry, really.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we are.\u201d the male adds \u201cBut if you want to punish someone, I suggest to punish her.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShut up, idiot!\u201d the female yells back \u201cBehave in front of the princess!\u201d<br>\r\nEden sighs, then says \u201cThose are the Palace\u2019s Magicians. Amos and Nena Campbell, brother and sister. It\u2019s an ancient title, today they are more like inventors, since they use science and not a so called magic. Their father was their predecessor.\u201d<br>\r\nWithout the slightest notice, Nena takes you by your arm and drag you inside, saying \u201cCome, princess! I want to show you MY latest invention.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOUR latest invention.\u201d Amos corrects her.<br>\r\nBefore your eyes, a strange machine appears.<br>\r\nNena smiles, and says \u201cThis, princess, is \u2026</span></div></div>",

In Calonia where teens and young adults wear diapers as well. For those it might be okay to use a machine, but still\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cAll those arms? They look scary!\u201d You say and step back.<br>\r\nThe machine looks like a very big changing table with four robotic arms, two on each side.  The arms end in hands, while one arm has an additional scanner. Those arms can reach all the items that lay around the comfortable looking changing pad, the diapers, the oil, the powder, the wet wipes, but also a spanking paddle and medical equipment.<br>\r\n\u201cIs all that stuff really needed for changing a diaper?\u201d You ask Nena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmos steps in and pushes his sister away.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, to have a machine like this should be a great help for the parents and how would it help if the machine does not know if the baby is fine and can react to it?! With this machine, you can press on start and a few minutes later your baby is a clean diaper and you even receive a health report from it. It is a great invention.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNena stick a finger in her mouth, before she pushes it in Amos\u2019s ear, with a wet smack. He jumps away and she continues the presentation.<br>\r\n\u201cThe paddle was his idea of course. He wanted me to try it and had manipulated the A.I. to give me a maintenance spanking. That bastard!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEden raise a brow and gives her and angry look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm, sorry for that.\u201d Nena apologizes. \u201cWell, why don\u2019t we have a little demonstration? There is a wet or dirty little baby round?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow we could use Alice.\u201d William whispers to his sister and grins while Meredith blushes and slowly lift her hand. \u201cI\u2026 I could use a change.\u201d She whispers and looks at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of you look at her and she blushes even more and shrugs. \u201cI guess it is still the medicine. I had a little messy accident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure Merry? We can get you changed by Melissa when we are back.\u201d You try to stop her, but she shakes her head and walks to Nena. \u201cNo, I am sure I want to try it. Melissa will not change me before bedtime and I really like to get cleaned up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all shrug, while Nena and Amos look very happy. They help Merry on the changing table and fix her in place with a chest-strap and wrist-cuffs.<br>\r\n\u201cDuring the test-phase we still need them. We want to make sure the baby does not jump up and get hurt by the robotic arms. After some fine tuning, the straps should become obsolete.\u201d Amos explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling from ear to ear, he presses the start-button and steps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHELLO BABY, TIME TO CLEAN YOU UP.\u201d The machine says and the arms start to move. One arm positions above Merry and a red light scans her.<br>\r\n\u201cUNDRESSING REQUIRED, NO ROMPER DETECTED.\u201d And the machine stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that was not impressive.\u201d You grin and Nena and Amos quickly go to Merry and strip her down to her diaper.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry for that, with a romper and the crotch-snaps it works perfectly.\u201d Nena explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reactivate the machine and after scanning the almost naked Merry again, the machine continues. It cut open the diaper at the tapes and begins to wipe Merry\u2019s crotch down with a wide wipe. By doing that it pulls away the diaper and holds her legs in the air. Now three arms work at the same time one is holding her legs up, one is cleaning and one is scanning her behind for remaining dirt. You would think that the machine now tapes the diaper close, but now comes the medical check. One hand positions in front of Merry\u2019s anus and a thermometer slides out a fingers tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Stop that, please.\u201d Meredith complains.<br>\r\n\u201cYOU WILL BE FINE, LITTLE ONE.\u201d The machine says and one arm pushes a pacifier in Merry\u2019s mouth. A second later the thermometer is extracted and the full finger of the hand push into her behind, but only for a few seconds.<br>\r\n\u201cNORMAL TEMPERATURE, NO OCCLUSION DETECTED\u201d The machine says.<br>\r\nOne of the arms grab the spanking paddle, but then stops, before you could say anything. \u201cNO PUNISHMENT FILE FOUND, CONTINUE WITHOUT SPANKING?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! Yes!\u201d Nena and Amos call out together and look very relieved, when the machine drops the paddle again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it lubes and powders Merry\u2019s crotch and tapes the diaper shut.<br>\r\nThen all arms pull back and the straps open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerry looks a bit stressed and sucks on her pacifier, but she is happy to be in a clean diaper again.<br>\r\nWhile you, Janet and Willy help her into her onesie, she takes the pacifier out and says: \u201cbeside the medical check it was fine, but it was scary when the\u2026 think pushed into my behind.\u201d She blushes and put the pacifier back into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but after the first time, the kids know what is coming and will be fine.\u201d Amos says and looks very proud. \u201cAnd I am happy that I could stop the spanking.\u201d He grins and wipes away imagined sweat from his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that OCCLUSION thing?\u201d Willy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it would give a full automatic enema if the baby is blocked up. It will even remind the parents to change the baby again, after an hour.\u201d Nena says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d You clap your hands. \u201cThat was interesting. Anything else you like to present or should we walk on, guys?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmos looks at Nena. \u201cWe can show the high chair, what do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI am not sure if it is ready, it still has issues with the software.\u201d Nena says and tries to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug and say\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The fully automatic spanking machine! It\u2019s complete with numerous implements and ...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe princess is clearly not interested in a machine that has the only purpose to spank it\u2019s user, dumbass.\u201d Nena interrupts him \u201cI suggest to show her the automatic bathtub, instead.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat monstrosity it\u2019s still under development, stinky head.\u201d he replies \u201cIt could severely endanger it\u2019s user for how it is now. But you are so slow in understanding that I would have been surprised if it worked.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEnough!\u201d Eden exclaims \u201cYou are in front of princess Susan of Calonia! Please, behave!\u201d<br>\r\nThey seem to calm down a little and nod in your direction.<br>\r\n\u201cYou created a machine for diaper change, one for bath time, one for feeding time and even one for spankings?\u201d you ask, amazed \u201cIt\u2019s impressive.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, princess.\u201d Nena says, smiling \u201cAnd we have in the pipeline even an automated crib. Very soon, everyone too busy to take care of their children but with not enough money to hire a nanny will no longer be obliged to do somersaults.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNow, about the high-chair. Do you want to test it?\u201d Amos says, overlooking his sister's voice with his.<br>\r\nYou nod, and he tries to take your arm, but Nena pushes him away and she takes you instead.<br>\r\n\u201cFollow me!\u201d she exclaims, taking you next to a strange looking high-chair. It\u2019s a simple high-chair, but with multiple arms like the changing table before. A lot of compartments are placed round it, full of baby foods, bottle with milk and other things. A small platform come out from the chair\u2019s base. And, last but not least, a big wooden hairbrush lie inside one of the compartment.<br>\r\n\u201cPut yourself over the base and you will enjoy a snack.\u201d Nena says, smiling brightly.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat with that hairbrush?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s my idea, of course.\u201d Amos intervenes \u201cIt\u2019s for naughty children that don\u2019t want to eat. I think a good spanking is always the best solution for naughtiness.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou should spank yourself and shout up!\u201d his sister yell at him, before saying to you \u201cAre you ready, princess?\u201d<br>\r\nYou take a step forward, going up on the platform.<br>\r\nA scanner originate from the high-chair, and a loud voice states \u201cHELLO BABY. TIME TO HAVE A SNACK.\u201d<br>\r\nTwo robotic arms lift you taking you under your armpits and takes you up, before gently let you in the high-chair.<br>\r\n\u201cSELECT ONE: BREAKFAST, MORNING SNACK, LUNCH, AFTERNOON SNACK OR DINNER?\u201d the machine asks.<br>\r\n\u201cAfternoon snack.\u201d you says, but the machine puts a pacifier in your mouth.<br>\r\n\u201cHUSH, BABY. A GROWN UP SHOULD REPLY.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAfternoon snack, please.\u201d Nena says.<br>\r\nThe machine seems to understand, because it takes out a bowl and a spoon, then fills the bows with ice cream.<br>\r\n\u201cFEEDING TIME!\u201d<br>\r\nOne robotic arm removes the pacifier, while another begins to take the ice cream to your mouth. You savour the nice ice cream, and you think that the machine it\u2019s delicate enough, even if it doesn\u2019t transmit the sweetness like a real nanny does.<br>\r\nOnce the cup is empty, the high-chair simply release you. As you are about to get down, however, the arms takes you up once again.<br>\r\n\u201cLOCK DETECTED. INITIATE PUNISHMENT.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d you scream \u201cTell it to let me go!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cStop! Stop now!\u201d Amos yells, beginning to fumble with the control panel.<br>\r\n\u201cYou idiot!\u201d Nena yells at him \u201cYou used the some punishment encoding you used for the changing table! The high-chair shouldn\u2019t give a fuck about the lock!\u201d<br>\r\nWhile the two tries to stop the machine, an arm begins to thrash your padded behind with the hairbrush.<br>\r\n\u201cTake me down!\u201d you shout, still receiving the slaps.<br>\r\n\u201cThere! This should go!\u201d Amos exclaims, pushing a button. <br>\r\nAs he does it, the machine stops and let you go, saying \u201cBEHAVE FROM NOW ON!\u201d<br>\r\nYou run to Eden and hug her, while Nena says \u201cI\u2019m mortified, princess. I work with a spanko.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a disciplinarian, not a spanko!\u201d he says, offended.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d Eden intervenes \u201cYou are the Palace\u2019s Magicians, you can\u2019t behave like a couple of brats!\u201d<br>\r\nThey stop, and Amos says \u201cI\u2019m sorry, too, princess. We will be sure to recalibrate it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, you\u2019ve been a good test subject.\u201d Nena adds \u201cNow back to work!\u201d<br>\r\nLike if you never entered, they resume to work (and to argue).<br>\r\nThey are for sure the strangest Palace\u2019s inhabitants you\u2019ve met so far.<br>\r\nYou leave the room, and your friends ask you if you are ok.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I was padded.\u201d you say, patting your own diaper \u201cIt was just a little humiliating. I even filled my diaper during it. Stupid laxatives.\u201d<br>\r\nJust as you said that, Janet winks at you and runs away. After a while, she\u2019s back. <br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d she says \u201cI needed the bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what can we do?

Your person is still in the focus of the press. It would be wise to have a few trips to the city, so the citizen and the press gets used to you. I receive dozens of requests for more interviews and photo-stories about your life in Calonia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel bad, that such an important person has so much work because of you. You look at your feel and nod your head. \u201cUhm, shopping sounds nice.\u201d You whisper, trying to get the best of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam\u2019s and Meredith\u2019s mother laughs out and shakes her head: \u201cI have said nothing about shopping. And maybe you should get rid of the lock before you be seen in public the next time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush and grab the little lock. You are currently the only one with the lock. Janet is back in trainers and a sexy summer dress and William and Meredith are in her normal clothes. Only you are still marked as a naughty child. You step from one toe to the other and feel the mess in your diaper shift. \u201cAnd I am the only messy baby in here.\u201d You think by yourself.<br>\r\n\u201cI will talk about it with Melissa and Rose, I have been very good\u2026 with little exceptions.\u201d You say and turn to leave.

If you lie I will know, and you\u2019ll have your mouth washed with soap.\u201d<br>\r\nMeredith nods, replying in a shy tone \u201cI went both of them in the early afternoon, but I tried the diaper changing machine created by the Palace\u2019s Magicians.\u201d<br>\r\nAs she says that, the nanny gives her a quite hard slap on the naked behind, scolding her \u201cYou know you need to ask me for things like this. I\u2019m really disappointed, Merry.\u201d<br>\r\nDon\u2019t wanting to see her getting in trouble, you intervene \u201cThey insisted, nanny. And we were curious. I tried the high-chair and had a snack.\u201d<br>\r\nShe looks at you with a stare that makes you go pale, then says \u201cPrincess, no one has ever told you that you should stay silent while an adult scolds one of your friends? If you want to intervene, you have to raise your hand and wait to be asked. You\u2019ll have a mouth soaping after dinner for this.

Don\u2019t punish us!\u201d<br>\r\nMelissa gently pats Merry\u2019s head, replying \u201cAction and reaction, little one.

But I want you to apologise and promise me that you\u2019ll be an obedient child tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\nBlushing, you nod and say \u201cI\u2019m sorry, nanny Melissa. I promise to be good.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cVery well. Let\u2019s go to enjoy a bath, then.\u201d the nanny says \u201cYou will then have your dinner and your punishments, before going to bed.\u201d<br>\r\nHappy about the bath, at least, you enter in the bathroom followed by both Merry and Melissa. Inside, you see Alice, completely naked.<br>\r\n\u201cI went potty on time, nanny!\u201d she exclaims, quite happy about it \u201cAre you proud of me?\u201d<br>\r\nYou notice that her punishment clothes are in the room too.

But the princess ...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNow, Alice!\u201d Melissa intimates her.<br>\r\nGulping, Alice begins to count on her finger, saying \u201cRule number 1: When you feel the urge, tell a grown-up that you need to go. Rule number 2: Wait that the grown-up gives you permission to go to the potty. Rule number 3: Remove your diaper before using the potty. Rule number 4: Clean up your intimate parts with care using wipes when you\u2019ve done. Rule number 5: Tell a grown-up that you\u2019ve finished using it.\u201d<br>\r\nMelissa smiles, saying \u201cWhat a good girl.

Melissa is helping you in, but when she is about to grab the sponge you hear a breaking noise from the nursery and she runs out.<br>\r\n\u201cAlice, what have you done? Oh don\u2019t tell me\u2026 .\u201d You and Meredith hear her from the room next door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am sorry, I tried to get the diaper back on and grabbed it to keep the balance.\u201d Alice says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou tried to get the OLD diaper back on?\u201d Melissa asks with her voice full disbelieve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was still clean, I thought\u2026 I am sorry,\u2026 no please do not spank me again.\u201d You hear Alice, before you can hear that she indeed receive a sound spanking by Melissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing alone in the bathtub you and Merry start to make bubbles and play with the toys, but when it takes longer and longer you grab the big sponge and approach Meredith. \u201cI think the Nanny is busy, mind if I start to wash you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeredith blushes a bit and grabs a sponge herself: \u201cbut only if I can wash you as well, I guess you need it more than me.\u201d She winks at you, but you still blush and feel a bit ashamed. Seeing this, she comes close to you and hugs you tightly. \u201cI am sorry Princess, I did not mean to embarrass you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your naked and wet bodies pressed together you feel heat rising up from our inside and you quickly break away and splash water at her. Then you begin to rub her back with the sponge and continue with her arms.<br>\r\nWhen she turns around you blush again, when you let your sponge run over her perking breasts and further down. Meredith looks as innocent as always, but even she hat flushed cheeks now and spread her knees to allow you an easy access to her crotch.<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2026 can I?\u201d You ask, hesitating, but she nods and you continue. You move the sponge up and down and feel her pressing her hips against your moving hand.<br>\r\n\u201cMerry are you sure we should?\u201d You ask, but she hushes you and grab your hand, moving it by herself. Seconds late she let out a tiny, cute moan and shivers all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith wide eyes you look at her and feel soooo jealous. The cute little Merry just had a climax. Something you are waiting for, for over a week.<br>\r\nWhen she opens her eyes she comes to you and give you an quick kiss on the mouth. \u201cnow it is your turn, princess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod eagerly and let her start to clean you up, but right in the moment she wants to start washing your front side Melissa comes in, looking a bit stressed.<br>\r\n\u201cI am sorry you had to wait so long. Ah Merry, you are such a good girl, starting to clean our dirty little girl.\u201d She takes the sponge from Merry and continues to clean to clean you up, quickly and professional. In the end, you are clean, but unsatisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you are done, Melissa looks at the clock and takes Meredith out of the bathtub and dries her up. She carries her over to the changing table to diaper her and dress her for dinner. Seeing your chance you move your hand between your legs and play with yourself. The bubbles are almost gone, but still provide some level of sight protection.<br>\r\n\u201cOne more minute, one more minute,\u2026 \u201c you think by yourself, when you hear Melissa\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, stop what you are doing or Melissa is not the only one that receive an enema tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing deep red you let Melissa take you out of the tub, diaper and dress you in a romper. \u201cYou need to learn some patience, little on. If you be a good girl for a little bit longer you are granted a special treat.\u201d Melissa says and put mittens on your hands.<br>\r\nYou moan out and a few days earlier you would have complained about them, but you know better now and stay silent.<br>\r\nLike Merry, you are put in a high chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am sorry for this, but your dear maid had tipped over a big vase and the floor needs to be vacuumed before I can allow you to walk around again.\u201d Melissa explains and only a few seconds later Alice is coming in with a vacuum cleaner. She is in her dropseat onesie again and even has a lock on it. She looks very unhappy, but makes sure everything is clean and free from shards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she walks out, Janet and William come in. They are holding hands and you feel a bit jealous. They seem to like each other better and better \u2013 even with Willy being a jerk from times to times. Janet tells you that she comes back after she had dinner and leaves again, while Willy is quickly bathed and put in a fresh diaper.<br>\r\nFinally you remember that you wanted to talk to Melissa. Obedient you raise your hand and wait for her to let you talk: \u201cPrincess, you do not need to raise your hand ALL the time, before I was scolding Meredith and you interrupted me. That was a different story.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head and speak: You Prime Minister told me that I should visit the town to calm down the pressing questions of the press. Do you think we can do that tomorrow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa is a bit overwhelmed by the sudden request.<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 that comes sudden\u2026 I think\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s a so difficult matter?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\nMelissa nods, replying \u201cNot so much, but I cannot decide something like that on my own. It\u2019s true that you have a personal bodyguard, but when you can leave the Palace is a matter that should be let in Queen\u2019s hand, as your safety is involved. Furthermore, I will no longer be your nanny tomorrow, because you\u2019ll go back to nanny Rose.\u201d<br>\r\nIn hearing your TRUE nanny name, You smile, then say \u201cMy safety? Isn\u2019t Calonia a peaceful nation.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt is, but you are the heir of the throne. You must understand it.\u201d she replies.<br>\r\nYou nod, accepting that you\u2019ll have to wait for the Queen.<br>\r\nAs Melissa takes out three glasses full of baby food and three baby bottles full of milk, the door of the nursery suddenly opens up, and two women come inside.<br>\r\n\u201cHow are my babies doing?\u201d the first woman says.<br>\r\nImmediately, both the sibling exclaims simultaneously \u201cMom! Mom! You came!\u201d<br>\r\nThe Prime Minister reaches her children, hugging them while they\u2019re still in the high-chairs.<br>\r\nThe other woman reaches you instead, smiling.<br>\r\n\u201cHi, princess.\u201d she says.<br>\r\nYou smile back, replying \u201cCharlotte! I was hoping to see you!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, don\u2019t be rude!\u201d Melissa intervenes \u201cThat it\u2019s not the way to address the Queen.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Melissa. I gave her permission to call me that, and I encouraged her to do so.\u201d the Queen replies. Melissa then takes a bow, apologizing.<br>\r\nThe queen then gives you a pat on your head, saying \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, my little princess? Why were you waiting for me?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI wanted to go visit the town tomorrow, but nanny Melissa told me that I should ask you about it.\u201d<br>\r\nCharlotte seems to think about it, then says \u201cOnly if you solemnly swear that you\u2019ll be on your best behaviour. I don\u2019t want to see on a next day newspaper the picture of the princess spanked in the middle of the capital.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not coming with me?\u201d you ask her.<br>\r\nThe queen shakes her head, replying \u201cI\u2019m very busy, Susan. I\u2019ll have one of my handmaid accompany you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHandmaid?\u201d you ask her \u201cYou mean, maids that follow you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, the handmaids are my personal assistants.\u201d She explains \u201cOne of them will accompany you tomorrow, if you still want to go.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, and she concludes \u201cI will ask Laura. She is very strict and I will grant her fully permission to punish you. It\u2019s that clear, princess?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m always on my best behaviour!\u201d you exclaim, stretching you hand toward her. You immediately blush as you remember you are in mittens.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I can see that.\u201d the queen states, ironically \u201cWhat have you done to earn those?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI ... I threw a rubber duck at nanny Melissa in the bathtub.\u201d you lie.<br>\r\n\u201cLiar, liar, pants on fire.\u201d Melissa immediately intervenes \u201cLiar, liar, soap in mouth. Liar, liar, sleeps on tummy.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cReally, princess?\u201d the queen says \u201cYou tried to lie with your nanny in the room? That\u2019s quite naive, don\u2019t you think?\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, thinking that Rose would have simply let the queen believe it and maybe punish you for it after her leaving.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Nanny Melissa caught me mas... I mean, having naughty fun.\u201d you say.<br>\r\nYou think she\u2019d go mad, but the queen pats your head instead, saying sweetly \u201cWhat a naughty girl. It\u2019s obvious that those mittens fit you very well.\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush once again, while the queen hugs you and then leaves, followed by lady Kent (she has cuddled her children all the time during your dialogue with the queen).<br>\r\n\u201cNanny, couldn\u2019t you support me?\u201d you say to Melissa once the door is closed.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like liars, princess.\u201d she replies \u201cIf you weren\u2019t already in for a mouth soaping, you\u2019d be for this.\u201d<br>\r\nShe then proceed to feed you. Once finished, she gives your punishment to both of you girls: she wash your mouth with soap and gives an enema to Merry. During the enema procedure, both you and Willy have been confined in the bathroom.<br>\r\nYou have difficult in understanding Calonian society: it\u2019s okay to bathe together, but not to watch another having an enema if not in certain cases.<br>\r\nOnce finished, you are all allowed to stay together, and Melissa removes your rompers, adds booster pads to your diapers, and then puts the rompers back on you.<br>\r\nYou have problem moving your legs, and you can\u2019t resist the urge to complain about it: \u201cNanny, I feel too bulky. Can\u2019t I sleep without this things on?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI thought to have said to you that you should not question adults decisions, princess.\u201d is her simple reply \u201cIt\u2019s for your own good, trust me. You are not being punished.\u201d<br>\r\nWhile the nanny begins to lift you to put you in the crib, Janet enters in the nursery, greetings all of you.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m ready for a nice sleep.\u201d she says, then looks at you three and says \u201cIf the crib has enough space for me, with all that padding.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t make fun of them, please.\u201d the nanny says.<br>\r\nJanet apologies, then reaches you and the four of you are putted in the crib by the nanny. Melissa gives you all your favourite plushes, gives you all a goodnight kiss and turn the lights off, before leaving the nursery followed by Alice.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you in mittens for what I think?\u201d Janet asks.<br>\r\nBlushing, you nod and she laughs \u201cOh, Susan, you must learn to don\u2019t get caught so easily.\u201d<br>\r\nYou\u2019d want to tell her about your moment with Merry, but you\u2019re so tired that you fall asleep.<br>\r\nDuring the night, you have the weirdest dream.<br>\r\nYou are in a big bedroom, and Merry is there too. But as you begin to undress, nanny Samantha enters the room, takes you out in the town streets by your hear and spank you in front of a photographer, scolding you aloud for having sex (that\u2019s a lie, since you didn\u2019t even had the occasion to do anything) and calling you a \u201cfilthy girl\u201d. Queen Charlotte, nanny Rose and nanny Melissa look at you with disappointed eyes, and let the evil nanny spank you so many times that you lose the count. William takes away Merry, promising that the \u201cevil Princess\u201d will not corrupt her further, while lady Kent encourage Samantha to hit you even harder. The worst part is when you see Janet hugging Richard, saying \u201cI always wished a true man. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ll be king.\u201d. Lord Grairven is looking at you, with a evil smile and with a shoe pressed over Eden\u2019s unconscious body.<br>\r\nEnough!<br>\r\nYou wake up, wet with sweat, shivering. You begin to cry, waking Merry up (she was hugging you).<br>\r\n\u201cSusie? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asks.<br>\r\n\u201cI had a nightmare.\u201d you reply, noticing that you heavily wetted yourself.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to tell me about it?\u201d Merry asks.<br>\r\nYou nod, and say \u201cI dreamed that our moment ruined my relation with all the one I care about here in Calonia. And Richard became king!\u201d you exclaim.<br>\r\nShe hugs you tightly, but before she can say anything the door opens, and Melissa enters.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, princess?\u201d she asks.<br>\r\nYou explain everything to her too (omitting the details concerning Meredith directly) then you ask her \u201cI am filthy, nanny?\u201d<br>\r\nYou are thinking about your feeling toward Merry, but you think she\u2019ll think you\u2019re talking about the naughty fun.<br>\r\nMelissa pats you head, replying \u201cPrincess, no. Never think that of yourself, never. Sexuality is a completely normal thing, it\u2019s only that you\u2019re a bit too young for it. When you\u2019ll grow up, then you\u2019ll have all the sexual experience that you wish. Never allow anyone to call you filthy for it, it doesn\u2019t matter what kind of sexual preference do you have.\u201d<br>\r\nFor a moment you think that she knows everything, but you realize that she is talking in general, and you feel relieved by her words.<br>\r\nWith a smile, the nanny continues \u201cI mean, you shouldn\u2019t know about it, but you visited the Queen\u2019s private collection. We all love Queen Charlotte, even with her ... kinky side. Because it\u2019s part of her.\u201d<br>\r\nYou smile, lying in the crib again.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, nanny Melissa.\u201d  you say, falling asleep again. The last thing that you feel before flying in dream land once again is a pacifier putted in your mouth.<br>\r\nThe next morning ...</span></div></div>",

She is eager to get you back, to spoil and sugarcoat your day.\u201d She says, half serious, half joking.<br>\r\nThe diaper she put on you has no boosters and the onesie you receive is yellow with the face of a duck on your chest. While you look down you notice your little nipples under the thick fabric and throw a jealous look at Janet. Your friends just stretched and you can see her bra under her romper. She looks much more mature with her thin trainers, that are even dry and her bra.<br>\r\n\u201cNanny Melissa, can\u2019t I have a bra as well?

You giggle and poke her behind with your \u2013 still mitted \u2013 hand.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Princess, please do not do that!\u201d She yells at you, but overcomes the instinct to slap you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa just put William in a fresh diaper and helps him off the changing table, when she explains:<br>\r\n\u201cAlice just had a big accident. I told her she had to wait until breakfast to use the potty for number two, but obviously that challenge was too much for her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel sorry for the maid, but still have to grin when she walks fast you, waddling a bit.<br>\r\n\u201cMelissa, can\u2019t you take the mittens off?

I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be on your best behaviour.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWould you punish me if I\u2019d misbehave?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\nRose intervenes, saying \u201cLaura, I think you should show the princess the content of your satchel.\u201d<br>\r\nWithout losing her kind smile, Laura nods and open her satchel, taking out from it a big black wooden brush.<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the Naughty Hairbrush.\u201d she explains, showing it to you \u201cIt\u2019s an hairbrush made of a very hard wood, not easy to find, and please look at the sentence engraved on it.\u201d<br>\r\nThe sentence is simply a \u201cNaughty child\u201d, engraved in the brush but mirrored.<br>\r\n\u201cIf I spank you with this, the sentence will be impressed on you behind, and in the right direction, not mirrored. You\u2019ll remember you lesson for almost a week.\u201d she finishes to explain, putting the brush away.<br>\r\nYou went paler and paler at any word the pronounced, and now you\u2019re almost shivering.<br>\r\n\u201cAre ... you really ready to spank me with THAT? I would never be able to sit again.\u201d you stutter.<br>\r\nBoth Rose and Laura giggle, while Laura takes out another hairbrush, much smaller and much more normal.<br>\r\n\u201cI was joking, princess.\u201d she says \u201cI never used it and I hope I never will. No, I normally use this. It\u2019s a common wooden hairbrush made of a thin wood, that stings just a little more than the hand. Be aware, however, that I will not hesitate to use this one, if you misbehave.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUmh ... can you be clearer?\u201d you say \u201cWhat will be considered misbehaviour during the trip?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNothing particular.\u201d she replies \u201cSassing someone, running away from me or your escort, being rude, lying. The usual things. Every punishment will be administer on the spot, it doesn\u2019t matter who we have around. Oh, and you can have some shopping too: always be polite with vendors. And never, never shoplift. Calonian Royal House enjoys heavy discounts in all shops, but has to pay too. Shoplifting will be the only thing that will make me use the Naughty Hairbrush instead of the normal one. It\u2019s that clear, little one?\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, without problem. Shoplifting is a thing you would have never done anyway.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd can Janet come too?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\nThis time is Rose that answers \u201cOf course, princess. Merry and Willy cannot accompany you because they have their lesson this morning, but Janet is free to come.\u201d<br>\r\nIn hearing that Merry has her lesson, you get a little angry, afraid that that bastard, Mr. Grairven, would paddle her.<br>\r\n\u201cHow is miss Spencer?\u201d you suddenly ask to Rose \u201cShe will come back tomorrow, right?\u201d<br>\r\nRose nods, and answers \u201cShe is ok, now. She\u2019ll be back tomorrow morning. This afternoon I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have your lesson with the supply teacher.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, feeling reassured by Melissa\u2019s note concerning the maximum number of stroke you can receive from the paddle in the day and happy that that bastard will not hurt Janet with his damn paddle, unless he would not want to be hurt himself by Eden\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, no sad thoughts now!\u201d you suddenly exclaim \u201cI\u2019m ready to enjoy my morning in the town!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSome last things, princess.\u201d Laura says \u201cYou can go shopping, but you\u2019ll have to greet the citizens first. Before going back to the palace, nearing at the end of the morning, you\u2019ll have a quick meeting with the mayor of the capital. And last but not least, during the trip would be a good idea to stay as clean as possible, so if you have a big accident of number 1 or a accident, even small, of number 2, tell me immediately: I will take you to one of the numerous public changing stations and change you.\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, realizing what the satchel really is: a strange type of diaper bag!<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to change me?\u201d you say, quite shocked \u201cIn public?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s nothing shameful about that.\u201d she replies \u201cEvery child you age need diaper changes. It\u2019s completely normal to be taken in a changing room.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cChanging room?\u201d you breath in relief \u201cFor a moment I thought that you would change me under everyone\u2019s eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not common and I don\u2019t usually do it.\u201d Laura explains \u201cBut some parents do, so if you see a child around your age being changed in the middle of a store, don\u2019t be rude. Oh, since we are on the topic: don\u2019t laugh if you see someone receiving a spanking in front of everyone or a mouth soaping in a public restroom. Those ARE common things.\u201d<br>\r\nYou think that Calonian is very strict, but since it\u2019s a so peaceful country, you don\u2019t feel to criticize that.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd about the dress?\u201d you ask \u201cWill I visit the city with this onesie?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d she simply replies \u201cWe just need to adjust your hair.\u201d<br>\r\nShe takes the brush out again, but this time she uses it in her meant purpose. Once she has finished, you have two long pigtails that make you look even younger.<br>\r\n\u201cWe are ready to go.\u201d Laura concludes.<br>\r\nYou greet Rose and reach the Palace main gate with Handmaid Laura. Janet is already there, with two knights. One is Eden, while the other is one of the man in black that was accompanying the queen when you first met her back in America. He makes a complete different effect dressed in a shining silver armour than in a black suit. <br>\r\nHe\u2019s not coming with you, he is simply guarding the gate.<br>\r\nLaura leads you outside, to your transport method. It is ...</span></div></div>",

You grin when she the licence-plate \u201cQueen II\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cOh cool, is that Queen Charlotte car?\u201d You ask Laura and she nods her head. \u201cYes Princess, it is one of her cars. We will have to pay for parking or receive a speeding-ticket.\u201d<br>\r\nYou grin from ear to ear, until Lauren opens the rear door and shows you a big children\u2019s seat, with 5-point harness.<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d You ask her look for another place to sit. The car is stretched and has four seats in the back. Two seats facing two additional seats, that point to the rear of the car. \u201cCan\u2019t I sit on a regular seat, please?\u201d<br>\r\nLaura shakes her head and pushes you on the special seat, before she straps you down. \u201cI am sorry, but that is not possible. Janet is a guest and does not need to sit in a kids car seat and the other two seats are for Eden and me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pout, especially when Eden decides to sit in the front, next to the driver.<br>\r\n\u201cEden is sitting in the front; I can use the other seat!\u201d You point at it, but Mrs. Laura insists that you stay where you are. \u201cIf you continue like this, we stay in the palace, princess.\u201d She warns you and you shut up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car starts to move and slide out of a heavy gate. Behind it you see rows of nice single houses, before the buildings begin to get more complex and higher.<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it, I would have never guessed that we are so close to the city!\u201d You shout out and pull at your straps. Janet is impressed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut haven\u2019t you seen all this on your way in, princess?\u201d Laura asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do not like to think about it, but then you answer: \u201cNot really, I was tired and fall asleep when the car took off from the airport.\u201d Suddenly something pops up in your mind. \u201cI have no money!!!\u201d How can I go shopping when I have not a single EURO??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet giggles and raises her VIP-Card. \u201cMy Card is also a credit card and I can spend 150\u20ac. I hope that is enough for a dress and ice cream.\u201d<br>\r\nYou are soooo jealous at her for that card and look at Laura. \u201cCan I have one as well, please?\u201d<br>\r\nLaura shakes her head, but digs into her satchel and takes out a little stuffed animal, no \u2013 it is a small purse that looks like a lion. When you open it you find a couple of banknotes for 50\u20ac.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy does she get more than me?\u201d You sulk and hug the little lion-purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, you have everything and when you really want something I can buy it for you. That money is for the case that you like to have a snack or something small. You do not need to buy a new dress.\u201d Laura explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I am not allowed to wear them anyway.\u201d You cross your arms in front of your chest and look out of the window, ignoring Laura for the rest of the ride.<br>\r\nWhen the car stops Eden steps out and opens the door. Everybody steps out and finally Laura helps you out of the car seat. The harness has a magnetic lock that you cannot open by yourself. You hate the seat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it is the Princess.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Princess.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBeautiful Onesie, Princess.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNice to see you Princess Susan.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear so many joyful voices that it is impossible for you to answer to all of them, so you call out: \u201cGood morning my dear citizens of Calonia!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour group starts to move, while Janet is running around and look at all the stands and windows along the street, while you have Laura and Eden at each of your sides. You are a bit afraid of all the people, since all of them look in your direction when you pass by. You grab Laura\u2019s hand and bit down on your bottom lip while you feel your crotch grow warm and wet.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay, Princess?\u201d Laura asks and looks down on you. \u201cYou look very nervous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head and walk on. \u201cEverybody is looking at me\u2026 that is a bit spooky.\u201d You whisper to her and make her giggle. She digs into her bag and pulls out a pacifier for you.<br>\r\nYou shake your head, but she pushes him into your mouth. \u201cHush little one, it will help you to relax.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush deep red when you start to suck on the pacifier.<br>\r\n\u201cAt least nobody expect me to talk to him now.\u201d You think and find the dummy indeed relaxing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Janet jumps to your side and make even Eden flinch and grab the handle of her weapon.<br>\r\n\u201cYOU HAVE TO SEE THIS!!!\u201d Janet shouts at you and pulls you to a shop, full of elegant and wonderful dresses. She points her finger at a long white dress with almost organic locking pattern in black. The pattern looks like the roots of a tree and are handmade.<br>\r\n\u201cWow that is beautiful!\u201d You agree \u2013 even when the pacifier makes your words a bit unclear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet pulls you with her and you find yourself in the shop.<br>\r\n\u201cHewo.\u201d You greet the shop assistants and continue to suck on your pacifier. Janet takes the dress in her size and goes to a dressing room, while you look around the room.<br>\r\nBeside \u201cnormal\u201d dresses you see some dresses that are close to the one you have been wearing for your interview, with solid fabric on the upper part and transparent skirts or at least with cut-outs to show off the diapers. You notice that you are standing in the kids-section, while Janet is on the mature side.<br>\r\nYou sigh and wait for Janet to come out of the changing room when you see a boy of your agree get pulled in by his ear. The elder woman, probably his mother is scolding him and comes closer.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have I told you about being whiny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut mommy, I hate shopping, it is so boring and you simply can\u2019t decide for the right pair of shoes. Why don\u2019t you go shipping with your friends?\u201d the young man, that is estimated as old as you, if not older receive a hard slap on his padded behind. He is wearing a white and blue sailor uniform even one of the typical sailor heads. He looks handsome, beside his red ear, that his mother keeps in her fingers.<br>\r\n\u201cYou ungrateful brat, I buy you the best and nicest clothes and when I want you to accompany with me, you are bored. Maybe you forgot your place?!\u201d she says and pulls him to a chair, where she takes him over his knees and starts to pull down his diaper. Right next to you and with other people around, she starts to spank him with her bare hand.<br>\r\nNobody seems to be concerned by this and find it unusual. Laura comes to you to block your view. \u201cPrincess, you are starring, that is rude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still hear the slaps and him starting to cry and plea his mother to stop. \u201cIsn\u2019t she too harsh?\u201d You ask Laura, but she shakes her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. He was not a good boy and now he receives his punishment, which is okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look beside her and see his red behind, while his mother keeps spanking him.<br>\r\n\u201cBut she has to stop at one point.\u201d You stomp your feet and bit down on you bottom lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mrs. Laura?\u201d you says, whispering at her \u201cI need a change.\u201d<br>\r\nShe doesn\u2019t understand the full sentence, so she removes you pacifier and you repeat it.<br>\r\n\u201cSure. Let\u2019s ask the employee at the cash desk where the restroom is.\u201d she replies, taking your hand and leading you to the cashier.<br>\r\nThe cashier is a small but good looking woman, and once next to her Laura says \u201cExcuse me, miss. The princess needs to ask you something.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t she simply ask about the restroom? Why must I ask this?\u201d you think, blushing.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you can ask me anything, princess.\u201d she replies, looking at you.<br>\r\n\u201cI need the restroom. Where is it?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n\u201cRestroom? But at your age you\u2019re still wearing it.\u201d she states.<br>\r\nYou understand that she wants you to say it out loud, so you decide to end this charade and say \u201cI need my diaper changed. Can you please tell me where the restroom is, so Mrs. Laura can change me?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOff course, cutie pie.\u201d the woman smiles \u201cThere is a big sign over there. Follow it and you will find the restroom.\u201d<br>\r\nYou greet her, and let Laura lead you to the restroom (always followed by Eden).<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s occupied.\u201d Laura says, once reached the door \u201cLet\u2019s wait for a while.\u201d<br>\r\nAfter a couple minutes, the door open, and a man takes two girls out of the restroom, holding both of them by one hand with both of his. The girls are almost identical, and you think that they are twins. You think they are 10 or 11 years old. One of them is dressed in a pink onesie with a lock, while the other in a uniform that likes like a Japanese sailor fuku. The one in onesie is thanking her daddy for changing her, while the other is crying.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair, daddy!\u201d you hear her cry \u201cShe is the brat, not me!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBecause she is in locked onesie?\u201d the man replies, moving away from you \u201cMartha was very well behaved today, while you threw a wild tantrum. That\u2019s not acceptable, Marie. You needed that spanking and you know it.\u201d<br>\r\nWhile they almost disappear from your field of view, you think that maybe the nannies in the Palace aren\u2019t so strict, after all.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, what are you waiting for?\u201d<br>\r\nLaura\u2019s voice brings you back to reality, and you enter with her in the restroom, while Eden waits outside.<br>\r\nThe handmaid puts you over a changing table, and begins to undress you.<br>\r\n\u201cNo one will enter, right?\u201d you ask, blushing.<br>\r\n\u201cI locked the door, and Eden stands in front of it. No one will see you getting changed, princess.\u201d Laura replies.<br>\r\nA little more quiet, you let her remove your wet diaper. She then proceeds to clean you up. She is good at this, almost at Rose\u2019s level. Once finished, she puts a fresh diaper on you and puts the onesie back on you, before letting you going down from the changing table.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Mrs. Laura.\u201d you say, blushing.<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem, princess. It\u2019s my job, after all.\u201d she states.<br>\r\nShe unlocks the door and open it. You get out from the restroom, only to see a man in his late twenties enter in it dragging a girl about 16 or 17 years old, that is wearing a white shirt and a skirt of tulle that doesn\u2019t hide her diaper.<br>\r\n\u201cI had enough of you attitude!\u201d he exclaims \u201cYou\u2019re in for a mouth soaping!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, big bro, please. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d she pleas, while he close the door behind her.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s that common?\u201d you ask to Laura.<br>\r\nShe nods her head, replying \u201cHe\u2019s a young adult and her older brother. It\u2019s normal that he is disciplining her.\u201d<br>\r\nYou begin to move away from the restroom door. While you\u2019re still thinking about the punished girl, the woman from before drags the boy about your age in sailor uniform in front of you, saying sternly \u201cApology to this girl for making a scene in front of her, Taylor.\u201d<br>\r\nThe boy, still sobbing, look at you and says \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t want to bother you.\u201d<br>\r\nYou try to resist the urge to say it, but if before you succeeded in it, now you can\u2019t anymore.<br>\r\nYou simply reply \u201cNo need to.\u201d to him, then you look at his mother and say \u201cI think you\u2019ve been too hard on him. Is normal for a boy to get bored during shopping.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, we have a little girl that thinks she has a degree in education.\u201d the woman states, before looking at Laura and says \u201cYou should keep an eye to your daughter, Mrs.\u201d<br>\r\nIs this woman dumb? Doesn\u2019t she know you\u2019re the princess? And, for God\u2019s sake, didn\u2019t she saw Eden?<br>\r\n\u201cShe is not my daughter.\u201d Laura replies, clearly annoyed by the woman\u2019s comment \u201cI\u2019m just an handmaid. She is princess Susan, and her official caretaker is Queen Susan herself.\u201d<br>\r\nThe woman goes pale, and you resist the temptation to laugh at her face, while she says \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t know. I never saw a picture of you, princess.\u201d<br>\r\nYou accept her apology, and she and her son leave. Just as they\u2019re out, however, Laura gives you a smack on the bottom, saying \u201cPrincess, criticize a parent for her educational method is rude.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut she did that too!\u201d you reply.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the reason why I didn\u2019t had you giving an apology, princess.\u201d the handmaid says \u201cAnd you will not be punished for this, but please be more careful with your words.\u201d<br>\r\nYou decide to wait for Janet, so you reach the dressing rooms and waits for her. After a couple minutes, she comes out.<br>\r\nShe is wearing the outfit she has saw before, and she looks like a goddess of old. With her stunning beauty, her longs legs and long hair and that dress that perfectly fits over her model-like body, she immediately remember you of Sif, Thor\u2019s wife in the Norse myth.<br>\r\n\u201cI tried other similar dresses.\u201d she says, explaining why she took so long \u201cBut this is the one I prefer. How do you think I look in this?\u201d<br>\r\nBlushing, you reply \u201cYou look fantastic, Janet.\u201d<br>\r\nLaura nods too, saying \u201cI think that\u2019s not age appropriate, but since you\u2019re a guest you can buy it if you like it. I must admit, however, that looks good on you.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet smiles, saying \u201cIt\u2019s quite expensive, though. I think this will empty my credit card.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Laura says \u201cCalonian Royal Hose will buy it for you. Consider it a present for your time in Calonia, Janet. The money on your VIP-card are yours now, it\u2019s not a loan.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet smiles brightly: she is really happy about it.<br>\r\n\u201cI was afraid I had to return them in same way. I\u2019m glad to hear that.\u201d She says.<br>\r\n\u201cCan we have a snack, after this?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\nLaura nods, while Janet goes back in the dressing room and come back with her old dress and the new one in hand. She pays the dress at the cash desk, and you leave the store.<br>\r\nIt\u2019s snack time, so Laura takes you to ...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura takes you to a nearby ice cream stand. You look at the huge variety of different ice and wonder why it is separated in ice for adults and kids. Your fist instinct is to ask Laura, but then you shrug it off and decide to order some mature ice.<br>\r\n\u201cI want that and that and that.\u201d You point your finger at the different kinds of ice and look at the lady behind the counter, but she ignores you and look at Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Laura is not saying anything you repeat your order and add: \u201chey Lady, are you deaf, I am talking to you and I have money to pay for it!\u201d You lift your tiger-purse and shake it. Now you receive a hard smack on your behind and Laura pulls you back.<br>\r\n\u201cHaven\u2019t I told you to be absolute polite to the citizens? Is that the way you talk to adults? If you do not stop this I spank you right here in front of her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you are pulled to the side Janet steps in front of the counter and greets the ice-cream vendor.<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Ma\u2019am, I am a tourist and I would love to try some of your ice creations.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vendor is surprised, but greets Janet.<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a pleasure to have you here, and it is good to see that you have very good manners. Some of our local kids have none of those, not even the princess. It seems like some of the stories about her are correct. It looks like she is a naughty girl that requires a strict hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that you blush deep red. You had thought the woman does not recognize you, but she simply lay the same standards on you that she use on other kids. Janet on the other hand is treated like an adult and receive her order, that she pays with her VIP Card. After a good discount she pays 3\u20ac for her 4 big scoops.<br>\r\n\u201cNow we try again, Princess.\u201d Laura pushes you forward.<br>\r\nSighing deeply \u2013 and receiving another smack for it \u2013 you go to the section for kids and talk to Laura. \u201cPlease Mrs. Laura, can I have those three kinds of ice-cream?\u201d You point at chocolate, vanilla and strawberry.<br>\r\nLaura address the vendor and orders the ice-cream for you. When she takes one of two exact similar looking chocolate ice-creams she hesitates and looks at Laura: \u201cAre you sure Ma\u2019am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nods \u201cIt will not hurt her, will it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Ma\u2019am, it will do her good.\u201d The vender nods and gives the ice-cream to Laura, who gives it to you.<br>\r\nEden and Laura have no ice, what is not surprising you. Laura sit down at a table, together with Janet and you, while Eden stands beside you and observe the surrounding.<br>\r\n\u201cMrs. Laura, why was I ignored, that is so rude of that bi\u2026 lady.\u201d You caught your tongue in time to avoid another smack or worse.<br>\r\n\u201cSellers of sweets are asked to sell nothing to minors, to prevent bad teach and overweight of children. Therefore some, like this one, ignore kids and wait for an adult to place the order. It is not uncommon, but she could have explained it to you, that was a bit rude of her.\u201d Laura explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly eat your very tasty ice and sit back in your chair. Janet is still eating hers and sits straight and like a lady. \u201cWhy are you such a geek? Are you trying to make me look bad?\u201d You spat at Janet.<br>\r\nLaura is about to say something, but Janet is faster.<br>\r\n\u201cSusi, do not be stupid. I am a guest and I try to be accepted as an adult. I have been asked four times why I am not in a diaper since we are in the city and twice I had to show my trainers to proof that I will not pee on the carpets in the shops. If I would behave like you\u2026 I they would call child-service or my MOM and ask them to pick me up. It is a kind of self-defense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have not been aware that it is so difficult for Janet, since you have never seen people talking to her. Now you grab her hand and apologies.<br>\r\nNow that Janet has her ice finished as well you get up again and take a last look at the two sections of ice, you had hoped to find the answer yourself, but now you turn to Laura you ask: \u201cWhy do they have  two seconds? What is the difference?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura grins and point at the kids section. \u201cThat ice contains more vitamins and calcium to help kids grow. Some varieties have additional increments, for example laxatives to keep the sweet tooth regular, while the adult section can contain alcohol and some artificial flavors.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lost it already when she mentioned laxatives, especially since you feel your tummy rumble a bit. \u201cLaura, are you telling me I just ate some ice that will help me to go number two?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sighs and gives you a little slap on your behind. \u201cIt is Mrs. Laura and yes, the chocolate will help you go number two quickly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are angry at her and run out of the store, straight in the line of a bicycle. \u201cWATCH OUT!!\u201d You look to your right and see him coming, but your know it is too late. You close your eyes and\u2026 wait for the pain\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You open your eyes, seeing Eden on her knees next to the bike: she stopped the bicycle before it can hurt you. The man on it has fallen too, but seems unscratched.<br>\r\n\u201cEden! Are you ok?\u201d you shout, running to her.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, thank you, my lady.\u201d she replies, getting on her feet again, then asking in a strict tone \u201cAnd you, princess? Are you hurt?\u201d<br>\r\nYou shake you head, still trembling a little. She\u2019s mad at you, and you can clearly feel it.<br>\r\nThe man that was on the bike gets up, reaching you too \u201cI\u2019m sorry, when I saw you, it was too late.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not your fault. It\u2019s mine.\u201d you say, apologizing to him for this.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok, little one. Just be more careful, ok?\u201d he says, patting your head.<br>\r\nLaura and Janet reach you too, and Laura takes you by your ear.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess! You should be ashamed of yourself!\u201d she scolds you, giving you an hard smack on the bottom \u201cI was scared to death! Look what happened!\u201d<br>\r\nYou are about to say that everything is fine, that you notice the broken bike and specially Eden\u2019s left arm: she\u2019s bleeding, even if it seems only a superficial wound.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Eden! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d you cry \u201cI understand that you\u2019re mad at me now!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s only a scratch, princess.\u201d the knightess replies \u201cI\u2019m not mad at you for this, I vowed to die for you, if necessary. No, I\u2019m mad at you because you\u2019ve done a dangerous thing. And I am mad at myself because my reaction was too slow.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what will happen, don\u2019t you?\u201d Laura asks.<br>\r\nWith a sad look, you nod, replying \u201cI get \u2026 a spanking.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou know you deserve it. A tantrum, especially one that endanger you, will not be tolerated.\u201d Laura says, taking you back in the ice cream store by your ear. She reaches the table where you were sitting before and takes you over her lap.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Mrs. Laura, can\u2019t you spank me once back in the Palace?\u201d you plead.<br>\r\nShe shakes her head, removing your onesie and then your diaper, and saying \u201cNo, princess. Every punishment will be delivered on the spot.\u201d<br>\r\nShe takes out something from her bag, and you know what it is. When she leans the brush over your bottom, you\u2019re certain of it. And then comes the first spank. It stings, but doesn\u2019t hurt much more than the hand. It\u2019s the normal brush, at least.<br>\r\nShe begins to hit you with the brush, and after few hits you are already crying.<br>\r\n\u201cLook, mama, look!\u201d you hear a little girl exclaims \u201cThat girl is getting a spanking!\u201d<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t see her, but judging by her voice you think she is 7 or 8 years old.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be rude, little one.\u201d you hear her mommy says to her \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that she deserved it. Be on your best behavior or you\u2019ll be next.\u201d<br>\r\nThe little girl pointed at you, put no other customer says anything in seeing your spanking: it\u2019s quite a normal thing for them.<br>\r\n\u201cWill you be disobedient again, princess?\u201d Laura says, while still spanking you.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, I will obey, I promise!\u201d you exclaim \u201cI\u2019ll be polite and good, please don\u2019t spank me anymore.\u201d<br>\r\nBut she continues to spank. Raising you head, you notice that Janet is looking at you and feels clearly really uncomfortable, and she is grasping Eden\u2019s right hand.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, please, Mrs. Laura, stop! I promise to behave!\u201d you sob.<br>\r\nShe gives you another set of slaps, before stopping and asking, addressing a man out of your field of vision \u201cDo you think it\u2019s enough, sir?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cA couple more strokes, maybe.\u201d he replies. You know the voice: it\u2019s the man that were over the bicycle.<br>\r\nThe hairbrush lends another two times over your bottom, making you jump over her knees.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think, Eden?\u201d Mrs. Laura asks again, this time to Eden \u201cHas she received enough?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI would give her another set of five, Mrs.\u201d the knightess says. She is still mad, it\u2019s quite obvious.<br>\r\n\u201cAnother set, then.\u201d Laura says, and then gives you other five slaps with the brush.<br>\r\nYou are sobbing without control, while the handmaid stops her hand. You think it\u2019s finally over, but then she asks \u201cAnd you, Janet? Do you think that she had enough?\u201d<br>\r\nYou look at her: Janet is biting her bottom lip, and says, looking at you \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Susan, but you really scared me this time. What would have happened if that would have been a car instead of a bike?\u201d <br>\r\nShe looks at Laura, and says \u201cI think she deserves another ten slaps at least.\u201d<br>\r\nYou resist the urge to yell \u201ctraitor\u201d to her, while Laura spanks you again, because you know she is right: nothing serious happened but could have been.<br>\r\nAfter the 10th slap wanted by Janet, Mrs. Laura finally lets you stand up.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, you know why you have received this spanking?\u201d she asks you.<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I disobeyed.\u201d you sob.<br>\r\n\u201cOnly partially.\u201d she replies \u201cThe main reason is that you endangered yourself, and you did it for nothing.\u201d<br>\r\nYou are still crying, aware that she is right. Laura hugs you, and then the same do both Eden and Janet.<br>\r\nYou let them go and you are calming down. Mrs. Laura is dressing you back up, when you hear a boy yelling.<br>\r\n\u201cGranny! Granny! I want an ice cream!\u201d he shouts, stomping his food.<br>\r\nAn old woman gives him a slap on the bottom, scolding him \u201cStop this nonsense this instant, young man, or your trousers will come down.\u201d<br>\r\nThe boy seems two years older than you, so seems 16 years old. That makes his tantrum look even more ridiculous. He\u2019s wearing a t-shirt, and sweatpants. He\u2019s quite tall, with short brown hair and green eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cBut I want one!\u201d he says aloud and begins to hit with his open palms the window of the ice-creams.<br>\r\n\u201cEnough, Samuel!\u201d his grandmother scolds him, taking him to a chair \u201cI\u2019ve warned you, haven\u2019t I?\u201d<br>\r\nShe takes him over her lap, then lowers both his trousers and his diaper, and begins to spank him with her hand.<br>\r\nHe instantly begins to cry, saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry, granny! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d<br>\r\nYou giggle. This one is a brat, without doubts, and deserves this. Or maybe you are a little frustrated for your spanking and you\u2019re simply happy that someone else is getting the spotlight.<br>\r\nMrs. Laura then says to you \u201cHaven\u2019t I said it\u2019s rude to stare to a punishment, princess?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d you reply, looking away and blushing.<br>\r\n\u201cWe still have time before the meeting with the mayor and then going back to the Palace for lunch.\u201d the handmaid states \u201cWhat would you like to do, princess?\u201d<br>\r\nYou see the boy (Samuel) being let get up, while his grandmother is still scolding him \u201cBehave, little one, or we will repeat the lesson.\u201d<br>\r\nMaybe it\u2019s a good occasion to befriend a Calonian that not reside in the Palace. But is it worth it? It\u2019s a 16 years old boy and a real brat (the most immature one you\u2019ve seen so far). Maybe asking to Mrs. Laura to introduce you to a mom with a girl about your age would be wiser?</span></div></div>",

But on the other hand he seems to be innocent and cute. Maybe you should try it.<br>\r\n\u201cUhm, Hi, I am Susan. You are Samuel?\u201d You simply speak to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seems surprised, like his grandmother is and nod his head.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that is me. I know you\u2026. You are Princess\u2026 Susan?\u201d He smiles and bows.<br>\r\nHis grandmother sighs and looks at Laura, before she goes to your handmaid and begin to talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just got spanked as well, that is really hard, isn\u2019t it?\u201d You try to keep the conversation alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugs and scratches his head. \u201cWith my granny I have a 50% chance that it works out when I throw a tantrum. She easily becomes embarrassed about my behavior and I get what I want. This time it was not working out.\u201d He grins and you understands that his naughtiness is more of a strategy than really his true self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you are not a total immature brat?\u201d You asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you have to do what helps you. If I simply ask for ice, she ignores me. If I keep asking her again and again she force me to keep a pacifier in my mouth. Throwing a tantrum is something I can do within seconds and \u2013 as I said \u2013 I have a serious chance that it works out. With my mom I cannot do that. As soon as I act up the takes me home and locks me in the crib until I promise to be good. With granny I have much more options.\u201d He smiles and does not think for a second that all this is strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura is coming to you and touch your back to get your attention. \u201cFound a new friend, princess?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush and look at your feet. \u201cI thought it would be nice to have a friend outside of the palace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nods and takes your hand. \u201cThat is true, I ask his grandmother for his contacts, so you can meet him again, if that is okay for you, Samuel?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods and suddenly begins to grin. \u201cSure, that would be nice. You can come around and watch me play soccer \u2013 or we eat an ice together, if I am allowed to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head, but have the feeling that this relationship will be difficult to maintain. He is not a total brat, as you thought before, but do you share some interests?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura leads you out of the store, but only a few meters further she stops and calls out to a woman with her daughter.<br>\r\n\u201cVictoria! We have not meet for weeks!\u201d She turns to you and smiles. \u201cSorry Princess, I think we have a few minutes before we have to proceed. I only want to say hello to an old friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and look at Janet, who is carrying two bags with the dress she had bought and a couple more items. \u201cIs your tummy doing fine? I heard you ate laxatives?!\u201d<br>\r\nYou role your eyes and nod: \u201cDO not remind me. I try not to think about it and only pray that Laura does not need to change me in front of the mayor. That would be really\u2026 oh fuck, look at her!\u201d<br>\r\nYou point your finger at Laura\u2019s friend\u2019s daughter.<br>\r\nShe is about 15 years old with a C-Cup rack you would kill for. Her rich chest is on display, since she only wears a kind of sports bra that has some reins connected in the back. The poor girl is practically on the leash. Beside this, some sports shoes and a thick diaper, she wears some mittens that are marked with a big M. Last but not least she sucks on a pink pacifier that has NAUGHTY GIRL written on its shield.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess\u2026 your finger\u2026 .\u201d Eden warns you, before Laura sees you pointing at the poor girl. Quickly you take your hand down, but by then the girl has seen you and blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would love to know why she is dressed like this and why it is allowed to punish kids in public \u2013 to this degree. It seems very cruel and reminds you of your nightmares. You would have never guessed that people do this for real, but you do not dare to talk to the girl. It looks like she is already in trouble and you do not want to make it worse for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Laura is done talking to her old friend. \u201cI am sorry Princess, we went to the same school when she got pregnant and took a break before she finished it.\u201d<br>\r\nThose few words make your mind spin. Laura is not older than 34. Her friend has the same age. Her daughter looks like 15\u2026 so her friend got pregnant at 17?? How could that happen when kids are kept in diapers for so long? Or was her friend 18 and just immediately got pregnant??<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of you walk further to the city hall. You\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She\u2019s very kind.<br>\r\nDuring the crossing, however, you messed yourself, and you\u2019re quite ashamed of this, even if it\u2019s not entirely your fault.<br>\r\n\u201cAre we going to meet the mayor, now?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we are.\u201d she replies, sniffing the air \u201cIf you don\u2019t need a change before that.\u201d<br>\r\nBlushing, you nod, and say \u201cI \u2026 I\u2019d really like to. Thank you.\u201d<br>\r\nShe takes your hand, and lead you to a small palace with the signboard \u201cCity Hall\u201d over the door.<br>\r\nLaura leads you inside, reaching a desk with a young man behind it.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am?\u201d he asks, looking at her \u201cDo you need something?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m handmaid Laura and this is princess Susan. We have an appointment with the mayor.\u201d Laura replies \u201cAnd the princess needs a change before the meeting.\u201d<br>\r\nThe young man (it\u2019s about 23-24 years old, and not handsome at all) says to you \u201cWelcome, princess. I\u2019m glad to meet you.\u201d then points to a changing table at the end of the room, saying \u201cThe changing station is right there.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d you exclaim, going pale and blushing at the same time \u201cEveryone will see me, there!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, princess.\u201d the man says, with a sympathetic tone \u201cBut usually children are not allowed in the city-hall, so an entire room only for a changing facility would have been considered a waste of space. You can consider yourself lucky: two years ago, the changing table wasn\u2019t\u2019 at the end of the room, but right next to the main entrance door.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, I don\u2019t like this either.\u201d Laura says \u201cBut you will not meet the mayor in a dirty diaper. Be a good girl and come with me.\u201d<br>\r\nYou look sad, ready for what you think it\u2019s the ultimate humiliation (and it\u2019s not even a punishment!) but then the man winks at you, saying in kind tone \u201cCome on, princess. Be a good girl for your nanny, and I\u2019ll let you have a lollipop after the meeting.\u201d<br>\r\nYou smile at him and thank him, before letting Laura leading you to the changing table. Eden follows you too, while Janet waits next to the receptionist desk.<br>\r\nBefore being to far away from her, you hear the young man ask to her \u201cAnd what about you, young lady?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Janet. I\u2019m a guest from the USA and I\u2019m training pants.\u201d you hear her reply.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a mature girl.\u201d the man says. If they say something else, you don\u2019t hear it.<br>\r\nLaura lifts you on the changing table, while Eden place herself under the handmaid, giving you her shoulders. She is not looking at your change, and this comfort you a little.<br>\r\nMrs. Laura removes your onesie and then your dirty diaper. She begins to wipe you, when a small group of employees enter from the front door.<br>\r\nThey take a quick look at you and you wish to disappear in the ground, but contrary to what you would have expected, they then proceed ignoring you.<br>\r\nLaura finishes to clean you up, before putting you in fresh diaper.<br>\r\n\u201cNice and clean.\u201d she says, rubbing your hair. She then takes you down from the changing table and puts the onesie back on you.<br>\r\n\u201cThe mayor is waiting for us.\u201d she says \u201cWe\u2019d better don\u2019t\u2019 make him wait for long.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe mayor \u2026 is a male?\u201d you ask, almost surprised. With every person of power that you\u2019ve met so far female, you thought to meet a female mayor too.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, in Calonia we firmly believe in gender equality.\u201d  she explains \u201cPoliticians, royals, worker, official, knights. In every job and position, you\u2019ll find both men and women of all ages, from young adults to old ones. There aren\u2019t any of them in the Palace, but there are even male nannies.\u201d<br>\r\nYou are quite happy to hear this, since you are a believer of gender equality, but at the same time you\u2019re happy to have nanny Rose as your nanny and not a male. That would have been quite embarrassing. Thinking better about it, William has a female nanny, even if he\u2019s a boy. Having a nanny of the opposite sex must not be that uncommon.<br>\r\nLaura takes you in the corridors, holding your hand. Eden and Janet both follow you.<br>\r\nShe stops in front of a door with a plate similar to the ones in the palace on it. The plate says \u201cMayor\u2019s office\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cMe and Janet will wait for you here.\u201d Laura explains \u201cThe mayor wants to speak with you privately.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd Eden?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n\u201cShe is your bodyguard, so she can come.\u201d Laura replies.<br>\r\nNoticing the doubt in your face, the knightess intervenes, explaining \u201cAn escort of a noble family member, like a royal family member like you are, it\u2019s not considered a person during a private meeting. For example, in this case, the mayor will not greet me nor will say anything to me at all. I will be like a ghost.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s unfair!\u201d you exclaim \u201cYou ARE a person, not a ghost.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMy lady, this s my job.\u201d Eden says \u201cThis procedure has been introduced to allow escorts to protect the nobles even during a private meeting. If you insist that he treats me like a person during a formal occasion, I would not be allowed to stay at your side.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you wait outside, then?\u201d you insist \u201cI don\u2019t\u2019 like the idea of you treated like a ghost. It\u2019s not a dangerous situation, right?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI could.\u201d she says \u201cBut I will not do it. I vowed to protect you, and I will not leave you alone with a stranger, even if it\u2019s a respectable person like the mayor.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, aware that you can\u2019t ask her to fail her duties: that would shame her name.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I suggest you to behave during the meeting.\u201d Laura concludes \u201cThe mayor has the authority to spank every naughty boy and girl of the city, and the Royal Palace it\u2019s formally part of it.\u201d<br>\r\nWith that last advice, you then knock the door, and a voice of a middle-aged man replies \u201cCome in.\u201d<br>\r\nYou open the door and enter, followed only by Eden.<br>\r\nThe mayor is \u2026</span></div></div>",

It takes you a second to notice, but with his white beard and red jacket he looks a bit like Santa Clause.<br>\r\n\u201cHello Sir, I am Princess Susan and it is a honor to meet you.\u201d You greet him and he comes around his desk and nods at you. He is very tall and in his shadow you step back, only to notice that Eden is standing behind you. Her presence make you feel a bit better and you shake his strong hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome Princess, It is a honor for ME to meet you. Most of what I heard about you helps me to look into the future with a smile.\u201d He smells off after shave, what seems strange to you, since he is obviously not shaving his beard, but you are a girl and have no clue what smell you should expect from him.<br>\r\n\u201cI see you had mixed feelings about Richard?!\u201d You smile and follow him to his desk. To your surprise you find a normal looking chair for guests and one a bit smaller with a kitten-pillow laying on it. Blushing a bit you sit down on the kitten-chair and look up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed the fact that Queen Charlotte found you is a relief for me. Lord Richard is a nobleman, nothing less \u2013 but for sure nothing more. He can spend his time and money in Monaco and leave us alone.\u201d He smiles and continue the conversation with less political topics. He is very nice and kind and asks you about your life in the states and if it is difficult to adapt. You feel brave enough around him to be honest and tell him that the tradition is very strange for you, but that you are eager to adapt.<br>\r\n\u201cThat is very good to hear. Can I offer you a snack?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCareless you say yes and he calls his secretary over the phone and ask her to bring a snack for a little girl. Only a minute later she comes in with a tray and place it on the desk.<br>\r\nHis secretary wears a long dress in black that ends just below her knees. She smiles at you and winks. \u201cShould I feed her Sir, it would be a pleasure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mayor sakes his head and walks around the desk. He sits down on the second chair in front of the desk and takes a bib from the tray.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Jenny, I do that myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish Sir Preston.\u201d His secretary says and leaves the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have not paid much attention to the tray, but now you see a bowl with a spoon instead of the cookies you had expected.<br>\r\n\u201cYou will love this, it is mashed banana. I asked your Nanny for your favorite snacks and she told me that you would like this.\u201d He smiles and ties the bib around your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could feed myself, Sir.\u201d You blush and feel a bit uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHush little princess, you are only a kid and I will not miss the chance to feed a sweat girl like you. How often do I have the chance to feed a princess? \u2026 honestly this is my first time. Now open up for the airplane.\u201d<br>\r\nSir Preston obviously is used to smaller children. You would guess that he has grandchildren, by his age. Still, he feeds you like an expert and waits patiently for you to swallow each spoon full. The mashed banana is very tasty, but you would have preferred cookies or cake \u2013 but maybe that is not healthy enough for a little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you are done he wipes your mouth and bows.<br>\r\n\u201cThat was very nice princess. I liked your little talk and would not mind to invite you from times to times.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel quiet full, but smile as well. He is a very nice person and to meet him was way less difficult as you had expect it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Eden leave his office. Outside Laura and Janet wait for you.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Laura says,\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You will not be forced to meet her, of course. It\u2019s not a formal meeting or anything, but I think would be good idea.\u201d<br>\r\nYou are now really curious, so you nod your head.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019d like to meet this person.\u201d you say.<br>\r\nLaura smiles and takes your hand, leading you to door with a plate saying \u201cchief councilor of the city council\u201d on it.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a pompous title.\u201d you say to yourself.<br>\r\nLaura knocks the door, meanwhile saying \u201cI\u2019ll wait here. You, Janet and Eden can all enter.\u201d<br>\r\nYou hear a voice from the other side of the door, a male voice: \u201cCome in.\u201d<br>\r\nYou are surprised. Laura said that you were about to meet a \u201cshe\u201d.<br>\r\nLaura opens the door, gently pushing you inside the room. Janet and Eden follow you, while Laura closes the door behind them.<br>\r\nIn the room, you see a well-dressed and quite short man in his early forties, that greets you with a tired smile.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for having requested your presence, princess.\u201d he says \u201cI tried to say to her that you were busy, but she insisted that she wanted meet you.\u201d<br>\r\nBefore you can ask to him who he\u2019s talking about, a girl about your age jumps in your direction, hugging you and saying in a high-pitched voice \u201cHi, princess! I\u2019m glad to meet you!\u201d<br>\r\nThe man sighs, saying \u201cPlease don\u2019t choke her, Tabitha.\u201d<br>\r\nThe girl named Tabitha lets you go, then takes you hands in hers, saying \u201cI\u2019d really like to be your friend. Really, really much! Do you want me as your friend?\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush and take a look at her. She\u2019s not much tall, and with a couple of breasts even smaller than yours. She has very long red hair, and two small eyes. Those are quite strange, because they are grey. She\u2019s wearing a red infant bodysuit closed with snaps over her crotch, that doesn\u2019t hide at all her thick diaper.<br>\r\n\u201cUmh \u2026\u201d you say, a little hesitant \u201c\u2026 before that, I think we should know each other better. For example, my name is Susan.\u201d<br>\r\nWithout waiting even for a second, she exclaims \u201cMy name is Tabitha, but my friends call me Tabby. I like playing with dolls. I cuddle them, but when they misbehave I spank them. Oh, and my dad is an important person of the city council. He has as boss only the mayor himself.\u201d<br>\r\nNoticing your trouble with this girl so full of energy, Janet intervenes, saying \u201cNice to meet you, Tabby. My name is Janet. I\u2019m the princess best friend and a guest here in Calonia.\u201d<br>\r\nTabitha immediately hugs her, saying \u201cNice to meet you too! The more we are, better it is!\u201d<br>\r\nThen she looks at Eden and jumps at her, hugging her too, exclaiming \u201cA Royal Knight! I\u2019ve never seen one!\u201d<br>\r\nYou giggle, in seeing Eden becoming red like a tomato. She wasn\u2019t expecting that for sure.<br>\r\n\u201cTabitha! Stop!\u201d her father scolds her \u201cRoyal Knights are not for hugging.\u201d<br>\r\nTabitha looks at him, without letting Eden go, and replies \u201cNo, no! I hug who I want! Meanie dad!\u201d, then sticks her tongue out to him.<br>\r\nThe man reaches her, drags her away from Eden and gives her a hard smack on the bottom, saying \u201cDo you want a spanking in front of the princess, Tabitha?\u201d<br>\r\nShe cries, saying she\u2019s sorry.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, little one.\u201d Eden intervenes, surprising you \u201cNo offence taken. But you should obey your daddy when he says something to you.\u201d<br>\r\nTabitha nods, then looks at you and say \u201cYou can invite me in the palace when you want! I\u2019d really like to play with you!\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, thinking that maybe she\u2019s a better choice than Samuel.<br>\r\nYou are about to say goodbye, when something crosses your mind. You bite your bottom lip, uncertain, but then you ask \u201cDo you get spanked a lot, Tabby?\u201d<br>\r\nYou had expected her to blush or to tell you to mind your business, but she instead smiles, replying without problem \u201cOh, I\u2019m spanked a lot! Yesterday I was spanked three times, got two mouth soaping and I spent almost an hour in corner time, with the nose in the corner and hands on the head. This morning daddy spanked me only once, for messing his desk. But usually I\u2019m spanked by mommy of by the baby-sitter. I like her, but she\u2019s too strict compared to mommy and daddy.\u201d<br>\r\nShe said everything (and it\u2019s much more than you asked for) in a complete normal tone, without a trace of embarrassment, like if it\u2019s a complete normal thing.<br>\r\nBut then she asks you, taking you off guard \u201cAnd what about you? I\u2019m curious. Is a princess spanked as much as a commoner?\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush deeply, uncertain of what reply. Once again, Janet intervenes to help you, even if this time you would have preferred her to shut up: \u201cOh, she gets a lot of spankings. Before the meeting with the mayor she got a long and hard spanking by Mrs. Laura with the hairbrush for crossing the street without enough attention. And her potty mouth often gets her a mouth soaping. And not mentioning the times I saw her in locked clothes or in mittens.\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush again, exclaiming \u201cJanet! Please!\u201d<br>\r\nTabby giggles, then says \u201cIt was fun meeting you, princess. Now I think I need a diaper change. I wetted myself a lot and if I wait too long to ask for a diaper change to a grown-up, I get a rash. And, consequently, a spanking.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, an after greeting her and her dad, you leave the office.<br>\r\nOutside, Laura asks you how the meeting was, and you tell her you\u2019d like to invite her at the Palace sometimes, while you still have to think about Samuel. And you remember her that you\u2019d like to meet Zoey, Victoria\u2019s daughter, too.<br>\r\n\u201cYou want a lot of friends, uh?\u201d Laura says, ruffling your hair \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing. I\u2019m sure the Queen will be happy about it. You know, when she discovered your existence, but before coming to America to pick you up, she was worried that you could be a sociopath without friends. We are all glad you\u2019re not.\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, realizing that in USA you have Janet and very few others as friends. Here in Calonia, however, you feel more at ease in meeting persons about your age. Maybe it\u2019s because they are like big children? Or it\u2019s because you feel more childish yourself? You\u2019re not sure about it.<br>\r\n\u201cAre we going back to the Palace, now?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\nLaura nods, replying \u201cOf course. There you\u2019ll have your lunch, you\u2019ll take you nap and then you\u2019ll attend your class and go back to nanny Rose to tell her if you earned demerits. Then, you\u2019ll have the rest of the day free.\u201d<br>\r\nYou shake your head, thinking that she doesn\u2019t needed to explain your entire afternoon program, since you asked her only about the return.<br>\r\nAll together you go back to the limousine (you are put in baby reins for the road crossing). Once secured in the kids seat, Laura and Janet takes place around you, while Eden sits next to the driver.<br>\r\nYou then go back to the Palace. There, Laura lead you to your nursery, when you meet Meredith along the way.<br>\r\n\u201cHug attack!\u201d she exclaims, hugging you.<br>\r\nYou hug her back, asking her about her morning. You are eager to know about Marcus Grairven.<br>\r\n\u201cThe supply teacher is very kind.\u201d she says, surprising you \u201cHe gave me few demerits and even helped me with clever advices to how to work on my shyness. He had that big scary paddle over the desk, but I didn\u2019t used it. He said \u201c<i>I only use the paddle on naughty girls that deserve it</i>\u201d. I was surprised.\u201d<br>\r\nYou clench your first, thinking \u201cThat bastard! He paddled me and Janet because he hates me!\u201d<br>\r\nOn the other side, you are relieved in hearing that Merry didn\u2019t get a paddling. Janet will not be paddled anymore, and you have Melissa\u2019s note about the maximum strokes he can give you.<br>\r\nYou greet Merry, and only when she\u2019s away you think that William wasn\u2019t with her.<br>\r\nOnce at the nursery\u2019s door you open it.<br>\r\nInside, you see Rose, that smiles at you. She is \u2026</span></div></div>",

This is how it should be when you are in the care of Mrs. Laura. Maid Alice is not around. You wonder if she is still working for Nanny Melissa or what she is doing. Maybe she is already working as a normal maid again?!<br>\r\nRose seems to be preoccupied and runs around the nursery without doing anything with it.

Would that take away the pressure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanny Rose smiles and nods her head. \u201cYes that would help me a lot. Oh thank you Susan!\u201d<br>\r\nShe give you a wet kiss on the forehead and before you know it, she lifts you up, carries you to the chair and sit you down on her lap.<br>\r\n\u201cYou are such a good little girl, I can be happy to be your nanny.\u201d Rose says and pushes her bra to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did not mean\u2026  mhhh.\u201d You want to say that you were talking about a real baby, or another baby, not yourself, but Rose is so eager to get rid of the painful pressure in her breasts that she misunderstood you and pushes her nipple into your mouth. As soon as you tongue touch her flesh, you feel milk dripping and filling your mouth. In reflex you gulp down the warm, rich milk and find yourself nursing from her.<br>\r\nAfter the first shock is over you have already two mouthfuls down and shake yourself away from her breast.<br>\r\n\u201cRose! This is wrong, I should not nurse from you.\u201d You say, before she gets hold of the back of your head and guide your mouth back to her nipple.<br>\r\n\u201cHush baby, there is nothing wrong with this. Many kids have a wet-nurse, even in higher age. It was not planned, but please help me out. I am not sure how long the effect lasts, but if might go away on its own.\u201d<br>\r\nThis is not the news you had hoped for. You have to admit that the taste is good, but to suck on her nipple feels simply close and even kind of sexual, especially since it makes Rose feel so much better.<br>\r\nYour sucking takes away her pain and replaces it with a very nice sensation that make her blush and slightly moan out whenever your tongue touch her nipple.<br>\r\nAfter several minutes she changes your position to the other nipple and again feeds you until her milk runs dry. When nothing comes out, she lowers you down and smiles.<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank you Susan, I know that was strange, but I was in real pain. Please do not complain about me.\u201d Her eyes fill with tears and she starts to sob.<br>\r\n\u201cI am sorry Susan, I am a bad nanny and stupid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slide from her lap and hug her tightly.<br>\r\n\u201cIt was\u2026 strange, but I will not report you or anything. We can keep this a secret. Nobody must know about it.\u201d You offer, not wanting your friends to know that you just nursed on your nanny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose nods and buttons up her dress, covering her breasts. To your surprise she brings in a baby bottle and takes you on her lap again.<br>\r\n\u201cDo I have to drink even more? I had a snack in the city and\u2026 your milk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease princess, we need to make sure you receive all that you need.\u201d She begs you and obediently you finish the bottle as well. Then she put you down into your crib for your nap. Your stomach is full of milk and formula and before you fall asleep you feel the crotch of your diaper become warm and wet. Still, or maybe because of that, you sleep like a baby and wake up two hours later by Rose\u2019 soft voice.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, Time to go to class. I heard that Mr. Grairven is in a good mood today. Try to be a good girl and you will be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stretch and yawn and say hello to Janet, while Rose checks your diaper, but decide that you are not wet enough for a change. Outside in the hallway you and Janet meet Eden, who escorts you to your class. Janet is in a great mood. She is wearing one of her new dresses and spin the skirt all the time.<br>\r\nWhen you enter the classroom with her you find\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His paddle stands over the desk, threatening as usual.<br>\r\n\u201cGood afternoon, Mr. Grairven.\u201d you say, entering with Janet. Eden waits at the door, like usual.<br>\r\nThe teacher puts down the newspaper and looks at the clock, saying \u201cGood afternoon to you too, princess. Good afternoon, Janet. Right on time, I see. The paddling seemed to be effective, after all.\u201d<br>\r\nYou resist the impulse to say him to fuck himself with a chainsaw, and reply \u201cI will try to behave, today, sir.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it.\u201d he says \u201cAfter you two\u2019s lesson, I thought that your friends would be two troublemakers too, but they are polite and diligent. I hope you will not corrupt them with your influence. Now, take position at your desks, so we will begin.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI have to give you this, first.\u201d you say, and give him the note with Melissa\u2019s signature that Rose gave you after your ... embarrassing moment with her. The teacher takes the note and read it.<br>\r\n\u201cA maximum number of stroke, uh? I don\u2019t agree, but I don\u2019t have the authority to deny it.\u201d he says, then looks at Janet \u201cBut you, miss, will get a paddling right now, for coming in my class dressed as a streetwalker.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry sir, but I will not let you paddle me this time.\u201d she says \u201cFirst of all, I\u2019m dressed in a dress that fits my age, not like a whore. And I\u2019m a guest with a VIP-Card, so you have no authorization to paddle me against my will.\u201d<br>\r\nHe sighs, saying \u201cI\u2019m aware of that. I was only hoping that you wanted to submit to a little discipline. If you don\u2019t want, I can\u2019t force you.\u201d<br>\r\nYou laugh out loud, without thinking.<br>\r\n\u201cVery well. Is seems that a paddling WILL occur, after all.\u201d he says, taking his paddle.<br>\r\nYou regret doing it, but you submit. After this paddling (that stings like hell), the lesson finally begins.<br>\r\nToday you find that your teacher is far more tolerant than last time, and gives you even some wise advice to how to handle a public speech. At the end of the lesson, he has paddled you two more times: the first paddling is for failing at math, like usual, the second one for speaking without permission.<br>\r\nWhen the lesson is finally over, Mr. Grairven gives you the note with your demerits. E gives one to Janet too.<br>\r\n\u201c12 demerits for princess Susan, 7 demerits for Janet.\u201d he says \u201cGive this to your nanny, please.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m exonerated from the demerit system, sir.\u201d Janet says to him.<br>\r\nMr. Grairven shakes his head, replying \u201cThe way your nanny will administer it, or not administer it at all, it\u2019s not my concern. I have the duty to give a note with your behaviour.\u201d<br>\r\nAfter this, he gives a quick look at the newspaper, smiling.<br>\r\n\u201cSo, princess, will you be present at the great party?\u201d he asks you.<br>\r\n\u201cParty? What party?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\nHe look at you straight in your eyes, exclaiming \u201cYou don\u2019t know about the party? Incredible. House Penrose-Glee, the cadet house of the disappeared Penrose House, which is the House of King Gregory, first king of Calonia, organize a party every year. It\u2019s considered one of the most important parties of the country. Only the most important nobles are invited. My cousin assured me that he\u2019ll have them invite me too, this year. We don\u2019t know when the party will occur, yet, but it will be quite soon, I\u2019m sure.\u201d<br>\r\nYou are surprised, and you are not sure if going to this party would be an immense pleasure or a total stress, so you aren\u2019t sure if you\u2019d really want an invitation.<br>\r\n\u201cJanet.\u201d you says to your friend \u201cCan you wait for me outside? I need to tell something to Mr. Grairven.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet seems confused, as Mr. Grairven himself. Your friend nods, greets the teacher and leaves the room.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it, princess?\u201d he asks, with a flat tone.<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t like you calling my friend a whore, just for having dresses that fit her age.\u201d you tell him, sure of yourself thanks to Eden presence.<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d he says \u201cShe\u2019s a guest, so I can\u2019t force her to change, but in Calonia, the tradition wants that children are dressed like children, until they are 18 years old.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cStop this charade!\u201d you exclaim in his face \u201cI know your secret: your Hose doesn\u2019t respect the tradition! You are potty trained early like in the USA!\u201d<br>\r\nMr. Grairven shoot you with his glance, but he resists the temptation to choke you only because Eden is standing at the door.<br>\r\n\u201cLittle brat.\u201d he whispers \u201cHow did you discovered it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYour cousin, lord Richard, told it to me personally.\u201d you reveal.<br>\r\n\u201cThat idiot!\u201d Marcus exclaims, to your surprise \u201cHe\u2019s totally incapable of keeping a secret. Just for pairing, I will tell you a secret too. I can\u2019t stand him, nor can my sister.\u201d<br>\r\nYou look at him, with a surprised expression \u201cAre you serious? You paddled me like a slave of cotton plantations for speaking ill of him, and you can\u2019t stand him?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI paddled your diapered behind, princess, not your naked back. Don\u2019t compare yourself with slaves of old, or with the maids of our residence: they could tell you what a true punishment is.\u201d he replies \u201cAnd I support my cousin, because is the only member of our House with the possibility to be king. If a Grairven become king, all of us will have a benefit. This doesn\u2019t mean I like him. That arrogant man.\u201d<br>\r\nYou are surprised, and not just a little. Marcus is not a good person. He still think that whipping servants is right, and thinks only to his personal gain. However, he\u2019s not evil like you thought the first time. And he\u2019s a capable teacher. Melissa was right. Denying him the job only for his last name would have been unfair.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Grairven.\u201d you say \u201cI still don\u2019t like you, but I now see you are different from your cousin. This doesn\u2019t mean I will not try my best to be queen, though.\u201d<br>\r\nHe nods, replying \u201cOnly with a true rival House Grairven can thrive. Richard thinks that would have been better if you weren\u2019t never born, to gain an easy access to the throne, but I think that he should earn it only defeating you. He forgot the ancient say of the founder of the House, \u201cA man it\u2019s strong only when he defeats strong enemies\u201d. That it\u2019s a Grairven way.\u201d<br>\r\nYou greet him, and leave the room.<br>\r\nHouse Grairven it\u2019s a house of warriors, strong and determined. That always made them seems all evil at your eyes. You know see that they are simply bold and with a powerful will.<br>\r\nBut Richard is rotten. You will never let him getting the throne.<br>\r\nYou reach Janet, who is waiting for you, and aloud you say \u201cJanet! Eden! I take a vow! I will be Queen, and Richard will bite the dust.\u201d<br>\r\nThe two looks at each other, and Janet giggles.<br>\r\nYou return to your nursery, where you give Rose your demerits.<br>\r\n\u201c12 demerits. I think that a spanking it\u2019s necessary.\u201d she says, reading the note.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, nanny. He already spanked me for that.\u201d you plea her.<br>\r\nBut Rose shakes her head and sits down on chair, saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry, princess, but you need it. This spanking will be extra hard.\u201d<br>\r\nAlready crying, you lay yourself over Rose\u2019s lap, ready to receive your spanking. Rose raises her arm, and gives you two playful swats over your diaper.<br>\r\n\u201cDone.\u201d she says, giggling.<br>\r\n\u201cNanny!\u201d you exclaim, blushing \u201cYou tricked me!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t resist, princess.\u201d she giggles. Janet was mentally prepared to watch your punishment, and laughs instead.<br>\r\nYou leave her laps, asking her:</span></div></div>",

Sometimes it is a Masquerade, sometimes it has special slogan, but it is always great.\u201d She is smiling and her eyes are filled with joy and you wonder if she is invited as well or if she just imagines being there.<br>\r\n\u201cRose, will you go to that party as well?\u201d You ask to be sure.<br>\r\n\u201cThat depends on the invitation, sometimes it is only for the invited person. In your case it would be you and Eden as your shadow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it if everybody is calling her a shadow or a ghost. She is a nice person.\u201d You say, pouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose ruffles your hair and gives you a kiss on the forehead. \u201cOh cutie! Yes she is nice, but being a ghost means that she can go to that party and at least enjoy it a bit, while I have to see if you are allowed to bring your nanny or not. Sometimes they put a strict limit to the number of guests and then I cannot come \u2013 but if I am lucky, I am allowed to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile to her and suddenly imagine what it would mean if she is NOT allowed. \u201cSo, if WE are unlucky I go alone and nobody will change my diaper? Isn\u2019t the party including drinks and will last very long?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose laughs out and giggles: \u201cOne of their nannies would change your diaper, if they think it is needed. You should be more worried about the treatment of children on that party and hope that you will not get separated from the adults. That would make it way less enjoyable.\u201d<br>\r\nYou do not understand what she is talking about, so she explains: \u201cYou are a minor, but the princess, therefore they will invite you, but maybe they send all minors to bed at 9 to enjoy the rest of the party without kids. Then it could be, that they have a kind of sleepover with the other kids or they simply put you in a crib and tell you to sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t I go home? I have a limousine.\u201d You grin, but Rose shakes her head.<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be very unlikely. If we are lucky I can come with you and when it is time for you kids to go to bed, I will tuck you in and stay with you until you are sleeping.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis all sounds very unfair for you. If there is a party and you are invited you want to celebrate and have fun. \u201cHow was Queen Charlotte treated when she was a kid? I want the same for me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose shakes her head and laughs: \u201cNo, you do not want that. The minor princess Charlotte was parade in onesie and thick diapers, by reins from her Nanny Samantha. Then she was put in a playpen in a corner of the Party until 9, before her Nanny feed her a bottle and put her to bed in a locked crib, before Samantha changed from her strict uniform to a fashion dress and spend the rest of the night dancing and having fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to match the picture of the old hack with a young woman dancing, but that does not work. Then you feel sorry for Queen Charlotte and decide that you better do not ask for the same treatment. \u201cOkay, I will ask the Queen to double-check the invitation or ask the house Penrose-Glee to provide more details. If I can choose, I like you to come with me. The idea of another nanny changing me is\u2026 not nice.\u201d You say, but mean \u201cstupid\u201d, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to leave Rose, to play with Merry, William and Janet, when\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Never again!\u201d she sobs, still hugging you.<br>\r\n\u201cYour Majesty, please, a bit of self-control.\u201d Rose intervenes, putting a hand on her shoulder \u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\nThe Queen calms herself down a little, lets you go and grabs your shoulders.<br>\r\n\u201cLaura told me about the incident! My heart lost a beat! You cannot put yourself in danger, princess. Promise me something like that will never happen again.\u201d she says, clearly referring to the incident with the bike.<br>\r\n\u201cThe incident?\u201d asks Rose sternly, making you going pale \u201cWhat incident is she talking about, princess?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUmh ...\u201d you stutter \u201c... I had a little ... accident with a bike.\u201d<br>\r\nShe is clearly not satisfied with your answer, but as the Queen tries to say what happened, Rose stops her \u201cNo, your majesty. Her discipline is MY duty. She will tell me exactly what happened with her own lips, if she doesn\u2019t want a mouth soaping.\u201d<br>\r\nBlushing, you tell her everything that happened around the ice cream stand, concluding with \u201cMrs. Laura already punished me for this, with a hard and long spanking. Please, don\u2019t punish me again.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, cutie.\u201d Rose says, ruffling your hair \u201cI don\u2019t punish someone that has already been punished, so I will not punish you for it. However, I should punish you for not telling it to me. This time, I will not do it, but if something like that happen again, your mouth will be washed with soap. It\u2019s that clear?\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, hugging her and saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry, mommy.\u201d<br>\r\nThat sentence come out from your lips in an extremely spontaneous way. You blush, immediately saying \u201cI meant nanny! Nanny! With a lot of N!\u201d<br>\r\nRose giggles, replying \u201cNo offence taken, little one. Not at all.\u201d<br>\r\nThe Queen, on the other hands, looks sad. To try to console her, you hug her too, saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry for calling nanny Rose that way, mommy Charlotte.\u201d<br>\r\nThe queen gives you a tired smile. She understood that your sentence this time wasn\u2019t spontaneous at all, but she appreciates the gesture.<br>\r\n\u201cJust promise me that you\u2019ll try to stay safe.\u201d the queen says. As you promise that, she greets you and leaves the room, stopping next to Eden for a moment saying \u201cGood job. I\u2019m happy we chose you.\u201d<br>\r\nEden puts her hand on the heart and bows a little, while the Queen goes away.<br>\r\nYou greet Rose and leave too, with Janet and Eden. You\u2019re going straight to Melissa\u2019s nursery. If the siblings aren\u2019t there, the nanny will for sure know where they are.<br>\r\n\u201cMommy Rose, uh?\u201d Janet giggles, during the way.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, shut up.\u201d you simply say to her, blushing.<br>\r\nYou reach the nursery and knock.<br>\r\n\u201cCome in.\u201d Melissa says, without even asking who were knocking.<br>\r\nYou open the door, and you see nanny Melissa and William. The nanny is the middle of the room (you now know, after spending time with her, that she puts herself there every time someone knocks), while Willy is hugging his stuffed bear, giggling. You look around, and find Merry too. She is in a corner of the room, with the nose in the corner and her hands on the head. She is wearing a t shirt, a thick diaper and nothing else. Her behind (the part visible, at least) is bright red. She also have a band around the back of her head, and you presume she is gagged with a pacifier.<br>\r\n\u201cHi, princess. Hi, Janet.\u201d Melissa greets you, while Willy runs into you and stops next to your friend, greeting her.<br>\r\n\u201cHi, nanny Melissa.\u201d you say \u201cWhat is Merry punished for?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe wanted to see you once you were back from your trip.\u201d the tall nanny replies \u201cSo she had the brilliant idea to slip away from the nursery in hiding.\u201d<br>\r\nYou feel bad for this, and says \u201cSo it\u2019s my fault. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\nYou were expecting Melissa to scold you and spank you for corrupting the prime minister\u2019s daughter, but she shakes her head instead, saying \u201cNo, princess, don\u2019t take blame for something you couldn\u2019t control at all. It\u2019s her fault, and her fault alone.\u201d<br>\r\nThe nanny come closer to you, and whispers to your ears, with a pitch so low that even you have trouble hearing her words \u201cIt\u2019s my duty to punish her if she does something like that, but I like that she broke a rule for a friend. She\u2019s always so shy. You are a good friend for her, but try not to get her too in trouble.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, while Janet and Willy both look at you in curiosity, as the nanny reaches Merry.<br>\r\n\u201cYou can go to play with the princess, if you want.\u201d she says to her \u201cBut you\u2019ll get your dress back this evening.\u201d<br>\r\nMeredith nods, relaxing her arms and turning around. She is really gagged in a pacifier.<br>\r\n\u201cI will remove the gag.\u201d Melissa says, unlocking it \u201cBut you will be put in it again once you\u2019re back.\u201d<br>\r\nShe nods again, and comes in your direction, trying to smile.<br>\r\nBefore go, however, you ask to nanny Melissa \u201cNanny, can you change my diaper? I wetted myself during today\u2019s lesson and I forgot to ask Rose about it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd she forgot to check you? I really doubt it.\u201d she states.<br>\r\n\u201cI distracted her asking about the party.\u201d you say.<br>\r\nMelissa sighs, replying \u201cOk, I will change you, but I want you to tell her that you had a diaper change from me.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, thinking that you will simply not tell her, so she will not know you had your diaper changed and you will be praised for having kept your diaper dry.<br>\r\nMelissa lifts you on the changing table, while your friends give you a bit of privacy leaving the nursery. Eden stands at the door, but doesn\u2019t look in your direction.<br>\r\nOnce you are in a fresh diaper, however, Melissa puts you in lockable plastic pants, something you wore only in your first day in Calonia, and says, locking it \u201cI will give the key to Rose myself. I want to be sure you don\u2019t lie.\u201d<br>\r\nShe then dresses you back up in your onesie (a green one, that Rose had put on you after your nap) and lets you leave the nursery.<br>\r\nTrying to don\u2019t think about the locked plastic pants (and what Rose will say about your change), you try to have fun with your \u201ccrew\u201d.<br>\r\nYou run through the corridors, playing \u201ctag\u201d. After a while, however, William goes to slam against a floor clock. The clock sways, before falling down with a loud slam, getting into pieces.<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Merry yells \u201cNanny Melissa will roast my hiney with the spoon for this! The hiney of all of us!\u201d<br>\r\nEden sighs, and intervenes \u201cI suggest to leave, before someone sees this.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d you hear a voice.<br>\r\nToo late, dammit!<br>\r\nBefore your eyes, a maid appears. You immediately recognize her: is the red haired maid from the laundry.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess? The minister\u2019s children?\u201d she says, coming closer \u201cWhat the hell happened here?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re sorry, it was an incident.\u201d you say.<br>\r\nShe sighs, replying \u201cI should report this to the Housekeeper.\u201d<br>\r\nRemembering that Mrs. Amelia is one of the three servants (excluding the nannies) with the authority to spank you (and to spank the siblings, you think) you plea here \u201cPlease, sweet maid. Don\u2019t tell her anything.\u201d<br>\r\nShe bites her bottom lip, then says \u201cI will let you choose, princess. You can all get a light spanking from me, like a maintenance spanking over your diapers, but you have to ask for it since I wouldn\u2019t otherwise have the authorization to do it, or you can come to me to see the Housekeeper.\u201d<br>\r\nYou choose ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 - Let her spank you. It\u2019s a light one, after all.<br>\r\n2 - Go to the Housekeeper. Maybe she will not punish you at all, but she could also punish you harsher than the maid.</span></div></div>",

It is not hurting much, it is more the noise and the fact that you begged for this that makes it humiliating and a punishment.<br>\r\nAfter you it is the turn for Merry and William, while Janet stands at the site and bite down on her bottom lip. When it is her turn she hesitates. \u201cI do not have a padded behind, at least not that much. Can you spank me extra light, please?\u201d She raises the skirt of her sexy dress and shows her training pants.<br>\r\nYou want to hold her back and tell her that she does not need to be spanked, but you are not sure if the maid would agree with that.

Janet is still a bit weak on her legs and wipe her eyes when you pull her to her feet.<br>\r\nYou look at Eden, that stands in the hallway like a lighthouse \u2013 visible for everybody, and curse.<br>\r\n\u201cFuck! Now we are screwed!\u201d It is clear that whoever is coming has seen Eden, therefore it is only logical that you are caught already.<br>\r\n\u201cJanet, move your long legs and take the exit to the garden.\u201d You push and pull her off.<br>\r\nFinally Janet is snapping out of it and hurried off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise the young maid follows her quickly.

All alone \u2013 and slipped?\u201d He asks, not believing your lie for a second. He looks around, but cannot see anybody else.

He knows what her job is.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd she was never in danger to get hurt?\u201d he asks her instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Sir, not for a second.\u201d Eden answers and bows her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, so I only need to punish the princess for destroying an old piece of furniture that was worth as much as a small car?!\u201d He scratch his head and you can feel your behind itching, expecting to be spanked again. Instead he shakes his head and begins to write down a note.<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I noticed that some girls does not mind to receive a spanking \u2013 I would even say, some girls LIKE to get a spanking.\u201d He grins and gives you the note. \u201cBut I am sure your nanny knows an effective punishment for you, little one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down on the note and see that he asks Rose to pick a punishment for breaking the expensive clock by slipping into it and lying to an adult. Then he ruffles your hair and walk on.<br>\r\nAs soon as he is out of sight your friends come back and surround you. They ask what had happened and you quickly explain it to them.<br>\r\nMerry jumps at you and hugs you tightly. \u201cOh thank you for taking the blame.

I have only seen it once and it included a strange harness that looked\u2026 bizarre.\u201d He shudders all over and you hope that Rose will not punish you like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all walk down the corridor, back to the nursery, but stops outside.<br>\r\n\u201cCome on guys I was hoping to receive a treat very soon, can\u2019t we find a way to get rid of this note? Think about it!\u201d<br>\r\nAll three friend look at you, before they break out laughing. You blush and look at your feet.<br>\r\nJanet is the first to recover and pat your head. \u201cPoor little girl, want to have her kitten scratched.\u201d She giggles; before she notices that she is maybe the only one of you that has the liberty to have naughty fun whenever she wants. But you know that Merry just had her fun and by the lectures  that Willy receive on a regular base \u2013 as Merry has told you \u2013 you know that he manage to cover naughty fun as \u201cwet dreams\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, very funny, I am serious. Can\u2019t we blackmail Mr Harper to make him forget about the note? It will for sure throw me back a few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerry and Willy stare at you in disbelieve.

Susan will take it from Melissa\u2019s nursery. She will enter with an excuse and steal it. Meanwhile, William will look for Mr. Harper and will keep him occupied. Merry, for you I have this task: you must look for a glass and for water. When Susan will return with the sleeping aid, you will have to pour it into the glass. Then, William will try to show something to the Butler, trying to lead him back to the site of the incident. You will then appear, Merry, and you will offer him the glass of water.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou want put him to sleep next to the broken clock?\u201d Willy asks \u201cWhat good will do to Susan?

Well, yes. We were 16, and we were playing tag. It was very funny, since I accidentally fall on Charlotte. We both ended up against a wall, and the ancient mirror on it fall down. We were lucky that we hadn\u2019t hurt ourselves.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd your punishment?\u201d you ask, with a mixed feeling. You are afraid, since her reply would have been valid for you too if you were discovered, but you are also genuinely curious about it.<br>\r\n\u201cMy mom was in the Palace, thanks to heaven.\u201d Rose continues \u201cSo she took care of us instead of Samantha, or I don\u2019t want even imagine what that hag would have done to us.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you mom didn\u2019t punish you?\u201d you ask, almost disappointed.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly.\u201d she replies, giggling a little \u201cI still remember that I had problem sitting down on my diaper for almost two days. And the harness. I will never forget it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe spanked you that hard?\u201d you gulp, but Rose shakes her head.<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all. She used the Naughty Cream.\u201d she says, reaching the wardrobe and taking out a jar of cream. The jar was next to the carpet beater, and you suspect that there is a reason for it.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d you ask. It looks like a normal cream to you.<br>\r\n\u201cThe Naughty Cream.\u201d Rose sighs \u201cThe greatest invention of the old Palace Magician, the grandfather of Amos and Nena. If you put it on a bottom, it will sting for days. Till the effect last, it\u2019s like receiving a spanking for all day long. I don\u2019t like this thing, so I think I\u2019ll never use it. Don\u2019t misunderstand my words, however: if you\u2019ll REALLY deserve it, I will use it.\u201d<br>\r\nYou gulp, then run to Rose and hug her.<br>\r\n\u201cI will not misbehave that much, nanny.\u201d you say, almost sobbing.<br>\r\nShe hugs you back, whispering \u201cOh, cutie. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be on your best behaviour.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, aware that you are lying to her. You don\u2019t like this sensation. You feel like if you\u2019re betraying her trust. And the thought to have possibly ruined the relationship between Mr. Harper and Mrs. Spencer hits your conscience much harder than a spanking.<br>\r\n\u201cNanny Rose.\u201d you say, beginning to cry \u201cI\u2019m a bad girl.\u201d<br>\r\nShe ruffles your hair, saying \u201cCome on, princess. I know about your locked plastic pants. It\u2019s not a thing you should be to ashamed of.\u201d<br>\r\nYou wants to tell her everything, from the moment you leaved the nursery till now, but you can\u2019t do that. You\u2019re too afraid that she will not trust you anymore if she discovers it. She will not discover what you did, and everything will be fine. This is what you think.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you mad at me?\u201d you ask, trying to stop your tears.<br>\r\n\u201cFor going to Melissa instead of asking me? No, I\u2019m not mad. Only a little disappointed.\u201d she says, still ruffling your hair \u201cBut it\u2019s my fault. I didn\u2019t notice that you were that wet because I got distracted talking about the party.\u201d<br>\r\nYou hide your face in her boson, while calming yourself down.<br>\r\nRose gently lifts you up, putting you in your high-chair. She then spoon feed you and gives you your bottle of milk. Once finished, she gives you a kiss on the head and puts you next to the crib. She removes your onesie and puts in a romper. Then, she puts you in the crib.<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight, princess.\u201d she says.<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight, nanny Rose.\u201d you reply.<br>\r\nOnce she has turned the light off and leaved the room, you hug Mister Rabbit very tightly and whisper to him \u201cAm I a bad girl, Mister Rabbit? I should tell Rose about what happened? After all the problem we got through to not being punished? Oh? Do you think so? I agree. Thank you, Mister Rabbit.\u201d<br>\r\nAnd you fall asleep.<br>\r\nThe next morning, you feel an hand on your shoulder.<br>\r\n\u201cTen more minutes, please.\u201d you reply, without opening your eyes.<br>\r\nThe hand insists, and you hear a familiar voice saying \u201cCome on, princess. You cannot sleep all day.\u201d<br>\r\nYou open your eyes, and you see Queen Charlotte bent over your crib, touching you to wake you up.<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Susan.\u201d she says, smiling \u201cHow do you feel today?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Charlotte.\u201d you tell her \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you.\u201d<br>\r\nShe lifts you out of the crib, putting you on the changing table. Rose is nowhere to be found.<br>\r\n\u201cUmh, Charlotte? Where is my nanny?\u201d you ask, a little worried.<br>\r\nThe queen removes your romper, unlocks and removes the plastic pants and begins to remove your diaper, wet and messy after the night, saying in a flat tone \u201cOh, I fired her. I don\u2019t like how she was raising you.\u201d<br>\r\nYou turn crimson, and in a fit of rage you yell \u201cYou fired Rose?! How could you?!\u201d<br>\r\nBut, after an instant, you hear someone knocking at the door. Not the nursery\u2019s main door, but the bathroom\u2019s door.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, very funny, your majesty. Now open this door.\u201d  you hear. It\u2019s clearly Rose, and is in the bathroom.<br>\r\nThe Queen giggles, then says \u201cOh, you can wait here a little longer while I change the princess.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCharlotte!\u201d you exclaim, surprised \u201cThat is naughty!\u201d<br>\r\nShe giggles again, finishing your change. She helps you coming down from the changing table, then she goes to the bathroom door and unlocks it.<br>\r\nRose comes out, takes the queen by a wrist and gives her a loud smack on the bottom.<br>\r\n\u201cOuch!\u201d the queen cries \u201cRosie! I\u2019m the Queen, now! You cannot do that!\u201d<br>\r\nShe called her Rosie instead of Rose. You catch that is probably the nickname they used when they were kids.<br>\r\n\u201cI can always report this to nanny Samantha, Lotty.\u201d Rose replies, giggling \u201cOr I can tell it to mommy.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, please.\u201d Charlotte says \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone! Not to aunty Juniper and especially not to nanny Samantha!\u201d<br>\r\nAfter this, the two women both burst out laughing. You laugh too.<br>\r\nThe Queen ruffles you hair, saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I couldn\u2019t resist the temptation. You were really mad at me for a moment, weren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, blushing \u201cRose is my nanny. I wouldn\u2019t have forgave you if you would have fired her.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it, really.\u201d Charlotte says \u201cI want your childhood to be a little happier than mine.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut why your parents hired a nasty nanny like Samantha?\u201d you ask, curious about it.<br>\r\n\u201cShe was very loyal to them, so they trusted her.\u201d the Queen explains \u201cBut when I was young, the country had both a king and a queen, so my mother was used spending more time with me than the time I spend now with you (and I\u2019m sorry about it, really). And there was aunty Juniper. I was used to call her that. She\u2019s Rose mom. She was (and still is) an housewife, so she had time to raise both of us. Those are the main reasons. If I had to spend too much time with Samantha, my mother would have fired her, I\u2019m sure of it. That is the reason I didn\u2019t have a bad childhood.\u201d<br>\r\nShe looks at Rose, concluding \u201cAnd the fact that I had and still have a wonderful friend.\u201d<br>\r\nRose bows, giggling. Then, she takes out your breakfast, while the queen says \u201cI have to go, now.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I am invited, you are invited and we can bring one additional person.\u201d<br>\r\nYou smile at Rose, but then you feel sad right away. \u201cOnly one? So it is either Janet or Rose? Or one William or Meredith? Why can\u2019t I bring more than one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen shrugs and bends down to look you straight in the eyes. \u201cWe need to ask if Janet would be allowed at all. She is not a citizen of Calonia. For William and Meredith I can tell you that they will not come, I am very sorry. Prime Minister Kent is invited PLUS one as well and she will not pick one of her kids while the other has to stay behind. I am sure she will pick a handmaid of her Secretary to come with her. So it is either Janet or Rose.\u201d She gives you a quick kiss on the forehead and turns to leave, but you grab her hand and hold her back.<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you take Rose and I take Janet? That would solve the issue.\u201d You beg, with puppy eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess don\u2019t!\u201d Rose scolds you and pulls you back. \u201cDon\u2019t blackmail the Queen that is not fair. She can take whoever she wants and I will understand it, when she takes her handmaid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 but I don\u2019t want anybody else to change me. That is embarrassing and the food \u2013 oh, can I sit at the big table with all you adults??\u201d Rose and the queen giggles, but then the Queen shakes her head.<br>\r\n\u201cI am sorry little one, but as far as I know the Agenda foresees that we will have music and fun from 1700 to 2100. Then the kids are separated, feed and put to bed, while the adults have the big banquette and eat and celebrate until midnight, before we dance and celebrate more.\u201d<br>\r\nShe smiles and is obviously looking forward to it, but for you it sound unfair.<br>\r\n\u201cBut I want to eat with you as well! I want to dance as well and I want to stay up all night!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want a lot little one, but you are just a child and you will be treated like the other children as well. You will be feed, changed into romper and put to bed. That is the tradition. In the morning you get picked up by Rose, no matter if Rose was part of the Party or not.\u201d The Queen explains patiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBUT THAT IS NOT FAIR!\u201d You stomp your feet and fold your arms in front of your chest. Queen Charlotte sighs and shakes her head. Then she looks at Rose: \u201cCan you take care of her, I have to go now.\u201d And she turns around and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO! I WAS NOT DONE!!\u201d You shout after her, totally forgetting yourself and behaving like a total brat. Rose picks you up from behind and carries you to her chair, where she takes you over her knees. Very quickly your diaper is at your knees and her hand is turning your behind pink. \u201cPrincess, this is not the way you talk to an adult, especially not the queen. She was very patient and explained everything to you.\u201d She keeps spanking you for a little while, until you start to cry and beg her to stop. Then she pulls your diaper back up and turns you around.<br>\r\nYou almost expect her to breastfeed you again and you are not sure if you are happy of disappointed when she offers you a baby bottle instead.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I was a brat.\u201d You whisper before you start to drink from the bottle. It is formula and you know that you will have some mush as well. When the bottle is finished you are put in the high chair, still only dressed in your diaper. You can see that Rose is not sure if she should put you in a regular onesie or a punishment one, because of your outburst with the queen, so you try to get on her good site. \u201cUhm, you are not lactating anymore?<br>\r\nRose blushes a bit and shakes her head.<br>\r\n\u201cNO little one, I only took the pills once and I do not plan to take them again \u2013 except you want me to.\u201d She looks you in the eyes, but you shake your head.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, the bottle is enough \u2013 but it was not that bad either.\u201d You say and blush again. \u201cI guess the Queen was disappointed when I called you mommy after I nursed from you. But that was a\u2026 reflex, I do not know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose starts to feed you the mush and suddenly giggles.<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I should tell the Queen what happened and she can start to nurse you. Maybe then you call her mommy as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost spit out the mush and shout: \u201cIT IS OUR SECRET! YOU CAN\u2019T TELL HER!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose understands your anger, but still scolds you.<br>\r\n\u201cSusan, stop shouting at adults right away or you wear the paci-gag for the day, I am sure you will not like that! I will not tell her that you nursed on me, but maybe I will suggest that nursing you would help you bonding with her.\u201d She grins and you cannot tell if she is serious or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to eat and when you are finished you ask her in a very low voice: \u201cWill you hate me when I take Janet to the party?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose lifts you from the high chair and gives you a long, thigh hug.<br>\r\n\u201cHush baby, I will never hate you. If you can take Janet, you should do it. We don\u2019t know if she will have a second chance to go there, while you can invite me next year or the year after.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dresses you in a normal onesie, without a lock and with a fairy on the chest, before she let you go. In the hallway you are awaited by Eden.<br>\r\nIt will be a normal day and you will have classes in the afternoon with Miss Spencer. In the morning you can play with Janet, while Merry and Willy have class. So, you look for Janet\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Really? You already completed it twice.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Dark Souls Remastered!\u201d she exclaims, without moving her eyes away from the game \u201cI didn\u2019t have the occasion to play it yet!\u201d<br>\r\nWhile she begins to explain the big differences from the normal version from the remastered one, an explanation that you find completely boring, since you aren\u2019t a serious gamer like her, and you look at Eden. She positioned herself out of the room, next to the door. She leaned her back on the wall, with arms crossed under her chest. She really look intimidating.<br>\r\n\u201cDone!\u201d Janet exclaims, shortly thereafter \u201cJump attack and resin! It always work!\u201d<br>\r\nShe close the game and comes to hug you.<br>\r\n\u201cEverything ok, Susan?\u201d she asks, hugging you.<br>\r\nYou hug her back, replying \u201cI started the day with a morning spanking for having a little outburst. Excluding that, seems that nobody discovered us about the clock or about our plan. And I have a big news for you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhich is?\u201d she asks, letting you go.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you remember the party? The one Mr. Grairven told us about?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I do. I was present when you asked details to Rose, remember? So? Do you have news about it?\u201d she asks back.<br>\r\nYou nod, and say \u201cI have an invitation and I can bring a person with me.\u201d<br>\r\nShe looks sad and, lowering her head, she says \u201cOnly one. I see. I hope you and Rose will have fun.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Janet!\u201d you exclaim \u201cRose will come with me next year. For you, this could be the only occasion to come. I will bring YOU with me.\u201d<br>\r\nShe seems shocked, then smiles and hugs you again.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Susie.\u201d she says, almost sobbing.<br>\r\nAfter she calmed down a little, you leave the room together.<br>\r\n\u201cJanet, can I ask you something?\u201d Eden says to her, catching you both by surprise.<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, Miss Langdon. What is it?\u201d Janet answers, looking at her.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s about your adulthood.\u201d she says \u201cAfter this \u2018vacation\u2019 here, you\u2019ll go back to America, right?\u201d<br>\r\nJanet nods, not sure of where this is going.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I noticed both your attachment to the princess and your clever mind.\u201d Eden says \u201cIf you want, when you turn 18, you can move here in Calonia and begin to train as a Royal Knight.\u201d<br>\r\nYou are surprised, but you like it. Janet eyes are glowing.<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d she exclaims \u201cI\u2019ll have a job!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFirst you must come of age.\u201d the knightess says \u201cThen you\u2019ll have to submit to an hard training. It\u2019s not a game.\u201d<br>\r\nBut Janet nods, with determination. She puts and arm around your shoulder, saying \u201cI will the best knight of Calonia and I will protect you! I promise you this!\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, then look at Eden saying \u201cIs this an idea of yours?\u201d<br>\r\nThe escort nods, replying \u201cYes. Trust me, my lady, I\u2019m not doing her a favour because she is a friend of yours. I really believe she can become a great knightess.\u201d<br>\r\nYou say to yourself, grinning \u201cI\u2019ll have Janet as a knight and for sure Merry as Prime Minister. I\u2019m gonna be a great and happy queen!\u201d<br>\r\nAfter this, you and Janet leave the hallway, with Eden behind you.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat shall we do this morning?\u201d you ask your friend.<br>\r\nShe seems to think to it for a while, then says \u201cWe can play in the garden. A relaxing thing, after the long day you had yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, and you go straight to the garden. Once there, however, the sound of an explosion catches you attention.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d you ask, a little shocked, wetting yourself for the fright. Janet boggled as well, and Eden moved her hand to the gun. The servants in the garden looks around, not knowing what happened.<br>\r\nSuddenly, from beyond a bush, you hear two voices.<br>\r\n\u201cIt worked! It worked!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and it has been for sure heard in the entire Palace, idiot!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, shut up! I\u2019m proud of myself! Maggot!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBedwetter girl!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSpanko!\u201d<br>\r\nEveryone in the garden sigh, including Eden (she removed her hand from the gun). Amos and Nena Campbell. They are arguing again. You are curious of what are they doing in the garden.<br>\r\nYou suddenly see the two of them coming out from behind the bush, and they continue to argue.<br>\r\nTired of it, you go closer to them, and ask Eden \u201cCan you make them stop, please?\u201d<br>\r\nEden go closer to them, and catch them both by their ears with both her hand.<br>\r\n\u201cEnough!\u201d she scolds them \u201cYou may be adults, but I assure you that I will spank you nonetheless if you don\u2019t stop this little show.\u201d<br>\r\nOnce she lets them go, they look at her and point each other with a finger.<br>\r\n\u201cShe started it!\u201d Amos exclaims, and at the exact same time, almost synchronized, Nena exclaims \u201cHe started it!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cAnd I finish it.\u201d Eden concludes \u201cCan you please explain the explosion?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course!\u201d Nena says aloud, with the tone of a person that forgot she has just been scolded \u201cI was testing my latest invention!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I was trying to keep it under control. But I failed.\u201d Amos adds.<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a complete success!\u201d Nena continues, completely ignoring her brother \u201cCome to see!\u201d<br>\r\nShe takes you by your wrist and lead you behind the bush. There, you see a small pool of yellow liquid on the grass, and broken glasses scattered all around.<br>\r\n\u201cUmh ... so?\u201d you ask, not sure of what is it.<br>\r\n\u201cThis, princess, is artificial pee!\u201d she explains, excited \u201cIn adding the right chemical elements, I managed to create it!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you are deliberately ignoring the fact that the test tube exploded in your hand in doing so.\u201d Amos intervenes.<br>\r\n\u201cDetails. It\u2019s not yet perfect, that\u2019s all.\u201d she replies.<br>\r\nEden sighs, and intervenes too \u201cI think this is your dumbest invention ever. Artificial pee? Why it would be useful?\u201d<br>\r\nNena swells her chest, saying proudly \u201cSpankings are overrated. With this, you can make your child spend his time in a wet diaper, even if he doesn\u2019t need to pee. It\u2019s far better punishment method.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI still think spankings work better.\u201d Amos adds.<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t contain a laugh, and the same it\u2019s true for Janet. Eden, instead, sighs again, asking \u201cAnd why you were testing it in the garden?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat was my idea.\u201d Amos replies, proudly \u201cSince I was certain that something would have gone wrong, I didn\u2019t want the substance all around the laboratory.

Sure she has a benefit with her thin training pants, but by now you are used to your extra padding and can run around very quickly. From playing catch to jumping over the stones in the pond you finish \u2013 a bit out of breath \u2013 with watching butterflies and other insects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end you sit down on a bench and make a face: \u201cI need a bath.\u201d You sigh and Janet giggles.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, does the baby need to ask her nanny to be washed?!\u201d she tease and tick out her tongue.<br>\r\nYou do the same and grin, but then you see Miss Spencer walking into the garden.<br>\r\nThe usually smiling woman looks quit sad and immediately you feel guilty and poke Janet in the site.<br>\r\n\u201cLook at her, I think she is the real victim of our little trick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet smiles weakly, but then shakes her head.<br>\r\n\u201cI would like to agree, but have you seen Mr. Harper lately? He looks much worse. I could bet that he is two inch shorter now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo they had a fight?\u201d You ask, feeling even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe had throwed his stuff out of her room and avoid him wherever she can. When I had dinner yesterday the maids where talking about it. She was furious that he was drinking again.\u201d Janet says and quickly added: \u201cHe, I am feeling bad as well, but we did it for Meredith and William and if we row back now it will help nobody.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about this for a long time until you response:<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to do something. Either we tell them the truth and beg for forgiveness or we try to get them back together one way or the other. I just do not know how\u2026 .\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet beside sighs and shrugs as well: \u201cI never had to bring people back together.\u201d Suddenly she freeze and look around the garden, to make sure that nobody can listen to her, but you. \u201cWhatever we do, we should do it, before the spanko-maid breaks down and talks about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe spanko\u2026 oh, the red-head. Fuck I have not thought about her. Have you seen her since then?\u201d You whisper back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t, but as I said, we should be active before she talks. As ad as Miss Spencer looks, that maid will feel bad as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head and the two of you go back to the nursery. You like to have a bath before dinner and see if you can ask Rose for an advice. In front of the nursery Janet leaves you and you enter alone.<br>\r\n\u201cRose, can I ask you something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose comes closer and grins: \u201cYou want a bath, little one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush and sniff at your armpits: \u201cIs it that bad?? We were playing\u2026 but that is not what I want to ask, at least not the only thing. Uhm\u2026 Have you ever tried to bring a couple back together after they had a fight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose takes your hand, guides you to the changing table and starts to strip you down to your birth suit. \u201cNo, I never tried that. Normally they either fix it themselves or\u2026 not. Are you talking about Miss Spencer and Mr Harper?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go pale and forget to breathe for a second: \u201cYou heard about it as well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods and lifts you into the bath tub, which is already half way full and still fills with warm water.<br>\r\n\u201cI guess everybody heard about it. The maids and nannies are one big community. Nothing stays a secret for a long time. So you try to fix their relationship? That is so nice of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFilled with guilt you nod, but feel a tear run down your face. Quickly you slide under the surface and hide it from Rose.

I must make things right ... without being punished, if possible.\u201d you think.<br>\r\nRose finishes to wash you, than leads you out of the bathtub, saying sweetly \u201cPrincess, I didn\u2019t mind washing you, because you really needed it. But normally a bath would be given before bedtime, not before lunch. So please, try to stay more clean in the morning from now on.\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, realizing that you\u2019ll have your lesson with Mrs. Spencer after your nap. You nod, and Rose lead you to the changing table. After diapering you, she puts you in a romper.<br>\r\nShe smiles at you, and takes you to her chair. She sits on it and pats her lap.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, nanny, not a spanking.\u201d you beg her.<br>\r\nShe look confused, and say \u201cPrincess, I want to give you your bottle. You didn\u2019t do anything for getting a spanking. Or do you know something I don\u2019t? Uh?\u201d<br>\r\nYou go pale and immediately sit on her lap, saying \u201cNo at all. I was afraid you\u2019d give me a spanking for the bath thing.\u201d<br>\r\nShe sighs, replying \u201cPrincess, I may be strict, but I don\u2019t enjoy punish you. Getting a little dirty isn\u2019t a thing worth a punishment, at most a scolding.\u201d<br>\r\nShe gently puts the bottle full of formula in your mouth, and you begin to nurse from it. The thought of Rose nipples crosses your mind, but you manage to pull it off.<br>\r\nOnce finished, Rose cuddles you a little, then puts you in the crib.<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I will not be changed after the nap, right?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\nShe nods, replying \u201cYou just got changed, princess. I will change you again before bedtime, after dinner.\u201d<br>\r\nYou hug Mister Rabbit, while Rose puts a pacifier in your mouth.<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem really stressed about something.\u201d she gently explains, doing it \u201cTry to relax, little one. The pacifier will help you.\u201d<br>\r\nShe rubs your hair and leaves, after having turned the lights off.<br>\r\nYou fall asleep, but you have a dream about the Butler being kicked out from Mrs. Spencer room.<br>\r\nWhen your naptime is over, you are awakened by Rose.<br>\r\n\u201cGood afternoon, Susan.\u201d she greets you, removing your pacifier with a smile on her face.<br>\r\nHer kindness makes you feel even worse. For what you did, you should be treated sternly, and not kindly. You\u2019d really want to confess everything, now. But Janet is right: doing it will only have all the four of you punished for breaking the clock, having lied, getting the Butler in trouble, stealing the sleeping aid and stealing the wine. You don\u2019t know what punishment you can receive with so many serious misdeeds, and you\u2019d like to stay in your blessed ignorance about it.<br>\r\nNo, you need to endure it and work to make them back together. This is the best thing to do. You think about the red haired maid. You should do it before she breaks down, or you could directly ask for help to her. After all, she respects you. You yet have to think about her involvement.<br>\r\nThis train of thoughts is interrupted when Rose takes you out from your crib and removes your romper, putting you in a really embarrassing dress.<br>\r\nIt\u2019s a Japanese typical kindergarten uniform. It\u2019s composed of a light-blue smock, a short black skirt that comes out a little from the smock (the smock is quite long, and covers almost entirely your butt), a pair of white socks that almost reach your knees and a pair of white shoes. She puts a yellow hat over your head and puts a yellow school backpack over your shoulders. As a finishing touch, she pins a cat-like sticker over your smock, with the sentence \u201cMy name is Susan. Princess in training.\u201d written on it.<br>\r\nRose then gently pats your padded bottom, saying \u201cNow you\u2019re ready for school, little one.\u201d<br>\r\n \u201cNanny Rose!\u201d you exclaim, blushing while looking yourself at the mirror \u201cI\u2019m not a kindergartener! And I\u2019m not Japanese, either.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, someone knows what she is wearing.\u201d she giggles.<br>\r\nYou blush, admitting \u201cI was used to watch a lot of anime.\u201d<br>\r\nShe pats your hat, saying \u201cIf you want to watch something, you need only to ask. We can easily recover the DVD or Blu-ray box set of your favourite anime series.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHave you something already?\u201d you excitedly ask her, completely forgetting your dress.<br>\r\nShe shakes her head, saying \u201cNothing from Japanese animation, I\u2019m afraid. But I\u2019m sure to have seen somewhere in the Palace the complete collection of the Disney Princesses DVD.\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush even deeper, replying \u201cThanks. I\u2019m okay.\u201d<br>\r\nYou greet her and open the door to leave, but the nanny stops you.<br>\r\n\u201cNot until Miss Langdon is here, princess.\u201d she says.<br>\r\nYou sigh and wait. After less than a minute, Eden comes. She doesn\u2019t make any comment about your kindergarten dress, and you begin to walk to reach Mrs. Spencer office, hoping that only few maids will see you dressed like this.<br>\r\n\u201cEden, do I should feel bad for what I did to the Butler?\u201d you ask to your escort.<br>\r\nShe shrugs, replying \u201cYou did something bad to another person for your personal gain. Yes, you should feel bad. However, tell everything now would be meaning getting all of your friends in trouble too.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you already know it.\u201d she simply replies.<br>\r\nYou nod, saying \u201cI must get them back together, without being punished.\u201d<br>\r\nEden gives you a weak smile, and says \u201cThat would be the best solution for everyone. The Queen will not punish Mr. Harper for a single trouble, you four all get away unpunished, and Mr. Harper and Mrs. Spencer will be together and happy again.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod again, determined. After the lesson (and after taking the teacher\u2019s note to Rose) you\u2019ll speak with Janet, Merry and Willy, and together you\u2019ll manage to create a plan.<br>\r\nJust outside of the classroom, Janet is waiting for you. <br>\r\nShe grins, saying \u201cI didn\u2019t know we were held back to preschool. Have you packed an Onigiri for your afternoon snack?\u201d<br>\r\nYou stick your tongue at her, making her giggle. You enter together, while Eden waits at the door, like usual. You would be happy to see Mrs. Spencer instead of Mr. Grairven, but the sad look on her face ruins the moment.<br>\r\nMrs. Spencer ...</span></div></div>",

It is already afternoon, have you overslept and just got up? You have a carefree life, don't you princess? The biggest challenge you face is \"is my diaper wet enough to ask for a change?\".\" She monks you and Janet can not hold back a little giggle.<br>\r\nBut a look from Miss Spencer makes Janet shut up right away.<br>\r\n\"Sit down and read chapter 4 and 5 in your history books. You have 10 minutes.\" She says and sits down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that her dress is skintight and that she is not wearing \"Protection\" any longer. You are just not sure if that is because her bladder infection is finally cured or because of the broken relationship with Mr. Harper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing deeply you take your history book and flip through the chapters. Each one has ten pages, without big pictures or anything that would make it faster to read through them. You raise your hand to point out, that you would need more time... and wait... and wait.<br>\r\nFinally you just speak up: \"Miss Spencer, could we have more time for the reading, because.. \". You start, but she interrupts you.<br>\r\n\"If it is too much to read you should not waste time talking, especially not without being asked. 5 demerits!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp hard and look over to Janet, who tries to read as fast as possible. Maybe she had made the riser decision - as so often. You instead, try to argue for more time: \"Mut Miss Spencer, more than 20 pages in 7 minutes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has been 10 minutes, but you prefer to fight with me and talk back instead of doing what you are told. 5 demerits and you suck your thumb until the time is over.\" Miss Spencer demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? But that is bad for the teeth... .\" Janet pokes you with her elbow and raise her brow and you shut up, but it is too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talking back, still? 10 demerits for that!\" Miss Spencer barks, she is in a horrible mood and you have to pay for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to read, but barely make it through the first chapter when she get up and take Janet's and your book away. Then she asks questions about the text and Janet is able to answer 6 of ten. You instead fail after the third and can only guess with the next questions, since you haven't had time to read the text to be able to answer correct.<br>\r\n\"7 demerit points for the wrong answers and 5 for not sucing your thumb as I told you. Did you had a messy diaper today, princess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised you shake your head: \"No Miss Spencer, is that an issue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe your blocked colon prevents you from learning, here drink this, it will help you with that problem.\" She takes a glass of water and throws a pill in it. The pill dissolves quickly and turns the water pink.<br>\r\n\"It is an invention from the twins. They asked me weeks ago for a review and I think you are the perfect test subject today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the water that has a strawberry smell now and look at Eden. \"Do I have to drink it, if it might be not save?\" You ask her, hoping for a NO.\" Eden comes to you and niffs at the water.<br>\r\n\"I know that - from people talking about it - if is... save, just not the laxative I would prefer.\" She says and goes back to her corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing deeply you drink the water that is even tasting like strawberry, not bad at all.<br>\r\nMiss Spencer grins evil and bitter and continues the lesson, but only five minutes later you feel a little your diaper become warm and wet and a short time later your body gets rid of its waste, without pain and totally without control.<br>\r\n\"This is what it feels like to me incontinent, both ways.\" You think and fiddle on your chair. While your diaper fills a hint of strawberry can be smelled and you wonder how the twins managed that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Spencer is continuing her lecture and quickly change to math, your most hated subject. Today it is extra hard, because you gain one demerit for each wrong answer. Like this you earn the number of 27 demerits within 20 minutes.<br>\r\nFinally it is too much for you and the anger about her unfair treatment breaks out in words: \"Miss Spencer I know you have personal issues with your relationship, but Mr Harper did nothing wrong and it is not fair that we have to suffer under your bad mood.\"<br>\r\nBeside you Janet lift her arms and looks at the ceiling, mouthing \"WHY?\" - while Miss Spencer goes ballistic.<br>\r\n\"HOW DARE YOU TALK ABOUT MY RELATIONSHIP? YOU HAVE NO CLUE WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT! I SUGGEST THAT YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP AND LEAVE ADULT STUFF TO THE ADULTS!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Miss Spencer, I heard that Mr Harper hit his head at the clock and somebody spilled wine on him while he was blocked out.  He loves you.\" You know it is risky to spread a rumour that is so close to the reality, but at some point you have to start project \"re-unification\".<br>\r\nUnfortunately Miss Spencer is not listening - or not ready for new ideas.<br>\r\n\"PRINCESS SUSAN! SHUT UP!\" She barks, rips open the top drawer from her desk and take out a pacifier with a strap.<br>\r\n\"I wanted to get rid of this thing from Mr. Graivren, but now I can use it.\" She says, pushes the foul tasting nipple in your mouth and ties it place with the strap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach for the strap, but the smacs your hands away.<br>\r\n\"You keep sucking on the soapy dummy and learn to be quiet little girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately the lesson is over and you and Janet, followed by Eden leave the room. You feel worrible in your wet and messy diaper - even when you smell like a strawberry cake. You can feel that you are constantly leaking into your diaper and hope that the effect does not last too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of your nursery you meet Willy and Merry. Both are heavy diapered and wear locks on their onesie, presents from the lesson with Miss Spencer. \"Hi Susie, I see it was hard for you as well?!\" Merry sighs and hugs you tightly. \"Hm, but you smell good, what is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet giggles and explains what had happened. Merry blushes and apologise for her words. \"I I would have known that it is your full diaper I would have been more careful.\" She blushes and give your handing diaper a pat with her hand.<br>\r\n\"But I like your uniform.\" She smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush even more and poke Janet in the site to speak for you.<br>\r\n\"I think Susie wants to bring Miss Spencer and Mr Harper back together. She mentioned that it was not Mr Harpers fault. That he knocked his head and that somebody spilled wine on him as a joke. We need to make sure that this rumour spread and find more ways to bring them back together - or you guys will be all incontinent and smell like strawberries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head and look down at your note. You never had 53 demerits, not even with Mr Grairven. You hope that Rose will be generous and accept that you are already punished enough...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m in trouble, am I not?\u201d<br>\r\nThe siblings go pale, and Merry says \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of getting so many demerits. I got 32, and Willy 28, and are the highest number we had ever got. We both got an enema and we were putted in locked punishment clothes with booster pads. And I was spanked too. But isn\u2019t nanny Rose more lenient than nanny Melissa?\u201d<br>\r\nYou shake your head, replying \u201cI got she same punishments as you for the same amount of demerits. I think that the system foresees standard punishments for a specific amount of demerits, and is therefore not at the discretion of the nannies.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet touches her chin, thoughtful, then says \u201cSo, from 0 to 4 demerits, no punishment. From 5 to 10 you get a spanking. From 11 to 20 you get an enema. From 21 to 30 you get the enema plus the public shame, be it the locked onesies or a shameful walk, both of them in booster pads. More than 30, from 31 to 40 I guess, the same than before but plus a spanking. This is what I understood of the demerits system so far. This mean that, if the system goes in a straight line, you can expect different punishments from 41 to 50 and from 51 to 60.\u201d<br>\r\nYou strive for not burst out crying in front of them, and say \u201cRose will kill me!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you should let this run and go to her only for dinnertime.\u201d Janet suggests.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think is a good idea.\u201d Willy intervenes \u201cShe\u2019ll get the punishment for the demerits plus one for not going back immediately if she does that.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s true.\u201d Merry adds \u201cIf she goes now, maybe Rose will not punish her at all.

She takes the sibling and leaves, greeting you. The two Kent are quite fast for someone with all that padding.<br>\r\nYou feel you diaper hanging. You\u2019re wearing a smock and a skirt, with no pants. If it gets any heavier, it may fall down. Not wanting it, you open the nursery\u2019s door.<br>\r\nEden greets you too, and leaves, while you enter alone.<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome back, princess.\u201d Rose greets you, smiling.<br>\r\nYou immediately begin to sob, grasping the note in your hand.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, princess, what\u2019s happened?\u201d she asks, coming closer to hug you.<br>\r\nAs she does that, however, she smells the strange fragrancy coming out from your extremely full diaper.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, are you smelling like strawberries?\u201d Rose asks, surprised.<br>\r\nYou nod, and still sobbing you reply \u201cMrs. Spencer made me drink an invention of the Campbell twins. I can\u2019t control myself. I\u2019m incontinent! And my things smell like this!\u201d<br>\r\nRose cuddles you, saying \u201cHush, princess. I know what are you talking about. The effect will last till tomorrow morning. When you\u2019ll wake up tomorrow, everything will be okay again.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, beginning to calm down a little.<br>\r\n\u201cNow \u2026\u201d she says \u201c\u2026 about your note?\u201d<br>\r\nYou lower your head, giving the note to her. Rose takes it, and you see her going pale.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess!! How did you managed to get 53 demerits?! You should be ashamed of yourself!\u201d she scolds.<br>\r\n\u201cBut nanny Rose! It\u2019s unfair! She was angry on her own and \u2026\u201d you begin to say, but she interrupts you.<br>\r\n\u201cShe was stricter than usual. I get it. However, princess, how much strict a teacher should be its decided only by the teacher himself. I ignored Mr. Grairven note because he paddled you, but this is different.\u201d she explains, still in her scolding tone \u201cYou will be severely punished for this. 53 demerits!! What are you, a donkey?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what will happen now?\u201d you ask, trembling a little.<br>\r\n\u201cFirst, you\u2019ll get out of that diaper. It\u2019s already full.\u201d she takes you to the changing table, removes your clothes and lifts you on it, then removes your diaper.<br>\r\nOnce you are naked, when she is cleaning you, a little jet of pee comes out from your crotch, centering Rose in the face.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m mortified, nanny!\u201d you immediately exclaim, but she sweetly hushes you.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t\u2019 worry, little one.\u201d she says, cleaning her face with a wipe and giggling a little \u201cI know it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d<br>\r\nOnce you\u2019re clean (and you feel your tummy luckily empty), Rose states \u201cFirst of all, I\u2019ll put you in a thick diaper.\u201d<br>\r\nOnce done that, she takes you down from the changing table and makes you lean on it. She unfold the diaper, lowering only the back part of it.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, princess.\u201d she says, while you hear her opening the wardrobe \u201cBut you bottom deserves it.\u201d<br>\r\nThe carpet beater. She uses it 14 times on your buttock, before putting 3 booster pads in your diaper and closing it.<br>\r\n\u201cCome with me!\u201d she orders, taking you with her.<br>\r\nShe puts on you the bib with the words NAUGHTY BABY and the clear and pink plastic pants with the word BRAT printed behind. Apart this and your diaper, you are not wearing anything else.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, nanny!\u201d you cry \u201cI\u2019ve been punished enough!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c53 demerits, princess.\u201d she reminds you, taking out from a drawer something you believed been only a metropolitan legend.<br>\r\n\u201cA dunce hat?!\u201d you exclaim \u201cPlease, no!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHush, princess.\u201d she says \u201cI don\u2019t like this either, but you must learn to behave during schooltime. You don\u2019t get an enema too just because Mrs. Spencer gave you the twin\u2019s creation.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, while she puts the shameful hat on your head. She takes you out from the nursery, and leads you in the garden by your wrist with her right hand, while in the left one she carries papers and a pen.<br>\r\nOnce in the garden, she makes you sit on a bench, giving you the pen and the papers.<br>\r\n\u201cWrite 1000 times: I must behave in class.\u201d Rose commands \u201cAnd with a good calligraphy, or I\u2019ll make you restart again.\u201d<br>\r\nYou gulp, and begin to do what she has said, feeling extremely humiliated.<br>\r\nOne of the maids in the garden giggles, saying \u201cHas the princess been naughty!\u201d<br>\r\nTo your surprise, Rose exclaims \u201cShut up! A comment for anyone of you, and I will report it to the Butler!\u201d<br>\r\nYou smile a little, thinking that this punishment will at least ease your conscience for what have you done to Mr. Harper.<br>\r\nOnce finished, Rose is pleased.<br>\r\nOnce back in the nursery, you are wet and messy. Again. At least, you smell good.<br>\r\n\u201cHush, princess.\u201d Rose says, once alone with you in the nursery \u201cThis is the hardest punishment I think you\u2019ll ever get from me.\u201d<br>\r\nShe tries to look stern, but you see she\u2019s almost crying. She doesn\u2019t like it, it\u2019s quite obvious.<br>\r\nIt\u2019s dinnertime, and Rose \u2026</span></div></div>",

You are already restless and can't wait to be changed into a fresh diaper.<br>\r\nFinally Rose picks you up and lay you on the changing table.<br>\r\n\"Ah, finally!\" You sigh. \"Rose, I can't believe I was in a dirty diaper for the past hours, I am looking forward to a fresh one like crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose freeze and couches. \"I am sorry Susan, but I can't change you. With 53 points that is not an option before tomorrow morning. I even have to give you a final spanking. That is why you are on the changing table.\" She says.<br>\r\nWith your legs high in the air she spanks your messy behind with a paddle.<br>\r\nIt hurts, even through the diaper, but the worst part is the humiliation and the fact that you will stay in that diaper until tomorrow morning.<br>\r\n\"Not fair, not fair, not fair.... \" You whisper by yourself, until Rose silence you with a pacifier, but at least a normal one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou starts to suck on it and find some comfort in it, while Rose picks you up and put you in your crib.<br>\r\nAt least Mr Rabbit is waiting for you and you can hug and cuddle him as much as you like.<br>\r\n\"Good night princess, I will wake you up in the morning and make sure you get cleaned up as soon as possible.\" She looks quit sad and quickly leaves the room.<br>\r\nThe spanking has exhausted you and you fall asleep quickly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs promised Rose wakes you up early and cleans you up. Against her own rules she baths you and make sure every inch of you is clean. She is almost overdoing it and you feel arousal when she wash your behind and crotch - but as professional as she is, Rose makes sure you do not find release.<br>\r\nShe diapers you, feeds you and dress you in a pink onesie with a Pony on the chest. You do not receive a lock and wonder if William and Meredith are as lucky as you, or if Melissa is forcing a lock on them for the next days.<br>\r\n\"That you for not putting a lock on me, Miss Fletcher.\" You thank Rose and she hugs you tightly.<br>\r\n\"Oh, my little girl. Yesterday was horrible and I am as happy as you, that it is over.\" She says and rubs your back<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday is wednesday and you wonder if some preparations for the party have to be made, but since Rose does not mention anything you concentrate on Miss Spencer and Mr Harper.<br>\r\nIn the corridor you meet Eden and to your surprise you find Merry and Willy, next to Janet.<br>\r\n\"Hey gang, no class this morning?\" You ask the \"twins\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are both in punishment onesie with a lock at the collar and look very jealous at your pink pony onesie.<br>\r\n\"No, Miss Spencer has canceled the morning class on short notice and told us we have class together with you later.\"<br>\r\nthat surprises you and you and your friends sneak to Miss Spencers, dorm-room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear her and Mr Harper having a fight behind the door and you don't even need to press your ear against the door to understand them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did nothing wrong - as far as I know. I had a blackout and when I woke up my head was hurting and I sat on the broken clock. I don't remember getting a bottle of wine and I don't remember drinking it. That is the truth!\" He says in a firm voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Ben, how can i believe that? You have been drinking for years and promised me that it is over and then you are found like this.\" Miss Spencer barks at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't you heard the latest rumours? Somebody spilled the vine on me. I haven' measured it, but I had at least half a bottle on my uniform - and as you remember - I never spilled anything when I drank.\" He tries to be funny and you hear Eden behind you sigh. \"Not clever.\" She whispers and quickly steps away from the door. As a royal knight she does not want to be found eavesdropping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES I REMEMBER! You never missed a drop, you made sure to get everything in your mouth.\" Your teacher snaps at him.<br>\r\n\"Who should pour wine on you? Who would do that?? Even the knights are afraid that you spank them!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you should step in now and confess that you did that, because you thought it is funny. You would need to invent something about the origin of the wine, not to endanger Janet, but that is the price you would need to pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you think about this you hear Miss Spencer sigh.<br>\r\n\"Okay okay, I see that you still want me and I have the reputation to be fair.\" William beside you gasps and shakes his head, but you ignore him. Instead you continue to listen at the door.<br>\r\n\"I tend to believe your words if you accept that I will punish you like one of my students.\"<br>\r\nYou clap your hand over your mouth and suppress a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want... WHAT?! YOU want to punish ME? Do you think that is smart little lady.\" Mr Harer says cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After that you can be the grown up again and IF YOU ARE LUCKY I become your little girl again, but that would be AFTER I punish you.\" Miss Spencer says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bite down on your bottom lip. One the one hand you want to see what she has in mind to punish him, on the other hand he is innocent and might not accept her offer. Maybe you really should tell them that you spilled the wine on him... .</span></div></div>",

You\u2019ve done everything so far to protect Janet and the Kent siblings, not only yourself. If he accepts the punishment, everything will be okay. If he doesn\u2019t, you\u2019ll need to come up with a plan. Luckily for you, you have Janet on your side, and maybe you can ask some tips to Eden. You really hope he simply accepts.<br>\r\nBreathless, you wait for Mr. Harper reply.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Elisabeth. I will not submit to it.\u201d he suddenly says, in his stern tone.<br>\r\nYou grit your teeth. Why can\u2019t something be easy for a change?<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d the teacher asks.<br>\r\n\u201cIf I had done something wrong, to get your forgiveness I would accept every punishment, even to get around in the Palace wearing a diaper and nothing else or get spanked by the youngest maid in the Palace.\u201d you hear him state \u201cBut I assure you I am innocent, and I will not let anyone punish me for something I didn\u2019t done. Not even you.\u201d<br>\r\nYou hear Eden sighs again, whispering \u201cHe is a proud man. His greatest strength, but also his greatest weakness.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFine!\u201d Miss Spencer exclaims, angrily \u201cGet out of here! And never show yourself here again!\u201d<br>\r\nYou and you friends decide to leave, to avoid getting caught by him.<br>\r\nOnce away enough, you say to them \u201cDammit. It was so close.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you entered? It was a good opportunity so say something.\u201d Willy says.<br>\r\nJanet shakes her head in your place, replying \u201cNo, without thinking accurately about what to say. A wrong answer to an unexpected question and he would have discovered much more than we want.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo? We let them with her broken relationship?\u201d Merry asks, looking sad about it.<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d you immediately say \u201cMy conscience sting enough. Rather than that, I confess everything!\u201d<br>\r\nYou pause, then add \u201cBut I don\u2019t want that either. So we must come up with a plane to get them together.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSusan, it\u2019s not simple task.\u201d Janet says.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, come one. The Prank Queen doesn\u2019t have a plan?\u201d you tease her.<br>\r\nShe sighs, replying \u201cI\u2019m still thinking about it. Only the four of us aren\u2019t enough, for what I have in mind.\u201d<br>\r\nIn hearing this, you have an enlightenment and exclaim \u201cSamuel, Zoey and Tabitha! They can help us!\u201d<br>\r\nBut Janet shakes her head \u201cYou can invite them to befriend them, it would be funny, but it will not help us. They surely can\u2019t stay in the Palace for long, and plus I don\u2019t trust someone I just met with a complex plan.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUmh \u2026\u201d Merry intervenes \u201c\u2026 who are these people?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cChildren we met in the capital.\u201d you explain \u201cI wanted to invite them in the Palace, so the four of us can befriend them.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cZoey and Tabitha are hot?\u201d Willy asks, but receiving a slap on the bottom from Janet immediately afterward. He doesn\u2019t get a reply.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Willy.\u201d you think \u201cJanet is a jealous person.\u201d<br>\r\nThen you look at your friend, telling her \u201cWe can use the red-haired maid. I mean, she\u2019ll get in trouble too if we are discovered, and she respects me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe spanked you after forcing you to ask for it.\u201d Janet notices.<br>\r\nBut you reply \u201cAnd everything would have ended there, if Mr. Harper wasn\u2019t in the same fucking corridor in the same fucking moment! Think about it. Another maid would have simply informed the Housekeeper, while a footman would have informed the First Footman (I never met him, now that I think about it), and we would have got a severe punishment. She gave us a choice, a choice that gave us the possibility to get a very light punishment. And she gave that choice because she respects me.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet seems convinced, as she states \u201cOk. We can use her. But we\u2019d need someone else. Two other persons at least.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is your plan?\u201d you then ask.<br>\r\nBut Janet makes another sign of denial, saying \u201cI\u2019m still working on it. First, I need to know who we can count on.\u201d<br>\r\nYou think about someone else that would be useful. Not Eden, since she follows you everywhere.<br>\r\n\u201cWe can ask the scientist.\u201d Willy suggests \u201cIf we confess to them, they can help us. I\u2019m sure they are uninterested in our discipline.\u201d<br>\r\nYou shake your head, saying \u201cFor what I saw so far, they are strict disciplinarian, despite their strange attitude. Amos is a spanko, and Nena is always looking for alternative punishments to spanking.\u201d<br>\r\nMerry intervenes too, saying \u201cWe should confess to someone that doesn\u2019t care about discipline, someone that would only have a gain in making things better for the couple. Someone like \u2026\u201d<br>\r\nYou all look at each other, and in the exact same moment you all exclaim \u201cAlice!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWe can convince her quite easily. I\u2019m sure she will be happy to get things better for them, since the Butler mood has repercussion on her work.\u201d Janet says, touching her chin \u201cBut if she doesn\u2019t want to help us, we can easily blackmail her with something that wouldn\u2019t get us in trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOk. The four of us, the red-haired maid and Alice.\u201d you say \u201cWe need another one, right?\u201d<br>\r\nEden sighs, saying \u201cI can ask a favor to a couple of Royal Knights, if your plan requires persons that do small things.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet smiles, saying \u201cPerfect! I will think about a plan today!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhen we will act, big sis?\u201d Merry asks.<br>\r\n\u201cI still don\u2019t have it.\u201d Janet replies \u201cI think I will tell you about it tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, deciding to let her think. You simply play for the rest of the morning, with Janet losing at every game you play because she is concentrating on the plan.<br>\r\nAfter a while, you find yourself in the garden. William is playing in the pond, jumping from a stone to another, while Janet sits under a tree with a thoughtful expression. You and Merry, on the other hand, are sat on a bench together.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame.\u201d Merry says.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n\u201cYou smelled so good yesterday.\u201d she replies, smiling brightly. She really thinks it, she\u2019s not teasing you about it.<br>\r\nYou put an hand on your crotch. Under the onesie, you feel your wet diaper. Doing it, you reply \u201cYeah, now I smell like pee and not like strawberries, but I pee normally and not like an incontinent person or a little toddler without bladder control.\u201d<br>\r\nShe takes your hand and rests hear head over your shoulder, asking \u201cZoey and Tabitha are hot? Or cute?\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, replying \u201cZoey has C-Cup. I would kill for having it. Tabitha has a AA-Cup, but she\u2019s very cute. She\u2019s friendly and I think she\u2019s a bit overactive.\u201d<br>\r\nMeredith blushes, saying a little hesitant \u201cBut you still \u2026 prefer me, right?\u201d<br>\r\nYou hesitate yourself. This feeling is something still strange for you.<br>\r\nBut then you reply \u201cYou\u2019re special for me, Merry.\u201d<br>\r\nMerry hugs you, rubbing her head against your cheek.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll always be my princess.\u201d she says.<br>\r\nThinking that the atmosphere is getting too sugary, you say \u201cAnd you\u2019ll always be my little girl afraid of the children-eater toilet.\u201d<br>\r\nShe poke your side, giggling and saying \u201cI\u2019m still sure of it. Nanny Melissa says that if you\u2019re not of age, the toilet may eat you. That is why they invented the diapers. To keep us safe.\u201d<br>\r\nYou\u2019re 100% sure that is not the reason for inventing diapers, but you decide to not break her illusions. But something else comes in your mind, since she is so na\u00efve.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you believe in Santa Klaus, Merry?\u201d you ask her.<br>\r\nSurprisingly, she nods, replying \u201cOf course. Santa delivers presents to good children, while Krampus delivers spankings to naughty children.\u201d<br>\r\nYou resist the urge to laugh, and say instead \u201cHave you ever been spanked by Krampus?\u201d<br>\r\nShe shakes her head, replying \u201cNo. But once he left a note to nanny Melissa. She showed it to me. He wrote her to punish me for been a brat during the year, since he was too busy to do it himself.\u201d<br>\r\nYou know for sure that Melissa had wrote it herself, but once again you decide to shut up.<br>\r\nYou see that is lunchtime, so you greet your friend and go back to your nursery. Once at the door, you hear Rose talking with the Queen herself.<br>\r\nYou \u2026</span></div></div>",

I mean... I know I am not her mother but... I would really like to get closer to her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bite down on your bottom lip and feel sorry for the Queen. It is not her mistake either and you HAVE a real mother \u2013 she can only not be in Calonia \u2013 but she would like to get closer to the Queen as well. Maybe she should call her mommy, even just to make her happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose starts to say something, but Eden interrupts your eavesdropping and cough.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, normally I do not say anything, but it is lunchtime for you and for me as well. If you do not mind I suggest that you enter the nursery and the two of us can eat something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hiss at Eden to be quiet, but when you press your ear at the door again Rose has already finished her sentence and hear steps coming closer.<br>\r\nQuickly you open the door and see the surprised face of the Queen, that was just about to open the door.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hello Susan, are you coming for lunch? I helped Rose to prepare the bottles for you.\u201d She smiles weakly, but then walks on. \u201cI am sorry, I have an appointment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run to Rose and hug her. \u201cHi nanny Rose, did the Queen really helped with my lunch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose giggles and lift you into your high chair. \u201cYes she did, she mixed the formula and even prepared a second bottle for her growing princess.\u201d You smile weakly, knowing that you will be a very wet princess later one, but you still appreciate the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose feed you both bottles in the high chair and you wonder why you can not sit on her warm lap, but maybe she feels quietly about your good relationship and holds you on distance for the moment.<br>\r\nAfter you are feed the two bottles Rose puts you down in your crib and give you Mr Rabbit to cuddle. She lowers the light and wishes you a good sleep. You wonder what you part of the discussion of Rose and the Queen you have missed, but you only think about it for a short time, before you fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up your diaper is already wet and you ask Rose to change you.<br>\r\n\u201cLittle princess, what have we agreed on, based on your diaper changes?\u201d Rose lectures you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat I will not ask to be changed, except I am at the leaking point?!\u201d You sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly. And be smart. When I change you now I cannot change you after your lesson \u2013 and depending on Miss Spencer's mood, you will like a change after class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and suddenly feel much less enthusiastic to continue your day. You really hope that Janet has developed a good plan  - and that it will work out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are dressed in a new onesie with a smiling sun on the chest and meet Eden, Janet, William and Meredith in the hallway.<br>\r\n\u201cHi! Please tell me your plan is ready to be executed, I am not sure if I can stand a grumpy Miss Spencer for the second day in a row. According to the fight she had with Mr Harper she might be in an even worse mood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilly and Merry, both in locked punishment onesie nod eagerly and all of you, even Eden look at Janet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet smiles weakly and says...</span></div></div>",

So, you must try to earn lee demerits possible during today\u2019s lesson.\u201d she says \u201cAfter it, I will explain my plan.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you say it right now?\u201d Willy asks.<br>\r\nShe shakes her head, replying \u201cYou need to concentrate on the lesson. For now, I can only anticipate you that we will give the Palace a ghost to catch.\u201d<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t know what she is talking about, but you all decide to trust her, and go to class.<br>\r\nYou knock at the class door, and you enter as you hear \u201cCome in.\u201d<br>\r\nInside the classroom, Miss Spencer is waiting for you.<br>\r\n\u201c1 demerit to any of you for coming late.\u201d she says, while you all go to your seat. Eden waits at the door, of course.<br>\r\n\u201cGood start.\u201d you think, ironically.<br>\r\nThe lesson is hard to follow. You all try your best to don\u2019t irritate the already angry teacher. You all get demerits for mistakes, but you all stay in your best behavior, without giving her reasons to scold you. You don\u2019t talk back and passively accept every critic from her, always waiting to be called for saying something.<br>\r\nYou must however focus really hard to don\u2019t intervene when she says to Merry \u201cMeredith, no one will ever love you if you stay that shy.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut \u2026 but \u2026\u201d she says, before starting to cry.<br>\r\n\u201cSee? Do you think someone would want a crybaby like you?\u201d she says.<br>\r\n\u201cEnough!\u201d you burst \u201cThis is unfair, Miss Spencer! You can be strict as you want, but you can\u2019t make a girl cry with comments like those!\u201d<br>\r\nYou expect her to give her a lot of demerits for this outburst, but instead she says \u201cVery good. I was really asking myself you four were yourselves or a bunch of little robots.\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, realizing that she may be much stricter when angry, but never completely unfair.<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Merry, stop crying.\u201d she says \u201cI was only joking. You are a beautiful girl.\u201d<br>\r\nShe tries to calm down, and you rub her back.<br>\r\nThe lesson continues, and at the end of it Miss Spencer call you all at her desk.<br>\r\n\u201cYou must focus much harder.\u201d she says, sternly and in an angry tone \u201cYou all get an extra demerit for earning so much demerits.\u201d<br>\r\nYou resist the urge to tell her to stick those in her butt, and you listen as she gives you your note.<br>\r\n\u201cFor William, we have 18 demerits. For Meredith we have 11 demerits and for the princess only 7.\u201d she explains.<br>\r\nYou feel lucky. Ok, for behaving perfectly good they are a lot, but it\u2019s still better than you expected. Maybe even because she gave demerits to three person and not only to you, so she hadn\u2019t focused on you only.<br>\r\nYou greet her and leave the room, don\u2019t want to irritate her further.<br>\r\n\u201c11 demerits!\u201d Merry cries \u201cI\u2019ll get another enema, and after behaving perfectly.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, me too.\u201d Willy adds, quite sad \u201cAnd we got the maintenance spanking before the lesson. I really hope your plan is good, Janet.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet nods, saying \u201cIt is. Now I will tell it you.\u201d<br>\r\nYou think about the spanking Rose is going to give you for your 7 demerits, but then you focus on Janet, saying \u201cWe\u2019re listening.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo \u2026\u201d she says \u201c\u2026 who would have a gain in damaging the Butler\u2019s reputation?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUmh \u2026 no one?\u201d you say.<br>\r\nShe shakes her head, replying \u201cTry harder, Susie. What would have happened to you if Mr. Harper wasn\u2019t there to save you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRichard would have beaten me like a drum and now you would be able to cook eggs on my behind.\u201d you say to her \u201cBut what this has to do with\u2026 wait a minute! You want to blame Richard for the prank?!\u201d<br>\r\nJanet giggles, replying \u201cYeah. We can adjust everything and even stain Richard\u2019s reputation.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous, Janet.\u201d you say \u201cYou don\u2019t know him.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI agree.\u201d Eden adds \u201cJanet, attacking lord Richard\u2019s reputation can put you all in serious trouble, much serious than getting a punishment from the nannies.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOnly if he discovers it.\u201d she replies, smiling \u201cBut what I have in mind won\u2019t leave the Palace and will not hurt is public image. That would be interesting, but I agree too that would be too dangerous.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOk, big sis.\u201d Merry says \u201cCan you give us the details?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNot now.\u201d she replies \u201cAfter your punishments we will come back together to discuss it. During your trials, I will gather Alice and the maid with red hair. We will all meet together in my room.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, and the group scatters. You go straight to the nursery, hoping for a quick thing. Eden waits you out, while you enter.<br>\r\nRose greets you, saying \u201cWelcome back, princess.\u201d<br>\r\nYou run to hug her, saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I got some demerits. Can you punish me, please?\u201d<br>\r\nYou really hope to accelerate the process, this way.<br>\r\nShe looks surprised. Without knowing what to say, she takes the note, then sighs in relief.<br>\r\n\u201c7 demerits? A quite normal number, I must say.\u201d she states.<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t admit that getting so few demerits cost you a lot and wanted to break everything after the lesson to take out your stress.<br>\r\n\u201cRose! Just give me my spanking!\u201d you say, freeing on her your frustration.<br>\r\nRose gives you a slap on the bottom, replying sternly \u201cPrincess, calm down and I\u2019ll use the hand. Insist again and I will take the carpet beater.\u201d<br>\r\nYou instantly calm yourself, saying \u201cSorry, Miss Fletcher.\u201d<br>\r\nShe nods, then takes you to the changing table. She removes your onesie and your wet and dirty diaper, cleaning you up. Once you\u2019re cleaned, but still naked, she lifts your leg in diaper position, and gives you a good amount of smacks, turning your behind red quite fast. Luckily, she is only using her hand.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, little one, but I you need what is going to come.\u201d she says.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking abo\u2026 OUCH!\u201d<br>\r\nBefore you can finish your sentence, she gave you four hard smacks on the upper thighs, making you gasp in pain.<br>\r\n\u201cYou must remember to be polite, little princess.\u201d she explains, putting you in a fresh diaper after rubbing a good amount of baby oil and used a good amount of baby powder.<br>\r\nShe takes you down from the changing table and puts you back in your onesie, letting you go to reach Janet.<br>\r\nYou go to meet her.

Willy and Merry still look like they have been crying minutes before and the dropping diapers tell you that they have suffered under another enema by Melissa. You really hope to bring the teacher and the butler back together \u2013 for your own sake, but mostly for the \u201ctwins\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet lifts her hand like a real leader and everybody quiet down.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for coming everybody. We have an issue that requires a combined effort to be solved. Because of a great misunderstanding of the situation we created some\u2026 trouble that finally leaded to a break in the relationship of Miss Spencer and Mr Harper. We feel responsible to fix this and - as I said \u2013 we need your help for this.\u201d<br>\r\nEverybody is nodding their heads and you understand that Janet has already talked to the \u201cNew\u201d Team-Members.<br>\r\n \u201cThe plan is this: Since we cannot confess what the real cause was, we need to blame it on somebody externally and nobody is more suitable for this than Lord Richard. He wanted to beat the princess up before, what was prevented by our dear Mr Harper. We will use this to set crumbs that will show everybody that Lord Richard hired somebody to trick Mr Harper to damage his reputation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait for somebody to speak up and question her, but to your surprise everybody agrees with her plan. It is obviously that nobody likes Lord Richard and has no issues with blaming him. Still you feel the need to say something: \u201cI\u2026 I really want to thank you all for your support. I know this is not the most elegant way to handle the situation, but in the end it will help us a lot and since we only spread rumours and not blame Lord Richard with hard facts he cannot do anything about it.\u201d<br>\r\nYou smile weakly and feel really uncomfortable with all eyes on you; therefore you are happy when Janet takes over again.<br>\r\n\u201cEvery single one of you will spread one information only. Do not overdo it, just stick to the fact you pretend to have observed, the rest will be handled by me.\u201d The turns to the knights: \u201cYou will report to your boss that you have seen a suspicious, new, tall footman. You have followed him during your shift but could not find evidence that he did something forbidden. You took over shifts from each other and when the second shift took over you found the unconscious Mr Harper. Since then you have not seen the footman anymore.\u201d The tow knights nod their heads.<br>\r\nThen Janet turns to the foxy maid: \u201cYou found a bottle of wine missing from a top shelf in the cellar, which will eliminate kids and small persons from the list.\u201d<br>\r\nTo the laundry maid she says: \u201cYou will report that you basically washed a whole bottle of wine out of Mr Harper\u2019s uniform and that it is basically not logic that he got drunk from a little sip.\u201d<br>\r\nTo William and Meredith she says: \u201cYou got a hard part: Take away the sleeping pills and hide them somewhere, where they can be found easily. Be careful that Melissa does not find you and pretend to know nothing when she find the medicine missing.\u201d Willy nods firmly, but Merry sobs and looks uneasy. You go to her and hug her tightly: \u201cHush baby, it will be over soon. No more stress and no more enema\u2019s for cosmic high demerits.\u201d You whisper to her and she hugs you back tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Princess will report that she broke the clock while she played and has no clue why the butler was sitting in the pieces.\u201d Janet continues and you go pale. \u201cWHAT? Can\u2019t we say that the footman broke the clock?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet thinks about it and then shrugs: \u201cIt would be better if you did the damage, but we can try to say it was the footman. Still, play B will be that you confess the broken clock.\u201d<br>\r\nYou smile weakly, hoping you can avoid that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will walk around the palace and collect all the information like Detective Conan.\u201d She grins and waits. When nobody smiles or says anything she sighs and explains: \u201cI will play detective and report to The Queen, Mr Harper and Miss Spencer. Then it is up to them to believe it or not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody nods and spread out. You are left behind with Janet. \u201cAnd now?\u201d You ask.<br>\r\nJanet shrugs: \u201cI need to wait a bit,\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Oh, Janet?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d she says.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good plan.\u201d you say to her \u201cI\u2019d really like to be smart as you are.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet puts her hands on your shoulders, saying \u201cOh, Susie, stop that. I\u2019m just good in making pranks and plans, I\u2019m not smarter than you.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, trying to tell her that you believe in her words. It\u2019s true that you are comforted by them, but you still think that she is really smart.<br>\r\nYou hug her, and she rubs your back. She then leads you to the other side of her room, while you look at Eden. She is positioned outside of the room, in her intimidating pose.<br>\r\nJanet takes you at her wardrobe, opening it. She takes out a beautiful dress.<br>\r\n\u201cMom packed this for great occasions. I\u2019m glad she did, or I would have used the new one.\u201d she explains, showing the dress to you. <br>\r\nIt\u2019s really beautiful. It\u2019s a black long dress, with golden decorations at the height of the chest (you are sure it will exalt her boobs even more). The dress is opened under the armpits, and return to be just above the waist. The golden pattern there starts again, revolving around the skirt-like part like a snake around a prey. It ends at the end of the dress itself, running through the length of the skirt. The thing you are more jealous of is the upper part: it covers very poorly the shoulders, and leaves the skin naked from the neck to the upper chest. This will make Janet\u2019s upper boson visible. The skirt part reaches at maximum the knees, and Janet shows you a pair of wonderful shoes.<br>\r\n\u201cThese are news.\u201d she says \u201cI bought them the other day. They were on sale.\u201d<br>\r\nThe shoes are high-heel sandals, completely golden. The upper parts looks like if they are full of flowers.<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Susie? What do you think?\u201d she asks.<br>\r\nYou are so astonished by this beauty things that the only thing that come in your mind is \u201cPlease, can I try it on?\u201d<br>\r\nShe smiles, and gives them to you.<br>\r\n\u201cOnly for a minute, then you must take it off, or you will crumple them.\u201d she says.<br>\r\nYou remove your onesie (Janet helps you with the zip) and your diaper (it would be horrible under the dress).<br>\r\n\u201cDo not pee on the carpet, baby princess.\u201d Janet giggles, giving you a wink.<br>\r\nYou stick your tongue at her, and put the dress on. Then, it\u2019s time for the shoes. You look yourself in the mirror, and you find yourself more beautiful than you usually think you are. The only problem is that without a bra the upper part looks a bit too ... uncovered. Not that there are much to show, you think.<br>\r\n\u201cSo, princess Susan of Calonia?\u201d Janet says, giving you grin \u201cDo you think Merry would like you if she sees you dressed like this?\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush deeply, looking at her and exclaiming \u201cWhat?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, come one, Susie.\u201d Janet giggles \u201cWe are best friend. I noticed that with her you have ... unusual behaviours.\u201d<br>\r\nYou lower you head, asking \u201cYou noticed, eh?\u201d<br>\r\nJanet laughs, saying \u201cOh, Susan, Susan, Susan. You\u2019re that type of girl, uh?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not still sure of it myself.\u201d you admit \u201cThis feelings ... they are so strange.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet sighs, then saying \u201cI don\u2019t understand you, though. Girls don\u2019t have penises.\u201d<br>\r\nYou look at her with wide eyes. You would shout at her for saying that word with so much nonchalance, but you restrain yourself and say, in a calm tone \u201cReally? I didn\u2019t notice. What a news.\u201d<br>\r\nShe giggles again, but she then goes serious as she says \u201cMerry is a good girl. I\u2019m sure she likes you too.\u201d<br>\r\nYou have no secrets for Janet, but still you feel uneasy in speaking of this, so you try to change the topic, saying \u201cThe party will be incredible, right?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI really hope so.\u201d she replies \u201cMaybe I can find a sweet boy with a VIP card too that is not in diapers. That would be interesting. A prince form a foreign country, perhaps. I don\u2019t know, like Germany or Italy.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSadly to break the illusion.\u201d you say, quite sad \u201cBut children will be sent to bed early.\u201d<br>\r\nShe winks at you, replying \u201cI have a VIP-Card. I\u2019m quite sure they will let me enjoy the more interesting part of the party.\u201d<br>\r\nYou think that this is a possibility. Her VIP-Card can grant her a different treatment, it\u2019s possible.<br>\r\n\u201cCan you remove the dress now?\u201d she says, suddenly \u201cI\u2019d like it to be perfect for the party.\u201d<br>\r\nYou remove everything, finding yourself naked once again. You then take the diaper you had put on the bed, to put it on once again. Once done that, you put the onesie back on too, helped by Janet.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think that the plan is working?\u201d you ask her.<br>\r\nShe nods, replying \u201cI hope so. Now you should go back to your nursery.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s still quite early.\u201d you complain.<br>\r\n\u201cI need to move too.\u201d she says \u201cAnd you can\u2019t be seen around the Palace on your own with the plan running on. \u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n\u201cThe rumours will start to run soon. You need an alibi.\u201d she explains \u201cSpend your time with Miss Fletcher. This will protect you.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, saying \u201cOk. I will ask her to see a movie together.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet puts her hand on your shoulder, saying \u201cOk. I move too, now. If everything goes as I planned, tomorrow the entire Palace will be sure thinking that Richard has infiltrated a fake footman here.\u201d<br>\r\nYou greet her, and go back to your nursery. While Eden leaves you, you enter. Rose is cleaning the room with a mop, and is surprised to see you so soon.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess?\u201d she asks, looking at you \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNanny, I\u2019d like to see a movie.\u201d you say, trying to look more innocent as possible.<br>\r\n\u201cA movie?\u201d she says, surprised \u201cI thought that the Disney princesses movies didn\u2019t interested you. Since you didn\u2019t give me any title, I didn\u2019t ordered anything to watch.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cA Disney princess movie it\u2019s okay, I guess.\u201d you say, blushing.<br>\r\nYou are afraid that she\u2019ll go suspicious, but she giggles instead, saying \u201cOh, princess. So you like them. You were only trying to act tough, weren\u2019t you? There\u2019s no need to. You\u2019re so cute.\u201d<br>\r\nShe reaches you and picks you in her arms, beginning to walk away from the nursery.<br>\r\n\u201cRoooose!\u201d you say \u201cI can walk!\u201d<br>\r\nAs a reply, she cuddles you, saying \u201cHush, princess. I like carrying you in my harms, you know it.\u201d<br>\r\nYou shut up, while she carries you to a room you have never entered. It\u2019s plate says \u201cMovie house\u201d.<br>\r\nInside, the room looks exactly like a movie house. There are chairs, a projector and a big screen. It\u2019s like been in a cinema!<br>\r\nRose puts you on a chair (a normal one, for once), then reaches the projector. She puts a Blue-ray disc into the compartment for it and the movie title screen begins.<br>\r\nRose reaches you once again, makes you stand up and sits down, placing then you with your bottom over her knees, hugging you and cuddling you.<br>\r\nThe movie is Cindarella. It\u2019s good, but also kinda boring.<br>\r\nYou ...</span></div></div>",

So it is quiet boring to only sit there and watch the repetition of the repetition of the\u2026 .<br>\r\nYou fiddle around a lot and try to distract yourself, when Rose gives you a little slap on your naked legs. \u201cPrincess, stop that. Relax and watch the movie. You have asked for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bite down on your bottom lip, but can\u2019t sit still. \u201cCan we have popcorn? Or peanuts?\u201d You ask, looking for something to keep your hands busy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will not mess around. I just cleaned everything up and like to keep it this way.\u201d Rose sighs and keeps holding you. You move around more and try to slip off her knees, but she hold you close and give you another little slap. \u201cSusan! STOP THAT!\u201d<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes she offer you a bottle to nurse from and you agree, happy about anything. Therefore she gets up, stops the movie, prepared a bottle and continues the film when she is back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really thirsty you suckle on the nipple of the bottle. You try to blow bubbles into the formula and finally manage to blow a good amount of formula pass the nipple and all across the floor.<br>\r\nSurprised you lift the bottle up and it slips from your hands, falling down and spilling even more formula.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess! Oh, no!\u201d Rose scolds you and quickly gets up. She set you down, away from the puddle of formula and quickly picks up the bottle that was still leaking out.<br>\r\n\u201cNow I need to wipe the floor again!\u201d Rose sighs and does that right away, while you stand beside her and look at your feet.<br>\r\n\u201cUhm,\u2026 sorry.\u201d You whisper and take the baby bottle from Rose, while she grabs the mop again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose is really angry and speaks to herself while she cleans your mess away. \u201cOh I hope the medicine is working fast, then you have less chances to spill milk around my nursery.\u201d<br>\r\nSurprised you look at her and blush a bit. \u201cDid you take the lactating medicine again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose finishes her floor and grin at you. \u201cOh, not me, I gave it to the Queen, she was very sad about your lack of bonding. And I thought\u2026 \u201c.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU DID WHAT?\u201d You shout at her and approach her. While you do that you slip on the wet floor and fall on your padded behind. The shock of the impact makes you wet yourself and you whimper when you feel your diaper grow warm and wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, are you okay?\u201d Rose is over you and picks you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, but rub your behind. \u201cI am fine, but why have you done that? Are you stupid?\u201d<br>\r\nYou regret your foul mouth right away, first of all because of Rose\u2019 disappointed face and second, because she takes you over her knees, spanking your diapered behind.<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to learn to respect elders, stop to shout at them and argue them!\u201d She says and lads one slap on your behind with each word.<br>\r\nWhen she stops you have tears in your eyes and sniff. \u201cMe sorry.\u201d You say, still grumpy.<br>\r\nRose nods, but put a soapy pacifier in your mouth and ties him in place.<br>\r\n\u201cOne way or the other, you will lose that potty-mouth.\u201d She says and takes you back on her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpanked and drooling on your onesie, you finish the Disney movie, before she place you in the high chair and takes the pacifier out again. \u201cAre you a good girl again?\u201d She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Miss Fletcher.\u201d You say quietly.

I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFor fidgeting during the film, raising your voice at me and making a mess on the floor?\u201d she asks, sternly.<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I mean... yes, for that too.\u201d you reply \u201cBut I\u2019m sorry for calling you stupid. I\u2019m really sorry about that. You\u2019re not stupid, you\u2019re the best nanny in the country.\u201d<br>\r\nRose pats your head, and you notice that her eyes are a little teary.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, princess. You\u2019re a good little girl.\u201d she says \u201cQuite unruly and bit naughty, it\u2019s true, but you\u2019re sweet and kind. Without that potty-mouth of yours, your behaviour would improve drastically. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be wonderful Queen, one day.\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, then ask her \u201cDo you already know what will I wear at the party?\u201d<br>\r\nRose nods, saying \u201cOf course. Your dress is already ready. Do you want to see it?\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod. As Rose opens a wardrobe, you hope that is nothing too embarrassing.<br>\r\nTo your surprise, Rose shows you a dress that is indeed childish, but also quite normal. And you must admit that is a good dress. It is sleeveless and pink. The upper part is similar to a bodysuit, while the lower part is a skirt made of tulle, but less transparent than usual, decorated with printed red flowers. The skirt is long, and will for sure reach the ground once wore. And the dress, despite completely covering the boson, will leave your shoulders naked.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you like it, princess?\u201d Rose asks.<br>\r\nYou nod, replying \u201cA lot. Thank you, nanny Rose.\u201d<br>\r\nShe smiles, putting it away.<br>\r\n\u201cUmh ... nanny?\u201d you ask \u201cHave you any news about the party?\u201d<br>\r\nRose looks sad for a moment, then replies \u201cYes, I have.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good news?\u201d you ask her.<br>\r\nShe bites down her bottom lip, replying \u201cPoint of view, I guess. You don\u2019t have to be changed by another nanny.\u201d<br>\r\nYou already know that. But since you don\u2019t want to admit you eavesdropped, you carefully listen to her.<br>\r\n\u201cThe Campbell\u2019s inventions have been sold to House Penrose-Glee. The Queen told me that they will use it on the guests children, such as you.\u201d she explains \u201cSo you will not have another nanny change you, you should be happy about it. But I don\u2019t like those things. I only hope they fixed them perfectly.\u201d<br>\r\nYou look at her in the eyes, asking \u201cDo you know how many guests there will be?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThey invite 100 persons every year.\u201d she replies \u201cAnd everyone of them can bring a guest. So there will be 200 guests, or few less if someone goes alone.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd there will be a lot of boys and girls?\u201d you continue to ask.<br>\r\nShe giggles, making you blush, as she says \u201cYou mean children, right? As far as I now, you are the only child invited, but you can expect that a lot of parents brings their children.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I must expect to see at least 20 or 30 boys and g... I mean, children.\u201d you say.<br>\r\nRose nods, replying \u201cThose are the expected numbers, yes.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPlus the bodyguard, right?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\nShe smiles, rubbing your head \u201cYes, of course. Miss Langdon will keep an eye on you during the entire party, just as Mr. Maverick will do with the Queen.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Maverick?\u201d you ask, since you have never heard this name before.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a veteran Royal Knight. You already met him. He accompanied the Queen in America with three other knights.\u201d she explains.<br>\r\nOne of the Men in Black. When you saw them back then, you would have expected them to be anything, like members of a private security agency or something like this. For sure, you wouldn\u2019t have expected them to be Royal Knights. You even saw one of them in the silver amour, at the entrance of the palace. He was quite young, though, so he for sure wasn\u2019t Mr. Maverick.<br>\r\n\u201cThey look good in armours.\u201d you say, suddenly \u201cIn a black suit, they were a little frightening.\u201d<br>\r\nRose giggles, replying \u201cYes, I suppose they are. But the journey in the USA was kept quite secret to the rest of the world. If four knights in silver armours would have been seen there, Americans would have gone suspicious.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, as she takes out from the high-chair and puts you in a romper.<br>\r\n\u201cI will change you tomorrow morning, princess.\u201d she says, putting you in the crib \u201cI don\u2019t know when the Queen will effectively take the medicine, or how long it will take to have effect, since every woman is different, but I expect that you\u2019ll behave when she\u2019ll come to breastfeed you.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, extremely embarrassed. With Rose at least was an accident. That a woman WANTS to breastfeed you looks quite ridiculous in your eyes.<br>\r\nYou hug Mister Rabbit, while Rose turns off the lights and leaves.<br>\r\nYou are about to fall asleep, when you hear voices outside of the door.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened? What are you doing here?\u201d Rose asks.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the incident of the clock.\u201d a voice replies. You immediately recognize the voice of nanny Melissa \u201cThe Queen told maid Sophie to spread the voice, and everyone that hear it must spread it as well.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI still don\u2019t catch what are you talking about.\u201d Rose says.<br>\r\n\u201cA footman in Palace wasn\u2019t one of the servants of here.\u201d Melissa replies \u201cIt seem that he tried to damaging Mr. Harper reputation.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone has infiltrated the Palace?\u201d Rose replies, worried \u201cThat is preposterous. Are you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI found the sleeping aid in my nursery misplaced.\u201d Melissa explains \u201cOne of the maid said that, considering the wine spilled on the Butler\u2019s robe, it was spilled on him on purpose. Alice reported that a bottle of wine has gone missing. I don\u2019t think Mr. Harper would have stolen it. He would have simply ask for it, since he is authorized to drink it. And last but not least, two royal knights reported a suspicious footman. These voices beginning to run through the entire Palace. Even Janet has heard some of it. The Queen linked all, and now is quite worried.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo, a mysterious footman entered the palace and putted Mr. Harper to sleep after having stolen the bottle of wine and the sleeping aid from your nursery? Then spilled the wine on him next to the broken clock?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat is the conclusion the Queen came to.\u201d Melissa replies \u201cAnd she thinks that there is just a person that would have some gain in doing such things.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLord Richard.\u201d Rose whispers, angry \u201cThat bastard. But without evidence, we can\u2019t sue him or anything.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe security around the building will be intensified.\u201d Melissa concludes \u201cBut we must spread the voice to everyone in the Palace. If this footman is still here, we will catch him.\u201d<br>\r\nYou hear footsteps going away from the door, while you fall asleep.<br>\r\nYou sleep like a log, without having strange dreams nor nightmares.<br>\r\nIn the morning, Rose wakes you up. She seem less cheerful than usual.<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Princess.\u201d she says \u201cI have a good news and a bad one.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe good one, please.\u201d you say, still yawning.<br>\r\nAs she takes you out from the crib and leads you to the changing table to change your wet and dirty diaper, she says \u201cMiss Spencer seems to have forgiven Mr. Harper.\u201d<br>\r\nYou smile, brightly. Janet plan was a success, after all.<br>\r\n\u201cThe bad one ...\u201d Rose continues, after removing your romper and while changing your diaper \u201c... is that everyone should be careful, now.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d you ask, fully aware that she\u2019s talking about the fake footman that doesn\u2019t even exist, if not in Janet\u2019s mind.<br>\r\nBut Rose just says \u201cDon\u2019t worry your little head about it. The grown-ups will take care of everything. You should think only to play.\u201d<br>\r\nAs she finishes to change you, she puts you in a new dress. It\u2019s a white dress with short sleeves, completed by a skirt-like part that arrives just at your knees. It\u2019s full of pinks decorations and with the sentence \u201cMommy\u2019s Princess but also a true princess\u201d printed on the chest.<br>\r\n\u201cYou are so cute.\u201d Rose says, patting your head while you blush.<br>\r\nYou\u2019ll have your lesson in the afternoon, so your morning is free. Merry and Willy, on the other hand, will have free the first part of the afternoon.<br>\r\nAfter waiting for Eden to come, maybe you can go to play with Janet. Or you can look in the Palace\u2019s library to search some information about the former parties of House Penrose-Glee.</span></div></div>",

I am familiar with birthday parties and family stuff, but not with an event like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the book and nod your head. \u201cGood idea, I thought about that as well.\u201d You smile weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did not, do not lie to me or your nose will grow.\u201d Janet grins.

Mr Harper and Miss Spencer have been seen talking to each other and I am confident that they will spend the night together. I should take money for this!\u201d She grins and Eden gives her a \u201cthumbs up\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thank her as well and the two of you starts to play a video game. After a while Janet speaks up again: \u201cSo, you and Meredith, when should I arrange something for the tow of you? Hu?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush deep red and in the video game you are shot by Janet\u2019s avatar. \u201cJanet, stop that. We talked about that already. It feels different with her, but I cannot put my finger on it. Yes, it was kind of erotic to bath with her and the kiss\u2026 .\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWOW! The what? What happened in the bathtub? What kiss? Give me input!\u201d Janet pause the game and look at you. You realise that you haven\u2019t talked about it with her, for a good reason and just blurt out a secret of you and Merry.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d You whisper and blush even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I can force you.\u201d Janet grins and you slide away from her. \u201cNo, you will not. I am the princess,\u2026 NOOOOO!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Janet jumps at you and starts to tickle your sides. You laugh out uncontrollable and try to shake her off, but she is too good at this and rides you like a bull, continuously tickling you. You giggle and laugh and feel your diaper become warm, while you pee yourself. On the top of your lungs you call for Eden, but your bodyguard only shrugs and shake her head.<br>\r\nFinally you give up. \u201cOkay, okay, I tell you what happened.\u201d You say, gasping for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet promise you to keep it a secret and you tell her what happened in the bathtub, leaving some details aside. You only confess that Merry played with herself and kissed you, leaving out that Merry had a big O and you tried the same afterwards \u2013 even when Janet saw you with the mittens on.<br>\r\nJanet listens carefully and grins from ear to ear. \u201cSo you do not mind her having no penis, you just fall for her sexy ass and amazing eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really like her eyes and have no clue why she hates them herself. Her ass?? Yes, you are right; even with the thick diaper on it is cute.\u201d You say with dreamy eyes and Janet claps her hands and slides off.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I guess I can be happy that you don\u2019t try to get me laid.\u201d She grins and sticks out her tongue. \u201cShould I be jealous at Merry? I mean, I have the bigger tits and longer legs, but if that it is not what you are looking for?!\u201d<br>\r\nYou throw a pillow at her, but she avoids it and keeps grinning at you. \u201cOkay, so we need to arrange some private time for you and her, maybe in the bathtub again or alone in the crib?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJanet stop, this is not funny. Either it happens or not. Don\u2019t try to force it on us. You know how shy Merry is.\u201d You get really frustrated with your best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, not so shy when she kisses you.\u201d Janet replies and you can see her working on a play. To prevent further idea\u2019s from her side you continue to the game and shot her avatar. That brings Janet back to the reality and you continue to play until it is lunch-time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEden had a great time watching you two and still smiles when she escorts you back to the nursery.

The Queen herself stands next to her, smiling too.<br>\r\nWhile Eden greets you and leave, you feel a little anxious.<br>\r\n\u201cGood to see you, princess.\u201d Queen Charlotte greets you \u201cI was hoping to give you a little snack before your lunch, today.\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush deeply, fully aware of what is going to happen.<br>\r\nTrying to joke a little, you say \u201cIf I chose to get a spanking instead, can I go without having lunch?\u201d<br>\r\nThe Queen seems going sad, saying \u201cSo ... you\u2019d really don\u2019t like it.\u201d<br>\r\nYou try to smile, completing your joke with \u201cOh, you weren\u2019t talking about a mouth soaping? If it is something else, it will be fine.\u201d<br>\r\nRose giggles, and the Queen cheers up.<br>\r\nShe comes closer to you and take your hand, leading you to the chair that Rose usually uses to give you your bottle (and where she also breastfed you) and to deliver spankings.<br>\r\nThe Queen sits down, patting her laps and saying with a smile \u201cYou can sit here, princess.\u201d<br>\r\nStill blushing, you sit on her lap, while she begins to take her dress and her bra aside, revealing her naked nipple. She shoves it in your mouth, and you begin to nurse from her.<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t this sweet, little princess?\u201d Charlotte asks, sweetly, while you swallow her milk \u201cWho is the most adorable little girl in the country? You are, Susan.\u201d<br>\r\nYou continue to sucks her tasty milk, since it runs dry. She then takes you to the other nipple, making you nursing from it as well.<br>\r\nDuring the nursing from the second nipple, the Queen sings a sweet lullaby and cuddles you in her arms.<br>\r\nYou must admit that it feels good. Her milk is indeed tasty, and a peaceful sensation surround you entirely.<br>\r\nOnce her second nipple has ran dry, she removes your mouth from it, but continues to cuddle you and to sing for you.<br>\r\nRose gives her your bottle full of formula, and she puts it in your mouth. You suck it all, thinking that nurse from a bottle, despite being a very childish thing, it\u2019s better than being breastfeed.<br>\r\nOnce the bottle is empty, Charlotte takes you to your crib. Putting you down, she says \u201cEnjoy your nap, Susan. Rose will watch over you, as usual.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCharlotte?\u201d you call her, hugging Mister Rabbit.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, princess?\u201d she says.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you ... for caring about me.\u201d you simply say, before closing your eyes.<br>\r\nShe pats your head, and you hear her leaving the nursery with Rose.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you worried?\u201d you hear Rose asking.<br>\r\n\u201cAbout the mysterious footman? Yes.\u201d the Queen replies.<br>\r\nUnfortunately, they go away as they speak, and you don\u2019t catch anything else. So, you relax your body and fall asleep.<br>\r\nAfter some time, Rose wakes you up.<br>\r\n\u201cGood afternoon, sleepyhead.\u201d she says, smiling.<br>\r\n\u201cCan I have change, nanny?\u201d you ask \u201cI wetted myself during the morning, and during the nap I wetted myself more and even pooped a little.\u201d<br>\r\nShe smiles again, taking you out from the crib and saying \u201cOf course, princess. I can change you, but this mean that you will not have another diaper change until bedtime.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, aware of that. However, you don\u2019t want to leak during class.<br>\r\n\u201cYes. I know.\u201d you simply say.<br>\r\nShe lift you in her arms and takes you to the changing table. There, she change you, very professionally as usual.<br>\r\nOnce you\u2019re in a fresh diaper, she puts you in the clothing you\u2019ll wear for the afternoon. It\u2019s sailor uniform, white and blue, with even the typical sailor heads. It\u2019s the same outfit (female version, of course) that was wearing the spanked boy at the shop.<br>\r\n\u201cI have a good news.\u201d Rose says, while dressing you \u201cCan you promise me to behave today afternoon and all day tomorrow?\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, replying \u201cI suppose I can. Why?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you do, tomorrow evening I can take you in the basement, lock the door and you can ... play on the rocking horse.\u201d she says, smiling.<br>\r\nYou blush, but you are happy at the same time.<br>\r\nYou hug her, saying \u201cI\u2019ll be an angel!\u201d<br>\r\nShe gently pats your diaper, replying \u201cI know you\u2019ll be. But remember that angels don\u2019t throw tantrums and don\u2019t have a potty mouth, ok? And they get few demerits during their lessons, too.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, while she finishes with \u201cAnd angels that don\u2019t behave get visited by Krampus at the end of the year.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRose!\u201d you exclaim \u201cI grew up in America. You can\u2019t expect that I believe in this.\u201d<br>\r\nShe giggles, saying \u201cWell, you can tell him that he doesn\u2019t exists when you see him in December, princess.\u201d<br>\r\nYou know that there is no Krampus, but still you pretend to be scared by her words. You greet her and leave, once Eden arrives.<br>\r\nOn the way, you meet Janet. Together, you reach Miss Spencer\u2019s office.<br>\r\nThere, you see the Butler coming out from it.<br>\r\n\u201cGood afternoon, Mister Harper.\u201d you greet him.<br>\r\nHe seems in a bad mood, but very politely replies \u201cGood afternoon to you too, princess. I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m quite busy.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAre you worried about the rumours?\u201d Janet asks.<br>\r\nHe nods, replying \u201cThe Queen strengthened the security. The problem that this caused to me is in the background, now. I\u2019m much more worried about the Palace safety.\u201d<br>\r\nHe greets you and leave, while you knock the door and enter the classroom as Miss Spencer  gives you permission.<br>\r\nShe is back at her normal self. Strict, of course, but much more calm.<br>\r\nThe lesson, today ...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The lesson today is very interesting, at least for Janet.<br>\r\nWell, not the interesting in the way that the topics are new or something you had never heareda bout, but interesting in the meaning of \u201cwhat you like to know about your friends\u201d.<br>\r\nYou are not sure how to describe the topic itself, it would be fair to call it a mixture of biology and sociology, under the main topic of sexuality.<br>\r\n\u201cToday we talk about sex. Sexual orientations. Saver Sex and the right age for sex.\u201d Miss Spencer starts.<br>\r\nWith only that words you blush deep red and Janet burst out laughing hard. It needed the threat of being banned from the classroom before she calms down again.<br>\r\nFor you, it was torture. Whenever Miss Spencer talks about bi- or homosexual preferences Janet pokes you in the side and giggles, while you blush more and more until you are sure you look like a tomato. To make it worse Miss Spencer notice that and understands, that you are already fixed on the female gender and keeps telling you, that this is okay and fine for her, the palace staff and the country \u2013 as long as you get pregnant or adopt a child at one point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, after we are done with that topic, lets talk about saver sex. Princess, you should be safe in more than one way, but Janet I like you to listen carefully, we don't want to find you in the newspapers because you got pregnant on your vacation in Calonia.\u201d Now it was time for you to laugh and giggle, what Miss Spencer stops with the simple three words: \u201c5 demerits, princess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was still funny. Miss Spencer introduced various ways of protection and has Janet put a condom over a realistic looking dildo. At first with her hands and then with her mouth. Your laughing earns you two more demerits, but it was worth it to see Janet blushing while she tried not to gag on the dildo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it comes to the right age for sex you feel a bit stupid. Miss Spencer really points out that Janet can do it, basically right now and that this is okay \u2013 but you have to wait until you are 18. You point out, that is not so easy going in the united states, but Janet pokes your side and shakes her head to make you shut up. It seems like she put her hopes into the party and does not want somebody to know that she is not old enough according to the laws of her own country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that funny part Miss Spencer goes more into the biological part of a pregnancy and why it is better to wait with that until the body is ready for it. For sure she points out that the body is not ready before, but absolutely ready after the 18th birthday \u2013 something you can only shake your head about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the lesson is over and  - even with the laughing, only earned 9 demerits. A results you are very happy about.<br>\r\nOutside of the classroom you talk with Janet.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, what are we doing alter on? I would like to spy on Miss Spencer and Mr Harper to check if they are really together again, but we can do something else as well.\u201d You let Janet decide and she picks to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even if, with Miss Spencer talking about sex for the entire lesson, I think this is now just a formality.\u201d<br>\r\nShe said the last sentence of her phrase giggling.<br>\r\n\u201cOk, then.\u201d you agree \u201cI\u2019ll catch you later, and then we\u2019ll go on a spy mission.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to give the note to Miss Fletcher first, uh?\u201d Janet asks.<br>\r\nYou blush a little, replying \u201cIf I delay it, it will only get worse. A quick punishment and then I\u2019m free.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet hugs you and greet you, leaving.<br>\r\nEscorted by Eden, as usual, you reach your nursery. Inside, Rose is waiting for you.<br>\r\n\u201cHi, princess. How was the lesson for my little sailor?\u201d she greets you, referring to your clothes.<br>\r\n\u201cNanny, I got nine demerits.\u201d you say, giving her the note \u201cThey are not a lot, right? To prevent me to play with the rocking horse, I mean.\u201d<br>\r\nRose takes the note and reads it. She then smiles, saying \u201cYou haven\u2019t lie, they are 9 indeed. And yes, they aren\u2019t much. I consider you a well-behaved girl.\u201d<br>\r\nYou smile too, happy about the possibility to finally relieve yourself tomorrow evening with the rocking horse, but then she goes serious.<br>\r\n\u201cStill, nine demerits mean a spanking, princess.\u201d she says.<br>\r\nYou gulp, and reach the chair without hesitation, surprising Rose a little.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m ready \u2026\u201d you say \u201c\u2026 to get my spanking.\u201d<br>\r\nRose reaches the chair too and sits on it, then drags you across her knees.<br>\r\n\u201cVery good, princess. I\u2019m pleased that you now see that a little discipline does only your good. I\u2019m happy that you\u2019re accepting our tradition.\u201d she says, pulling down your pants and your diaper (that is a bit wet after the lesson).<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d you think \u201cI will never simply accept that this is ok. I still think I\u2019m too old for spankings. But the quicker it is, the better it is.\u201d<br>\r\nRose spanks you with her hand, giving you a considerable amount of spanks. Not a too high number, but enough to make your bottom quite red. And, of course, making you cry.<br>\r\n\u201cDone.\u201d she proclaims, once finished the spanking.<br>\r\nShe puts the diaper and the pants back on their place and lets you sit on her knees, hugging you tightly, cuddling you while you\u2019re still sobbing.<br>\r\n\u201cHush, little one.\u201d she sweetly says, rubbing your back \u201cA little discipline never killed anyone. I don\u2019t like spankings, but with them you\u2019ll develop into a wonderful Queen, one day.\u201d<br>\r\nYou hug her back, holding her close. You really like Rose. She is strict, but she\u2019s always so caring.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, nanny.\u201d you sob.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, my little sailor.\u201d she says, still cuddling you \u201cNanny loves her beautiful angel, even if she is a bit naughty.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s not was I mean.\u201d you say, without stopping completely to sob \u201cI\u2019m sorry for my first day here.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh? For the incident with the press and for misbehaving in Miss Kent\u2019s office? It\u2019s ok, you got the carpet beater for those.\u201d she says.<br>\r\nYou shake your head, stating \u201cNo. What I\u2019m sorry about is thinking that you were mean. I didn\u2019t know you back then. I\u2019m sorry for that.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, cutie!\u201d she says, continuing to hug you \u201cIt was your first day. It\u2019s normal for someone grew up in another country to see our strict discipline as unfair.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI still think it is.\u201d you whisper, hiding your face in her boson \u201cBut back then I was ignorant about your caring side.\u201d<br>\r\nShe rubs your head, concluding with \u201cYou\u2019ll appreciate our culture, sooner or later. For now, I\u2019m just happy that you see me as a loving nanny.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, while she lets you go. You greet and leave the nursery, followed by Eden.<br>\r\nWhile reaching Janet once again, something comes in your mind, and you ask to your escort \u201cEden, where you spanked a lot in your youth?\u201d<br>\r\nYou were expecting her to not reply or at least to blush, but in a completely natural way she states \u201cOf course, my lady. My father never spared me the hairbrush. My mother was often away, but when she was at home I was spanked at least twice a day. Without counting the others punishment.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMouth soaping?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\nShe nods, grinning a little and saying \u201cI was really a potty mouth back then. Mouth soaping was the punishment I got more times in my childhood. I was quite a tomboy, you know.\u201d<br>\r\nYou reach Janet room, and you enter. Janet greets you, and like a cold shower she asks \u201cDo you need some time for yourself? I can wait outside.\u201d<br>\r\nYou shake your head, saying \u201cThat will get me in trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Weren\u2019t you needing it?\u201d she asks \u201cOr are you so afraid to get in trouble to give up without trying?\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, and decide to tell her the truth.<br>\r\nWith a sigh, you say to her \u201cIn others circumstances, I will gladly accept. But getting in trouble now that Rose will give me permission to do it would be stupid.\u201d<br>\r\nShe freeze for a moment, then burst out laughing, saying \u201cYour nanny will give you permission to do that? How will it happen?\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush even deeper, replying \u201cWell \u2026 with a rocking horse.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet laughs really hard now, and you yell at her to make her stop \u201cJanet! It\u2019s not funny!\u201d<br>\r\nIn doing this, you wet your diaper more. Now the wetness indicator tells that a change can be performed, even if it\u2019s not strictly necessary yet.<br>\r\nJanet stops laughing and hugs you, saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Susie. I know I shouldn\u2019t tease you. But you must admit it\u2019s a funny thought.\u201d<br>\r\nYou admit it is, and hug her back.<br>\r\n\u201cNow, are you ready for our espionage mission?\u201d she asks.<br>\r\nYou nod, and you leave the room together.<br>\r\nWhile looking for the couple to spy, you meet someone in the hallways. Two people, talking to each other.<br>\r\nThose are \u2026</span></div></div>",

Before this happens, however, Eden catches you.<br>\r\nYou thank her, and continue to eavesdrop (for the scare, you messed your diaper a little).<br>\r\n\u201cNow everyone is worried about Richard\u2019s spy.\u201d Miss Spencer says \u201cOnce everything will go back to normal, we will make the announcement.\u201d<br>\r\nYou hear Julie greeting Miss Spencer, so you decide to hide beside the corner. You look at her while she leaves, curious about this person.<br>\r\nAlmost disappointed, you see a common maid on her early thirties, like many other in the Palace.<br>\r\nYou are about to leave yourself, when you notice something strange.<br>\r\nJulie look around, to make sure no one is there. You are well hidden, so she doesn\u2019t notice you.<br>\r\nTo your surprise, she takes an hairbrush out from her French maid outfit and begins to spank herself.<br>\r\n\u201cBad girl, Julie, bad girl!\u201d she says to herself aloud, in a scolding tone, but giggling a little \u201cYou should mind your own business!\u201d<br>\r\nAfter some slaps, she then puts away the hairbrush and leaves the hallway.<br>\r\nYou and Janet look at each other, and you both burst out laughing.<br>\r\n\u201cSelf spanking?! That is new.\u201d you exclaim.<br>\r\nJanet adds \u201cSo there ARE people that likes it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNothing strange.\u201d Eden intervenes \u201cSpankings are not a such uncommon fetish. That is true in Calonia, too. Of course, kinky spankings and punishment spankings must always remain separated.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, but you don\u2019t agree. To your eyes, liking spankings is simply impossible.<br>\r\nStill lost in your thoughts, you almost collapse when Janet says \u201cMaybe I can try it with Willy.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJanet!!\u201d you exclaim \u201cIf you like spankings so much, I can ask Eden to put you across her knees! Even better, I can ask Rose to give you all of my punishments!\u201d<br>\r\nJanet giggles, saying \u201cOh, Susie. I was joking. When you discovered that you were the princess, you got much more serious than before.\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, then hug her saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\nShe hugs you back, then lets you go.<br>\r\n\u201cSo, little sailor, do you need a change?\u201d she asks.<br>\r\nYou blush again, replying \u201cYes. Back in the nursery I\u2019ll ask Rose about it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I still miss my hairs.\u201d Janet says \u201cDown there, I mean.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMe too.\u201d you admit \u201cAnd the embarrassing thing is that I didn\u2019t even notice their disappearance before Rose told you.\u201d<br>\r\nA cold silence envelop the entire hallway.<br>\r\n\u201cNow I should go back to Rose.\u201d you say, after a while \u201cIt\u2019s almost dinnertime, and I need a change and a bath.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d Janet says \u201cI need to use the toilet, too.\u201d<br>\r\nYou greet her, and Eden escorts you to Rose\u2019s nursery.<br>\r\nYour diaper is very wet now, and even messed a little. You are eager to get a bath and go into a fresh one.<br>\r\nYou reach the nursery and enter, greeting Eden. You don\u2019t understand why, but she doesn\u2019t leave.<br>\r\nInside, a big surprise awaits you. The nanny, in fact, is not alone. She has a boy over her knees and she is spanking him. A boy you immediately recognize.<br>\r\n\u201cWilly?!\u201d you exclaim \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d<br>\r\nThe nanny looks at you, and you see that is nanny Melissa and not nanny Rose.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess?!\u201d she says, surprised \u201cWhat are you doing here?!\u201d<br>\r\nYou now see why Eden didn\u2019t leave. You didn\u2019t reach the right nursery. This is Melissa\u2019s one. How could you make such a mistake?<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d you say \u201cI made a mistake.\u201d<br>\r\nMelissa puts William down. He is crying. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n\u201cWilly pushed his sister.\u201d she explains \u201cAnd I see that you haven\u2019t yet learned to knock the door before enter in a room.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d you say.<br>\r\nMelissa \u2026</span></div></div>",

I was just too deep in my thoughts and entered the wrong door.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa holds your hand tightly and pulls you back.<br>\r\n\u201cI am sorry princess, but walking in without knocking, interrupting a punishment, I think you need a small punishment as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Willy wiping his eyes and see Merry in the crib, looking over the rails. She looks very cute, like a puppy and you blush when you notice that you stare at her. That moment of distraction is enough for Melissa to pull you over her lap and lift the skirt of your sailor dress. \u201cA little spanking never hurts.\u201d She says, more to herself than to you and begins to spank your padded behind. You wiggle on her lap when the little mess spread around and you feel the squishy, wet diaper be pressed against your crotch. You deeply regret that you had wiggled on her mal, because now she is basically spanking your\u2026 crotch and because she is spanking you very lightly, this sends confusing feelings through your body. \u201cOh, please stop Nanny Melissa.\u201d You moan out and Willy giggles. He stands beside his sister in the crib and look at you, while your face gets redder and redder. He is whispering to Merry and both of them grin at you.<br>\r\nWhen it is over you are breathing heavy and look at your feet to avoid looking at Nanny Melissa, Willy or Merry. \u201cI hope that teaches you to knock the next time.\u201d Melissa says and gives your behind a final little slaps, sending you over to Eden.<br>\r\nThe knightess takes your hand and guides you to the door, where she stops and coughs slightly.<br>\r\n\u201cUhm, I am very Sorry Nanny Melissa, thank you. Bye Merry, bye Willy.\u201d You say and Eden leads you out.<br>\r\nOutside she leads you to a bench and you slide down on it, with weak knees. Sitting down in your messy diaper is no fun, but you need some rest before you can face Rose and thankfully Eden knows that. \u201cMy friend had a nanny that used to spank her like this all the time \u2013 and worse. She told me about it and I think we should wait a few minutes before you get changed by Miss Fletcher.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush and nod your head, to ashamed to say anything jet. You are not sure if it happened by accident or if Nanny Melissa did it with intention, but you want to \u201ccool down\u201d before you get changed and have to answer embarrassing questions. You are so aroused that you would accept Janet\u2019s offer on the spot and have some minutes alone \u2013 but you want to be a good girl and earn your reward. It takes you a few minutes to come down and thank Eden.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, I\u2026 I needed that break. I don\u2019t want to get in trouble with Rose for something I haven\u2019t done.\u201d<br>\r\nEden nods her head and smiles down at you. She is a good friend by now and trying to keep you out of trouble when she could.<br>\r\n\u201cYour friend\u2026 her nanny\u2026 why have she done that to her?\u201d You ask your guard and Eden blushes a bit, making you think that her \u201cfriend\u201d might be herself. \u201cWell, that nanny liked to tease my friend and telling her that she likes to be in a wet diaper. To prove that, she gave her \u201clove-spankings\u201d \u2013 like she called them \u2013 and made \u2026 my friend climax in her wet diaper. Then she got punished for being naughty, for sure.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod your head feeling sorry for Eden\u2019s\u2026 friend. You can be very happy that Rose is such a good nanny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you walk to your own nursery, double-check that it is really the right door and enter.<br>\r\nInside you find\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m surprised it didn\u2019t leaked.\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush while she takes you to the changing table and lifts you on it.<br>\r\nRose begins to remove your clothes and to un-tape your diaper. While she is cleaning you, you decide to ask her \u201cNanny Rose, can I ask you a question about the Queen?\u201d<br>\r\nShe nods, replying \u201cYou\u2019re always free to ask questions, little one. If I can answer, I will.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCharlotte came in America to make me princess because she can\u2019t bear children.\u201d you say \u201cShe told me that. But this doesn\u2019t explain why there isn\u2019t a king. Is she still unmarried?\u201d<br>\r\nRose finishes to clean you up and lets you sit, still naked, on the changing table. She sighs, and says \u201cNo, little one. Queen Susan was happily married with a local nobleman named Roy. He became known as King Roy the Wise.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened to him?\u201d you ask her.<br>\r\nRose seems to go sad for a moment, and says \u201cA sudden heart attack, two years ago. Queen Charlotte was so desperate for her loss that I was afraid she would do something stupid. However, she stood up. She managed to administer the country alone, and rejected every suitor. Then, recently, she discovered that her cousin had a family on his own, and a daughter that one day would have inherited the throne.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d you say \u201cI wonder why my dad never told me about his Calonian origins.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou knew him well?\u201d Rose ask, making you go sad too.<br>\r\n\u201cNot so well, I must admit. He passed away when I was six.\u201d you say to her.<br>\r\nShe hugs you tightly, cuddling you in her arms.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he and king Roy know are talking to each other, and he is saying how proud he is of his daughter.\u201d the nanny says, still hugging you.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not a little kid anymore, nanny.\u201d you say, while your tone gets a little colder \u201cI don\u2019t need to believe in heaven.\u201d<br>\r\nShe doesn\u2019t reply, catching that you don\u2019t like talking about it. Instead, she changes completely the subject, saying \u201cYou really need a bath, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, and she takes you to the bathtub. She washes you accurately, and at the end you\u2019re fresh and clean, and you smell really good.<br>\r\nAfter diapering you, she puts you in the high-chair, where she feeds you with baby mush and with a bottle of milk. After the dinner, she puts you in a white romper.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want a pacifier, for tonight?\u201d she asks.<br>\r\nWithout even realizing it, you nod. She puts a pacifier in your mouth, then puts you in the crib. <br>\r\nRose rubs your hair, saying \u201cGood night, princess.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNanny Rose?\u201d you call her, speaking with difficulty behind your pacifier.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, cutie?\u201d she asks.<br>\r\n\u201cTomorrow evening ... remember that you promised it.\u201d you say.<br>\r\nShe giggles, replying \u201cOf course, princess.\u201d before turning the lights off and then leave the room.<br>\r\nYou hug Mister Rabbit, and quickly fall asleep.<br>\r\nDuring the night, you have confused dream. You see your dad face, vanishing in the mist. And nothing more.<br>\r\nThe next morning, Rose wakes you up.<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, princess. Ready for a great Friday?\u201d she says, smiling.<br>\r\nYou nod, while she takes you out from your crib.<br>\r\nAfter she had removed your pacifier, with a wet sound, you say \u201cI wetted and messed myself during the night.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI can smell it.\u201d she says, giggling and patting the back of your diaper \u201cA little change and then a healthy breakfast for beginning the morning in great style.\u201d<br>\r\nShe proceeds to change you, and gives you your breakfast while you\u2019re dressed only in your fresh diaper.<br>\r\nAfter this, she lifts you out from the high-chair and dresses you up.<br>\r\nShe dresses you in sailor-fuku, smiling sweetly.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re very cute, princess.\u201d she says, rubbing your hair.<br>\r\nYou hug her, and once Eden has reached the nursery, you great your nanny and leave.<br>\r\nThe Kent\u2019s siblings have lesson in the morning, so you decide to reach Janet.<br>\r\nDuring the way, however, you see the Queen coming in your direction.<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Charlotte.\u201d you greet her.<br>\r\nShe is sweating, and with a quick smile she says \u201cHi, Susan. I\u2019m in a bit of a hurry, so ...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cQueen Charlotte! Stop running away!\u201d a male voice says aloud.<br>\r\nA Royal Knight appears in the hallway and reaches the queen with few movements.<br>\r\n\u201cQueen Charlotte! I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re trying to sneak away like a disobedient child. Aren\u2019t you supposed to be an adult?\u201d the knight says.<br>\r\nHe is a quite old knight, with a big scar under his left eye.<br>\r\nAs he appears, Eden does a military salute.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, I am busy in administering the country. Can\u2019t I skip practice this week?\u201d the queen pleas, looking at him.<br>\r\nThe knight shakes his head, replying \u201cA member of the Royal House should train a lot, you can train only once a week just because your are alone on the throne, but you can\u2019t skip it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, is she\u2019s going to train?\u201d you say \u201cCan I see it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think ...\u201d Charlotte begins to say, but the knight interrupts her.<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, princess.\u201d he says \u201cYou\u2019ll train too once you\u2019ll come of age, so it can\u2019t hurt.\u201d<br>\r\nWith this words, he leads both you and the sighing queen (and Eden) to the training area.<br>\r\nYou sit on a bench, with Eden beside you.<br>\r\nWhile the queen is changing herself in the locker room, you ask Eden about that royal knight.<br>\r\nShe explains to you \u201cThat man is Joel Rames. He is the High Captain of the Royal Knights. He\u2019s quite old, now, but once he was the most skilled knight in the kingdom, and maybe even of our history. No one has ever defeated him in single combat, not even me nor Maverick. And ... he was my master during my training.\u201d<br>\r\nYou thank her for the explanation, and the queen finally comes out from the locker room.<br>\r\nShe is beautiful. She\u2019s wearing the same armour that Eden is wearing too, only that hers is not silver, but golden.<br>\r\nQueen Charlotte takes out a rapier, while High Captain Joel takes out a long sword. They are training weapons, without sharp edges and with covers on the tips. They begins to spar.<br>\r\nThe Queen is ...</span></div></div>",

The high captain is able to it her on the upper arms twice and she moans out in pain and has issues to lift her arm.<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t he going too hard on her?\u201d You ask Eden, but she shakes her head. \u201cDo not worry princess, he knows exactly how hard he needs to hit her, not to cause serious damage. Tomorrow morning the Queen will not even have a bruise and can move her arm like always.\u201d<br>\r\nYou really hope she is right. The Queen would not be happy to go to the party, looking beaten up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Charlotte lifts her rapier and tries to block the heavier weapon of the knight, but is pushed back. Then she slides to the side and poke him in the side.<br>\r\n\u201cHa! It took you so long to find out that avoiding a direct hit might be smarter.\u201d Knight Rames snaps at the queen and steps back, holding his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Charlotte wipes some sweat from her forehead and smiles weakly. \u201cI thought I test my strength with you, old man. \u2013 Was not so smart, I have to say.\u201d She gasps for air and rubs her upper arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight chuckles and shakes his head. \u201cOne day you learn that you don\u2019t need to be as strong as you opponent, if you are clever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little break, the two of them continue for another 15 minutes. The whole lesson does not even last 45minutes, but you can see that it is a great workout for the Queen and she walks off to take a shower, like her trainer did.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd Janet will fight like this as well?\u201d You ask Eden on your way to your friend\u2019s chamber.<br>\r\n\u201cFor 4 hours a day, plus fitness-training, plus theory. It is not so easy to become a knight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Janet\u2019s room you tell everything to your best friend and she listens carefully, until you end and she give you a little smack on your arm. \u201cHey!\u201d You complain.<br>\r\n\u201cFor not taking me with you, brat.\u201d Janet grins and sticks out her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the morning you and her play video games \u2013 Mortal Combat \u2013 and have a great time.<br>\r\n\u201cOnly lunch, one lesson and then you have a bit fun?!\u201d Janet grins, while she beats up your avatar with her avatar.<br>\r\n\u201cI only hope miss Spencer is in a good mood today.

You wonder where the Queen is and ask your nanny. \u201cRose, did the queen stopped to take the medicine? I am not unhappy about it, I just wonder about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose grins and tickles your sides through your bright pink romper. \u201cThe Queen notices that it might be not the ideal way to tighten your relationship and stopped to take the lactating pills. And she had two\u2026 accidents where she ended with a moist bra during meetings when she was too busy to nurse you or pump off the milk. She will find something else to spent time with you, little one.\u201d<br>\r\nYou are happy to hear that. You really like the queen, but you feel simply too old to nurse on breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a peaceful sleep with Mr Rabbit Rose dress you in an onesie with the pattern of a ladybug.

Miss Spencer is smiling, which is a good sign.<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Miss Spencer.\u201d you greet her.<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning to you too, princess. Good morning, Janet.\u201d she says and points at your chairs with a finger.<br>\r\nYou immediately sit down, like Janet does, and the lesson begins.<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you\u2019ll attend the Penrose-Glee party tomorrow evening.\u201d the teacher says \u201cI must be sure that you know the formal etiquette for such an important social event.\u201d<br>\r\nThe lesson is quite boring, but extremely useful. She gives you a lot of information about the etiquette to follow during a party in Calonia, about the guests and about the host. In particular, she speaks a lot about the main organizer of the event, lady Penrose-Glee herself.<br>\r\nYou raise your hand, and when she gives you permission to speak you ask \u201cAre you invited too, Miss Spencer?\u201d<br>\r\nShe shakes her head, replying \u201cI\u2019m not a noble, princess. As a teacher I have quite a name in the country but, technically speaking, I\u2019m a commoner.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, while Miss Spencer resumes her lesson. After speaking about the party, the last part of the lesson focus on math, your nemesis. You try the best you can to answer to the teacher\u2019s question, and at the end of the lesson she\u2019s pleased.<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, princess. Very well indeed. I was right, after all: you need only to believe in yourself and focus hard.\u201d she praises you.<br>\r\nYou are quite happy yourself. You managed to get better and better at math in just few days. It\u2019s quite obvious for you that it\u2019s because school system in Europe (or maybe only in Calonia, you\u2019re not sure about it) works much better than in the USA. You even managed to stay focus even when you were wetting your diaper during the lesson.<br>\r\nMiss Spencer then lends you a note, adding \u201cAnd you were well behaved too: 3 demerits for today\u2019s lesson. You can be proud of yourself. As your teacher, I am proud of you.\u201d<br>\r\nYou take the note, smiling.<br>\r\n\u201cUmh \u2026 miss Spencer?\u201d you then say, a bit hesitatingly.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, princess?\u201d she asks.<br>\r\n\u201cCan I \u2026 hug you?\u201d you ask her.<br>\r\nShe looks at your, surprised, then replies \u201cWell \u2026 just once, okay?\u201d<br>\r\nSmiling, you hug her. She hugs you back, while Janet giggles a little.<br>\r\nMiss Spencer lets you go. You greet her and march right to your nursery followed by both Eden and Janet.<br>\r\n\u201cNanny Rose! Nanny Rose!\u201d you exclaim happily, entering in the nursery and running to hug your beloved nanny \u201cI managed it! I got few enough demerits to avoid a punishment!\u201d<br>\r\nRose hold you in her arms, cuddling you and saying \u201cVery well done, princess. Can I see the note, please?\u201d<br>\r\nYou give the note to her, and she looks at it. Smiling, she hugs you again.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud of you.\u201d she says \u201cYou are a very good girl.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCan I spend the rest of the afternoon with my friends?\u201d you ask her.<br>\r\nRose nods, smiling, and replies \u201cOf course. And if you don\u2019t get in trouble during your playtime, once you\u2019ll be back here I will keep my promise.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet giggles again, but you\u2019re too happy to let her ruin your mood.<br>\r\nYou greet Rose and leave the nursery. You go straight to Melissa\u2019s one, knocking at the door. The tall nanny gives you permission to enter, and you open the door. You see that Melissa, that is standing in the middle of the room, is alone.<br>\r\n\u201cGood to see you, princess.\u201d she greets you \u201cHave you finally learned knocking?\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, remembering the embarrassing spanking she gave you yesterday and trying to forget it at the same time.<br>\r\n\u201cI was looking for Merry and Willy.\u201d you say to her.<br>\r\n\u201cI think they are in the garden, princess.\u201d the nanny replies \u201cYou can reach them if you want.\u201d<br>\r\nYou thank her and leave. While reaching the garden, Janet says to you \u201cDo you want me to take William away? In this way you\u2019ll be alone with Meredith.\u201d<br>\r\nYou become the color of a tomato, and instantly reply \u201cJanet! I already told you no!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAww, are you afraid that the cute little Merry could rape you if you are alone?\u201d she teases you.<br>\r\nKnowing that she really cares about you and simply enjoys teasing you a little, you decide to ignore her while reaching the garden.<br>\r\nYou find Meredith and William playing together. They\u2019re chasing each other, maybe playing tag or something like that. You\u2019re happy to see that they are in normal clothes and not in punishment ones.<br>\r\nYou look at Merry, in particular, and you notice that she has ribbons in her hair that make her look super cute.<br>\r\nYou reach them, and as she notices you Meredith immediately jumps at you and hugs you tightly.<br>\r\n\u201cHello, Susie.\u201d she says, whispering at your ear.<br>\r\nYou notice that Willy has run toward Janet, and you can\u2019t avoid thinking that they could be an interesting couple.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have something in mind for the afternoon?\u201d he then says, looking at you.<br>\r\n\u201cNothing in particular.\u201d you reply \u201cToday I\u2019ll be on my best behavior. Rose promised me a reward and I want it.\u201d<br>\r\nWilliam catches very quickly what are you talking about: he giggles and says \u201cOh, the princess wants to be good to be naughty.\u201d<br>\r\nYou make him the sign to shut up using your hands, and he decides to do it.<br>\r\nFor the afternoon, you could simply play in the garden. Or maybe you can ask around to know the First Footman, since you have never met him so far. You decide to change things a little, and go for the second option.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d really like to meet the First Footman. I never saw him.\u201d you say to the others \u201cDo you want to come with me?\u201d<br>\r\nThey all agree, and you begin to search.<br>\r\nYou look for a footman and decide to ask him about his boss.<br>\r\nThe footman you meet first is quite young and is cleaning an hallway with a mop.<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me \u2026\u201d you say \u201c\u2026 can I ask you something?\u201d<br>\r\nHe looks at you, surprised, and says \u201cOf course, princess. What do you need?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for the First Footman. Do you know where we can find him?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\nHe touches his chin and takes a thoughtful expression, then replies \u201cI think he is in dining room. As far as I know, he wanted to check the royal kitchen. But be aware that is quite nervous today.\u201d<br>\r\nYou think that meeting him while he\u2019s nervous maybe isn\u2019t that smart, since he is one of the servants authorized to punish you, but the curiosity gets too strong.<br>\r\nYou quickly reach the dining room, and you find a man inside.<br>\r\nThe man is \u2026</span></div></div>",

I thought you are still feed by your nanny.\u201d He looks for the nearest maid and is about to give her orders, when you stop him.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you are right. I\u2026 am still feed by my nanny, Mr\u2026 ?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I Maximilian Collin, the first footman, princess.\u201d He smiles and bows in a perfect aristocratic way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and relax a bit. \u201cOh, you are the first Max I meet in Calonia. I really like that name.\u201d You smile and try to befriend him \u2013with no success.<br>\r\n\u201cIt is Mr. Collin or first footman. Only my mother is calling me Max, Princess Susan.\u201d He says a bit angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm, I am sorry Mr. Collin, I will remember that. Are you preparing the table for dinner?\u201d You feel stupid right after the words are out, but wait for his reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Princess, I am \u2013 and now that I remember you are not even allowed to be here. If the order has not changed, what I doubt, then you are banned from the dining room for bad behavior and throwing a tantrum.\u201d Mr. Collin says and looks even stricter than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush and quickly look at Janet. \u201cUhm, yes, I only wanted to show the room to Janet, my best friend.\u201d Janet\u2019s eyes go wide and you see her shaking her head slightly, but it is too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, Miss Janet is using this dining room on a regular base, are you trying to pull my leg?\u201d he pulls out a chair from the table and pat his lap. \u201cPrincess, are you aware that I have the authority to punish you? If yes, than I kindly ask you to lap over my knees.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? But I\u2026\u201d You bite down on your bottom lip and look at your feet. \u201cI did not mean to trick you. I only wanted to meet you.\u201d You say, but Mr Collin is still patting his knees. Sighing, you go to him and lie over his lap.<br>\r\n\u201cIt is good that you accept my punishment, Princess. I am pleased that you learned to follow instructions.\u201d He says and give your behind five slaps over your diaper. It does not hurt at all, it is only to make you know your place. You decide you do are not eager to become his friend. As soon as he let you up from his lap you greet him and leaves the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSusie, I eat her almost every day, twice sometimes.\u201d Janet says when you are in the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI noticed that.\u201d You say grumpy and stop for a moment. You are happy that is did not happen over his lap, but now you flood your diaper with a hissing noise. Janet is shaking her head and rolls her eyes. <br>\r\n\u201cReally? You want to ride the rocking horse in a soaked diaper?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerry giggles and blush a bit, but does not say anything, while William grins from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have not thought about that and your facial expression slips.

Unsure if you should ask to an extra-change you waddle back to your nursery.<br>\r\n\u201cI only hope Mr. Collin does not report anything to Rose.\u201d You whisper to Janet and she giggles. In front of your door, she ruffles your hair and takes Williams hand.<br>\r\n\u201cWe go back to the garden to play. You can have\u2026 fun.\u201d She winks at you and pull William with her.<br>\r\nMeredith hesitates for a moment, but then she jumps at you and give you a quick kiss on the lips. \u201cThink of be when you do it.\u201d She whispers into your ear and quickly runs off.

What have you done this time?\u201d<br>\r\nYou decide that saying all to her could avoid you a punishment for lying. Mr. Collin would tell it to someone anyway, you think.<br>\r\n\u201cI wanted to meet the First Footman, so I reached him in the dining room. But I didn\u2019t know I was not allowed there and I lied about it. So Mr. Collin spanked me after seeing through my lie.\u201d you say, almost crying.<br>\r\nTo your surprise, Rose giggles and pats your head, saying \u201cOh, princess. Your curiosity is admirable. I really like that trait of yours, but it has the tendency to get you in trouble. Why haven\u2019t you simply said that you wanted to meet him instead of lying? He would have not spanked you and he would have been pleased.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI \u2026 I don\u2019t know. I said the first thing that came in my mind.\u201d you admit.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that is the real problem, princess: you never stop long enough to think about what you\u2019re about to say or do. Is this tendency that created a problem with the press at your landing and the main reason you get in trouble so often.\u201d she explains, in a firm but not scolding tone.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d you say \u201cI\u2019ll try my best to get better.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI know you will.\u201d she says, cuddling you \u201cYou are a smart little girl, princess.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo \u2026 can we go?\u201d you try, afraid that now she has changed her mind.<br>\r\nLuckily for you, she nods instead, saying \u201cYes, princess. We can go in the basement.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCan I get changed, first? I am quite wet.\u201d you say to her, but Rose shakes her head.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it is only better, don\u2019t you think? And this way I don\u2019t need to change you twice in so little time.\u201d she says, giggling a little.<br>\r\n\u201cTwice?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, princess!\u201d she exclaims \u201cDid you think I\u2019d let you all night in a the diaper where you reached climax in? Absolutely not!\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, getting what she is saying. Rose takes your hand, and takes you to the basement holding it, while in the other hand she twirls the ornate key.<br>\r\nEvery maid and footman that you come across gives a look to the key and giggles. Every single one. You are sure that they know what is going to happen.<br>\r\n\u201cRose, can\u2019t you hide the key at least?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\nShe shakes her head, replying \u201cOh, it\u2019s part of the tradition. When a child is taken to have naughty fun, everyone that come across the child concerned should know it. As everyone in the palace will know about your menarche when you\u2019ll have it.\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush deep red, maybe even deeper than usual, and say \u201cRoooose!\u201d<br>\r\nShe giggles, saying \u201cWell, it\u2019s the first sign that you are going to become a woman, after all.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRose, I already had it!\u201d you exclaim, blushing.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, really?\u201d she says, surprised \u201cIt\u2019s a shame, I would have really liked to take care of it. Well, let\u2019s think about naughty fun, shall we?\u201d<br>\r\nWith this sentence, you are at the basement\u2019s door. Rose opens it with the key and let you in. You are ready to be left alone with the rocking horse, but she follows you and lock the door behind her, leaving the key in the keyhole (to prevent nanny Melissa to enter with one the Kent\u2019s using her key, you think).<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to watch me?\u201d you ask, blushing again.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious.\u201d she states \u201cI need to check on you to see that you don\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d<br>\r\nYou\u2019d want to complain about it, but you\u2019re afraid that she can change her mind. You nod and walk right to the rocking horse.<br>\r\nThe horse is brown and looks really cute, with a saddle on his back. The horse itself is stuffed and fluffy, but the saddle is really hard.<br>\r\nRose removes your ladybug onesie, leaving you only in your diaper. Then, she helps you getting on the saddle.<br>\r\nYou press your crotch against it, and you begin to ride the horse. You feel a good sensation running through your body. It\u2019s quite embarrassing that Rose gives you advice of how to do it correctly, but you must admit that following them only increase the pleasure you feel.<br>\r\nAfter a not so long time, your body reaches its climax, while your already wet diaper welcomes something that is not pee, something that Amos has once called pussy juice.<br>\r\nYou moaned harder and harder, and now you are exhausted but feel extremely good. You let your body fall on the back of the horse.<br>\r\n\u201cVery good, princess.\u201d Rose says, clapping her hand and making you feel a little ashamed \u201cThat was an excellent naughty fun session. I\u2019m sure your mommy would be proud.\u201d<br>\r\nYou\u2019re quite sure that the answer to this is a no, but you don\u2019t give and weight it.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have you thought about during it, princess?\u201d she asks, smiling.<br>\r\nYou reply without thinking \u201cTo a beautiful girl.\u201d<br>\r\nYou immediately blush, realizing what have you just said. At least, you didn\u2019t make Meredith\u2019s name.<br>\r\nRose giggles, saying \u201cOh, you have that kind of preference.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt is not a problem, right?\u201d you ask, without looking at her in embarrassment.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy should it be a problem? We are not in the middle-age anymore, you know.\u201d she says \u201cCalonia is very liberal on the matter.\u201d<br>\r\nYou\u2019re glad about it, and you\u2019re so happy of your climax that you don\u2019t make a fuss when Rose picks you up and carries you back to the nursery holding in her arms.<br>\r\nShe puts you down in the nursery, saying \u201cNow, princess, it\u2019s bath time. It will put you in a fresh diaper afterward. Then you\u2019ll have your dinner and you\u2019ll go to bed.\u201d<br>\r\nShe does just that. Once cleaned, in a fresh diaper and then in the high-chair to get your dinner, the door of the nursery opens.<br>\r\n\u201cYour majesty.\u201d Rose greets the queen, who has entered.<br>\r\n\u201cI have good news for you, Susan.\u201d she says, looking at you \u201cIf you promise to behave, you can have dinner in the dining room with me.\u201d<br>\r\nYou are happy about it, and say \u201cYes!

Closer than the last time, while a maid enters and carries a tray with a steaming bowl of mush and a baby bottle.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess Susan, I am Liz and I have the duty to feed you tonight.\u201d She says and picks up the bowl and spoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, let us start.\u201d Charlotte says and starts to eat herself, while the first spoon approaches your mouth.

Grumpy you take the next offered spoon from Liz and let her feed you.<br>\r\nLiz is feeding you faster than Rose did and you finish the bowl quickly. You don\u2019t like her pace and the fact that you have no breaks to talk to the Queen.<br>\r\n\u201cIf you are that hungry, I can bring you more.\u201d Liz says and you nod, only to have some time alone with the Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you looking forward to the party?

I only want to avoid that it ruins a wonderful night.\u201d You already see Liz returning with a fresh bowl of mush and speed up your words. \u201cI was super impressed by your skills in the training area as well, and I am happy that you don\u2019t take the medicine any more, I think we can spent time together in a different way, you know?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOpen up for the airplane.\u201d Liz smiles and continues to feed, or better \u2013 stuff you with mush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Charlotte smiles weakly and takes her time to answer, while spoon after spoon is pushed into your mouth.<br>\r\n\u201cI am also happy to spend more time with you. Rose\u2019 idea with\u2026 feeding you directly was nice, but difficult to maintain.\u201d She blushes and takes another bite from her delicious smelling Chicken-Leg.<br>\r\n\u201cI do not worry about the invention of the Campbell\u2019s, they always give out a manual with all their inventions. I am more concerned that Lord Richard will be around and might cause some trouble. I will not address the case with the spy since I cannot proof it, but our relationship is very bad \u2013 as you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz is switching from the bowl to the baby bottle and holds it for you in a high ankle. The formula comes fast and some if it is dipping down your chin. You feel very much like a baby, helpless as you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOther than that I am looking forward to the party as well and hope Janet and you will have a good time. I talked to Laura and she told me that Zoey and Tabby will be at the party as well. Uhm, not AT the party, but you will have an hour or two between the party and your actual bedtime. Their parents are invited and I asked them to bring their girls. I hope that is in your interest.\u201d Queen Charlotte says and takes a sip of red wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz is smart enough to lower your bottle and allow you to answer. To your embarrassment you belch from the air you gulped down, before you can answer: \u201cSure, that will be great, even when it is only an hour or two.\u201d<br>\r\nAs soon as your words are out Liz stuff the bottle back into your mouth and you have to hold back to shout at her and tell her how stupid she is. Without being able to do anything you see the Queen getting up, walking around the table and give you a kiss on the forehead. \u201cGoodnight Susan.\u201d She says, while you just finish the rest of your baby bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, that was a nice dinner, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Liz grins and helps you out of the high chair. She really think that she did a good job and you only hope that she learn to feed you nicer or that Rose can feed you the next time \u2013 in the dining room. Liz guides you to the door, where Eden waits for you. Tired from the long day and all the food you take her head and let her guide you to your nursery, where Rose tucks you in.<br>\r\n\u201cRose, can you feed me next time? Liz is\u2026 just not good at it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose smiles down at you and gives you Mr. Rabbit. \u201cAw, she will learn it. It would bad for her if I take over from her.\u201d<br>\r\nYou could not care less, but hold our tongue.<br>\r\nRose switches off the lights and you try to fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost an hour later you have cramps and fill the seat of your diaper completely. \u201cOh\u2026 shit.\u201d You whimper and try to find a comfortable position. Your dinner had went right though you and now you face a long night in a full diaper. You decide to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She is wearing just her nighty.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, are you ok?\u201d she says, coming next to your crib, worried.<br>\r\n\u201cUmh ... can you change me, please? I can\u2019t sleep like this.\u201d you say.<br>\r\nYou see Rose expression change dramatically.<br>\r\n\u201cYou called me here for changing your diaper? Really, princess?\u201d she says, sternly \u201cYou know the rules. You\u2019ll be changed tomorrow morning.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut it stinks, and it\u2019s messy!\u201d you complain, aloud \u201cYou can\u2019t leave me like this!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEnough, little one.\u201d Rose says, in her scolding tone, calm and stern \u201cI suggest you to sleep, princess. This is just a tantrum, and you know that I don\u2019t stand them.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNanny, just this time. Come on! Do it!\u201d you say to her.<br>\r\n\u201cI give you three possibilities, princess.\u201d the nanny replies, making the sign of three with her fingers \u201cOption one: you sleep peacefully like the little angel you are capable of being. Option two: continue with this tantrum and get a spanking. Option three: beg me very politely to change you, not like a spoiler brat like this, and I will do it. Be aware, however, that option three will be followed by a suppository.\u201d<br>\r\nYou quiet down, saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll sleep.\u201d<br>\r\nShe rubs your hear, and says \u201cA very good choice, little one. And please, don\u2019t yell at me or at another grown-up. It is rude, and rudeness is punished.\u201d<br>\r\nShe puts a pacifier in your mouth and leaves. You suck at it, hugging Mister Rabbit. After a while, you finally fall asleep.<br>\r\nYou feel a warm hand waking you up in the morning. You open your eyes, and to your surprise you see queen Charlotte, smiling at you.<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, little angel.\u201d she says, sweetly.<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning to you too, Charlotte.\u201d you reply, yawning.<br>\r\nAt least, that is what you think of saying. With the pacifier in your mouth, none of your words is understood.<br>\r\nCharlotte giggles, removes your pacifier and then you repeat the sentence.<br>\r\nStill smiling, she lift you out from the crib, taking you to the changing table holding you in her arms.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, my little princess is poopy.\u201d she says, as she puts you on the changing table \u201cTime for a diaper change.\u201d<br>\r\nRose isn\u2019t around, and while the queen changes you, you ask to her \u201cHave you locked Rose in the bathroom again, Charlotte?\u201d<br>\r\nShe giggles, replying \u201cNo, not this time. I simply told her that nanny Melissa wanted to speak with her.\u201d<br>\r\nAs the queen finishes to put you in a fresh diaper, Rose enters in the nursery, a bit angry.<br>\r\n\u201cYour majesty.\u201d she says, sternly \u201cIf you want to change the princess, you can do it without tricking me outside. Really, sometimes you behave like a little girl.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s more funny, this way.\u201d the queen giggles.<br>\r\nShe\u2019s always so busy and must act in a manner appropriate with her role, which takes with absolute seriousness and devotion. It\u2019s natural that she needs to let it go sometimes. Rose is her best friend, so it\u2019s natural to do it with her.<br>\r\n\u201cFunny, uh?\u201d Rose says, apparently serious but trying her best to don\u2019t giggle \u201cWell, I can ask to nanny Samantha what does she think of your funny pranks, Lottie.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Rosie, don\u2019t do it.\u201d the queen replies, faking a cry.<br>\r\nYou three then all laughs together, and the queen takes you down from the changing table.<br>\r\n\u201cCharlotte, can you explain to me exactly how the party will work? I\u2019m a bit confused.\u201d you ask.<br>\r\nThe queen nods, and explains \u201cThere will be music and fun from 17.00 to 20.00. Then, the children will be separated from the group and will go upstairs. They\u2019ll let you have two hours of fun with the other kids, from 20.00 to 22.00. After that, it\u2019s bedtime for you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBedtime at 22.00?\u201d you say, surprised and happy \u201cCan I really stay awake an hour more than usual?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJust for this time, little one.\u201d the queen says \u201cI asked House Penrose-Glee to make an exception. Don\u2019t get used to it.\u201d<br>\r\nYou hug her, saying \u201cThank you, thank you, thank you.\u201d<br>\r\nShe smiles and pats your head, then continues saying \u201cBetween 17.00 and 20.00, children will be left at the care of their caretaker. I\u2019ll let you socialize and have fun, but many children will be in playpens or just next to their parents. So, I suggest you to socialize with adults during the time of the party, since you\u2019ll have two hours with the kids later. Always be polite and, please, if you see lord Richard don\u2019t run to provoke him.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cZoey\u2019s and Tabitha\u2019s parents are invited, right? Are they noble?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\nThe queen nods, replying \u201cZoey\u2019s father is, as Tabitha\u2019s mother. Their consorts became nobles too, with marriage.\u201d<br>\r\nShe gently moves you way from her, saying \u201cNow I must go, princess. Rose will dress you up and then you are free.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOne last question.\u201d you say \u201cThe party starts at 17.00, so I must prepare in the early afternoon, right?\u201d<br>\r\nThe queen nods again, and explains \u201cYes, princess. It is correct.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that is the reason I don\u2019t have lesson today!\u201d you exclaim, happy. But Rose shakes her head, while the queen greets you and leave.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, princess.\u201d Rose says, once you\u2019re alone \u201cYou don\u2019t have lesson because you have two free days.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut I had to lesson last Saturday. I remember it well, becouse Mr. Grairven gave me my first paddling.\u201d you state.<br>\r\n\u201cThat is because you spent the entire Friday afternoon grounded in Melissa\u2019s nursery and you skip a lesson.\u201d Rose explains.<br>\r\nYou are happy to hear it, though. This mean that you have only 5 lessons per week.<br>\r\nConcluded that, Rose proceed to dress you up. She puts you in white dress, whose lowest part remember a skirt. The skirt-like part is just long enough to cover your diaper. If you\u2019d bend over, everyone will see it. It has long sleeves and a pink band around the neck the almost seems a little scarf. On the chest is printed a strawberry, and under it is printed the sentence \u201cDon\u2019t spank me, I\u2019m cute\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cRemember that being cute won\u2019t avoid you punishments if you misbehave.\u201d Rose says, giggling.<br>\r\nYou greet her and leave (after the arrival of Eden).<br>\r\nYou decide to go to see Janet.

I am happy that I received the makup-kit.\u201d Janet snaps. Then she remembers something and comes to you. \u201cAaaand? Was it good yesterday, could you get rid of some pressure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush deep red and nod. \u201cYes, it was good \u2013 but that is all I say about it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor sure Janet tries to get more details, but you keep quiet and try to bring the makeup to her attention again. You think it is enough that Rose knows that you thought about a girl. If you tell Janet that you thought about Merry, while you rubbed yourself off on the saddle, she would not stop to press you for more \u2013 shameful \u2013 details and insist that you try something real with Merry.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, can you put a nude makeup on me. Nothing drastic, only underlining my\u2026 natural beauty?\u201d You blush about your own words. Normally you don\u2019t think you are beautiful, but at least Janet is distracted from other topics.<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I try my worst.\u201d Janet grins and starts to work on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen do you get changed? I guess after lunch, hu?\u201d Janet asks you and feel insecure.<br>\r\n\u201cI am already dressed. I don\u2019t think they change me again \u2013 except when I make my dress dirty.\u201d You say, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet sits bag, the facial brush in her hand and sighs: \u201cWhat a waste. I had hoped they put you in a sexy Lolita-dress.\u201d<br>\r\nYou give her a little slap for that. \u201cPah, I look good and innocent. You are the only Lolita on the party and I hope you get in trouble for it.\u201d You stick out your tongue, but don\u2019t mean it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI look great! And I look mature. It is NOT Lolita-style!\u201d Janet insist and needs a minute to calm down again.<br>\r\nShe is about to continue when you whisper: \u201cYou are only pissed off because Willy is not there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngry and blushing deep red Janet gets up and walks up and down the room.<br>\r\n\u201cYou BITCH! That is unfair! You could make out with Merry when you had the guts to do it. I CAN NOT! Maybe you have not noticed it, but he is diapered 24/7!\u201d She sits down and sighs. \u201cAnd he is to cute, still. \u2013 I have no clue how that will work out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can ask to change his diaper. Then you have access to the part of him that is interesting you.\u201d You grin. It was meant to be a joke, but Janet seems to think about it, before she nods. \u201cHm, that could even work! Thanks Susie, not I wipe the lipstick-penis from your cheek.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT?!\u201d You quickly look into the mirror and sees that she was joking. Basically she is already down with your makeup \u2013 and she had done a great job, making you look more sensual and still pure.<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the makeup. I hope Rose let me wear it later on as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this you help Janet with her makeup. She tries out different styles, but then sticks to a medium heavy \u201cpainting\u201d, making her look a bit older, so she could pass for a young looking adult and not a teenager. \u201cWe should visit the twins, I want to see Williams reaction when he sees me with the makeup and my dress.\u201d Janet suggested and slide into her dress. She does not wear a bra under it and very skimpy panties. From the side you can see half of her naked breasts when she lift her arms and you beg her not to overdo it at the party. She put on heels and you suddenly lack a full feet of height, compared to her. \u201cYou look very mature.\u201d You have to confess. \u201cAnd very sexy.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet thanks you and joins you and Eden in the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling from ear to ear you knock at Melissa\u2019s nursery and wait for her to let you enter.<br>\r\nJanet and you step in, seeing William, Meredith and Nanny Melissa and wait for the reactions.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s stronger than me. I live in the Royal Palace and I often consider myself like I\u2019m the prince. You are right, I should not do it.\u201d<br>\r\nYou hug him back, and both Janet and Merry hug the both of you.<br>\r\nWhile the four of your are hugging each other, you can clearly hear a passing maid saying \u201cOh, how cute they are.\u201d<br>\r\nYou separate each other from the embrace, and finally Merry says \u201cBy the way, I haven\u2019t complimented you for the makeup.

Now that you remember me, I\u2019d better change myself.\u201d she says.<br>\r\nYou accompany Janet in her room, and she comes out with a everyday clothing, saying \u201cI will put it on again in few hours, but for now I stay like this.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAny idea of what we should do before lunchtime?\u201d you then ask.<br>\r\nMerry takes word \u201cI have an idea. You wanted to meet every staff member of the palace, right?\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, replying \u201cI\u2019d really like it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know every staff member, but there are two people I\u2019m sure you haven\u2019t met yet. With them, I\u2019m almost sure that you\u2019ll have met every important servant in the Palace.\u201d she explains.<br>\r\n\u201cTwo people, uh?\u201d Janet intervenes \u201cWho are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the Palace Librarian and the Royal Chef.\u201d Merry says.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I know them both!\u201d Janet exclaims, then looks at you and adds \u201cIt would be a good idea, Susie.\u201d<br>\r\nYou look at Eden, looking for approval, and she simply nods. <br>\r\nHowever, you say \u201cI\u2019d like to, but I\u2019ll do that another time, maybe next week, after the party. After meeting the First Footman, I think I\u2019ll be a little more careful.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOk, then we are left with two options.\u201d Janet says \u201cGo to my room (we are just out of it, after all) and play videogames or play in the garden.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI think videogames are fine.\u201d you say.<br>\r\nThe siblings agree, and the four of you decide to play with videogames.<br>\r\n\u201cI suggest a little bet to get everything more interesting.\u201d Janet says with a disquieting grind \u201cAfter every match, the winner spanks the loser.\u201d<br>\r\nYou and the siblings look at each other, surprised.<br>\r\nThen, with the siblings support, you say \u2026</span></div></div>",

It will be a fair match \u2013 and we take turns, so in the end everybody plays against everybody.\u201d Janet says and grabs the controller. \u201cCome to my side cutie-but, time to earn a spanking.\u201d She grins at Willy and he sits down beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are very good at driving simulations, but Janet picks a fighting simulation, because the rounds does not take as long as it would take to drive around a circuit. \u201cOkay, best of three!\u201d She says and her avatar flies at Willi\u2019s and literary rips his ass apart. Within 17 seconds she wins.<br>\r\n\u201cUps, I am sorry, I guess I am very good at this one.\u201d She grins and starts the second round. This round does only last a few seconds longer and she grins from ear to ear when she slides back, put the controller aside and pats her lap. \u201cLooks like little Willy receive a spanking.\u201d She grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam lay across her lap and she slides rub her hand over his padded behind in a sensual way. \u201cSuch a cute little behind.\u201d She grins and begin to smack him. She is very unexperienced with this and not sure how hard she should or could beat him, but after a while she knows how to make William tense up with each slap.<br>\r\nWhen she is done he has a red face and rubs his behind. \u201cDamn it, you will be a hell of a nanny, if you like. By ass is glowing through the diaper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Merry and you play against each other and the match is very tight, but she loses after three rounds and lay across your lap, very willingly. You notice that her legs are not tight together and you wonder if she is doing that by intention.<br>\r\nLike Janet you have no clue how to give a \u201cgood\u201d spanking and cannot bring yourself to really slap her. You are so bad that Merry complains about it. \u201cHarder Susie, I cannot feel anything.\u201d She whispers and you try it a bit harder, but give up quickly. \u201cSorry Merry I am not good at this.\u201d You apologize and hug her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next match is William against you. You lose and William can show that he is already strong\u2026 . In the end you have tears in your eyes and Merry is holding your hand, while her brother is warming up your behind. You end up wetting yourself and that makes William laugh out and end the spanking. \u201cI guess our princess has enough.\u201d He grins and you stick out your tongue at him, while Meredith hugs you and rub your behind. You lay your head against hers and inhale the sweat smell of her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Merry and Janet play against each other is interesting. They both wants to win and it looks bad for Janet, when William comes from behind and tickle her sides. \u201cHey, not fair!\u201d She complains when Merry wins.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry sister, I make it nicely.\u201d Merry grins and take Janet over her knees. She is not in diapers and almost jumps off Meredith\u2019s lap when the first slap hits her panties. \u201cHey, careful!\u201d<br>\r\nMerry shrugs, but says that she is sorry, before she grabs Janet tightly and let a thunder of lighter slaps rain down on Janet\u2019s behind. Almost unnoticeable her hand goes deeper and almost hit Janet\u2019s crotch.<br>\r\n\u201cWow, wow, stop it!\u201d Janet shouts and wiggle off Merry\u2019s lap. She has weak knees and blush deep red. \u201cWe don\u2019t do that!\u201d She snaps at Merry and press her knees together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no clue what you are talking about.\u201d Merry grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have the feeling that you have missed something and ask William what was going on, but he simple grins and shakes his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEden is coughing slightly and you know it is almost time for lunch.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, two last matches. Again Willy, Janet and Merry and me?\u201d All your friends agree and you watch Janet play with William. This time the rounds last very long and you see Janet\u2019s character behave very defensive. She manages to lose against William and lay over his lap with a wide grin. \u201cGive it to me, baby.\u201d She teases him.<br>\r\nHer behind is a bit red from Merry\u2019s spanking and William is not less enthusiastic. But this time Janet lays perfectly still and accept the fast slaps of William.<br>\r\nHer face is all red when she gets up and she is panting a bit, while she presses her knees together. Finally, you understand what has been happening in front of your eyes. \u201cHey you gave her a love spanking.\u201d You whisper to William and he grins, nodding slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe match against Merry is a bit senseless. You WANT to lose and having that in mind the matches last quiet long. The issue is that Merry wants to lose as well and fights quit bad.<br>\r\n\u201cHave you finally understood it?\u201d She whispers and pokes your side.<br>\r\n\u201cSo it was your idea from the beginning?\u201d You ask back.<br>\r\n\u201cI have Janet a hind, how we can have fun without being stopped by the adults.\u201d<br>\r\nYou like her more and more and finally manage to lose against her.<br>\r\nCopying her position, you lay over her lap, with your legs slightly parted. She let her hand slide over your padded behind and press on your wet crotch. \u201cOh, that will feel good.\u201d She whispers and lift her hand to spank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am very sorry to interrupt you, but we have a tight schedule today and Rose asked me to bring the princess back in time. Can you please end this and we go back.\u201d Eden speaks up and comes to you.<br>\r\nYou and Merry blush quiet deep and you almost beg Eden to let Merry give you the promised spanking, but then you take a look at the clock on the wall and sigh. \u201cOh fuck\u2026 okay.\u201d You sigh and get up from Merry\u2019s lap.<br>\r\nYou hug her and she press a kiss on your cheek \u201cNext time, Susie.\u201d She whispers to you and you go to Eden.<br>\r\nAgain you feel betrayed especially since Janet, William and Meredith are allowed to play a bit longer.<br>\r\nGrumpy and pouting you let Eden escort you to Rose\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she sees you, she immediately takes you under your armpits and lifts you in the high-chair, dismissing Eden in your place.<br>\r\n\u201cYou can go now, miss Langdon.\u201d she says to her, while taking out two bottles of formula \u201cI take care of the princess from now on.\u201d<br>\r\nEden greets you and the nanny and leaves, while Rose looks at you saying \u201cYou could have arrived a little earlier. If it wasn\u2019t for Eden, you would have been late, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d you apologize \u201cI was playing with my friends and I got carried away.\u201d<br>\r\nRose sweetly pushes the first bottle in your mouth, and you begin to suck it.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not scolding you, princess.\u201d she says, rubbing your hair while you suck on the bottle \u201cYou must only be more aware of your schedule.\u201d<br>\r\nYou finish the first bottle, and let her taking it away.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not getting a spanking, right?\u201d you ask, while she comes closer with the second bottle.<br>\r\nAs the nanny gently puts the second bottle in your mouth, she says \u201cDon\u2019t be silly, princess. I spank you only when you misbehave. It is not that I like it, you know.\u201d<br>\r\nWhen you have finished the second bottle too, Rose takes you out from the high-chair, removes your clothes, puts you in a cute romper and puts you in the crib.<br>\r\n\u201cNow you\u2019ll take your nap. I\u2019ll wake you up in two hours like usual, at 14 o\u2019clock. Then, after your diaper change, you\u2019ll take a bath. I want be sure that you are perfectly clean.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThen it\u2019s dressing time?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\nShe nods, and says \u201cYes. At 15.30 we will leave the Palace. We\u2019ll be at Penrose-Glee Manor perfectly on time, at 17.00.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAn hour and half?\u201d you say, surprised \u201cIt\u2019s so distant from here?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPenrose-Glee Manor is not in the capital. Not only it is officially in another city, but it is in fact in open countryside.\u201d she explains, then giving you a kiss on the forehead.<br>\r\n\u201cNanny Rose?\u201d you say to her, before she leaves.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, princess? Do you need something?\u201d she asks.<br>\r\n\u201cCan I take a photo of myself with Janet one of this day? I\u2019d really like it in front of the throne, dressed in adult clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really bizarre request, princess.\u201d Rose says, surprised, before asking \u201cWhy do you want such a photo?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo Janet can show it to my former classmates.\u201d you explain \u201cI\u2019d really like to make some of them jealous. But if they see me in diapers, they\u2019ll laugh at me.\u201d<br>\r\nRose giggles, replying \u201cI think that we can do it. Just once, though.\u201d<br>\r\nYou thank her, and she turns the lights off and leaves. You hug Mister Rabbit, falling asleep.<br>\r\nWhen Rose wakes you up (perfectly on schedule) your already wet diaper is now on the verge of leaking, and is a little messy.<br>\r\n\u201cGood afternoon, princess.\u201d Rose says, smiling brightly like usual. You really like her smile, warm and pure.<br>\r\n\u201cNanny!\u201d you say, with a happy voice, starching your arms in her direction.<br>\r\nRose giggles, and taking you up she says \u201cOh, someone is happy to see me. Are you ready for going at the party, princess?\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, while she takes you to the changing table. You are very happy when she removes your wet and dirty diaper and cleans you up. Once you\u2019re clean, but still naked on the changing table, the nanny exclaims \u201cNow it is bath time!\u201d and takes you in the bathroom.<br>\r\nShe fills the bathtub. Once full, she helps you enter in it. You follow her instruction like a puppy: you\u2019re too excided for the party, it would be a terrible idea getting in trouble now.<br>\r\nAs she washes you, you distract yourself playing with the rubber dolphin you took from Melissa\u2019s nursery back when you stole the sleeping aid. Something done to avoid you a punishment, and that almost ruined a relationship in return. At least, everything turned out fine.<br>\r\nOnce perfectly clean, she takes you out from the water and dries you up with a towel. When you\u2019re dry, she takes you back in the main nursery\u2019s room and back on the changing table. There, as usual she puts on you a lot of cream and then puts you in a thick diaper.<br>\r\n\u201cNanny, can\u2019t I have the normal diaper and not the thick one, please? Just for tonight!\u201d you plea her.<br>\r\nBut Rose shakes her head, saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry, princess, but you will wear thicker diaper till the queen says otherwise. Tonight is no exception.\u201d<br>\r\nYou sigh, while she finishes the diapering procedure. Then, she makes you stand up and begins to dress you up in the dress you\u2019ll wear at the party.<br>\r\nWhile she does that, you ask her \u201cI almost forgot! What do you think of my makeup, nanny?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAfter your sleep it is almost disappeared, princess.\u201d she says \u201cBut I can put some more on you, if you want.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod and, once you\u2019re dressed, Rose puts some nude makeup on your face, with the movements of a true makeup artist. When she has finished, she lets you look at yourself at the mirror.<br>\r\nYou are almost amazed. The beautiful dress she showed you back when you first asked about is looks even more beautiful on you, and you feel beautiful too with it on. It is accompanied by a pair of golden ballet flats shoes. The golden color is not tawdry, but elegant, since it is the color of true gold, and not that golden tonality that golden things normally have. The part that you like more is lowest one, that is like a skirt of tulle: it is far less transparent than usual and quite wide, so it not only hides your diaper almost completely, but makes even difficult to say you\u2019re wearing one. Of course, looking better at it will reveal the bulge around your lowest section. And the makeup on your face is almost invisible, but makes you look cuter.<br>\r\n\u201cThis is me?\u201d you say, amazed.<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Rose says, smiling and putting her hands on your shoulders \u201cNow we must go, princess.\u201d<br>\r\nShe takes your hand and escorts you out of the nursery and through the hallways. Every maid and footman that you cross compliments you and your outfit. Despite the diaper, you finally feel like the princess you are.<br>\r\nRose takes you out of the Palace, guiding you to a royal limousine. It is not the same that got you on the city, is another one, much bigger. It must carry more people, after all.<br>\r\nThe other that will go at the party are already there. <br>\r\nJanet is beautiful, like you already saw her. <br>\r\nThe queen wears a beautiful light blue dress that looks MAGNIFICENT on her. <br>\r\nLady Kent is there too, and she wears a simple but still elegant black dress.<br>\r\nBehind the Prime Minister there is a small woman dressed with a elegant dress, that doesn\u2019t fit on her, since is seems stolen from a bit bigger woman. You catch that she must be Lady Kent\u2019s secretary.<br>\r\nThere is Eden too, dressed like usual in her silver armour. Next to her there is another knight.<br>\r\nHe is a bit elder than Eden, and has a really intimidating expression and a short beard. He\u2019s wearing a silver armour too, and you immediately recognize him as one the Man in Black you saw in America. You realize he must be Mr. Maverick.<br>\r\nThe last person that is present is placed next to the queen, and is dressed exactly like Mrs. Laura. You realize that she is an handmaid too. She\u2019s younger than her, thought, maybe just a little older than maid Alice. She has a shy smile on her face that makes you giggle.<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome, Susan.\u201d The queen greets you \u201cLet me introduce you the others.\u201d<br>\r\nShe takes your hand and takes you next to them, saying \u201cYou already know Lady Kent, and of course Eden and Janet too.\u201d<br>\r\nShe leads you in front of the male knight, saying \u201cThis is Mr. Maverick, my escort.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUmh \u2026 nice to meet you.\u201d you say to him.<br>\r\nHe doesn\u2019t reply, just nods.<br>\r\nThe queen then introduces you the other two women: \u201cThis is handmaid Patricia. She has been chosen to accompany me in this year edition of the party.\u201d<br>\r\nThe handmaid takes a bow, saying \u201cI\u2019m honored, princess.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd this is miss Justinia. She is Lady Kent\u2019s secretary.\u201d the queen concludes, taking you in front of the last woman.<br>\r\nThe secretary shakes your hand, but doesn\u2019t smile. She seems even stricter than miss Spencer, and you\u2019re not eager to find out if it is true or not.<br>\r\nYou all get in the limousine, except Rose. While you are getting in your children\u2019s seat, Rose, from out of the car, says aloud \u201cAnd remember to behave, princess.\u201d<br>\r\nYou smile at her, and the car finally leave the palace.<br>\r\nDuring the long journey \u2026</span></div></div>",

She had worked for the Kent\u2019s for a while and helped out Nanny Melissa.\u201d You try to start a conversation with Handmaid Patricia.<br>\r\n\u201cYes Princess, I know her. She had some\u2026 issues for a while\u2026 and as far as I know it was because of you. Anyway, now she is back to her regular duties. I was almost afraid that she would be chosen to go today, but she is still\u2026 not ready for that.\u201d She says and blushes herself. Although, not as much as you.<br>\r\nYou just addressed a sensitive topic. Obviously, Maid Alice is still under \u201ctraining\u201d for her special issues and the palace does not want to embarrass itself with another guest in diapers \u2013 or trainers, whatever is true right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshamed you look at the Queen, but she is still talking to Mrs. Kent, that leaves only Miss Justinia for you. \u201cAnd you are working for the Queen for a while?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFor all my life, princess.\u201d She says in a cold voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you like your job?\u201d You press on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like it a lot, especially when I can print out and staff docents of documents because a spoiled princess ruined them with hot chocolate, that days are the best.\u201d Miss Justina is not a fan of you.

NO! I am a guest, you are only a PLUS ONE, you can stay behind.\u201d You spat at her and make all heads in the car turn. Janet stares at you and tries to overplay the situation. \u201cHey Susie, be cool. It is a long ride and a bit boring, but if you look out of the window you can see how beautiful your country is. You have super high trees and lakes and\u2026 \u201c Janet is really trying her best to distract you\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI sit in the MIDDLE, in a BABY seat, I cannot see a SHIT!\u201d You shout at your best friend.

She looks at the Queen and after Charlotte nods, she pushes the sticky nipple into your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurious you try to spit the pacifier out, then you try to pull it out, but is stays firmly in place, while a nice vanilla flavor fills your mouth.<br>\r\n\u201cSusan, calm down and \u2026 stop to pull at the pacifier, it will stay in your mouth for one to two hours. We call them time-out pacifier and they are very sticky. Just suck on it and the effect will go by faster. Your behavior is not acceptable and you can be happy that we do have no space to give you a spanking. Now, calm down and enjoy the ride.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngry you suck on the pacifier that is firmly glues to your lips, while you can play with the nipple, with your tongue. You are almost sure that this is another invention of the Campbell-twins.<br>\r\nAfter a while you have calmed down and have to remind yourself to suckle on the nipple. For sure you do not want to arrive at the party with a pacifier stuck in your mouth... . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the car arrives at Penrose-Glee Manor\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We have arrived.\u201d The queen says.<br>\r\nYou slowly open your eyes, realizing that you fall asleep during the journey (and you wetted yourself, but not much).<br>\r\nAll the other are already out of the car, leaving you alone with the queen.<br>\r\nCharlotte removes your pacifier, and says sternly \u201cI really hope you\u2019ll behave, Susan. This is an important party. It is a mundane occasion, but you must know that even a mundane occasion can create a scandal for the Royal House if you behave poorly. Did you get it?\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, a little ashamed, and reply \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Charlotte. I was bored and I throw a tantrum. I\u2019m sorry about it, really. I know I behaved childish.\u201d<br>\r\nThe queen smiles and pats your cheek, saying more sweetly \u201cI\u2019m glad you learned your lesson, Susan. Now we\u2019ll go in, and I expect to see a very polite princess.\u201d<br>\r\nSaying that, she free you from your baby seat and helps you coming down from the car.<br>\r\nPenrose-Glee Manor is huge! The stereotype of a countryside manor, with a garden so big that you could play soccer in it.<br>\r\nGuests are in the garden as well, drinking and eating pretzels, but you catch that the majority of them are inside. The party already started, even if you\u2019re on schedule.<br>\r\nWhen you enter in the manor, you hear music pervades it. It is a sweet music, not something you\u2019ll hear at the disco, but still is not a boring classing music. A man dresses elegant come closer, and the queen gives him a slip of paper. He read it, and says aloud all of your names, the invited follow by his guest. When is your turn, he announce \u201cPrincess Susan Petersen of Calonia, accompanied by miss Janet Brown from the USA.\u201d<br>\r\nYou enter inside, and the festive air conquest you immediately. There are a lot of guests, and they all seem relaxed. They are talking, or dancing, or drinking. With the corner of the eye, you notice that there are kids of various age in a playpen in the corner of the big room you entered. The queen encourages you to socialize, so you greet her and leave.<br>\r\nYou expected Eden to follow you, but she and Mr. Maverick reach the first floor and watch the party from above, from a great balcony that overlooks on the party\u2019s main room. There are other people in armours with them (leathers armours, mainly) and you get they must be the escorts of the noble present at the party.<br>\r\nWhen you are speaking with a plump and sweet middle-aged lady that wanted to know you, you hear the man at the door announces something you knew would happen, but you hoped it did not happen: \u201cLord Richard Grairven, accompanied by Lady Gwendoline Rainecourt.\u201d<br>\r\nYou look at him, and your jaw almost falls down. Richard, handsome as always, is dressed in a light blue clothing with red details that makes him look a prince charming from fairy tales, and he\u2019s accompanied by the most beautiful lady you have ever seen. The woman that the announcer called Gwendoline is tall and slim, with long blonde hair that seems made of gold, moves her top model-like body with elegance and she\u2019s dressed in a black adherent dress that empathies her body and shows partially her legs, boson and shoulders. However, she seems looking at everyone with sufficiency.<br>\r\nThey are both followed by two men in armours. The one that follows the woman is dressed in leathers armour like many escorts, but the one that follows Richard wears a threatening black iron armour.<br>\r\nYou try to distract yourself, resuming your conversation with the sweet lady, trying to ignore the comments of the other guests that say how handsome Richard is.<br>\r\nAfter a while, you decide to go at the bar, where drinks are given. The man behind the counter greets you, but laughs when you ask a glass of wine, giving you a bottle of milk instead. Don\u2019t wanting to get in trouble, you greet him and begins to suck at it, when something unexpected happens.<br>\r\nRichard himself reaches the bar and asks for a shot of whisky. As he drinks it, he notices you.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess.\u201d he says, with a cold and soft voice \u201cI didn\u2019t know House Penrose-Glee invites potty pants these days.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d better watch yourself.\u201d you reply, soft voiced too \u201cI\u2019m not defenseless as you think.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHow, what can you do?\u201d he whispers, with a evil grin \u201cWhet yourself? Oh, sorry, I think you already done that.\u201d<br>\r\nYou smile evilly too, whispering \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d<br>\r\nWith this, you put the bottle down and begin to cry aloud, rubbing your eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy you\u2019re so mean? Can\u2019t you leave me alone?\u201d you sobs aloud.<br>\r\nVoices from guests begin to arrive: \u201cIs that lord Richard?\u201d \u201cHas he made the princess cry?\u201d \u201cWhat? What\u2019s happening?\u201d \u201cWhy is he bullying her?\u201d<br>\r\nRichard is furious: you are damaging his reputation, and you are really curious of how he will react now.<br>\r\n\u201cLittle monster.\u201d he whispers.<br>\r\nAfter this, however, he makes a large and kind smile (the fakest you\u2019ve ever seen), and says aloud with a sickly sweat voice \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry princess. I didn\u2019t mean to bother you talking about politics affairs. Now, now, don\u2019t throw a tantrum. Here, if you stop crying I give you this.\u201d<br>\r\nSaying this, he takes out a lollypop from his pocket, holding it out to you.<br>\r\nAgain, the guests whisper around you \u201cHe\u2019s a kind guy, uh?\u201d \u201cI knew it.\u201d \u201cWhat a gentleman.\u201d<br>\r\nKnowing that refusing it would make you look like a spoiled brat, you stop your cry and take the lollypop, greeting him.<br>\r\nRichard pats your head, and you must resist the temptation to bite his fingers. At least, the guest now whisper things like \u201cThe princess is so cute.\u201d \u201cWhat a polite girl.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019ll be a wonderful ruler.\u201d<br>\r\nYou reach the queen, that was watching you.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d you say \u201cI thought it was a good idea.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt was.\u201d the queen admits \u201cIf Richard hadn\u2019t that lollypop with him, you could have managed to damage is reputation. But he\u2019s provident. And please, Susan: it was a good idea, it\u2019s true, but I must ask you to avoid to take initiative without asking a grown up first.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, and she encourage you to have fun. You decide to look for Janet.</span></div></div>",

She is only a little bit shorter than you, but she behaves like you could carry her around \u2013 what might be true, if you would do more sports. Right now, you can only set her back down as fast and careful as you can. She wears a pink ballet dress with a tulle skirt, that does nothing to hide her diaper \u2013 or the pink skin of her upper legs that clearly shows that the wild child has been spanked recently.<br>\r\n\u201cHi! Have you just arrived? I was at the bar, but you have been gone already, you forgot your bottle! Or was that intended? I took a sip from it, so we had an indirect kiss. Oh it is so cool that you are around. Have you seen Zoey already? You will not believe it\u2026. .\u201d She is talking and talking, but then you see Zoey and you cannot help but grin.<br>\r\nThe beautiful girl is at this great party, dressed in a pink romper and plush booties. Her long legs are bare and slightly spread by a very thick diaper. On her chest you can read \u201cspoiled brat\u201d and at her neck she wears a little lock. \u201cHi. I\u2026 my mom thought I need a reminder in good behavior and made me wear this \u2013 even after I was a perfect angle for the whole week. She said I was only good because I wanted to wear something mature and sexy.\u201d Zoey says, blushing deep red.<br>\r\nYou feel really sorry for her and give her a hug.<br>\r\nWhile you hug her, Tabby is hugging the two of you and you can hear surrounding adults \u201cAhhh\u201d and \u201cOhhh\u201d, since you are so cute together.<br>\r\nQuickly you break up the embrace and try to cheer Zoey up again.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, let us meet next week. I invite you to the palace and we play hide and seek and have a great time with Janet and the twins. \u2013 By the way, have you seen Janet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoey shrugs and Tabby is looking strange at you as well, then you realize that they never seen her. \u201cUhm, sorry for that. She is as old as me, but allowed to wear mature clothes, heels and makeup. Just look for the youngest adult you can find, that should be her.\u201d You suggest.<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t want to spent too much time looking for her, but officially she is your PLUS ONE and you want to make sure she is having a good time.<br>\r\nLooking up you see Eden, looking down at you. You think about asking her for help, but first: you are not sure if you are allowed to walk up the stairs, to her and second: shouting up at her is for sure NOT an option.<br>\r\nYou continue to walk through the other guests, but walking alone is not faster than walking together with Tabby and Zoey. Almost every person that notice you wants to talk to you and you need almost an hour to pass from one side of the room to the other. Frustrated you watch out for Tabby and Zoey, but they are nowhere to find \u2013 just like Janet. For the way back, you walk at the side and finally you see Janet.<br>\r\nShe is\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I saw your scene with Richard. Brilliant!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you here alone, drinking?\u201d you ask \u201cI thought you were hunting for singles noblemen.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI am.\u201d she grins \u201cLook. There are three of four that are looking at me and at my glass of champagne. I\u2019m showing that I\u2019m not a little kid, and they are showing interest in me for this. After I\u2019ve done, I\u2019ll go to speak to the youngest and more attractive of them.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHow old do you think he is?\u201d you ask her, a bit skeptical.<br>\r\n\u201cThe one that I look at is very young, I think barely 18. But he seems out  of diapers, so it\u2019s okay.\u201d she says, smiling \u201cAnd now he saw that the princess speak with me. I\u2019m sure he will be even more interested in me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUmh \u2026 maybe I should let you alone with your prey?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\nJanet gives you a wink, replying \u201cThanks, Susan. You\u2019re really a friend.\u201d<br>\r\nYou smile, but before leaving her alone you say to her \u201cRemember that William is still at the palace.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happens in the jungle, stays in the jungle.\u201d she says, still grinning.<br>\r\nYou decide to let her alone. You enjoy the party for his entire duration, speaking with a lot of guests and with different children. Tabby reached you after a while, and Zoey just after her. You so had the opportunity to introduce to her properly, since before tonight you saw her just once when she was strapped in a pacifier.<br>\r\nYou really like her: she\u2019s the perfect balance between Merry\u2019s shyness and Tabby\u2019s extremely easygoing attitude. She\u2019s serious, calm and collected, but still quite easygoing and sweet.<br>\r\nYou really enjoy the party a lot, almost forgetting your problems with Richard and the throne, till 20.00. By then, you have wetted you\u2019re diaper more. You\u2019d really like a change, but still you\u2019re afraid of it, so you are unsure of what hoping for exactly.<br>\r\nWhen the big clock of the room says that is 20.00, ringing aloud, the adults gather all the children in a corner of the room, before resuming with the party. The queen escorted you there personally.<br>\r\nYou, Tabitha and Zoey find yourself with a bunch of other kids, at least 22/23 of them, boys and girls with an age between 12 and 17. Janet is nowhere to be found. She was right, after all: she can enjoy the rest of the party with the adults. You are happy for her, but you\u2019re still jelous.<br>\r\nA quite tall woman (every woman you seem doesn\u2019t seem so tall to you, actually, after seeing Melissa) is at the center of the group. She is dressed in an outfit similar to the one the maids at the palace wear, but much more tight and short. You catch that is not a French maid outfit, but a Japanese maid one\u2019s. She has long black hair and green eyes and she\u2019s quite young, maybe 25 or 26.<br>\r\n\u201cChildren! Pay attention to me, please!\u201d she says aloud \u201cI\u2019m nanny Melody, and I will take care of you till tomorrow morning. I will escort you in the children room, where you will be allowed to play till 22.00, then it\u2019s bedtime.\u201d<br>\r\nYou raise your hand, and nanny Melody says \u201cYes, princess? Is there a problem?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI have to questions.\u201d you say \u201cThe first one is about changing. You, know, diapers. Will you change us?\u201d<br>\r\nYou already know the answer, but you hope that she says something more, like the setting of the machines.<br>\r\n\u201cI would have done that if lord Penrose-Glee hadn\u2019t buy those machines from your palace. They will take care of changing you diapers if needed and feeding you before bedtime.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat will you do, then?\u201d a boy ask. He\u2019s 17, and clearly not happy to be with you kids.<br>\r\n\u201cI will make sure that you all behave correctly.\u201d the nanny says \u201cAs you are guests of the manor, and I\u2019m the nanny of it, I have full permission to spank naughty children that misbehave. Now, the princess had another question, right?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d you say \u201cHow should be call you? Ma\u2019am? Miss?\u201d<br>\r\nShe smiles, replying \u201cOh, I like politeness, but nanny Melody is ok.\u201d<br>\r\nYou smile at her, while she takes you all upstairs. She makes you line up in pairs, making you use one hand to hold you companion one\u2019s and the other hand to hold the shoulder of the child in front of you. You have no idea of who have ahead, but your companion is Tabby. You fill like a kindergartener, while you walk like this just in front of the escorts. You see that Eden has her and on the rapier, and looks at Richard\u2019s escort with suspicious eyes when you pass in front of him.<br>\r\nWhen the entire column has passed, Eden moves herself and closes it.<br>\r\nYou finally reach the room, and you are amazed. He\u2019s a big room with a lot of cribs for two, and two high-chair (the automatic ones) are next to each crib. All of those things are at the border of the room, while in the corner there is the diaper changing machine.<br>\r\nThe central part of the room (a big part) has a padded floor, and with a lot of toys of various types.<br>\r\n\u201cRemove your shoes, kids. Unless you have plush booties, of course.\u201d nanny Melody says, and you remove your shoes. Many other children do that, but many other don\u2019t, and you realize that plush booties weren\u2019t so rare between the kids at the party.<br>\r\nThe nanny then notices Eden, that is standing at the opened door, and says to her \u201cI\u2019m sorry, miss, but I think you\u2019re in the wrong room.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, miss, I\u2019m the princess\u2019 escort.\u201d she explains, looking around to ensure that the room hasn\u2019t other entrances.<br>\r\n\u201cYou can watch the door, then.\u201d the nanny replies \u201cBut I can\u2019t allow you inside, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s ok.\u201d the knightess agree \u201cBut if the princess calls me I will enter, taking the door down if necessary.\u201d<br>\r\nWithout giving the nanny time for answering, Eden closes the door behind her, closing herself out of the room. You think that her biggest issue is Richard\u2019s escort, and you are happy that she\u2019s there: than man in black armour frightened you.<br>\r\nThe nanny sits on a chair in the corner, and begins to read a book. You notice a big hairbrush lying on the small round table next to her, and you are not eager to use it.<br>\r\nA line forms in front of the diaper changing machine, and so you decide to wait a little to use it too. While some kids go there, other are playing. You notice that a girl about your age is alone, almost in a corner, and you decide to reach her.<br>\r\nWhen you do, you notice that she is doing something strange. Meditating, perhaps?<br>\r\n\u201cHey, hi! I\u2019m princess Susan.\u201d you introduce yourself, but she doesn\u2019t reply. You decide to touch her shoulder, and her reaction is wild.<br>\r\n\u201cYou interrupted my meditation!\u201d she yells, and jumps at you to hit you. You fall on the ground, with the girl on you, but then she is taken up by nanny Melody, that takes her to the chair and spanks her bare bottomed OTK with the hairbrush. She cries after few slaps, since they are hard, and the nanny gives her a lot of them.<br>\r\n\u201cBeing the host doesn\u2019t give you permission to assault guests, young lady!\u201d the nanny scolds her, during the spanking.<br>\r\nAs she lets her go, the girl come straight to you, saying an apology.<br>\r\nYou accept it, and ask \u201cAre you the daughter of lord Penrose-Glee?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI am.\u201d she replies, still sobbing a little \u201cAnd nanny Melody is my nanny.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy have you assaulted me like that?\u201d you ask \u201cWhat where you doing?\u201d<br>\r\nTaking a dramatic pose and suddenly stopping to sob, she exclaims \u201cI, young lady Penrose-Glee, virgin of the dark, married with the void, was looking into the future!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd ... did you see it?\u201d you ask, sceptical.<br>\r\n\u201cOf course!\u201d she says, proudly \u201cAs always!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBlossom!\u201d her nanny calls her \u201cDo you want a mouth soaping too?\u201d<br>\r\nBlossom goes pale, saying that she\u2019s sorry. Then says \u201cWell, I never saw anything so far. But I will, one day!\u201d<br>\r\nYou smile at her, and then decide to play with Zoey and Tabby.<br>\r\nYou go to them ...</span></div></div>",

I did nothing wrong! I was a good boy all day long!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny your name is?\u201d Nanny Melody asks. After hearing his name, she checked his data on a little tablet. \u201cWell Jonny, it looks like your nanny asked to give you this spanking. She attached a file to your information to make sure you receive it. Let me see\u2026 \u201c. She moved her finger down on the table and announce quiet loud. \u201cDear nanny Melody, Little Jonny refused to clean up his toys and was rude to his grandparents, please make sure he receives a good spanking and remind him to be a good boy. PS: make sure that he is not masturbating, he is a little wanker.\u201d<br>\r\nSome kids around laugh out, while others blush and look down. They probably fear that their nannies or parents added similar files to their information-package.<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks like the machine was too soft on you, little Jonny.\u201d Nanny Melody says and put his hands in locked mittens. \u201cNow you can go back to your little friends and look forward to dinner \u2013 you have additional information for that as well.\u201d The nanny grins and pats his diapered behind. Pouting the boy goes back to his friends, while Tabby looks very angry.<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, I should have known it! My daddy didn\u2019t punish me all morning and I was so stupid and even teased him about being to lazy to spank me.\u201d Zoey in her punishment romper and Blossom in her short, white dress look at her and shake their heads.<br>\r\n\u201cYou act to bratty, people could thin you like to be punished.\u201d Zoey says, clearly unhappy with her strict mother. But Tabby shrugs it off: \u201cMaybe you are right, but I see it as a game between me and my parents and maybe you have not noticed, but I am quite energetic and love any kind of interaction. I basically don\u2019t care if my daddy reads me a book or spank my behind. Important is, that he spends time with me.\u201d<br>\r\nYou still think this is stupid: \u201cHave you tried to be a good girl and spent\u2026 pleasant time with your parents?\u201d<br>\r\nTabby sighs and for the first time she looks sad: \u201cI did, but then they say \u201cGood girl, keep going.\u201d And that was it. If I am a brat, I get much more attention from them.\u201d<br>\r\nSlowly you begin to understand her and when you think about it, she might not be the only kid with that feelings. In the USA you go alone all day and have freedom to do what you like, but you only spend a few minutes with your parents. You don\u2019t even miss them much, because you have been very independent. In Calonia you spend a lot of time with your nanny and \u2013 as you noticed during the time with Nanny Melissa \u2013 you miss her very quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts drifted off you\u2019re a while and you don\u2019t notice that Zoey and Blossom get changed by the automatic changing table. You only notice it when Zoey is waddling even more than before, still, she seems happy. \u201cHa! Two booster pads to make sure I do not leak. It could be much worse.\u201d She grins. Since she has been in a romper already the changing table does not change her clothes. In Blossom\u2019s case it does. When she comes back her dress is replaced with a white romper with a cute looking angle on her chest. The last one of your friends to get changed is Tabby\u2026 .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTabitha, would you please get changed. I have directions to get you changed before dinner.\u201d Nanny Melody orders.<br>\r\n\u201cWish me luck.\u201d Tabby says and approaches the machine\u2026 .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll wishing luck did nothing to prevent her from receiving a spanking, similar to the one Jonny got before. In addition, she receives an enema and a diaper, as thick as Zoey\u2019s. Still, she smiles when she comes back to you. \u201cMy daddy did not forget me.\u201d She smiles and rubs her round belly. \u201cAnd now I am pregnant.\u201d<br>\r\nYour diaper is quite wet by now, but since you don\u2019t have to get changed right now \u2013 and you don\u2019t trust the machine, you decide to wait a bit longer. The first younger kids are looking tired and get feed by the automatic high chairs and put in the cribs. The tops of the cribs are locking automatically and some kids cry in fear, but Nanny Melody is able t calm them down. She as a bunch of stuffed animals for the kids to cuddle with, while some kids simple hug each other and fall asleep in warm embraces.<br>\r\nTabby\u2019s round belly is flat again, therefore her diaper in swollen and forcing her to crawl on all forth. She does not mind that at all and is constantly talking with Blossom, who in return is talking about her visions and dreams, whenever Tabby is taking a breath. You are happy to be with Zoey and try to talk about music.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you have been on concerts, all by yourself?\u201d The is amazed.<br>\r\n\u201cI was dropped off and picked up again, but during the concert I was alone.\u201d You say proud. Okay, it was only one concert and it was a pop band with many fans of your age, but still it counts.<br>\r\nZoey and you are asked to get feed and the two of you approach the automatic high chair. Two of the four arms grab you by the hips and lift you in.<br>\r\n\u201cERROR! Change required!\u201d You high chair blurs out and you blush deep red when Nanny Melody comes to you. \u201cAh, princess. I am sorry, but you go straight to bed after dinner. It was a long day for a coming leader and you need your rest.\u201d She press some buttons and the machine release you again. \u201cCan I have a second?\u201d You ask her, but she pulls you forward and put you on the changing table. \u201cIt is already late my dear, you can rest later one.\u201d She says and the arms of the changing table begin to undress you.<br>\r\nYou close your eyes and press down. You want to go number two before the machine change you, but your colon does not work well under stress and you only wet your diaper more. Far too quickly the automatic changing table is checking your temperature and the status of your colon.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, please no!\u201d You whimper as the thick finger enters your behind.<br>\r\n\u201cCleaning required.\u201d The robotic voice says and you feel warm water stream up your behind.<br>\r\nAfter the enema, you are thickly diapered and put in a pink romper with a pony on the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, that was not so bad, was it?\u201d Nanny Melody smiles and brings you back to your high chair.<br>\r\nZoey is already down and is lifted into the crib, while you get feed two bottle of formula. A few minutes later you find yourself beside her.<br>\r\n\u201cUhm\u2026 I am sorry\u2026 I tried to avoid the enema. Now you have to lay beside a stinker.\u201d You say, blushing.<br>\r\nZoey smiles at you and wipes some hair from your face. \u201cIt is okay. Tabby\u2019s diaper is full as well and I noticed that they use perfumed water. Little Tabby smells like flowers. Funny if you consider that she shares the crib with Blossom.\u201d<br>\r\nYou like the way she is touching your face and the way your naked arms and legs touch. She is a beauty and you share a crib with her. \u201cStrange that Blossom has to sleep in a here. I mean, it is her parents house.\u201d You wonder, but Zoey things it is because Nanny Melody wants to be able to watch her.<br>\r\nSuddenly the lights go down and your eyes need a moment to adapt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabby and Blossom are in the crib next to you and you can hear them whisper: \u201cTabby stop, nanny will spank me if I am naughty.\u201d Blossom complains.<br>\r\n\u201cHush, I am humping your leg. It is not your fault at all. Just be quiet.\u201d Tabby whispers back.<br>\r\nYou blush deep red and look at Zoey. She is laying on her side and her hand is laying on your tummy, rubbing slightly, trying to make sure that you don\u2019t have painful cramps. She is so beautiful and so nice\u2026 . And you still have Janet\u2019s words in your ear \u201cWhat happens in the jungle, stays in the jungle.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Can I \u2026 hug you?\u201d<br>\r\nShe blushes a little, but nods. You wrap your arms around her body, and she does the same. You\u2019re so close, now, that your bodies could melt and become one. Without thinking about it, you kiss her on her mouth.<br>\r\nYou think she\u2019ll go mad for this, but she holds you in place instead, kissing you back eagerly.<br>\r\nThe kiss almost drain all of your air, and when she lets you go you\u2019re panting a lot. Zoey, on the other hand, seems perfectly fine.<br>\r\nHer hands touches your little breasts, and gropes them. You have still your arms around her body, and you decide to wrap her legs too with one of yours. Her knee suddenly presses against your thick diaper, more and more, pressing against your crotch in the end.<br>\r\nZoey begins to press more, begging to rub her knee against your crotch. You feel more and more arousal. You begin to moan, and after short time you reach climax. While you\u2019re still wheezing, she remove her knee, then touches your hand with hers and guides it to her big tit. You instantly begin to grope it, and your knee automatically reaches her diapered crotch. You pay her back, making her cum rubbing your knee on her diaper. Her moans are so cute and sweet that you could eat her. While you\u2019re doing it, you feel her diaper going even warmer and wetter: after the pussy juice, she released pee too.<br>\r\nMaybe you\u2019ll both be spanked for this in the morning, but you couldn\u2019t care less at the moment. In your mind, now, this moment is worth a bottom beating with a riding crop (even if no nanny would use something like that, it would be child abuse).<br>\r\nBoth exhausted, you hug each other, and you think that Zoey is even softer than Mister Rabbit. Then you both fall asleep, after another kiss, while the back of your diaper goes heavy.<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\nYou are awaken by a warm hand, and you see the angry face of nanny Rose.<br>\r\n\u201cNanny!\u201d you exclaim, but she frowns.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess! How could you!?\u201d she yells. She takes you out from the crib and undresses you, leaving you naked.<br>\r\nShe makes you spin around, and you see Marry in front of you. While Marry speaks, Rose gives you a hard spank at her every word: \u201cHow could you, Susan? I trusted you! I thought I was special for you! Betrayer!\u201d<br>\r\nMerry begins to sob, and Rose says sternly \u201cI don\u2019t want to see you ever more. I\u2019ll let you to nanny Samantha.\u201d<br>\r\nYou try to cry, but you can\u2019t: somehow, you fell like if you deserve it.<br>\r\nNanny Samantha comes in the room, takes you by your ear and leads you to the automatic changing table.<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting, very interesting.\u201d she says, fiddling around the control panel of the machine \u201cI can set it to give you spanking with three different implements one after another. Lets see: a stick, a carpet beater and a big school paddle with holes. That is okay.\u201d<br>\r\nShe puts you on the changing table, making you lay on your tummy, and you see the mechanical arms taking out the three dreaded implements.<br>\r\nThe spanking is very hard, so hard that you pee on the changing table.<br>\r\n\u201cPathetic.\u201d Samantha comment, and then Richard enters in the room.<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re getting what you need, stinker.\u201d he grins, taking Merry\u2019s wrist with a hand and dragging her to him \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll take good care of your friend.\u201d<br>\r\nWhen Richard kisses Merry on the mouth, you almost pass out in pain.<br>\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d you jump out in the crib, beginning to cry. <br>\r\nZoey wakes up too, and says sweetly \u201cSusie? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d you sob \u201cI have an important person. I should have thought about her.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIs that the problem?\u201d Zoey says, still sweetly \u201cI don\u2019t know how thinks works in your home country, but here no one feels offended by a little naughty fun with someone else. We hadn\u2019t had sex, Susie, just a little \u2026 release, and a couple of kisses.\u201d<br>\r\nDespite her words, you still feel bad. Then the lights turns on, and nanny Melody comes to your crib.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess? What\u2019s happened?\u201d she asks. She is dressed in a nighty, and seems worried about you.<br>\r\n\u201cI had a nightmare.\u201d you say, still sobbing.<br>\r\nWhen you say that, she fiddle around the control panel, and the crib opens up. Melody lifts you up and takes you to her chair, where she sits on and then makes you sit on her lap, beginning to cuddle you.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, princess. Blossom has nightmares quite often. I know of to make them go away.\u201d she whispers, before beginning to sing you a sweet lullaby.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been naughty \u2026\u201d you sob, but feeling more calm now.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to speak to me about it? I can make you feel better, and I promise I won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d she offers.<br>\r\nYou decide to trust her, and say \u201cI had \u2026 naughty fun.\u201d<br>\r\nShe says, a little sterner but still sweetly \u201cThat is a naughty thing, you know. It\u2019s something worth a spanking.\u201d<br>\r\nYou hide your face in her boson, and say \u201cIt is necessary?\u201d<br>\r\nShe nods, replying \u201cIt is. But you\u2019ll feel better after it, I promise.\u201d<br>\r\nWith these words, she makes you lay on your tummy on her knees and spanks you on your messy diaper using her hairbrush.<br>\r\nIt is not much painful, but she was right: you feel better.<br>\r\nThe nanny takes you to the changing table, but she doesn\u2019t activate it, deciding to change you herself. She is quick and professional, but you still feel a little ashamed.<br>\r\nShe then takes you up and then puts you in the crib, rubbing your hair and saying \u201cTry to sleep for the rest of the night, princess. Tomorrow morning your nanny will be here to bring you back at the Royal Palace.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNanny Melody?\u201d you call her.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, princess?\u201d she asks.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d you whisper.<br>\r\nShe smiles and leaves, while the crib closes itself and the lights turn off. Zoey rub your back, saying \u201cRelax, Susie. Nothing bad happened.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, replying \u201cThank you, Zoey. I\u2019m sorry to have overreacted a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem, sweet princess.\u201d she replies, smiling and then giving you a quick kiss on the mouth. You don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re betraying Merry, now, and you both fall asleep, this time without nightmares.<br>\r\nThe next morning, you are awaken by Rose. She came there just to pick you up, and you thank her for it.<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, princess.\u201d she smiles.<br>\r\nAs she takes you out from the crib, you hug her tightly.<br>\r\n\u201cNanny! I missed you!\u201d you say, making her giggle.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, after a single night?\u201d she says, still giggling \u201cMy little princess\u2019 affection toward her nanny is growing, uh?\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, and you notice that the room is indeed full of adults (nannies, mostly, but there are parents as well), and the first thing you hear is a spanking, accompanied by a scolding \u201cUnauthorized naughty fun? Are you kidding me?\u201d<br>\r\nYou look who is spanking who, and you see \u2026</span></div></div>",

All you can think about is how to have the next orgasm. Wait until I tell your mommy what you did with the princess. For sure she will force the full package on you. The mittens, the double diaper, the locked onesie and the reins\u2026 .\u201d She goes one longer, but you are distracted by Rose poking your side and looking at you in a stern way. \u201cSo, you had fun with your crib-mate, princess?\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush deep red and look at your feet.<br>\r\n\u201cUhm, yes I had\u2026 but I already confessed it to Nanny Melody and got spanked for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanny Rose tries to suppress a smile.

She does not receive any kind of punishment, while she would deserve it.<br>\r\nBlossom, that had spent the night with her looks a bit tired and her left leg looks a bit red, where little Tabby had humped her for an hour cumming again and again.

She is an old witch and had a nightmare involving her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlossom nods, yaws and says goodbye, before Rose comes back and give you a little slap on your wet diaper. \u201cA light spanking and a fresh diaper after you expelled your enema?!

If you talk to Nanny Melissa, the twins will know what I did and I already left bad for Merry.\u201d You blur out and blush deep red when Rose grins at you. \u201cOh, so little Meredith is the girl you thought about in the basement? Maybe she should decide your punishment for being unfaithful?!\u201d She grins.<br>\r\nYou jump up and stomp your little feet. \u201cNO! YOU CAN\u2019T!

The most embarrassing part are the kids next in line, that are watching you while you\u2019re laying naked, getting spanked.<br>\r\nThe paddle stops, and the arms put you in a thick diaper, with 2 booster pads in it. You\u2019re already feel like having a pillow  between your legs, but then the arms take out another diaper.<br>\r\n\u201cDouble?!\u201d you try to exclaim behind your pacifier, and beg Rose to stop the machine.<br>\r\nThe nanny simply shakes her head, while the arms put the second diaper on you, followed by locked plastic pants. When the diaper changing procedure is over, the mechanical arms puts you in a shirt that covers your breasts and partially your belly, and your hands in locked mittens with the M. The machine at the end puts your feet in plush booties then lets you go.<br>\r\nYou try to move, but with all that you have between your legs you are no able to do it and you fall ahead. You don\u2019t hit the ground just because Rose takes you catches you with her arms.<br>\r\nYou cry in her boson, while she rubs your back to calm you down.<br>\r\n\u201cHush, princess.\u201d she whispers \u201cYou were very brave. I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019ll stay like this all day. But I promise you that I\u2019ll change you after dinner.\u201d<br>\r\nWith these words, she removes at least the soapy pacifier.<br>\r\nWhen all the kids are changed, you are all put in high chairs and fed. Rose feed you personally, and the same do a lot of caretakers with other children. There are just few of them that activate the automatic high chair.<br>\r\nWhen you\u2019ve finished your breakfast, Rose asks to nanny Melody, who was feeding Blossom and so was quite close \u201cCan I take your punishment means of transport? The princess can\u2019t walk right now and I didn\u2019t took it with me. I promise to give it back as soon as possible.\u201d<br>\r\nMelody nods, with a smile, while you go a little pale.<br>\r\nThe two nannies leave together, and then return with an oversized stroller.<br>\r\n\u201cNo! You can\u2019t take me out in that!\u201d you exclaim, but Rose stare make you hush.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you prefer to crawl till you reach the limousine? The choice is yours.\u201d she says, sternly.<br>\r\nYou lower your head, while Rose lift you up and puts you in the stroller, blocking you in it with baby restrains.<br>\r\n\u201cCan I say goodbye to my friends?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\nRose nods, and takes the stroller in a position where you see Zoey, Blossom and Tabby, all three of them still in high chair.<br>\r\n\u201cSee you soon, girls.\u201d you say, smiling \u201cI hope to see you all at the palace, next week.\u201d<br>\r\nThe others greet you, and Rose takes you away pushing the stroller. It\u2019s extremely embarrassing.<br>\r\nOut of the baby room, you see that Eden is sleeping on chair in the middle of the hallway, blocking the passage completely.<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Langdon!\u201d Rose calls her \u201cYou can wake up!\u201d<br>\r\nEden opens her eyes. She has stayed on guard for the entire night, and you feel a little bad for her.<br>\r\n\u201cNothing to report.\u201d the knightess says \u201cCan I ask permission to sleep a little more, while you\u2019re with the princess? Till we leave, at least.\u201d<br>\r\nRose nods, and takes you down the stairs (she has taken you down in her arms and then made a second turn to take the stroller). You see that there are still guests in the main room. Some are talking, other are sleeping.<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is the queen?\u201d you ask Rose.<br>\r\n\u201cIn a guest bedroom.\u201d Rose replies \u201cWe\u2019ll wait here until she awakes and \u2026 Janet! What have you done?!\u201d<br>\r\nRose has seen Janet while she was finishing her sentence, and couldn\u2019t avoid to immediately focus on her. Your best friend is stretching herself, since she just awoke. She has slept on the chair, laid on the bar counter, and shows evident hangover.<br>\r\n\u201cUmh? Has the earth stopped to spin?\u201d she says, sleepy.<br>\r\n\u201cJanet!\u201d Rose scolds her \u201cWhere you drunk? Really?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a guest.\u201d she argues \u201cCan\u2019t I do that?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJanet, drinking alcohol is allowed for you, but not getting drunk. You will be punished for it.\u201d Rose explains \u201cSince you\u2019re a guest I let you choose: you can lose your game console for a couple of days, or you can get a mouth soaping once back in the palace.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet thinks about it, since she never got a mouth soaping, but then says \u201cI take the soap, thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEhy!\u201d you exclaim \u201cI can get away with a quick mouth soaping too if I get drunk?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, princess, since you\u2019re not allowed to drink alcohol at all.\u201d Rose says \u201cGetting drunk for you would mean a spanking, an enema, a mouth soaping and punishment clothes for a week.\u201d<br>\r\nYou think that is not fair, but still you\u2019re happy that Janet will not be punished like that. Your best friend reaches you, and whispers \u201cNice stroller, Susie.\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, and she pats your head. After a while, you see the queen coming in your direction, followed by handmaid Patricia.<br>\r\nWhen she sees you, she sighs and asks to Rose \u201cWhat has she done this time?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNaughty fun with her crib-mate, your majesty.\u201d Rose replies \u201cI have let the automatic changing table punish her for it.\u201d<br>\r\nWhen Janet giggles in hearing it, Rose adds \u201cAnd just to be fair, I also inform you that Janet got drunk.\u201d<br>\r\nThe girl looks a little ashamed, but the queen smiles at her, saying \u201cIt\u2019s okay. A swift punishment will resolve all, right?\u201d<br>\r\nJanet cheers up and nod. The queen then looks at you, saying sternly \u201cSusan, can\u2019t you behave, for a change? You will receive a bedtime spanking for this tonight, and I will administer it personally.\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, replying \u201cBut you can\u2019t! I\u2019m already been punished!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThis is part of the same punishment, little one.\u201d the queen says \u201cAnd you shouldn\u2019t talk back to adults.\u201d<br>\r\nWhen all the others that were in the limousine with you are arrived, Rose pulls the stroller out, taking you to the limousine under everyone eyes.<br>\r\nYou notice a little car next to the limousine, and you catch that is Rose personal one. She came here alone this morning, after all.<br>\r\nYou \u2026</span></div></div>",

Janet looks like she is sleepwalking and will probably sleep for the whole ride back. Not very entertaining.<br>\r\n\u201cUhm, Rose, can I ride with you. I think you have a cute car and you might like to have some company.\u201d You ask her politely.<br>\r\nRose looks to the Queen and Charlotte nods her head. \u201cSure, she can ride with you, if she likes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Eden stands next to the two of you. The sudden present of the knightess makes you jump a bit. \u201cI am sorry, but if I am not the worst person in math, then the car has only two seats and a small trunk. And it is forbidden to take children on the lap, because of the airbags.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, really? But the Queen allowed it already!\u201d You complain and try to support your words with your hands, until you remember that they are in humiliating mittens.<br>\r\nEden smiles at you and look at the Queen: \u201cOnly her majesty can allow me to be separated during my duty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Charlotte interrupts her chat with Patricia and wave Eden into the limousine. \u201cSure, Take the child seat in the trunk and sit in the middle. Rose, you will drive in front of us, behind the Escort. We will be save.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEscort?\u201d You look around and see a police-car waiting at the end of the driveway. You can\u2019t remember if you had an escort on the way to the party, but maybe you just missed it.<br>\r\nSince that is solved you finally can get into Rose\u2019 car. For a few seconds you sit in the passenger seat like an adult, until Rose sighs and gets the seat from Eden, before she can out it in the trunk.<br>\r\nA bit grumpy you let Rose strap you in and finally the two of you starts to move, following the police car and having the big limousine in the back.<br>\r\n\u201cI am happy that we drive together. I am sacred by Miss Justina, I am sure she is evil.\u201d You say and look around, while Rose is driving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Justina is a very\u2026 correct person, she can\u2019t stand it, if people do not follow the rules \u2013 especially minors. Rose says.<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I am happy that she is not my nanny, but you. You are nice and the best nanny in the world.\u201d You make Rose blush and laugh, when you notice it.<br>\r\nIt is so nice to look outside the front window, that you almost forget about your outfit. You are already in the city when you see citizens wave at you and you wave back with your mitted hands \u2013 what makes the people stare and laugh.<br>\r\nQuickly you take the hand down again and curse by yourself.<br>\r\n\u201cYou can still wave with your mittens, princess. Remember that the press thought you would not accept the tradition \u2013 you clearly show them that you do, now.\u201d Rose encourages you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing deep red, you start to wave back to them, until your arm hurts and you sit back. You feel pressure in your bladder and let go. Your pee spread out and makes your crotch warm and wet, until the diaper absorbs it and leaves you warm and moist. \u201cWill I really become incontinence after a while? Sometimes I think I am losing bladder capacity day by day.\u201d<br>\r\nWithout taking her eyes off the road Rose reach over with her hand and grab your padded crotch.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you are still doing fine if you can hold back so much, you should not worry to stay in diapers when you turn 18, princess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please, it would be horrible to become really diaper depend and pee myself without being able to stop it.\u201d You say and earn an angry facial expression from Rose.<br>\r\n\u201cMany people are like this until they are about 17 and their parents starts to train with them. Do you think William and Meredith can hold it back for more than half an hour? Don\u2019t be arrogant, Susan.\u201d Rose is really upset with you. \u201cMaybe we should ask the Campbell\u2019s for something to take away your control \u2013 for a while, or use a catheter?! Really Susan, sometimes it still sounds like you are looking down on your citizens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to complain, but maybe she right. You are very proud that you can wait with your small or big business and minimize the time you stay in a wet diaper. \u2013 With exceptions like today, where it is clear that you will be soaked before you get changed after dinner.<br>\r\nAfter the silence stretch, you switch on the radio and listen to music.<br>\r\nRose seems to be lost in her thoughts and you only hope that she is not planning anything to make you a bit more helpless\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you arrive at the palace it is already time for lunch and you are strapped down in the stroller and pushed back in. You hate it \u2013 and that is not getting better when Merry, Willy and Nanny Melissa see you.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, one night alone and under punishment.\u201d Melissa snickers and take a long look at the mittens. You really hope for Rose to be quiet about the real circumstances, but she only shrugs and says: \u201cOnce a naughty little girl \u2013 always a naughty little girl \u2013 but that is why we love them, don\u2019t we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa laughs out and give her charges little slaps on the padded behinds: \u201cSo true. They can play later one, if that is fine for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur princess will crawl over.\u201d Rose giggles and pushes you into your nursery, where she put you in the high chair and prepares your lunch.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Don\u2019t make me drink that! I don\u2019t want to be incontinent! I\u2019ll leak!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, calm down. This will not make you incontinent, will just make you pee more and more often for a while. You wear double diaper with two booster pads, so it will be extremely difficult for you to leak, even with diuretic.\u201d she explains.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, nanny!\u201d you continue to plea her \u201cI promise I will not make fun of the other kids again!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThis is not a punishment, little one.\u201d Rose adds \u201cI simply want that you learn something. See this as a way to fell closer to Merry, if you want.\u201d<br>\r\nUnderstanding that she will not change her mind (and afraid to get a spanking too if you continue to argue) you let her feed you.<br>\r\nYou nurse at the bottle, drinking all the tasty formula. You must admit that it\u2019s even better than usual.<br>\r\nSatisfied for the lunch, even if it will have collateral effect, you smile at Rose and say \u201cThank you for the lunch, nanny.\u201d<br>\r\nRose smiles too and pats your head. She puts the empty bottle down, then asks \u201cSo, princess, do you want to talk me about Meredith? Only if you want, of course.\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, but decide that, since she already know about that, it could make you feel better speaking to someone about her.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, since I first saw her she caught my attention.\u201d you begin to say \u201cI didn\u2019t know what the feeling was. I was not aware of my \u2026 sexual preference. I was still unsecure of it.\u201d<br>\r\nRose gives you a kind smile, and says \u201cI\u2019m happy that you feel more secure, now.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI do.\u201d you confirm \u201cI really like her. She\u2019s beautiful and with a wonderful character. I must admit, however, that Zoey\u2019s body was too tempting.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I clearly see why.\u201d Rose grins.<br>\r\n\u201cI had a nightmare concerning my relationship with her, at the beginning.\u201d you continue \u201cLike if our relationship was wrong. Somehow \u2026 filthy.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, princess.\u201d Rose says, sweetly \u201cThere is nothing wrong in it. Anyone should be free to enjoy love in the form he prefer. The only important part is the consensuality of both the partners.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, replying \u201cYes, I understand it now. Nanny Melissa said that too.\u201d<br>\r\nAfter a moment of silence, you ask \u201cIf I get married a woman, the country will have two queens?\u201d<br>\r\nRose giggles, and shakes her head replying \u201cNo, princess. You will be the ruler. Your spouse, be it a man (so receiving the title of king) or woman, will have power and influence, but not as much of the throne heir. King Roy was less powerful than Charlotte, and Charlotte\u2019s mother, former queen, was less powerful than her husband, the one that inherited the throne as king. If you get married with a woman, to avoid confusion your spouse will receive the title of Princess Consort, the wife of the queen.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCalonian royal system contemplate something like that too?\u201d you say, astonished.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it already happened once.\u201d she explains \u201cOne of the kings of House Grimm dynasty married a man, and he received the title of Prince Consort.\u201d<br>\r\nWhile she finishes the sentence, you already feel the diuretic beginning to work, and you release it without fully controlling it. Still, you felt it coming and you managed to hold it back a little, so you now know for sure that the diuretic hadn\u2019t made you incontinent like the Campbell\u2019s invention did. When you wet yourself, you see Rose\u2019s satisfaction.<br>\r\nRose make you have your nap after lunch. When you wake up, even before Rose can take you out from the crib, you hear someone knocking at the door.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s me, Janet!\u201d you hear \u201cMiss Langdon is with me. Can we enter?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCome in.\u201d Rose says, and the door opens up.<br>\r\nJanet is now dressed normally, and is followed by Eden, that looks much more relaxed than in the morning.<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Langdon came in my room to pick me up.\u201d Janet says, looking at Rose \u201cShe said that you asked her to take me here with her. It\u2019s something wrong, miss Fletcher?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDid you forget, Janet?\u201d the nanny says, quite sternly \u201cYou accepted to get a mouth soaping, remember?\u201d<br>\r\nShe nods, and lets Rose taking her next to the sink.<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t like seeing this, but is at least best that when she gets spanked. Rose makes the water run from the faucet and puts the bar of soap under it. Then, holding Janet still with the other hand, she proceeds to wash her mouth with soap. Janet makes horrible faces, and drools a lot. She even stomp her feet to distract herself during it.<br>\r\nWhen Rose has done, Janet exclaims \u201cThis taste awful!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. Soap doesn\u2019t have a good taste, and Calonian soap is designed to taste even worse and to be completely non-toxic, so it can always be used on children that lie, swear or drink.\u201d Rose explains \u201cIn your case, this is for getting drunk.\u201d<br>\r\nShe then takes Janet in a corner of the room and make her put her hands on over the head, saying \u201cTwenty minutes of corner time, Janet. You must think to what you did.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet comply, and Rose takes you out from the crib. As she puts you down, she says \u201cYou can go to see the siblings and spend your Sunday afternoon with them, if you want. Janet will reach you after her corner time.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod and try to walk, but you fall on the ground for the excessive padding.<br>\r\n\u201cI suggest you to crawl, princess.\u201d Rose says, taking out two fluffy things similar to kneepads and putting then around your knees \u201cThis will make you your knees don\u2019t get hurt in the process.\u201d<br>\r\nAshamed, you crawl out of the nursery. When you are in the middle of the first hallway, you look at Eden and ask her \u201cCan\u2019t you take me in your arms? This is too humiliating.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYour nanny said you to crawl, my lady.\u201d she replies \u201cIt is true that is not my job to discipline you, but I can\u2019t interfere with her orders for your education.\u201d<br>\r\nYour face is red like a tomato, especially when in one of the hallways you cross Mr. Collin.<br>\r\n\u201cHello, princess.\u201d he says, looking at you.<br>\r\n\u201cGood afternoon, Mr. Collin.\u201d you say, without looking at him, and he simply passes away.<br>\r\nYou finally reach nanny Melissa\u2019s nursery, and you ask Eden to help you getting up to knock. With your escort help you get on your feet (you peed more during the journey between the two nurseries) and you knock.<br>\r\nWhen Melissa says that  you can come in, you see her standing in the middle of the room (like usual), and the siblings still sleeping in their crib.<br>\r\n\u201cI was about to awake them.\u201d the nanny says, without making more comments on your clothing \u201cYou came right on time, princess.\u201d<br>\r\nThe twins had peed a lot during their nap, and the tall nanny decide to change them, saying to you that you can stay and watch if you want (this makes both siblings blush).<br>\r\nYou decide to \u2026</span></div></div>",

She rolls it up and holds it in her hand for a few seconds. \u201cIt is all cold and clammy, so you wet yourself right after you lay down, little one.\u201d Melissa says, half scolding.<br>\r\nMerry blushes and avoids to look at Susan. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t help it, nanny. When I lay down and relax is just comes out.\u201d Meredith whispers, while Melissa slides a fresh diaper under her behind. Hearing her makes you feel sorry for her and again you see that your nanny was right in every way. Other kids your age, like Merry have almost no control and you \u2013 the princess \u2013 feel mature because you can hold it in for hours.<br>\r\nMelissa takes a bottle of oil and rubs it in her hands, before she begins to massage it into Merry\u2019s crotch. Her skin looked a bit red before and her nanny wants to make sure she does not get a rash.<br>\r\nFascinated you look at her working hands and notice a fresh warmth between your legs. You can\u2019t tell if you just leaked into your diaper again or if it is arousal.<br>\r\nYou would love to change Merry\u2019s diaper and rub oil over her crotch \u2013 for a long time.<br>\r\nSuddenly you feel her eyes on you and blush.<br>\r\nMeredith\u2019s cheeks are flushed as well. What her nanny is doing, is feeling very good and you would like to know what she is thinking right now.<br>\r\nShe winks at you and slides her thumb into her mouth, sucking it slowly.<br>\r\n\u201cHer perfect little mouth\u2026\u201d You think and break the eye-contact, blushing deep red.<br>\r\nNanny Melissa is done with the oil, adds a bit of cream and tapes Melissa in a fresh diaper, before she is dressed in a pink onesie that has a bunny-tail.<br>\r\n\u201cEastern is coming.\u201d She grins and gives Merry\u2019s behind a little slap, before she lifts her off the changing table. Merry is coming to you and lays her hands over your mitted hands, binding them to the high chair.<br>\r\n\u201cYou have been naughty, Susan?!\u201d She whispers and you are not sure if she is talking about the last night or about the way you watched her.<br>\r\nHer grip is tightening up and she comes even closer. \u201cSeeing you so helpless is giving me a little thrill.\u201d She whispers and you blush deep red. Nanny Melissa is busy lifting Willy on the changing table, complaining that he is getting too heavy for her and you use her distraction.<br>\r\n\u201cIf that turn you on, I should tell you that Nanny Rose gave me diuretics. I am helplessly wetting my super thick diaper \u2013 that is so thick that I can\u2019t walk in it.\u201d You whisper back in a low voice.<br>\r\nMerry is biting down on her bottom lip and makes a little \u201cmeow\u201d, while she grins at you.<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a kinky girl, Meredith Kent.\u201d You say and lean over to kiss her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY GUYS, WHAT HAVE I MISSED?\u201d Janet is walking in, totally unaware that she just interrupts a sexy chat of Merry and you. A second later she freezes and look at William. Like his sister he had shows signs of rash and got a similar treatment like his sister. The difference is, that it is VERY obviously that the likes it.<br>\r\n\u201cHowls Pony I am shocked!\u201d She jells out and William slaps his hands in front of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Janet, if you can\u2019 keep your unwanted remarks to yourself, you better leave.\u201d Melissa snaps at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet blushes deep red and apologizes. She comes to Merry and you and grins. \u201cHave you seen that? I guess the noble yesterday could not offer something like this.\u201d<br>\r\nYou sigh and Merry does the same. She knows what her brother looks like, down there and you could not care less.<br>\r\n\u201cAh, sorry, wrong audience.\u201d Janet grins and slaps you back. \u201cWhat about you, saw something sweet and juice as well?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJANET! SHUT UP!\u201d You shout at her. \u201cARE YOU IN HEAT?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls! Up to the corners, all of you \u2013 yes, Janet as well \u2013 and stay quiet for a while.\u201d Melissa barks at the three of you. She sighs and finish to change William. He is put into a white onesie with a bunny tail as well.<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Isn\u2019t that a bit girly?\u201d He complains, but only receive a slap on his behind.<br>\r\n\u201cIf you complain more you will wear bunny ears as well, young man.\u201d Melissa scolds him.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, you can leave now, all of you. Go playing, but behave!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet and William run out, while Merry walk next to you, while you crawl on all forth.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry for being so slow.\u201d You apologies to her.<br>\r\n\u201cIt is okay, you look almost perfect.\u201d She grins and run to her nanny.<br>\r\nA few seconds later she comes back and touch your behind. \u201cWhat?\u201d You ask and see the cat tail, attached to your onesie.<br>\r\n\u201cTwo rabbits and a cat, do you think Janet your wear a dog-tail? Merry grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would suit that bitch.\u201d You grin and look forward. Your best friend is holding hands with William and you wonder what the four of you could do today.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, we could do roleplaying.\u201d Merry suggests.<br>\r\n\u201cIt might be a bit childish, but we can play\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She always lies!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, the teacher lies?\u201d \u2018mommy\u2019 Janet says \u201cThat\u2019s enough, young lady! You earned yourself a good, old fashioned spanking. Come over my knees!\u201d<br>\r\nYou crawl to her, and Janet takes you on her knees, then gives you two playful swats on your plastic pants.<br>\r\nShe then scolds you, saying \u201cHave you learned your lesson, young lady?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes mommy! Please, no more!\u201d you exclaim, faking a cry.<br>\r\nJanet makes you sit on her knees, and you hug her with your mitted hands, while she begins to cuddle you, saying \u201cMommy doesn\u2019t like to spank her little angel, but you must learn that school is important.\u201d she says.<br>\r\nWilliam then makes his entrance, saying aloud \u201cDears, I\u2019m home.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome, dear.\u201d Janet welcomes him \u201cHow was work today?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTiresome.\u201d he replies \u201cI had to sign a lot of paperwork\u2019s. Being the Prime minister is difficult, but I know I do something really important. And you my dear?\u201d<br>\r\nJanet smiles at him, replying \u201cOh, I spent all day at home. Being an housewife is difficult too, even if I can spend a lot of time with my naughty angel.\u201d<br>\r\nYou take your hands toward Willy, saying aloud \u201cDaddy! Daddy!

Feel lucky that I don\u2019t put you in locked onesie this time, missy.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, the locked onesie no, please daddy!\u201d you cry.<br>\r\n\u201cHush, little one.\u201d Janet cuddles you \u201cDaddy said that this time he will not put you in that.\u201d<br>\r\nMerry then decides to make her entrance too, and says in a cute voice \u201cAunty Janet! Uncle Willy!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, look at who the stork let us on our door.\u201d Janet says, smiling at her \u201cCome closer, dear.\u201d<br>\r\nMeredith reaches you, saying \u201cCousin Susie! I\u2019m Merry! Mommy said that I\u2019ll spend some days with you.\u201d<br>\r\nYou smile at her, saying \u201cWelcome, Merry! Do you want the special welcome of the family?\u201d<br>\r\nMerry nods, and Janet puts you down, before patting her laps.<br>\r\n\u201cA welcome spanking, then.\u201d she grins.<br>\r\nYou think that Janet is turning into a spanko, but you keep this thought for yourself.<br>\r\n\u201cBut aunty!\u201d Merry says, stomping her foot \u201cIt\u2019s not right! I didn\u2019t do anything!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, it seems that the welcome spanking just turned itself into a punishment spanking. Dear, can you fetch me a hairbrush?\u201d Janet says.<br>\r\nWilly lends his hand toward Janet, and she pretend to take something from him.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, dear.\u201d she tanks Willy.<br>\r\nHe grins, looks at Merry and says \u201cYou\u2019d better lay on auntie\u2019s lap, if you don\u2019t want to get worse.\u201d<br>\r\nPretending to be an unruly child, Merry stomps her foot again and crosses her arms at her chest, saying \u201cNo! You\u2019re mean! I\u2019m a guest!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMerry.\u201d Janet says, in calm and stern tone \u201cNow you\u2019ll get your spanking, or a mouth soaping will follow.\u201d<br>\r\nSighing, Merry lies over Janet laps to receive two playful slaps.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that this can be a lesson for you, young lady!\u201d Janet scolds her.<br>\r\nMerry is doing her best to don\u2019t laugh, and Janet puts her sitting next to you and says to you \u201cYou can play with your cousin, while mommy and daddy have a private moment.\u201d<br>\r\nWith this, Janet takes William\u2019s hand and takes him at the corner of the room, almost out of your field of vision.<br>\r\n\u201cMerry special attack!\u201d Meredith suddenly says, hugging you and giving you a kiss on the mouth.<br>\r\nYou hear Eden giggling at it, but she immediately stops.<br>\r\nYou kiss Merry back, and you see with the corner of the eye that Janet and William are kissing each other too.<br>\r\nMerry\u2019s kiss is delicate and sweet, completely different from the one full of lust that Zoey\u2019s gave you last night. <br>\r\nSuddenly, while you\u2019re still sharing a long kiss with Merry, Janet comes closer and says \u201cAh, ah, ah! No kissing, little girls! You\u2019re cousins!\u201d<br>\r\nYou play home for the entire afternoon. It is very funny, but at the end you\u2019re quite tired.<br>\r\n\u201cThis was a wonderful afternoon.\u201d you declare aloud \u201cBut I think I\u2019d be better going back to my nursery. Rose promised that she will take me out of all this after dinner, but I must get a bedtime spanking from the queen too.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe queen herself will spank you?\u201d Merry says, blushing a little \u201cIt\u2019s a great honor, Susie. You should be grate for it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a spanking, I\u2019d prefer avoid it completely. Sadly, I can\u2019t.\u201d you try to put a hand on your plastic pants to feel if your diaper is soaked or not, but whit mittens you can\u2019t catch it. For sure it\u2019s full of pee, and you popped quite a lot as well.<br>\r\nThen William adds \u201cBut the queen is like your mommy, here, right? You should be grateful that she come to see you, even if is to administer a punishment. I don\u2019t remember last time mommy punished us.\u201d<br>\r\nYou understand it. It\u2019s similar to what Tabby said at the party. Still, it\u2019s note the same for you. You really like Charlotte, but it\u2019s inevitable that you feel closer to Rose than to her, since the queen is not your mother.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll thank her for her time, even if is for a spanking.\u201d you say \u201cBut I really hope to get no spankings at all tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\nWith these words, you greet your friends and crawl out of the room, making giggle them all.<br>\r\nYou\u2019re almost at the nursery, when you meet someone in the hallway.<br>\r\nIt is \u2026</span></div></div>",

I did not mean to embarrass you, but you look so cute \u2013 and funny thing, you look almost like little Zoey when I left her an hour ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have seen her? I heard what her nanny said about her punishment, but only a part of it. I could hardly believe she will really be punished so harshly for some simply naughty fun.\u201d You look up at the handmaid.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Zoey has a long history in getting in trouble for naughty fun, that is the reason her mommy and nanny are so strict with her. I had a tea with Zoey\u2019s mom and saw the little one in a baby bouncer. She is thickly diapered, like you and her hands are in mittens as well \u2013 but hers are always tied down, to make sure she is not rubbing her crotch with them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, she is punished, just like me?!\u201d You say, a bit relived that Zoey is not treated soooo bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, she will receive this treatment for three days, even at school, where her classmates will tease her merciless. She can\u2019t go to her soccer-training and will lose her position in the coming match. She is punished enough I would say.\u201d Mrs. Laura says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you are in the palace you have forgotten that other kids go to usual schools. Sure, they will all be in diapers, but it is not hard to imagine that Zoey will be bullied a lot if she is defenseless in mittens and thick diapers.<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 I was not aware that she is not homeschooled \u2013 or playing soccer. I am sorry for her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe will survive it, princess, like you will.\u201d She ruffles your hair, but quickly steps back when she catches the smell coming from your diaper. \u201cDon\u2019t let me hold your back from getting changed princess, you need it badly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wish her a nice day and continue your journey to the nursery.<br>\r\nRose is already waiting for you and has you out of the diaper in a few minutes. The bath that follows takes much longer and is very relaxing. Smelling fresh and tried up in huge fluffy towels you walk back to the main room. You are a bit afraid to be without a diaper, since you are not sure if the diuretics still effect you, when you see the Queen coming in and sit down on the wooden chair.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, I hope you have not forgotten about your punishment.\u201d She says in a strict voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Queen Charlotte, I haven\u2019t.\u201d You bow your head.<br>\r\nYou look at her beautiful blue dress and turn to Rose. \u201cUhm, Nanny Rose, I fear that I will leak when I am spanked. Could you put me in a diaper, so I do not make a mess on the Queens nice dress?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte looks down on her dress and smiles at you. \u201cThank you for liking my dress. I like it as well, but do not worry.\u201d She says, takes a thick nighttime diaper and lay it over her knees. \u201cIf you should leak, the diaper will absorb it. So, I can give you a nice bare bottom spanking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the diaper on, it would hurt less, but you still go to her, let your towel fall to the ground and climb on her lap, stark naked.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for spending your time on my punishment. I am sorry that I am such a bad girl, that we can not spend time on nicer things.\u201d You say and really mean it.<br>\r\nCharlotte is surprised about your words and hesitates to spank you.<br>\r\n\u201cI would love to spent more time with you as well, Susan.\u201d She says, clears her throat and begins to spank you.<br>\r\nAnybody can see that she would rather hug you, that spank you and therefore she only gives you ten halfhearted slaps, before she pulls you into a tight hug, pressing the air out of your lungs.<br>\r\n\u201cOh Susie, you will be a very good Queen one day. You learn quickly and are good with words \u2013 if you think about them. Would you mind if I put you in a diaper now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor sure you do not mind, even when Rose is better at it. Charlotte needs more time and you blush deep red when Rose tells her that she has to add two booster pads, because you always wet yourself so much during the night.<br>\r\nThickly padded Charlotte takes the pink roper from Rose and put in on you. You are happy that you don\u2019t get the mittens back on and can hold your bottle yourself after you are put in the high chair for your dinner.<br>\r\n\u201cGood night now, I am very sorry, but I have to go. I have an official dinner with the deputies of the noble houses.\u201d She sighs and turns to leave.<br>\r\n\u201cGood night mommy.\u201d You say to her. You are not sure if you overdo it. After last night you want her to be happy and you know that the little \u201cm-word\u201d is pushing her buttons.<br>\r\nOverjoyed she looks at you a blow you a kiss. \u201cGood night Susie. Be good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose lifts you out of the high chair and lay you down in bed.<br>\r\n\u201cUhm, nanny Rose, are you sad when I call the Queen mommy? I mean\u2026 the two of us a re still closer. It is just\u2026 I want her to be happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose lifts her nose and makes a snorting noise. \u201cPAH! As if I would care. I can be the meaning nanny in the world if that helps you to feel closer to the Queen.\u201d<br>\r\nShocked you look at her and feel your fresh diaper grow warm and wet. \u201cRose\u2026 I\u2026 .\u201d<br>\r\nBut then Rose giggles, sticks out her tongue and tickles your sides.<br>\r\n\u201cAw, cutie pie, do not worry. I am happy to be your nanny. I still love you and I am not jealous if you call my good friend mommy. We all love you and want you to be happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved you takes Mr. Rabbit in your arm and wiggle your behind under the sheets.<br>\r\n\u201cUhm, I still pee a lot and with close to no warning. Will the effect last longer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose gives you a kiss on the forehead and lay your overnight bottle in your arm. \u201cWell princess, the effect\u2026 .\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You see sitting down on her chair, smiling.<br>\r\nYou then look at the queen, saying \u201cNo problem at all.\u201d<br>\r\nThe queen lifts you on the changing table, removes your romper, makes you lay on your back and un-tapes your diaper.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, my little princess is very wet and messy.\u201d she says, with a voice that would have suited if used to talk to a toddler \u201cLet\u2019s get her nice and clean.\u201d<br>\r\nCharlotte proceeds to remove your dirty diaper and to clean your back and crotch. Once you\u2019re cleaned, she rubs baby oil and baby powder on you and put you in thick diaper.<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t I still have a normal one, please?\u201d you ask, but Charlotte shakes her head.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Susan.\u201d she says, taping the diaper close \u201cYou\u2019ll wear thicker diaper since I think it\u2019s okay. And furthermore, with the diuretic still doing its job it would be non wise to put you in thinner diapers.\u201d<br>\r\nOnce you\u2019re diapered, Charlotte puts you in the clothes you\u2019re going to wear for the morning.<br>\r\nIt is a little kid jammies, like the one in the shape of a unicorn Rose once made you wear. This is large too, but is in the shape of a lion (and as the color of one, too), with a tail and a hood that seems surrounded by a mane, with ears and eyes too.<br>\r\n\u201cThese jammies are embarrassing!\u201d you say, as she dresses you \u201cCan\u2019t I wear something else?\u201d<br>\r\nBoth Charlotte and Rose giggles, and the queen says \u201cI would never deny my cute little princess the privilege to wear cute little clothes.\u201d<br>\r\nShe takes the hood up and gives you kiss on the forehead, before greeting you and leave.<br>\r\nAs she has gone, you decide to investigate on Calonian school system. Since you have a private teacher, it\u2019s something you\u2019re quite curious about.<br>\r\n\u201cNanny Rose, can I ask you something?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\nRose nods, replying \u201cOf course, princess. What do you want to know?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s about school. I\u2019d like to know how it works in Calonia, since I have a private teacher.\u201d you say.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Calonian kids spend a lot of time in school, like the students in the USA, I think. The only difference is that public school has a different \u2026 setting.\u201d she says,<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, in Calonia children start in kindergarten and compulsory education last till one is 18.\u201d Rose explains \u201cBut elementary school, secondary school and high school work exactly like kindergarten. The only differences are the subjects. A high school kids studies algebra, for example, but still have nap after lunch and a little playtime.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the punishments?\u201d you ask \u201cAre the kids subjected to corporal punishments?\u201d<br>\r\nRose shakes her head, saying \u201cNo. Since it would be difficult to control every teacher to ensure no one abuse his role as educator, corporal punishment are forbidden in public schools. They use the demerit system, the same that Miss Spencer uses on you and the siblings. Teachers can spank in private schools, however. There, they use paddles, like the one Mr. Grairven has.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the bullies?\u201d you ask \u201cMrs. Laura told me that her classmates will tease Zoey.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJust a bit, since humiliation is a part of the punishment.\u201d Rose explains \u201cBut if someone exaggerate, he or her will receive demerits. And just to give a complete explanation: headmaster (or headmistress) can paddle students, under some circumstances, so if someone really exaggerate too much, that someone gets a paddling. Our system, with parents that strictly control kids activity at school thank to the demerit system and occasional paddlings from the school headmaster, ensure the smallest quantity of bullies in the entire world. Bullying is almost not a problem at all, here.\u201d<br>\r\nYou listen to her carefully, and you\u2019re happy to hear that bullying is not a problem here, but sad thoughts suddenly envelop your mind and you begin to cry.<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, what\u2019s happened?\u201d Rose says, surprised, and immediately hugs you.<br>\r\n\u201cI was thinking about a friend of mine.\u201d you say, calming down \u201cShe was forced to change school because of bullying. I never saw her again. I\u2019m happy to hear that here bullies are properly treated.\u201d<br>\r\nRose cuddles you in her arms, saying \u201cBullies usually do that because at home they don\u2019t get enough attention. In Calonia, kids are always given the attention (and the discipline) they deserve.\u201d<br>\r\nYou let her go, and when Eden comes to pick you up you greet the nanny and leave with the escort, looking for Janet.<br>\r\nWhen you reach her room, however, you hear her talking. You decide to eavesdrop, curious to know who is she talking too.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, mom, I\u2019m not surrounded by male slaves that wash my feet!\u201d you hear her exclaim, and you realize that she is talking with her mother at the phone \u201cAnd yes, I\u2019m still virgin, thanks for reminding me that.\u201d<br>\r\nYou decide to knock and, when you enter, Janet \u2026</span></div></div>",

She holds her hand over the mouth-part and whispers to you.<br>\r\n\u201cHer imagination is going while. She got her fingers on a Calonian online-newspaper and I was stupid enough to tell her that I was on the party as well. Now she is going ballistic.\u201d<br>\r\nShe put her ear to the phone again and nods her head.<br>\r\n\u201cYes Mom, I am still listening. \u2026 No I am not sounding annoyed, I am sounding like always \u2026 not I am NOT always annoyed by you\u2026 maybe I am now. WHAT? Oh, you know why\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2026 Whould\u2026 I\u2026 . MOOOOOM!\u201d She gives up and press the phone into your hand. \u201cGood luck with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Mrs. Brown, It is me Susan.\u201d You try your luck.<br>\r\nMrs. Brown is still furious, but calms down a bit. What is very nice, since she was shouting before and you could not understand her at all.<br>\r\n\u201cHi Susan, I am sorry I must sound like a lunatic, but I spend hours reading online about your\u2026 country and I always had the impression that you are very\u2026 strict with children. I was even afraid that my little Janet would be punished according to your harsh rules. Pah, I was so worried that I thought about ordering her back to the state, but NOW!\u201d Her voice is getting louder again.<br>\r\n\u201cNow she tells me that she went to the party and was treated like an adult! I know that that means! I am 33 and have a 14 years old daughter that will turn 15 soon. She does not need to repeat MY mistakes!\u201d You can tell that she is close to tears, therefore you decide to tell her about the last days, including all embarrassing details. Janet goes pale when you tell her mom, that she Is wearing training pants for most of the time and got spanked a couple of times.<br>\r\n\u201cBut what about the party?\u201d She asks again.<br>\r\nNow it is getting difficult, since you don\u2019t want to lie.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Janet was under the strict eyes of the Queen and a high number of guards. She never behaved in a way that would be against our strict rules. Yes, I saw her holding a glass of Champagne to impress a boy that was a few years older, BUT she never left the party with him and \u2013 as you can tell \u2013 she is sober and does not have a hangover.\u201d<br>\r\nMrs. Brown is not saying anything and when the silence stretch you continue.<br>\r\n\u201cReally Mrs. Brown. Janet is behaving very well. She became a good friend of my personnel guard and they offered her to work as a knightess, when she likes. Everything is fine.\u201d<br>\r\nSuddenly Mrs. Brown is starting to cry loud.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Thank you. Thank you Susie, I was only afraid that my baby would have a baby soon.\u201d You turn the phone away and press your hand over your mouth to suppress your laughing.<br>\r\n\u201cAhm, no, To be honest \u2013 the boy she has her eyes on for most of the time is diapered all around the clock for the next four years. Therefore it is very unlikely that you will become a grandmother soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet is boxing your arm for that, but you quickly step away. Her mother is giggling now.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, that sounds good. I am sure she will not sleep with him as long as he is not potty trained.\u201d<br>\r\nYou have heavy doubts, but you can suppress a rube answer.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Susie, give Janet a kiss from me. I call her later again. Bye!\u201d<br>\r\nShe hangs up suddenly, but you keep the telephone at you ear and begin to fake the discussion on.<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, I think as well that Janet should be in diapers as well. Yes, that would make is absolutely save.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! MOM!\u201d Janet runs to you, but you step away and keep the telephone.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, she should be punished as well \u2013 EVEN STRICTER?? If you think so, Ma\u2019am.\u201d You grin and finally Janet is able to rip the phone out of your hand.<br>\r\n\u201cMom, really? Mom? MOM?!\u201d Janet looks at the phone and notice that the call has been ended half a minute ago.<br>\r\n\u201cSUSAN, YOU BITCH!!\u201d She jumps at you and pins you down on the ground. Eden is so surprised that her hand goes to her sword, but then Janet grins and begins to tickle your sides.<br>\r\n\u201cYou naughty little kitten, I will teach you to play pretend with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she tickles you merciless for a few minutes. Until she smells something.<br>\r\n\u201cOh Susan, really? How long will you stay in that diaper?\u201d She asks and jumps off you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are ashamed yourself, but blame her. \u201cIt was your fault! You sat on my tummy and tickled me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet shrugs and helps you to your feet. \u201cWhatever you say, little kitten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am a lion!\u201d You pout, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet looks amused.<br>\r\n\u201cSure you are \u2013 Meow Meow!\u201d She grins and plays with your tail.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what are we doing today?

And she and the Butler shared a lot of fun with that, after it. And the one with the wine wasn\u2019t really a prank, but more a plan, like the one that I thought to solve the problem afterward creating a fake Richard\u2019s agent.\u201d she replies \u201cNow I was planning something much more innocent, harmless and fun.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d you say, looking at her \u201cBut if I think it\u2019s too much, I\u2019ll will say no.\u201d<br>\r\nWith a grin, Janet takes out a red whoopee cushion.<br>\r\n\u201cI was thinking to embarrass someone a little.\u201d she says, still grinning.<br>\r\n\u201cWhere the fuck you got that, Janet?\u201d you ask, surprised.<br>\r\n\u201cNo bad words, or you get a mouth soaping.\u201d she teases you, before answering \u201cI bought it in the capital, when we went outside.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd who are you planning to use it on, tell me.\u201d you say.<br>\r\nJanet grins again, and says \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s secretary, miss Justinia.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019ll make our behinds bright red if she discovers us, are you aware of this?\u201d you tell her.<br>\r\nBut Janet shakes her head, replying \u201cShe will never discover us. I have a perfect plan.\u201d<br>\r\nYou are a little afraid of the stern secretary, but she made you suck on a time-out pacifier, after all, and you think that a little payback is needed.<br>\r\nAs you two march toward her office, followed by Eden, who doesn\u2019t make any comment on the situation, Janet asks you \u201cMaybe we can call the \u2018twins\u2019, before preparing the cushion?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThey are with Miss Spencer for their morning lesson.\u201d is your answer, and the conversation dies there.<br>\r\nWhen you finally reach Lady Kent\u2019s office, you see that the door next to it has a plate with \u201cPrime minister\u2019s secretary\u201d written on it. That is the right door.<br>\r\nJanet knock at it, and nobody replies. Your friend looks at you, grinning, and opens the door. You enter in the room, and you notice that it is a much smaller copy of the minister\u2019s one.<br>\r\nWith few movements, Janet hides the cushion between Justinia\u2019s wooden chair and the chair\u2019s thin pillow.<br>\r\nYou hear that someone is coming, and you immediately start to panic.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat shall we do, now?\u201d you exclaim, but keeping a low tone of voice, while in the excitement you wet yourself more.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d replies Janet, opening a big wardrobe \u201cLet\u2019s hide here.\u201d<br>\r\nYou reach the wardrobe and enter in it with Janet.<br>\r\n\u201cEden!\u201d you call you guard \u201cPlease, hide with us.\u201d<br>\r\nYou see are amused about the situation, and she complies. Once she\u2019s inside the big wardrobe, you all hide among the clothes and Janet closes the door. You can\u2019t see anything, but you can hear what happens.<br>\r\nThe office door opens up, and two persons come inside.<br>\r\n\u201cI will print these documents as soon as possible.\u201d you hear the first voice saying. It\u2019s clearly miss Justinia.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Justinia. But first, I\u2019d like to talk about the request we got the other day.\u201d replies the other voice, clearly belonging to Lady Kent.<br>\r\nThey speak of something you don\u2019t fully understand, since Justinia sits down and a loud fart (created by the cushion) is heard.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lady Kent!\u201d you hear her say, with a mortified tone.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a problem, don\u2019t worry.\u201d lady Kent\u2019s reply.<br>\r\nMiss Justinia stands up, to take a paper, judging by the sound, and when she sits down again another fart is heard.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m desolate, really!\u201d she exclaims.<br>\r\nJanet giggles a little. She positioned it so well that the secretary hasn\u2019t even realized that she\u2019s not doing it herself.<br>\r\nOnce again, Lady Kent says that is not a problem, but then it happens again.<br>\r\n\u201cJustinia, maybe we should discuss this after you have gone to the bathroom?\u201d you hear the Prime minister suggest.<br>\r\n\u201cBut I clearly don\u2019t feel the need to go!\u201d the secretary exclaims \u201cThis is strange!\u201d<br>\r\nYou hear the Lady sighing and leaving the room. You do your best to don\u2019t giggle, but then you hear the fart sound again, this time however followed by the secretary\u2019s sentence \u201cWell, well. Someone is having fun behind my back. This cushion was responsible for that!\u201d<br>\r\nAfter saying these words, she leaves the room in hurry, yelling with full lungs \u201cPRIME MINISTER!\u201d<br>\r\nDon\u2019t wanting to get in trouble, and thinking that you had enough fun, you leave the room with Janet and Eden.<br>\r\nOnce safe in another hallway, you and Janet bursts out laughing. You see that even Eden is giggling a little.<br>\r\n\u201cPrime minister!\u201d Janet mocks the secretary imitating her voice, imagining the rest of the conversation \u201cIt was a cushion! Someone pranked me! If I catch them, I will spank them till they are sore!\u201d<br>\r\nYou laugh, and reply \u201cShe doesn\u2019t even thought to look in the wardrobe. It was a so obvious place to hide that I was scared she would have done that first.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I know people like her too well.\u201d Janet replies, winking at you \u201cFirst they think about apology to their superiors, and only then they search the culprits.\u201d<br>\r\nYou immediately stop to speak about the prank when you see an old maid dressed in more complicated clothes than the other. You immediately recognize Amelia, the Housekeeper.<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Mrs. Amelia.\u201d you greet her.<br>\r\nAmelia smiles at you, replying \u201cHello to you, princess. I\u2019m glad to see you. I never had the opportunity to speak with you, so far.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI saw you only once, in the garden.\u201d you remember \u201cYou were talking to maid Alice.\u201d<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t add anything else, since you don\u2019t want to tell to the only female servant in the palace (nannies excluded) with the authority to spank you that you eavesdropped their conversation.<br>\r\nMrs. Amelia pats your head, on the hood, smiling, and says \u201cWhat a cute little lion.\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, thanking her. She then adds \u201cAre you behaving, princess?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course!\u201d you reply \u201cNanny Rose spanks me if I don\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\nShe smiles again, then greets you and leaves saying \u201cI\u2019m quite busy, princess. I hope we can spend a little more time together, next time.\u201d<br>\r\nYou greet her too, and you must admit you\u2019re surprised. As in the only occasion you saw her she was scolding Alice, you thought she was stern like Mr. Collin. She\u2019s IS severe, for sure, but maybe she\u2019s more Rose-like.<br>\r\nJanet puts an hand on your shoulder, saying \u201cThe prank was successful, and we still have time before lunch. What do you think we should do, little kitten?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a lion, not a kitten!\u201d you exclaim, in a cute voice.<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, Nala.\u201d she teases you, playing with your tail \u201cYou\u2019re a wild and ferocious lion that hunts in the savanna, not a little kitten that is made wear a diaper to don\u2019t pee on the carpet.\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush furiously, replying \u201cWell, my mom doesn\u2019t know. Yours knows that you\u2019re in training pants.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEhy! That was a low blow!\u201d Janet exclaims \u201cYou even said to her that I have my eyes on a diapered boy!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s the truth.\u201d you say, candid \u201cDid you prefer that I told her that I didn\u2019t know what happened exactly between you and the pray you were looking after? Or that you got drunk, even if not so much, and got a mouth soaping for it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d Janet sighs \u201cYou really want to know what happened with the young noble.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, and Janet replies \u2026</span></div></div>",

Therefore, I started to drink more and more until I had an excuse to go to the toilet and leave him behind.\u201d<br>\r\nShe comes to you and hugs you. \u201cOh Susie, I think you had a better night in the crib with\u2026 Zoey, wasn\u2019t it, than I had with this \u2013 so called \u2013 noble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub her back and comfort her, but secretly you are glad that she did not make out with a noble \u2013 or anybody else. Sure, Janet is more mature than you and during that night, she looked like an adult, but she is only a few months older than you. You wish that her first time is something special and not a drunk one-night-stand in the wardrobe of a party.<br>\r\nThe two of you talked some more about the twins and that it would be fun, but strange at the same time if the four of you would build up relationships. While you talk, Janet is mixing a series of Alcohol-Free Cocktails. Something that she wanted to try after sitting at the bar for so long. Even Eden receive one Virgin Margarita.<br>\r\nThe side effect is, that your best friend runs to the bathroom twice, before lunch and you feel your diaper becoming a soaked mass. You feel the wetness soaking it completely and you wonder if it might leak if you continue \u2013 but the cocktails are so tasty \u2013 especially after you where drinking formula for most of the time \u2013 that you don\u2019t deny to try another one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it is time for lunch and when you get back on your feet your bladder let go of more pee and you diaper hang heavy between your legs.<br>\r\n\u201cUhm, you did not messed up my sofa, did you?\u201d Janet asks, as she see you waddling to the door. But neither your lion-costume or her sofa has any spots.<br>\r\n\u201cAs long as I am standing it is fine. Maybe I had a drink to much.\u201d You blush and ask for Eden\u2019s hand to keep the balance. For a second you think about crawling, but with the costume you are looking like a baby already. You don\u2019t want to make that expression even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the nursery Rose is giving you a suspicious look.<br>\r\n\u201cHello Susan, why do you waddle like that? Did you have a messy accident?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo nanny Rose, I am only soaked because I tested some of Janet\u2019s cocktails.\u201d You say, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, Rose pulls down the zipper of your lion-dress and pokes the soaked diaper. \u201cOh, Susan, If you plan to make the diaper leak, tell me so and I add some booster pads into it.\u201d She scolds you and strips you down. She even takes off your diaper while you stand, to make sure that you do not leak on the changing table. Then, she lay you down on it.<br>\r\n\u201cWe better put you in a fresh diaper right away, I don\u2019t want you to leak\u2026 \u201c She starts to say, when you feel a sudden pressure and release a stream of pee on the changing table on onto her uniform.<br>\r\n\u201cI am sorry! I am sorry!\u201d You call out, pressing your hands on your crotch and try to stop the flow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose sighs and quickly wipes your hands off with a towel, before she put you in a double diaper with booster pads. The padded you normally receive when you had an enema.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, please not, I have class after lunch and must be able to walk!\u201d You pout and receive a light slap on your thighs for this.<br>\r\n\u201cHush baby, I put the pads on your knees, so you can crawl. If you drink so much you must life with the padding.\u201d She says sternly, clearly angry that you peed on her beloved uniform.<br>\r\nThickly diapered, you are feed your lunch \u2013 what takes longer today, since your tummy is already full of the drinks Janet made you. But Rose insist that you take your formula, since you need the nutrition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel bloated, when you lay in your crib and hug Mr Rabbit, but still, you manage to fall asleep quickly.<br>\r\nWhen you wake up your diaper is warm and wet and you blush when you notice, that you wetted so much during your sleep. \u201cNanny Rose, can I be changed? I am already wet and I don\u2019t want to wear such a thick diaper.\u201d You complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess Susan, do you want to receive a spanking or will you stay quiet now. It is decided and you will stay in your diaper until dinner.\u201d Rose insisted. She has changed her uniform and put you in your lion onesie. This time with additional knee pads.<br>\r\nYou try to walk a few steps, but land on your knees quickly. The diaper makes it impossible for you to walk. \u201cROSE, PLEASE!\u201d You pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLast warming princess! Stop your whining!\u201d Rose says and to underline her words she is pushing a pacifier in your mouth, one that has whispers painted on the shield and makes you took even more like a little lion. The whole situation is really annoying you and you feel your anger rise. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I be treated like a normal teenager?!\u201d You ask yourself and spit the pacifier out.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to paci!\u201d You say.<br>\r\nRose tries to stay calm. She picks the pacifier back up, cleans him and hold him in front of your mouth.<br>\r\n\u201cSusie, you will be late for class if you continue to misbehave. Take your lion-pacifier and crawl off, or you are in trouble, young lady!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I only ask to be treated a little more maturely.\u201d<br>\r\nRose expressions seems to change, but she still uses her scolding tone: \u201cSusan, you\u2019re a child, here, and you should be treated like one. I don\u2019t like to spank you, you know it, but I will if you don\u2019t stop this little show.\u201d<br>\r\nShe pushes the pacifier in your mouth, and you let her do it. However, you can\u2019t hold back anymore and begin to cry.<br>\r\n\u201cNanny, please!\u201d you say, behind your pacifier \u201cI\u2019m sorry! I\u2019m the princess! I can\u2019t bear this for 4 years!\u201d<br>\r\nRose hugs you tightly, whispering \u201cI know that is difficult, princess, I know. But you\u2019re strong, you\u2019ve demonstrated it a lot of times. Do you want me to carry you in class in my arms?\u201d<br>\r\nYou hide your face in her boson, and when you\u2019ve calmed down a little you hug her back and nod, whispering behind your pacifier \u201cYes, thank you. I\u2019m sorry. I love you, nanny.\u201d<br>\r\nRose ruffles your hair and lifts you in her arms, carrying you to the classroom.<br>\r\nYou completely relax in her warm embrace, and you whisper \u201cI\u2019m sorry for wetting your uniform.\u201d<br>\r\nRose giggles, saying \u201cAll is forgiven, little one.\u201d<br>\r\nYou see that Eden is following you (you didn\u2019t even realized she had joined you), and you\u2019re glad to have her as your guardian angel.<br>\r\nWhen you reach the classroom, Janet is already waiting. Seeing you in Rose arms, she greets you but doesn\u2019t comment.<br>\r\nThe nanny knocks the door, and when she enters, still holding you in her arms, miss Spencer is really surprised.<br>\r\n\u201cRose?\u201d she says \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to the princess?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe was overwhelmed by her emotions and needed a little calm-down-time, so I carried her here in my arms, Elisabeth.\u201d Rose replies, holding you tightly.<br>\r\nYou were expecting miss Spencer to laugh at you or call you immature, but very sweetly she instead comes closer and says \u201cSometimes happens with little girls. Do you want to skip lesson for today, princess? We can recover it Saturday.\u201d<br>\r\nYou shake your head, and reply something. Rose removes your pacifier, and you say again \u201cNo, thank you, Miss Spencer. I\u2019m okay, I can follow the lesson.\u201d<br>\r\nRose puts you down on your chair, behind your desk, gives you a kiss on the forehead and whispers \u201cI will wait you in the nursery after the lesson.\u201d, before greeting miss Spencer and leave.<br>\r\nWhile miss Spencer takes position behind her teacher\u2019s desk, Janet puts a hand on your shoulder, whispering \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Susie. You\u2019re wonderful.\u201d<br>\r\nShe doesn\u2019t even know what the problem was, but she tries to console you anyway. You really appreciate it.<br>\r\nSo the lesson begin. Miss Spencer is back to her normal strict self, but you are attentive and you try your best to answer to every question.<br>\r\nOnce the lesson is finished, miss Spencer calls you at her desk. You have to <br>\r\n\u201cVery good princess, very good indeed.\u201d she says, giving you a note \u201cI noticed quite a constant progress in you. You got only 2 demerits, which are very few. Focus a little harder and you will achieve to obtain 0 demerits, which is worth a reward.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cA reward?\u201d you say, surprised \u201cWith 0 demerits I get a reward?\u201d<br>\r\nMiss Spencer nods, saying \u201cAs you noticed, it is a difficult thing. But I\u2019m quite sure you can do it.\u201d<br>\r\nYou smile at her, taking the note from her, and decide to ask \u201cHave you always been a private teacher, miss Spencer?\u201d<br>\r\nThe teacher nods, replying \u201cI was formed to be a private teacher, princess. I never taught in a public school.\u201d<br>\r\nYou wanted to ask how was to teach in a Calonian school, but her answer destroyed the possibility to ask her that.<br>\r\nYou greet her and slowly crawl out from the room in your wet and dirty diaper, followed by both Janet and Eden.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened, Susie?\u201d Janet asks \u201cSomething happened between you and your nanny?\u201d<br>\r\nYou shake your head, replying \u201cNothing, really. I was simply overwhelmed by the thought to have this wet and dirty diaper for the day.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet nods, but doesn\u2019t say anything. She saw that you were very sad for it, and she teases you only when it\u2019s funny for both of you.<br>\r\nWhen you arrive at the nursery, Eden opens the door for you and you crawl inside.<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome back, princess.\u201d Rose greets you with her kindest smile \u201cI hope you feel better and that the fussiness is gone.\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, but crawl to her saying \u201cCan I have a hug?\u201d<br>\r\nRose smiles again, and take you in her arms, hugging you tightly.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, princess. I love you, you know it.\u201d she whispers, then says with a more serious tone \u201cHow the lesson went?\u201d<br>\r\nYou smile too, now, and give her the note saying \u201cHere!\u201d<br>\r\nRose takes the note, reads it and then she exclaims \u201cYou\u2019re my little angel! 2 demerits! I\u2019m so happy that I don\u2019t have to give you yet another spanking.\u201d<br>\r\nBlushing, you add \u201cMiss Spencer also said that maybe I can manage to achieve 0 demerits and get a reward. What is the reward, nanny?\u201d<br>\r\nRose giggles, replying \u201cOh, you can choose it, princess. You can have an extra naughty fun session, ice cream after dinner for a week or a trip to the amusement park.\u201d<br>\r\nYou smile, excited, and exclaim \u201cReally!? One of that!? They are all wonderful things!\u201d<br>\r\nRose giggles again, pats your head and says \u201cOh, you little ones. It takes you very short to cheer up and forget your worries. I\u2019m almost jealous of it.\u201d<br>\r\nYou think that now you can leave, but Rose says \u201cI have a little surprise, but I will give it to you only if you promise to behave. Will you promise it, princess?\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, answering \u201cI promise! I\u2019m sorry for before, really!\u201d<br>\r\nRose smiles, and takes out from a drawer a gift box.<br>\r\n\u201cSurprise!\u201d she says, smiling.<br>\r\nAs you take it, Janet comes closer, curios herself. You open it, and you find a Blue-ray discs box set. The cover shows five girls (magical girls, you catch) dressed in battle gears, under the words \u201cPuella Magi Madoka Magica\u201d. It\u2019s a Japanese anime! You know it, but never saw a episode.<br>\r\nYou jump at Rose, hugging her and saying repeatedly \u201cThank you, thank you, thank you!\u201d<br>\r\nShe pats your head, saying sweetly \u201cWe can watch some episodes after dinner, if you want.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, thanking her again and then leaving with Janet (still crawling and still followed by Eden, of course). You got so excited that you even forgot to ask Rose for a diaper change. But then you think that she wouldn\u2019t have done it anyway, so it\u2019s only for the better.<br>\r\nYou crawl straight to Melissa\u2019s nursery, but when you knock and then enter, you discover that \u2026</span></div></div>",

I allowed them to get dirty, since they will have a nice bubble bath later. It is the reward for earning only 3 demerit points, each.\u201d She smiles, very proud of her charges. <br>\r\nYou smile and bite down on your tongue, not to point out, that you got even less, that would be rude. \u201cOh, that is impressive. So, they are in the garden?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so, it is the best place to get dirty. William likes to skip a few stones when he is crossing the pond. Today he will do it until he slips and end with his padded behind in the water.\u201d She says. It is obviously that she loves the twins, even when they can be a handful.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, we go and meet them.\u201d Janet says and turns to leave.<br>\r\n\u201cYou, mean: You walk and the little lion crawls.\u201d Melissa laughs. \u201cOh, you are so cute, princess. Rose has some great ideas!\u201d<br>\r\nYou smile weakly and try to catch up with Janet as she wants to see it, when William falls into the water.<br>\r\nOutside, in the garden the two of you find the twins sitting on the bench. Meredith\u2019s shoes are dripping wet and William is covered in mud from the knees down. \u201cAw, we missed the fun.\u201d Janet pouts.<br>\r\nWhen you arrive, William is giggling at your outfit, while Meredith comes to you, knees down and pats your head \u2013 or the fur covered hood. \u201cSusan, you are such a cute little kitten. I could cuddle you all night long.\u201d She says \u2013 and for the first time today you don\u2019t mind it. You even press your head against her hand and imitates to purr.<br>\r\n\u201cAw, look at this, I guess she likes you.\u201d William giggles and you snap at his pointing finger.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, bad kitty!\u201d Merry scolds you and you whimper, only to be kissed all over the face by her. \u201cAw, it is fine, I am not angry at you.\u201d<br>\r\nYou all laughs out not and discuss what to do now.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, if you are okay to play with us, we can get all dirty and all bath together.\u201d William suggested.<br>\r\nYour initial reaction is to laugh it off. You are boys and girls and your nannies would not allow it \u2013 but for the adults you are only kids as well \u2013 and you bathed together before\u2026 .<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, we try it. I want to get out of this warm lion-costume anyway \u2013 not to mention the thick diaper.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, why do you have to wear that?\u201d William asks and Janet tells him about the cocktail-tasting that went a bit overboard.<br>\r\n\u201cI am sorry for you Susan, but when we play catch, you will be a dirty little kitten quickly and Rose has to give you a bath \u2013 and if you are luck, we can all bath together.\u201d He grins.<br>\r\nYou look at Janet to see if she is fine with that idea. Especially after the disappointing party, she has her eyes back on William and therefore she nods.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, then it is decided. We play catch and I start the first chasing \u2013 all have to be on all forth.\u201d You smile.<br>\r\nMeredith and William simply fall to there knees and crawl away from you, while Janet takes off her shoes and is more careful. Her skirt is not that long and as soon as she is on hands and knees it slides even further up and reveals her training pants.<br>\r\nYou start to chase her, but she is quick and you are handicapet by your thick diaper, that is even wetter and less comfortable by now. Already sweating you call out in William\u2019s direction. \u201cWow, look at Janet\u2019s ass!\u201d<br>\r\nYour plan works. William is very distracted, instead of avoiding you, he tries to get a better view on Janet\u2019s behind and like this you can touch him. \u201cOne down!\u201d You call out and try to catch Merry.<br>\r\nLike Janet, she is faster than you, but she is teasing you more. She slows down to let you catch up with her. Her padded behind in front of you, you chase her around the pond, until she miss-steps and falls flat on her face. Luckily, she is on the grass and she does not hurt herself.<br>\r\n\u201cGOT YOU!\u201d You slap her behind and make her blush.<br>\r\nJanet has won the round and now she has to chase the three of you. At first you fear that she is going straight to you, since you are so slow, but she is aiming on William and the two of them have a long fight, before she finally smacks his behind. So far relaxed you look at Merry and the two of you crawl into opposite directions.<br>\r\nJanet is fair and chase Merry down within a few minutes.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I am done!\u201d You call out, panting hard. You turn over and lie on your back. Arms and legs of the lion-outfit are covered in dirt and you are 100% sure that you will be bathed tonight. The only question is where and with whom?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted the twins go to their nursery, while Janet, Eden and you go to yours.<br>\r\nAfter knocking on the door, you enter and see Rose\u2019 surprised face.<br>\r\n\u201cJesus, what happened to you? Are you hurt?\u201d She is really worried, since you look like a mess, but you smile at her and grin from ear to ear.<br>\r\n\u201cWe placed catch with the twins and to make it fair all of us went on all fourth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I can see that\u2026 . Aren\u2019t you aware that cats and lions are very clean?\u201d She smiles and shakes her head. \u201cNow you need a hot bath to get you clean again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet blushes a little, but raise her voice.<br>\r\n\u201cUhm,\u2026 could we bath together, like Susie, me and\u2026 the twins? They will take a bath as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Rose says and thinks about the request.<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And you think that nanny Melissa is really obsessed with the position thing.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Melissa.\u201d replies Rose, going closer to her and putting you down next to the changing table \u201cI think that taking good care of the children is much more important than the royal etiquette.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is William?\u201d Janet asks, suddenly.<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s in the bathroom, ready to take a bath.\u201d Melissa replies, taking Merry down from the changing table, completely naked with only her thick glasses on, and then says to her \u201cWe now go to reach him, while Rose takes care of the princess.\u201d<br>\r\nMelissa has caught that Rose prefers taking care of you herself. But you don\u2019t even listen to that, though, because you\u2019re to busy looking at Merry naked body. While Rose and Melissa are still talking (something about your lion onesie, you don\u2019t catch what exactly), Merry notices that you\u2019re staring at her. You both blush, but then she does a sexy pose, moving her hand on her side.<br>\r\nWhile you are getting excited, Melissa takes Merry\u2019s hand and leads her to the bathroom. Rose then lifts you up on the changing table. She removes your onesie, and giggling she says \u201cThe lion is changing his fur.\u201d while doing it, and then removes the knee pads too.<br>\r\nWhen you\u2019re only in your diapers, she makes you lie on the changing table on your back, and proceeds to remove everything. Once you\u2019re naked, she cleans you up and then takes you down from the changing table. You\u2019re quite embarrassed in being naked next to Janet, even it already happened before.<br>\r\nYour BFF giggles, but immediately stops when Rose says \u201cOk, Janet\u2019s turn.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI can undress myself, miss Fletcher.\u201d she says, blushing.<br>\r\nRose pats her head, saying \u201cJanet, I think you can call me nanny Rose, now. \u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUnless you\u2019re naughty.\u201d you giggle, remembering that even you must call her miss Fletcher when you\u2019re punished.<br>\r\nRose giggles too, and the says to Janet \u201cI won\u2019t force you, of course. But I think it would be for the best.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet is convinced, and lets Rose lift her on the changing table. Rose removes her nice dress (that you really envy) and takes her training pants down.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little wet.\u201d she says, making her blush and you giggle \u201cIt\u2019s just some drops, sometimes it happens to adults too, especially when the drink too much. Well, nothing so serious to put you back in diapers. Unlike the giggling princess, here, that is one of the heaviest wetter I have ever seen.\u201d<br>\r\nThe parts reverse immediately: Janet giggles, while you blush.<br>\r\n\u201cRooooose!\u201d you exclaim, while she takes Janet down from the changing table, still naked too.<br>\r\nRose giggles only, and takes both yours and Janet\u2019s hand with hers, leading you to the bathroom. Inside, William and Merry are both there, naked, standing next to the full bathtub.<br>\r\nYou see with the corner of the eye that Janet and William stare to one another. You then notice that Merry is doing the exact same with you, making you blush, but you stare at her too.<br>\r\nThe two nannies help you all enter in the bathtub, and Melissa overturns the chest full of rubber toys in the water.<br>\r\nYou enjoy a relaxing bath, next to Merry. You look at each other often, blushing.<br>\r\nRose is washing your back, when she says \u201cPrincess, if you feel the urge tell me immediately. I don\u2019t want you to pee in the bathtub.\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush more, while the other three laughs a little.<br>\r\n\u201cHush!\u201d Melissa scolds them \u201cThere is nothing shameful about it!\u201d<br>\r\nYou are so happy to be cleaned up that you play with Merry, staging a conversation with two rubber toys (you have a frog, she has a goldfish). Willy stages a battle between two of his instead, but you notice that he looks often toward Janet\u2019s naked body. And your BFF simply enjoys the bath, without doing anything, simply looking at William time to times.<br>\r\nWhen you\u2019re all clean, the nannies takes you out from the bathtub and dry you off using towels.<br>\r\n\u201cThere.\u201d Melissa says, once you\u2019re all dry \u201cThe children are okay, now.\u201d<br>\r\nThey takes the four of you to the changing table, and Janet goes first. Rope takes out for her a pull-up, but is much more childish than usual. It is not a blank pull-up, like the others that Janet wore during her time here, but it is a Cindarella pull-up.<br>\r\n\u201cIs this really necessary?\u201d she asks, embarrassed.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Janet, but these we have.\u201d Rose replies \u201cWe don\u2019t have so much pull-ups that fits you, since here children your age are diapered. So, for this time, you have to wear them.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t I have my underwear back, then?\u201d she asks.<br>\r\nRose shakes her head, saying \u201cNot even your VIP-Card gives you that permission, Janet. You\u2019re a minor, after all.\u201d<br>\r\nShe sighs, and Rose adds \u201cLook, Janet, I don\u2019t like your attitude right now. I can\u2019t spank you, but I can take away your game console.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she exclaims \u201cNo, please! If you have to punish me, spank me instead!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIf you wish that.\u201d Rose says \u201cI give you three choices: the Cindarella pull-up, a diaper or a punishment, and since you wish to be treated like a Calonia, that would be pat-pat on the bottom.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet blushes (especially after Rose\u2019s extremely childish way to refer a spanking), saying \u201cThe pull-up is fine. Thank you, Rose.\u201d<br>\r\nRose smiles at her and put her in training pants, followed by a nice and mature yellow dress.<br>\r\n\u201cThere.\u201d Rose says, taking her down from the changing table \u201cNo one will be able to see it. Was all that fussing needed?\u201d<br>\r\nJanet hugs her, saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry, nanny.\u201d<br>\r\nHer childish reaction makes you giggle, before remembering that you usually do the same.<br>\r\nRose pats her head and then proceeds to diaper you too. She puts you in a thick diaper, but not double and with just one booster pad. She then puts you in a pink romper with the sentence in red letters \u201cI\u2019m a cutie pie\u201d printed on it.<br>\r\nWhile Melissa dresses up the siblings, Rose asks to you \u201cIt has been a long day. Now we\u2019ll have dinner and then, if you want, we can watch a couple episodes of the new anime.\u201d<br>\r\nYou smile at her, nodding. You greet your friends as she leads you back to your nursery. The nursery, however, isn\u2019t empty. Inside, there is \u2026</span></div></div>",

You are so sleepy that you don\u2019t even fully realize what\u2019s happening. Almost completely asleep, you abandon yourself in Charlotte\u2019s embrace, whispering \u201cSleepy, mommy.\u201d<br>\r\nShe pats your head, smiling brightly, and puts you down on something soft. You close your eyes, and you feel a hand ruffling your hair while Rose\u2019s kind voice says \u201cGood night, princess. I\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d<br>\r\nYou then hear the sound of a door, and nothing else for a while. Then, you feel something warm pressing against your body, especially around your shoulders, like a warm embrace. It is a spreading a sensation that makes you feel protected. Protected and loved.<br>\r\nThe sleepy sensation finally goes away, when you really fly into dreamland.<br>\r\nYou have a peaceful night, without nightmares. Maybe one of them most peaceful night you\u2019ve ever had.<br>\r\nThe next morning, you feel a warm hand touching your shoulder. You open your eyes, yawning, and you see that the hand belongs to Charlotte. The queens is gently shaking you with her right hand, while she has the left one around your body. You blush, realizing that you\u2019re hugging her and probably you\u2019ve done that all night long, pressing your wet diaper against her.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d you whisper, but she smiles and ruffles your hair.<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Susan.\u201d she simply says, holding you close to her.<br>\r\nYou notice that she is wearing an elegant yet simple and surely comfy pajama, red and with blue details.<br>\r\n\u201cDid I fell asleep?\u201d you ask, a little embarrassed.<br>\r\nCharlotte nods, saying sweetly \u201cYes, but it\u2019s a natural thing for a kid, don\u2019t worry.\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush, and say \u201cI like the series. I\u2019m sorry for falling asleep.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll resume it from where it interrupted, next time.\u201d she says \u201cI like it too, I must admit. Madoka herself reminds me of you.\u201d<br>\r\nYou giggle, replying \u201cBut I don\u2019t have pink hair.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s because you don\u2019t live in an anime.\u201d the queen giggles too.<br>\r\nYou like staying like this, hugging her. Despite the diaper around your waist, that you still don\u2019t like and maybe never will, despite the childish things that you think you\u2019re too mature for \u2026 you are happy to be here.<br>\r\nYou are about to say it to the queen too, but a voice interrupts you \u201cYour majesty, both you and the princess need your breakfast, and you have a lot of things to do.\u201d<br>\r\nYou recognize the voice of Mrs. Laura, while the queen sighs.<br>\r\nCharlotte looks over your shoulders, behind you, saying \u201cOh, can\u2019t I spend the morning with the princess?\u201d<br>\r\nYou try to suppress a giggle, in hearing Mrs. Laura sighing behind your back.<br>\r\n\u201cYour majesty, please, don\u2019t make it difficult.\u201d she says.<br>\r\nCharlotte giggles, winking at you, and then gets up. She helps you coming down from her huge bed (the biggest you\u2019ve ever seen). You look at the handmaid, and say, after yawning \u201cGood morning, Mrs. Laura.\u201d<br>\r\nThe woman takes a little bow, and replies \u201cGood morning to you, princess.\u201d<br>\r\nYou are then let sit on the bed, while Laura helps Charlotte dressing up for the day. It\u2019s a process so slow that feels almost like a ceremony.<br>\r\nWhen the dressing time is over, the queen claps her hand. The door opens, and you see three women dressed like Laura enter in the room. You recognize one of them as Patricia, while you\u2019ve never seen the other two. You catch that those are the queen\u2019s handmaids too.<br>\r\n\u201cMrs. Laura, can I ask you something?\u201d you ask to the handmaid you know better.<br>\r\nEvery head in the room turn toward you, and Laura says \u201cOnly if it is a quick thing, princess. We all have to go.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, then ask \u201cThe handmaids answer to the Housekeeper and to the Butler like the other maids? I\u2019m curious about it.\u201d<br>\r\nPatricia giggles, but stops when the two unknown handmaids give her a bad look. Laura instead says \u201cWe deeply respect them, and we\u2019re asked to listen to them, but we answer only to the queen herself.\u201d<br>\r\nWith your question answered, Charlotte come closer to you and rubs your hair, saying \u201cI\u2019ll be pretty busy. But I promise you that I\u2019ll spend all my free time with you, Susan.\u201d<br>\r\nYou smile at her, and she leaves the room followed by the four handmaids. Immediately after they are gone, Rose enters in the room.<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, princess.\u201d she greets you, smiling.<br>\r\nAs you see her, you run at her and hug her tightly.<br>\r\n\u201cNanny Rose! Nanny Rose!\u201d you exclaim.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, someone is happy to see me.\u201d she says, hugging you back \u201cCome on, princess. Back to the nursery. You need a new diaper.\u201d<br>\r\nShe lifts you up, saying \u201cYou don\u2019t mind if I carry you, right? You know that I like it.\u201d<br>\r\nYou hug her again, saying \u201cNo problem, nanny.\u201d<br>\r\nShe then carries you back in her nursery. Once there, she puts you on the changing table, removes your romper and your diaper, before putting you in a fresh one.<br>\r\nOnce you\u2019re diapered, Rose puts you in a pink dress with a skirt made of tulle that doesn\u2019t conceal your diaper at all. It\u2019s so transparent that not only everyone will see your diaper, but they\u2019ll even notice if you wet yourself. It\u2019s quite embarrassing, but at least it\u2019s not like the jammies.<br>\r\nYou feel full of energy this morning, even if you don\u2019t know why. It\u2019s because you\u2019ve slept so well, maybe?<br>\r\nAfter having fed you your breakfast, Rose pats your head, saying \u201cI\u2019ll wait you with your lunch. Don\u2019t get in trouble in the morning, princess.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, greet her and leave the nursery. Eden was already waiting for you outside of the door.<br>\r\n\u201cEden!\u201d you call her, as you see her \u201cI\u2019m ready to conquer the world!\u201d<br>\r\nThe knightess is surprised, but then she gives you a smile and says \u201cIf you say so, my lady.\u201d<br>\r\nAnd then you leave with her.<br>\r\nYou then reach Janet\u2019s room, to spend time with her.</span></div></div>",

Hey, that is not funny!\u201d<br>\r\nShe interrupts her speech, when she finds you covering your mouth and suppressing giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am sorry, but you look very funny.\u201d You reply and ask her to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince I was not dressed correctly I got punished with a spanking and an enema and put in this diaper and onesie until I am picked up by an adult.\u201d She pouts and wiggles with her padded behind. \u201cThat is two hours ago. I have no clue where this useless scientists are, but when I find them, I will\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d She sighs.

I rather get cleaned up by a human. I received a spanking already. Have you seen my dress?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEden and you search around, but find nothing. Disappointed Janet leaves the room quickly, followed by Eden and you. The walk back to yours and her hallway is embarrassing for Janet. Many maids are crossing the way and all know her as the only mature kid. Now, in her full diaper she has to explain a lot, until she is so angry about all the grinning people, that she starts to dash, as fast as her diaper allows it and runs straight into Rose\u2019 nursery.<br>\r\n\u201cHello Miss Fletcher, I am sorry to bother you, but would you PLEASE clean me up?!\u201d She says, almost falling over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose looks surprised, but nods her head and quickly get the full diaper off her.

Maybe you haven\u2019t noticed, but you will have an extra lesson before lunch, since the princess has planned to invite a few friends. Miss Spencer will teach you two and the twins about the rules for external visitors. No worries, it will not take long.\u201d Rose explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had totally forgotten about that, and therefore you and Janet are still in the same dressed, when you meet the twins.<br>\r\n\u201cHi\u201d You greet them. \u201cSorry for taking away your teaching time, I guess you will have to work longer the next time to compensate this?!\u201d Merry and William, both dressed in green onesie nod their heads.<br>\r\n\u201cYep, that is the plan.

Miss Spencer is smiling, and you hope she stay in good mood.<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, miss Spencer.\u201d you greet her, and the same does Janet.<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome, girls.\u201d she greets you too \u201cAs I was saying to the Kent\u2019s siblings, I need to tell you about the rules for external visitors.\u201d<br>\r\nYou raise your hand, and when the teacher gives you authorization to speak you ask \u201cWhen will my friends come to the Palace, miss Spencer? Nanny Rose didn\u2019t say when will it happen.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh? She must have forgot that.\u201d miss Spencer replies \u201cThey will come today after your nap. That\u2019s is the reason for the extra lesson.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEhy! Does it mean I don\u2019t have a normal lesson today?\u201d you ask, excited.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and that is why tomorrow you\u2019ll have lesson both in the morning and in the afternoon.\u201d she says \u201cUnless you prefer recover the lesson Saturday?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI prefer having my Saturday free, thank you.\u201d you reply \u201cI\u2019ll take the two lessons tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEven if it mean I\u2019ll get punished two times for demerits if I get too much of them.\u201d you add, speaking in your mind.<br>\r\n\u201cOk. We can start, then.\u201d the teacher concludes her introduction \u201cSince it\u2019s an extra lesson I will not give you demerits, but make me angry and I will spank you after we finish.\u201d<br>\r\nShe said it smiling, so you are not sure if miss Spencer was really saying that she would spank you if you misbehave in the extra lesson or if she was joking. You aren\u2019t eager to find it out, though, so you decide to stay on your best behavior.<br>\r\nMiss Spencer is still smiling, and you think that is because her relationship with the Butler is going well.<br>\r\n\u201cNow, about the meeting that will occur, you must know that before you can spend the afternoon playing with your friends, a series of procedures must be followed.\u201d the teacher explains \u201cEvery guest group, in this case every kid with his or her caretaker or caretakers, will present itself in the throne room, where they will be greeted by the persons that will spend time with them in the Palace. Since you are kids, Queen Charlotte and Lady Kent must be present as well, with both Miss Fletcher and Miss Mason.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMiss \u2026 who?\u201d  you ask, don\u2019t recognizing the second surname.<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s talking about nanny Melissa.\u201d Merry intervenes \u201cShe already told you once her surname is Mason, right?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cExactly!\u201d miss Spencer exclaims, a bit too enthusiastically \u201cYou\u2019re so clever, Meredith. I\u2019d give you merit points, if I could.\u201d<br>\r\nShe is really happy today, and you bet she gave few demerits to the siblings too. You\u2019re almost bothered that you don\u2019t have lesson today but two lessons tomorrow. But then you remember you\u2019ll spend time with a lot of friends, so you\u2019re happy anyway.<br>\r\n\u201cAs I was saying, you must greet the guests in the throne room.\u201d the teacher resumes \u201cAfter all of the guests are properly greeted, you kids will gather in the centre of the throne room with your caretakers, and then all of you will get your maintenance spankings.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d you and the twins exclaim, simultaneously.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the rules, kids.\u201d miss Spencer says \u201cWhen a lot of children are left alone for an entire afternoon, a maintenance spanking must be administered to ensure good behavior. Don\u2019t worry, though. Since it\u2019s part of the tradition and not an actual punishment, it will be on your diapers and even lighter than a normal maintenance spanking.\u201d<br>\r\nYou think that the this maintenance spankings purpose is not to cause pain, since it will be extra light, but to cause embarrassment. Being spanked all at the same time will wipe away the security that is normally born when you\u2019re in a group, the normal thought \u201cIf we are many, they can\u2019t punish all of us.\u201d. It\u2019s really a clever think to do, you must admit.<br>\r\nJanet raises her hand, and when give permission she asks \u201cI will get it too?\u201d<br>\r\nThe teacher shakes her head, replying \u201cOf course not, Janet. Despite your current outfit, that I don\u2019t know if is wore to show your appreciation for our tradition or because happened something that I don\u2019t really want to know about, you are still a guest.\u201d<br>\r\nAfter saying that, the teacher giggled. Janet is relieved, but blushed for the outfit remarks.<br>\r\nYou raise your hand again, and say when given permission \u201cHow the spanking will work?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, chairs will be positioned in the middle of the throne room to form a circle that looks at the inside of the circle itself. Then, you will all be placed over your caretakers lap for the light and quick spanking. You three and the guests too, of course.\u201d after explaining this, she looks at Janet and adds \u201cI suggest you to pay attention to the procedure. A group maintenance spanking is interesting to see, especially for the synchronization the spankers normally have.\u201d<br>\r\nEmbarrassing. That is what this procedure is. It\u2019s really perfect to ensure well behavior without actually punish the kids. You are not eager to it, but at least you will play with your friends after that.<br>\r\n\u201cOnce the procedure is over, the rest of the meeting will be followed by adults.\u201d miss Spencer concludes \u201cOne day I will explain that part too, since you will need it too, but for now just know that after the group maintenance spanking is finished, you can greet the caretakers and leave. You will spend the afternoon completely alone, without grown-ups.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cExcept Eden.\u201d you add, mentally.<br>\r\nStill smiling (and you\u2019re really glad to see her like that), the teacher dismisses you all.<br>\r\nMeredith and William both greet you and leave, to have their lunch. Willy grinned at Janet outfit, but didn\u2019t say anything.<br>\r\nThe same then does Janet, saying that she will go to her room for a quick outfit change and then she will go to the kitchens to eat too. Once you\u2019re alone with Eden, you go to the your nursery to have your lunch as well.<br>\r\nOnce there, Eden greets you and leaves. As you enter in the nursery, you must admit that the time just before lunch is quite sad, since everyone greet you like you\u2019ll see them an eternity later, even it will be just few hours.<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome back, princess.\u201d Rose welcomes you, with her usual smile.<br>\r\nYou run to her, hugging her and saying, almost sobbing \u201cYou will never leave me. Right, nanny?\u201d<br>\r\nShe seems confuses, but then ruffles your hair saying \u201cNever, princess. When I\u2019ll be an old woman and you will be our queen, I will take care of your child too, if you\u2019ll let me do that.\u201d<br>\r\nYou hug her more tightly, saying \u201cOf course! You\u2019re the best nanny of Calonia!\u201d<br>\r\nYou really like the queen, but Rose is so different. Maybe it\u2019s because she takes care of all of the time, but you are really close to her.<br>\r\nAfter this, she gives you your baby bottle of formula making you sit on her lap (you don\u2019t get yet why sometimes she takes you on her lap while others she puts you in the high chair), removes your dress and puts you in a romper and puts you in the crib, saying \u201cI will change you after your nap, princess.\u201d<br>\r\nYou greet her, and fall asleep hugging Mister Rabbit.<br>\r\nAfter a while, Rose wakes you up and changes your wet and dirty diaper just as promised.<br>\r\n\u201cI think that the diuretic effect is going weaker.\u201d you say, as she puts you in a new diaper \u201cI feel more control, now.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d she comments \u201cAs I said, the diuretic isn\u2019t a punishment. I really hope that you now know how a Calonian child feel.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, as she dresses you in a nice dress: a shirt with a jeans overall, which legs come just below your waist. You diaper is indeed concealed, but the bulge is extremely obvious.<br>\r\nAs Rose lead you in the throne room (that you never saw till now) to make you meet your friends, you ask her who will administer your maintenance spanking, and she replies \u2026</span></div></div>",

All are dressed in very childish, but still nice looking outfits. Even Zoey, that usual suffers under the strict hand of her nanny is wearing a skintight leotard and a short skirt. She looks stunning again, especially beside Tabby. The cute girl is in a red dress that goes down to her knees, underneath that she wears additional thighs in the same color. She looks a bit angry, what might be because of the leather reins she is wearing. You smile and can guess that she was very hard to control without those. Her blonde and good looking nanny has a stressed expression on her face and chats with Zoey\u2019s nanny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no time to greet when, before a knight by the door clears his throat and announce the queen. All eyes point in the direction of the door and wait for the Queen to enter. Charlotte comes in a midnight blue dress. Everybody bows and greets her in one voice.<br>\r\nSmiling, she raise her hands and greets her citizens back.<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome everybody and thank you for the warm welcome, but this is not about me. It is for the kids to have a good time, therefore we should not waste their playtime and start with the required procedure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody nods and walk to the chairs that wait in a big circle. The Queen takes your hand from Rose and winks at you. \u201cIt will be loud, but not hard.\u201d She promises.<br>\r\nShe forms a king of cup with her hand and give you ten slaps over your padded behind. It is indeed loud, but you can hardly feel anything through your diaper and denim overall.<br>\r\nWhen you get to your feet again you see that Merry just swapped the place with Willy, since Melissa is spanking them both. Zoey is sniffing a bit and Samuel and Tabby looks fine. She is very happy that her nanny has the reins removed and eager to run around. But everybody is waiting for Melissa to finish the spanking of Merry. When she is done, the Queen nods at the other adults and they all let go of their kids.<br>\r\n\u201cSUSIE!!\u201d Tabby runs over to you and hugs you tightly. The rest is walking slower, but in the end all your friends surrounds you. Janet is coming to you as well and Samuel is at her side right away.<br>\r\n\u201cHi, do you remember me? Because I remember you! I love your dress!\u201d<br>\r\nHe is wearing a cute sailor uniform that hides his diaper well. You could hardly tell that he is wearing one, if we would not be surrounded by a cloud of baby powder. Janet, who changed into a light pink dress that ends halfway down her tights and looks great on her only smiles weakly, before she looks at you.<br>\r\n\u201cSo Susan, you are the host, what will be play now? Hide and see in the whole palace. Something like \u201ccapture the flag\u201d with teams \u2013 or do you have another idea?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill hugged by Tabby you think about it, before you decide to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You clear your throat, saying \u201cWell, maybe a little introduction would be the best idea. I am the only one that knows everybody, after all.\u201d<br>\r\nMeredith and William, in fact, don\u2019t know anyone beside you and Janet, the same Samuel. And Janet never met Blossom, nor spent time with Zoey and Tabitha.<br>\r\nYou see that Meredith has blushed deeply. She feels much more secure around you now, but, shy as she is, she is clearly in discomfort around so many new faces. As were expected, however, Tabby leaves you and jump between everyone, saying aloud \u201cI\u2019m Tabitha! My friends calls me Tabby! I\u2019m 14! My mom is a noble, my dad is right hand of the mayor of the Capital, and I like playing! I love playing, indeed! My motto is \u2018never behave\u2019! I get a lot of spankings, but I don\u2019t care!\u201d<br>\r\nZoey sighs, and puts a hand on Tabby\u2019s shoulder, saying \u201cI know it\u2019s not your best trait, but can\u2019t you stay quiet for 10 minutes?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI never stay quiet, that is a thing dead do!\u201d Tabby replies loudly, smirking at her.<br>\r\nYou notice that, during her presentation, Merry laughed a little. It\u2019s a good sign.<br>\r\nAs a perfect counterpart of Tabby, Zoey takes a deep and respectful bow, saying in a perfectly controlled voice \u201cMy name is Zoey, and I\u2019m 15. I\u2019m the daughter of a noble man, and I am the opposite of Tabitha, here, since I always behave, so I get spanked rarely.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut weren\u2019t you spanked just after the party for masturbating, like you usually do? Lying is punished with mouth soaping, you know?\u201d Tabby intervenes innocently.<br>\r\nZoey\u2019s face becomes red as a tomato. She stomps her foot, saying \u201cTabby! Shut up!\u201d<br>\r\nThat last part ruined her perfect (and boring) presentation, and you all laugh while she pout a little crossing her arms under her chest. Her big chest.<br>\r\nYou noticed that Merry looked at her, giving her attention especially to Zoey\u2019s big breasts. You really don\u2019t want to scold her for this, thought, since what happened between you and Victoria\u2019s daughter.<br>\r\nThe third visiting girl takes a step forward, and does a dramatically pose positioning her right hand on her right side and stretching forward her left arm with a open palm directed toward the ceiling, then says with her deepest tone possible \u201cThou have the honour to speak with young lady Penrose-Glee, a blossom of rose, Blossom the herald of a new age, born a decade and four years ago. Spanked a lot, even if her visions show to her the path she must takes. She see in the future of all of you great things.\u201d<br>\r\nShe looks at you, and adds \u201cThe virgin of the dark, raised by wolves, sees your future, young princess. I see \u2026 that you \u2026 will have your diaper changed before bedtime!\u201d<br>\r\nYou blush a little, while the others laugh. That is not even a prediction, is a completely evident thing!<br>\r\nAfter Blossom presentation, that made her get strange looks from everyone that hadn\u2019t yet met her (the siblings, Samuel and Janet) it\u2019s the visiting boy\u2019s turn.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Samuel. I\u2019m 16.\u201d he simply says, smiling, especially looking at Janet and  Zoey \u201cWell, technically speaking, I\u2019m a commoner. I don\u2019t have noble family members, so I feel a little out of place. But I\u2019m glad to spend time with you. And I\u2019m spanked quite a lot, too.\u201d<br>\r\nAfter his simple and strangely respecting presentation, you look at the siblings, encouraging them to present themselves with a movement of the head.<br>\r\nWilly doesn\u2019t hesitate a second: he takes a step forward and says with a calm and strong tone \u201cI\u2019m William Kent, son of the Prime minister. My friends call me Willy. I\u2019m 14, and the girl with glasses is my sister. I live in this palace, and I\u2019m glad to meet all of you. I\u2019m not spanked that often, for Calonian standards.\u201d<br>\r\nYou notice that while speaking he positioned himself between Janet and Samuel. You giggle a little.<br>\r\nNoticing that Merry is still hesitant, Janet steps in.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Janet.\u201d she says \u201cYou can call me big sis, if you like. I\u2019m 14, it\u2019s true, but I\u2019m almost 15 and \u2018already\u2019 out of diapers. Well, I\u2019m not a noble, but I\u2019m a guest so I\u2019m in a special position anyway. I\u2019m the princess best friend, after all. Oh, and since all of you said something about it: I\u2019m not spanked at all.\u201d<br>\r\nHer presentation was done in a completely calm but cheerful tone, really fitting for a grown up that doesn\u2019t have to show everyone he is a grown up but knows he is. You\u2019re quite jealous of it, you must admit to yourself.<br>\r\nYou decide to introduce yourself too, even if everyone already know you, leaving Merry for last.<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Susan.\u201d you say, trying to keep your voice firm and controlled \u201cI\u2019m 14, and I\u2019m the princess of Calonia. One day I will be the queen. I am really happy to see all of you. I\u2019m glad that you all came here today to spend time with me.\u201d<br>\r\nRemembering that everybody said something about their spanking, you conclude with \u201cAnd since I\u2019m embracing the tradition, I get a lot of spankings.\u201d<br>\r\nJanet claps her hand at your presentation, soon imitated by all the other kids.<br>\r\nYou blush and rub the back of your head, while Meredith has her turn at last.<br>\r\nStuttering a little, she says \u201cI\u2019m Meredith Kent. My friends calls me Merry. I\u2019m 14, I\u2019m spanked average, I like puppies and kitties, and \u2026 I\u2019m the princess\u2019 girlfriend.\u201d<br>\r\nThat last sentence made all go quiet, but the silence is immediately followed by a laugh from everyone. Except you, that didn\u2019t expect her to blurt out  something like that.<br>\r\nThe shy Meredith takes your hand, while looking especially at Zoey. And now you only hope that she doesn\u2019t say anything stupid. Zoey, however, didn\u2019t notice that.<br>\r\nYou\u2019re happy to see that no one laughed for your relationship with her, but just for the way it came out.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I knew it of course.\u201d Blossom says. You\u2019d really like to know why she is so interested in seeing the future, but for now you decide to don\u2019t ask.<br>\r\n\u201cSo now everybody know everybody.\u201d Janet says, then looks at you and asks \u201cWhat do you suggest to do? One of the two previous ideas or something else that just came in your mind?\u201d<br>\r\nYou look at her, replying \u201cHide and seek in the entire palace sound exciting.\u201d<br>\r\nYou see William smile, and then add \u201cYes, I vote for that.\u201d<br>\r\nEverybody agree, and you say \u2026</span></div></div>",

It leaves you speechless. Janet only manages to say. \"Wow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are introduced to a large number of palace staff members and political advisors, None of whom you remember except the nanny, Miss Anderson.

She agrees and you both throw on your t-shirts. With your thick diaper clearly exposed, you realize how cute it actually looks on you. \"Ready?\" Janet asks. \"Yeah.\" You reply. You both get in a squatting position and start counting down.\"3.....2.....1..GO!\" You yell. Both of you start grunting and sighing as you push poop out. It's especially easy since yours was trying to come out anyway before you started the competition. You can feel the poop get squeezed out of your body and start pushing against your diaper. It feels really good to release yourself of the pressure and let the poop just slide out. You feel your diaper expand further and further as you relieve yourself. You give another push and this time not only poop comes out, but you also completely empty your bladder, which also feels good. You give one last push and the final poop comes out and falls into your diaper. After all the pushing, you feel winded so you take a deep breath and, being careful not to sit on your butt, you kneel down and lay on your stomach. Janet saw how relaxed you look like this and quickly dies the same thing. You empty out the tiny little amount of pee still in your bladder and look over at Janet, who is panting from all the pushing. \"That felt good.\" You say. Janet nods in agreement. \" okay, let's get back in bed.\" Neither of you bother putting your onesies back on and both you and Janet quickly compare the size of your diapers and Janet agrees that you won. Both of you crawl back into bed, lay on your stomachs and pull the sheets up over you, waiting for breakfast.</span></div></div>",

Did you sleep well?\" You ask. \" Hold that thought, Susan, I gotta go to the bathroom really bad.\"<br>\r\nShe started to take off her blanket when she remembered what she was wearing, So she just leaned back and closed her eyes as you see a smile spread across her face and hear the hiss as she soaked her diaper. \"Um, Janet, you seemed to really enjoy that.\" You say.\"huh?\" \"Oh, yeah, that! Well, that's just because I really had to pee, and..um, it was really good to let it go. Not the diaper,that would just be.. Weird.\" \"Oh. Okay then!\" You reply. \"So, do you wanna go change, or?\" \"Not quite yet.\" She answers.\"okay. What do you wanna talk about, then?\" You ask. \"I don't know. \"But I am kinda getting hungry. Do you know what princesses have for breakfast around here?\" \" How would I know?

You both get changed out of your old used diapers and in to new ones, you both get put into t-shirt dress comobs, white t-shirt on the top with incredible poffy sleeves and skirt on bottom with many different layers to the skirt t  make it look even puffier. Next you put on  small blouse that goes over your t-shirt and back and sides of your dress but shows the front and all its layers, as you peak down you notice that your dress' only covers the top half of your diapers showing them (and any possible yellow stains) to the world. Soon after you put on your blouse the attendants tie bows around your wastes to keep your blouse from blowing in the wind. Finally you are each given a botnet to tie on your heads. \"You to girls look simply adorable\"the attendants say. \"We look over dressed\" Janet says. \"This is common dress for wealthy young girl as in this country.\" The first attendant says. \"Is it to late to stop following your guy's traditions?\" Janet asks. \"Yes it is\" the  attendant that took care of Janet says. \"So I'm stuck in diapers for the next two months will I'm her?\" She says. \"Hey I'm stuck in diapers for the next 4 years!\" You exclaim. \"Actually it is law that the princess stays in diapers until she is married, men find it attractive so it is easier for you to find a husband to rule with.\" The attendant that took care of you says trying to say it in a kind voice. \"How wonderful!\" You say in a sarcastic voice.\" Oh we forgot the last few things\" Janet's attendant says taking out a small bow to rap around both of your necks, a binkie for you each, white gloves, and a baby bottle of milk for you each. You each look at each other silently, exited that you get to dress up like this but sad that you have to be seen in public. \"Now then would you girls like to be taken to the garden to meet the other girls in strollers or walk there yourselves?\" Your attendant asks.</span></div></div>",

You try to stop it but the patch keeps growing and growing until you put in all effort to stopping yourself from pooping your diaper with no command like a baby, you succeed only to start pooping yourself, you try to compromise by stopping both only to end up with an empty bladder and bowel. You blush incredibly hard just as you attendant looks down. \"Oh we completely forgot your blush,\" she says taking out some makeup to add a slight pink blush to both of your cheeks. You suddenly turn your head to Janet whose diaper is also turning yellow and brown at an alarming rate. You arrive at the garden where you see three other girls all with attendants of their own and all in dresses exactly the same as yours and Janet except in colour. \"Hello,\" a brown haired girl in a lavender dress crawls over to you \"are you the new pwincess?\" \"Yes\" you say sheepishly trying to ignore her baby speak. \"Wow, you shure are pwitty\" a girl in pink with black hair says coming over. \"Well I think her fwiend wills pwitty too.\" A blonde girl in a yellow dress says. \"Thank you.\" Janet says politely trying to stand up to do a curtesy, managing to do one only to safely land on her padded butt hearing a squish. \"What was that?\" Janet asks. \"Oh you must have had your coninince taken away while you were sweeping.\" The brown haired girls in a pink dress says. \"WHAT!!!\" You and Janet scream in unison. \"Well Let me explain after we all get changed or would you like me to expwain now?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well, that is because it is not actually a toilet. This is a diaper seat, and these are used all over Calonia, and their purpose is to make using one's diaper easier. While you should go any time you feel an urge, if you happen to be near a diaper seat, it should make adjusting to your new life considerably easier. To use it, all you must do is sit down on it, and let go. The bowl-shaped design allows the diaper to be more open when it is used. Don't worry, just pretend you are using a toilet back home and relax.    -Queen Charlotte.\"<br>\r\nYou are stunned, but you look at Janet and know that she's out of options.

You fight all of the years of potty training you have and just relax your bladder, closing your eyes and you feel your pee trinkling out when you let a deep breath out.

You see a smile appear on Janet's tear-streaked face \"Thank you, Susan.\" She says, than gets off her bed and hugs you. \"Um, janet,?\" You say. \"What?\" She asks. \"We...

It's a pastel pink and a very juvenile style. You guess the Calonians aren't big on growing up fast. She ties it's thick ribbon in a bow at your back then helps you into a pair of shiny black flat shoes, just as immature as your dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow all dressed, your mother leads you back out to the queen.

A large bodyguard is stopping her from approaching any closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright.\" you say. \"She's my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bodyguard looks to the Queen who nods, indicating that Janet should be allowed to pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Janet asks when she's closer. \"You disappeared.

I've never heard of it.\" She says. \"What's really going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to go.\" Queen Charlotte insists. \"It's not safe to stay here attracting attention.\"</span></div></div>",

She wraps her arm around your shoulder and says \"Let's get outta this craze-fest!\"<br>\r\nYou and Harry scoff as you approach the front door. Finding it unlocked, you step inside. Your mother is sitting on the couch in the front room with a well-dressed woman. There are also four men in black suits standing around the room.<br>\r\nThe woman smiles at you and says \"You must be Susan.\"<br>\r\nYou slowly nod and say \"Yes, ma'am. That is my name. This is my best friend Janet and my boyfriend Harry.\"<br>\r\nBoth Harry and Janet smile and nod their heads in acknowledgement. Janet still has her arm around your shoulders and Harry still has his arms wrapped around your upper body protectively.<br>\r\n\"Mom, what's going on? Why were the police looking for me?\"<br>\r\n\"That's something I'd like to know, too.\" Harry adds in, \"I know that truancy is regarded as a misdeed, but all this police work and media attention seems a little over-the-top.\"<br>\r\n\"This is about something much more important than that, my dears,\" the woman replies, \"Take a seat and we will explain.\"<br>\r\nYou, Janet, and Harry nod and sit down on the couch across from the woman and your mother.<br>\r\n\"Susan, I am Queen Charlotte of Calonia,\" the woman begins.<br>\r\n\"Calonia?\" you remark, \"I've never heard of such a place.\"<br>\r\n\"It is a very private country,\" the Queen explains, \"But I assure you that it is real.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't think she's lying, Suze,\" says Janet, \"I remember reading this one article about a country called Calonia joining the United Nations.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" you say, turning back to Charlotte \"May I ask why you are here in America, Your Majesty?\"<br>\r\n\"It is simple, my dear,\" she replies, \"You are my heir to the throne. You are legitimately a princess.\"<br>\r\nYou are totally unprepared for that answer. \"How can that be? I have no royalty in my family!\"<br>\r\n\"On the contrary,\" Queen Charlotte corrects you, \"Your father was my cousin. That makes you my closest living relative.\"<br>\r\n\"You really have no other heir?\" you ask in amazement.<br>\r\n\"I once had a son,\" she replies calmly, \"He and my husband - the King of Calonia - disappeared years ago. I have never remarried and have remained childless since. You are indeed my heir.\"<br>\r\nYou appear to be breathless. This is all so much to take in at once. You stand up and bow before Queen Charlotte. Getting the same idea, Janet and Harry do the same thing.<br>\r\nCharlotte just chuckles, says \"There is no need for that, my dears,\" and lets you get back on your feet.<br>\r\nYou turn to Janet and Harry. They smirk at you.<br>\r\n\"So, 'Princess Susan?'\" remarks Janet, \"That has a nice ring to it.\"<br>\r\n\"Definitely did not see that coming,\" comments Harry.<br>\r\nSuddenly, an idea pops into your head.</span></div></div>",

He tells his son \"It's alright with your mother and I if you want to go, Harry.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Dad,\" Harry tells his father gratefully.<br>\r\nYou give Janet a moment to call her mother and tell her about the situation. After about three minutes, she hangs up and announces \"My mother is fine with me going!\"<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" says the Queen, \"I would suggest that you children pack quickly. We leave tonight.\"<br>\r\nYou turn to your mother and say \"What about you, Mom? Aren't you coming, too?\"<br>\r\nShe smiles ruefully and says \"I'd love to, sweetheart, but I have to stay here and watch over the house.\"</span></div></div>",

Queen Charlotte sits next to you and says \"I'm curious; why did you run away?\"<br>\r\nYou quickly realize that you had no specific reason, but you tell her \"When I saw all of you in the principal's office, I thought I had been... I don't know, implicated in some sort of scandal or something. I was just scared. So I ran off.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't blame you for being frightened,\" the Queen assures you, \"But promise me you won't try that again. It is never a good thing to run from one's responsibilities.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" you tell her.<br>\r\nA few hours later, after eating dinner, a limo pulls up to the curve. You kiss your mother good-bye, load your suitcases into the trunk, and get inside with the Queen, her bodyguards, Janet, and Harry.<br>\r\nAfter stopping at Janet's house and Harry's house to pick up their luggage - which had been packed earlier by their parents - the limo makes its way to the airport. There are more reporters there, but the police hold them off as you all approach a private jet. After getting your luggage into the cargo hold, you make your way up the staircase into the jet with the Queen, her bodyguards,and your friends. There is no one else on board, save for a few more body guards, some stewardesses, and the pilots.<br>\r\n\"Come with me,\" Queen Charlotte tells you, \"I'll show you to your rooms.\"<br>\r\nYou follow the queen to the back of the jet and you come across four rooms. She turns to the largest of them and says \"This is where I sleep. If any of you ever need anything, feel free to come and ask. But knock first.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course, Your Highness,\" you reply.<br>\r\nThe next two rooms are a little smaller and are labeled as Guest Rooms. Charlotte announces that this is where Janet and Harry will sleep.<br>\r\nThe last room is very spacious. This is your room, where you will sleep.<br>\r\nAs you settle down on the bed with Harry and Janet, Queen Charlotte says \"I need to speak with the pilot.

It takes a moment to register what you are seeing. the drawer is full of diapers and baby changing supplies like wipes and powder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.\" You say. \"What are those for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are for you.\" Queen Charlotte answers. \"It is tradition in Calonia that children are not potty trained until their eighteenth birthday. It reminds them that they are children and helps for strong bonds with their parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice for you.\" You say. \"But I assure you I am potty trained. I won't be needing the diapers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is an important tradition to our people.\" the queen informs you. \"As the princess you can't be seen as ignoring our traditions. Especially since you were not born in Calonia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The people won't be able to see my underwear.\" You point out. \"Let them believe I'm diapered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that won't work.\" She says. \"It's difficult for the royal family to keep anything private.

It becomes obvious as she starts folding it that it is, in fact, a cloth diaper. \"I was going to put you in a disposable.\" she explains. \"But this is how we deal to children who think they are too big for diapers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stewardesses lay you down on the bed, on top of the diaper. Queen Charlotte then generously coats your bottom and crotch with baby powder before bringing the front and sides of the diaper up tight around you. She fastens them with a pair of large safety pins and then goes back to the drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returns with a pair of light-blue plastic panties. They have a satin outer cover and rows of ruffles across the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slides the plastic panties up your legs and over your thickly padded bottom. Once they are in place you hear a click.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done.\" She informs the stewardesses. \"Thank you for your assistance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women release you and leave the room. You immediately start to struggle with the plastic pants, to try to remove them and the diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wont be getting out of those panties without this.\" Queen Charlotte holds up a small box. \"They have a magnetically activated lock which can only be removed with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeated, you allow her to put you in a matching bra and pull the dress on over your head. At least it covers the diaper. \"Sit down.\" She directs you, retrieving a pair of shiny black flat shoes from the wardrobe. She slides your feet into them, then fastens the buckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll send the stylist in soon to fix your hair.\" she informs you, leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou examine your reflection in the full-length mirror. You look rather immature. The dress is a very childish design and the shoes are exactly like a little girl would wear. You guess it makes sense. The thick padding around your bottom reminds you that Calonia isn't big on growing up fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to get comfortable on the bed to watch TV but the diaper forces your legs apart. \"How is a princess supposed to sit ladylike in this?\" You ask yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the stylist comes in. She has you sit at the dressing table and begins brushing your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fusses with your hair for ages, trying different looks. It's fun but you feel the increasing need to use the toilet. Actually, you correct yourself, use your diaper. If the Queen gets her way you won't be using a toilet for the next few years.</span></div></div>",

By the time the wheels touch down the little jolt is enough to make you flood your diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe padding between your legs and against your bottom grows warm and wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have just finished soaking the diaper when Queen Charlotte enters your room. \"Time to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.\" You say, looking at your feel \"I wet my diaper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have time to change you now.\" She informs you. \"You'll have to wait until we get to the palace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou disembark the jet, still in your wet diapers, to more camera flashes and shouted questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen answers a few.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will Princess Susan be attending school in Calonia?\" one reporter asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will make a decision about that once she is settled in.\" Queen Charlotte answers. \"She has a lot of adjusting to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did she run away from her school and then from the police?\" another shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having lacked a traditional Calonian upbringing. she has a few behaviour issues.\" answers the Queen, surprisingly openly. \"But I am confident that Calonian discipline will correct those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you and the queen get into another limousine. You cringe as you sit on the wet terrycloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil you enter the palace you believe nothing could be fancier than the jet you arrived on. The palace leaves you speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour diaper is growing cold and uncomfortable but you are forced to endure this while you meet various staff members and advisors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the queen leads you away from the others to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" you ask, looking around the room. There's a cot and a changing table, both painted a pastel pink. \"This is a baby's room.\" Then you notice that the furniture is scaled up, big enough for you. \"Kids here don't just wear diapers? You treat them like babies too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not all of them.\" She answers. \"Usually being in diapers is enough to keep children in line.\" she explains. \"It's hard to be rebellious when you need your mommy to clean your bottom but when a child really misbehaves they are treated completely like a toddler.\" she continues. \"That means sleeping in a cot, being spoon fed by their patents even being dressed in babyish clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't I already dressed in babyish clothes?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They may be less mature than you are accustomed to but I'm talking about onsies and footed sleepers\" She opens the wardrobe to show you. \"Or just maybe nothing but a t-shirt and diaper.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" is all you can manage to ask as she pulls your dress up over your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This treatment reinforces their dependence on their parents and in many cases brings them closer together.\" she explains, removing your shoes. \"Most children who rebel do it for attention.\" she explains. \"This way you get a lot of attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up on the changing table.\" She orders, patting the padded plastic top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb onto the table and lay down, you can argue about the room later. For now you just want to be out of this wet diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then pulls a strap across your waist, explaining \"Until I know you are going to cooperate.you will be strapped down for diaper changes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe unlocks your panties and pulls them off then removes the pins from your diaper and pulls it open. The air feels cold on your wet privates. She pulls the diaper away and drops it into a diaper pail to be washed. Taking a baby-wipe, she cleans your bottom. \"Doesn't that feel better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't respond but, silently, you agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA clean cloth diaper is folded and slid under your bottom. Queen Charlotte applies more baby powder and pulls the front of the diaper up between your legs before pinning it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe searches through a drawer and pulls out a pair of pink plastic pants. Like the first pair, these have rows of lace across the bottom. She slides the panties up your legs and over your diaper. You again hear the locking sound and the queen releases you from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly climb down as she goes to the wardrobe, obviously to find you something babyish to wear.</span></div></div>",

That is keep the point of view 2nd person (The main character of the story (Susan) is refered to as \"You\" - the reader) and limit options to choices Susan can make, not events outside his control. Eg \"Which door will you open? 1) The red door 2) The green door\" is good but \"What do you find behind the red door? 1) An over-sized nursery 2) The prime minister.\" is not.</td>",
