I'm leaving Kane up to you. \r<br>\nRaven has three brothers Fredrik, Goerge, and Henry. Fredrik, like her father, doesn't like the fact that Raven acts like a boy. Goerge and Henry are okay with it. They're not thrilled but they can deal with it better then Fredrik and their father. Raven's mother totally supports her. Raven is one of the best cooks in her village. She can make the worst food in the world decent<i>(this calls for wine but we don't have that so we're going to use ale)</i>. All the girls in her village, and a small group of boys, loath her. Her village is about a mile and a half away from the castle, and small enough to know everyone that lives there. Raven doesn't like to attract attention to herself, for her fathers sake. When she around nobles she acts the way she should <i>(yes sir/miss, no sir/miss eyes downcast)</i> she has to really get to know you before she'll start speaking her mind and show you her great sense of humor.</span></div></div>",

The castle is about half a mile away from you village so you have to get all your chores done fast.\r<br>\nYou jog out the door to start your chores.

Sometimes at night she would sit in the stalls with them for a while, getting to know them and letting them get to know her. She had decided years ago that she would learn to ride Nighthawk the big stallion. Raven thought they would make a great team. She thought it was fated with both of thier names stemmed from darkness. Recently whilst gooming him he had started nudging her, almost as if he were egging her on. Tonights chore was to do the tack. Raven decided that she would see how he would react as she worked near him. Hurridly she finished and went to meet her little band of friends.</span></div></div>",

While you're waiting for Ma to answer you go into your room and get your moneybag. You and your friends make bets at the feild, you know last one standing gets so many coins from the losers. You've earned a lot of money that way.\r<br>\n\"Alright, but he doesn't want you to ride him don't force him.\" Ma says. You thank her and go out to the stables. \r<br>\nAs so as Nighthawk sees the saddel he rears up and starts makeing a commotion. You are not impressed.\r<br>\n\"Oh don't be such a baby. Either I do it or Da will, and Da is a lot meaner then me.\" You put the saddel down in front of his stall and go in to calm him down. You stroke his neck and nose, talking to him in a soft, deep voice. When Nighthawk has calmed down, you blow solftly into his nose, now he has your sent and he knows you. He breathes in your face, you smile. \"Oh don't worry, I'll know you even if you were in a whole herd of stallions.\" When you start to put on the saddel he tries to bite you.\r<br>\n\"Stop that!\" You hit him on the neck, hard enough for him to know you mean it. \r<br>\nFinaly you lead Nighthawk ont of the stable and get on him.\r<br>\nAs Nighthawk walks up the road leading the castle your friends catch up to you.\r<br>\n\"Did your Ma let you take him or did you just 'forget' to tell her?\" Amos asks.\r<br>\n\"Name's Nighthawk and yes, Ma let me ride em.\"\r<br>\n\"Bet you I can beat you to the feild.\" Roger says. You look at Rogers gelding.\r<br>\n\"How much?\" you ask. You have a rule in your village: never say 'bet' unless you mean it, because someone will always accept it.\r<br>\n\"8 coins, first one to the post.\" You consider it.\r<br>\n\"What d'ya say Nighthawk? Think we can take him?\" Nighthawk nods his head. \"Alright then, your on.\" You and Roger line up and Dylan stands on the side of the road.\r<br>\n\"Alright Nighthawk. Remember all that fire you had back home? Well now's the time to use it. Remember that tiny little stall? Well now you have plenty of room to run.\" Nighthawk paws at the ground impatiently.\r<br>\n\"1...2...3...GO!\" You don't even need to tell Nighthawk to go. He races up the road, you stay close to his neck. You can hear you friends cheering. You glance back Roger is on your tail, but he doesn't seem to be gaining. \r<br>\nThe post isjust up ahead Nighthawk puts on an extra burts of speed. You race across the feild to the post. Roger is almost equal to you. You both glance at each other, adrenaline pumping through your veins. You start to pull ahead, the roger is in the lead, then you, then Roger. Finaly Nighthawk pulls into the lead and jumps over the post, he runs a few more feet before you can get him to stop. You get off and hug him around the neck. As you lea Nighthawk back to the feild you rub is neck, saying \"Good boy.\" over and over again. Everyone crouds around you patting you on the back and telling you how you flew past Roger. You lead Nighthawk to a water bucket. Everyone ties their horses to the post and walk a ways to the feild. Roger throws the 8 coins at your feet, \"There's your money.\" he says and walk's away. Roger <i>hates</i> loseing to you, besause your a girl. Amos, Dylan and the rest have been aroung you long enough not to care, but Roger...he gets on your nerves a lot. \r<br>\n\"Alright ten coins each in the pile.\" Amos say, putting his ten coins on the ground. Everyone else puts down their ten coins. It's the tenth fight you've had in this manner. The last on standing gets the money. So far you've won all nine times, and todat will be your tenth, your positive.</span></div></div>",

She took a deep breath, then drew her long dagger.  'Father will not like this,' she thought with a slight giggle.  While most days she minded her father, there were some days when she could care less about embarrassing him.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nRaven took another breath, and stepped out into the clearing.  The squires had not noticed her yet, and she was glad.  She decided to take on the larger man first; maybe the slighter one would help.  They had not deigned to notice her, although she was certain they had.  She WAS half way across the field at this point.  \"Sirrahs, of what do you fight?\"  \"This man,\" said the large guy, \"insulted my lord.\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Only after he insulted MY lord, boy,  Why do you ask?\"  Raven was taken aback.  No one had ever thought her a BOY before.  \"Well, I would like to challenge one of you.  And since you, Sirrah, seem to be most at fault,\" she aimed her dagger at 'Large,' \"then I will help him.\"  The blade was now pointing at 'Skinny.'  Both men laughed.  \"You, boy, think you can beat US?  We are squires to the King's bravest knights, and soon we shall be knighted, as well.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"First,\" Raven said, \"you had better stop calling me 'boy.'  And second, I will fight you!\"  They laughed even harder.  \"Not call you boy?  Why?  Are you a girl?\"  She was not going to take any more of this.  She stepped up to the large man.  \"If you think you can win so easy, why don't you draw,\" she demanded.  Deftly, he pulled his own dagger from his side.  He thought, 'There is no use to me using my sword, I will win in a moment's time.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThey began to parry.  Raven was showing her excellent skill with the blade for she was used to fights without proper etiquette, especially from Roger.  At last, Raven pushed him back far enough so that he tripped upon a tree root. She grabbed his knife, and held her own dagger to his throat.  \"If you can win so easily, why did I beat you,\" she asked, about ready to slay him.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"And why are you about to kill my squire?\" said a voice behind her.  Whomever the voice belonged to, he lifted her off of the offender.  \"Well...your squire said that this other guy had insulted you, and he said only after your squire had insulted his Lord, and...\" she trailed off, unsure of what to say next.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"And would you belong to that group of boys over there, son,\" the strange knight was looking in the direction of her friends.  She nodded.  \"What is your name?\" he asked, finally.  \"My name?\" she squeaked.  \"Rob, Sir,\" she lied.  \"One of them said you were a girl named Raven.\"  She flushed slightly.  \"Oh.  Was it Roger?  He's just jealous of me cause I can beat him in everything.\"  She hoped that the knight would believe her.  \"How old are you and your group?\" he asked.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThis time she told the truth.  \"I'm second oldest at sixteen, and Roger is oldest at seventeen.  He'll be eighteen next season, I think.  The youngest is ten.\"  \"Ah.  Well at least that bit of information is the same as what the others told me.\"  </span></div></div>",

Best you hear it from them then me.\" you mutter looking at the ground.\r<br>\n\"Why would I ask someone else a question about you when I have you right here in front of me?\" the knight asks.

She triped over a root and fell heavily.\r<br>\n\"Ow.\" she muttered, getting up. She mused about what the other girls from her village would do. She could just see Ruth, the leader of a group of girls that tormented her every chance they got, crying, screaming and insisting that she broke something.\r<br>\n\"And what are you?\" Something interrupted her thoughts. When she looked closer she saw that it was the paw print of some animal...a bear from the looks of it. She was an expert hunter so she could tell that the tracks were freash. She decided to folow them a ways, one thing she liked to do was guess what animals were doing and the time they had made the tracks, it was fun. She walked, hunched over, following the tracks. She stoped suddenly when she saw the bears feet. She looked up slowly, is was a black bear, standing on it's hind legs. They stood looking at each other, Raven petrified. Then the bear roared and Raven ran away at full sprint. She didn't bother yelling because she knew no one would hear her. She sprinted toward the castle, it was the first place with lots of people she could think of. Soon <i>(as soon as a half a mile run would be)</i>she could see the area where the squires trained.\r<br>\n\"Bear! Help, bear! HELP!\" she screamed at the top of her lungs. The bear right behind her. To her dismay there was no one anywhere. Without thinking she ran straight to the archery part and grabed a bow and a quiver of arrows. She fitted and arrow on the bow, took about a second to see the bear and aim and loosed it. The arrow flew straight and hit the bear in it's chest. She loosed three more arrows, lighting fast, not even taking the time to aim, she could see it in her minds eye. Each arrow hit it's mark and the bear fell down, dead. Raven hadn't wanted to kill it, but it was obvious that the bear wasn't going to back down. She sat down heavily, stunned by what had happened. She collapsed onto her back, deeply shaken, yet her eyes remained dry.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMeanwhile Kane, who had been look out the window, had seen the entire ordeal. Looking at the small figure at the squires training area, he was amazed at this girls speed and strength, she has outran a bear and killed it. He decided that someone should see if the girl was alright.  </span></div></div>",

Raven thought for a moment, then ducked behind a large bush.  Seconds later, a stallion and his rider had stopped right where she had been standing.  The rider dismounted, and tied the horse to a tree.  \"Listen, I know where you're hiding.  It would be best if you came out yourself, but if you want, I'll drag you out.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nRaven hardly breathed.  The man stepped closer to her.  \"Girl, I know you are behind that bush, I saw you try to hide.\"  Half ashamed, she crawled out from her hiding spot, only to find one of the King's knights staring at her.  \"My Lord,\" she said, dropping to her knees.  She might act like a boy, but no peasant would not bow to nobility.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Enough,\" the stranger's harsh voice said.  \"I did not track you down for you to grovel.\"  She stood and looked squarely into his eyes.  \"Then why did you 'track me down.'

What for?  I am only a girl, like everyone says!\"  He continued smiling at her.  \"Well, I would have thought that someone with your skill and intelligence would want to become a knight.  How surprising that I was wrong....\"  He untied the stallion and mounted it.  He then proceeded to turn the way he had come.  \"Wait, Sir!\"  He turned again.  That got them every time.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Yes?\" he asked patiently.  \"Do you really think I could be a knight?\"  \"If I did not think that you could become the greatest knight of our time, I would not have bothered to follow you.\"  Raven was glowing with happiness.

Probably lock me up and have me burned as a witch.\"  She laughed, though.  Now she would be able to do what SHE wanted, and not some man.

I have someone I would like you to meet.\" Kane lead her through the castle to his rooms. When she stopped at the door he realised that she had probably  been taught that it was inappropriate to enter a mans rooms without a chaperone.

They are the King and her previous handler. I'll have to discuss this with the King, but would you like to train to be her next handler?\" \r<br>\n\"If I would be allowed sir, I would love to. It would make my father proud.\"\r<br>\nAt this the pheonix started to chirrup again. Raven looked puzzeled.\r<br>\n\"Is something the matter?\" aked Kane.\r<br>\n\"I dont know.\" said Raven. \"I think I can understand her. No, that's silly.\"\r<br>\n\"No it isn't. People who are meant to handle her can hear and understand her. That just about settles it then. The King can't refuse her. Just what do you hear her saying?\"\r<br>\n\"It sounds like she's saying that she has finally found her true match, and that now her young can be freed.\"\r<br>\n\"Thats what I heard too.

The only ones left were the two that had been fighting and one other, who was helping the boy with the knees to his feet. Kane dismounted and lead his horse over toward the boys. He over heard one of them say, \"It's about time, I thought you were just gonna let him beat you to death then Raven.\" \"not a chance, I'd have prefered to have won fairly rather then kicking him but he's much stronger than me.\" At the sound of the second voice Kane stopped, he was astounded, unless his ears decieved him that was a girl. A tough one too. He got back on his horse and started off toward the castle again. As he did she turned and he saw that this girl could grow up to be a beuty.

Queen Morganna is, like all other rooms in the castle save for her husband's study, the absolute master of her domain.  Under her care, the drawing room is the most enjoyable in the castle.  A plain, wooden table is in the center for usual meals, but the Queen utilized most of her budget in providing for a high window.  The spacious window (heavily fortified with bars in case of an archery attack) lets in copious amounts of light, and certainly brightens the usually cheery castle.  Royal blue tapestries line the walls, creating a cheery feel to the room.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nSeated at the table is Morganna herself, a remarkable woman.  She is a master of the domestic domain, and quite a diplomatic woman.  With almond shaped brown eyes and a plump, ruddy complexion, she is quite unassuming for a monarch, and keeps her light brown hair in a traditional, unassuming style.  Seated next to her is Prince Kiltrain, a serious youth of about eighteen.  He is a direct contrast to his mother, with a lean, pale complexion, high aristocratic Roman nose, and piercing gray eyes.  His blond hair is relatively long, and it hangs to the point of his shoulders.  He is quiet, and therefore often misunderstood as pompous, a label his mother highly regrets.\r<br>\nNext to him is Princess Zara, a dour twenty three year old maiden who appears as if she'll never marry.  While she looks nearly identical to her mother, she possesses none of Morganna's grace, unassuming nature, or talent.  She is a selfish, spoiled, ungrateful little troll in your opoinion, and you'd do well to stay away from her.\r<br>\n Finally, the king.  King Asturon is a nobleman, thin and lean, with a hungry look in his grey eyes.  He is decisive, but fair, compassionate but orderly, and keeps his subjects happy.  You two had the extreme fortune of growing up together, and the King knows that you are far more talented than you let on.  His dark green robe and matching shoes suggests that the king is anticipating a hunt later today.\r<br>\n The servants are soon to arrive with the food.

Mandy is laughing so hard she's crying. The dress might look nice on her, it acents her eyes which are a darker shade of blue-green. You suddnely remember that the King is holding a party at the palace next week.</span></div></div>",

A servant walked by, put the oatmeal in Kane's bowl (after the queen's ofcoarse!) and walked off. Kane started to eat his oatmeal when he had the worst tickling sensation in his nose!!! \"Aa-Ahc-ackechooo!\" Kane sneezed, a big green booger landing right in the queen's royal soup. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe lady looked up, her head and giant fingernails quivering with anger, \"I'LL HAVE YOU HANGED FOR THAT!!!\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\nKane freaked.
