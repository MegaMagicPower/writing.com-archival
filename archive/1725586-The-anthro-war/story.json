She said \"I was looking for my mate, these humans have been attacking villages and I think...I think he is dead.\" she began crying and grace moved in to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left them alone and went to think, that man, he had red armor I saw him on hells hill, now they are attacking innocent people? I better go see if there is anyone near us. You walked back to the other two and said \"wait here I'm just going to see if we were followed.\" and you walk off.

Raith came in and stood at the side watching so you started with Grace. \"ok Grace what would you like to sparr with?\" she looked at the weapons and said \"I have had trainging with the spear so I'll use that\" she picked up spear made of wood and a blunt ends so it will Hurt but not kill. You picked up<br>\r\na wooden sword and got into your fighting stance. Grace did the same. \"Grace I picked the sword because most humans use these so it will help.\" she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a step at her and she took a step as well, you knew that you had to get close to hit, while grace could attack further away. You got your sword like you were going to jab and ran at her. She quickly lowered her spear and aimed it so you would run straight into it, but this is what you planned, you ran at it abd at the last second twirled to the right then hit the spear up slightly with your sword and as her defences were down attacked. But she was ready and quickly dropped the spear makeing you slip slightly and in that time she pounced with her claws. You managed to drop and roll out of the way to dodge and you picked up her spear abd threw it at her, she turned to face you only to get hit by the spear and fall to the ground. You lowered your sword and helped her up. She was rubbing her head. You said \"don't drop<br>\r\nyour weapon or your opponent will just use it against you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nnext is was Cath's turn. She had no training at all so she picked up a sword and you kept yours. You disided to go easy on her and play it defencely and teach her too attack. After a bit of teaching her about a good stance to stand in you said \"now attack and I will block them\" her swings were predictable but fast... Very fast. You only just managed to stop some of them, but as soon as you attacked back with a single swing she staggered and fell.you said to her \"your attack is very fast and that will help, but your defence really needs some work.\" she seemed puffed out so she stood over by Grace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaith then spoke up \"Well...can I call you wolf, that name suits you.\" you nodded abd he kept on going \"you know how to fight, but how would you do againts someone with a sword and sheild?\" he walked over to the training things abd picked up a sword and sheild. He then said \"just remember a sheild can be used as a weapon as well.\" you lunged at him with your sword so he put up the sheild and made your sword bounce off it, he then swung low with his sword and tryed to hit your legs, you jumped it and raised the sword above your head abd brought it down on him, but he blocked it with the sheild makeing you stagger. He then pushed you with it making you fall back then put the sword to your neck.. He smiled \"you clearly need training against one\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou spent the rest of the day training with Raith, Grace and Cath....

She said \"hello again Wolf.\" you then thought to yourself 'i'm always going to be called Wolf arn't I?' you replyed \"hi Cath...ready?\" she looked at you abd said \"apart from agony all around my body then yes I'm fine.\" Finaly Grace was up she was now a very good fighter with claw and spear, all she really needed was to get her stances right. Grace said \"are we off then?\" and without waiting for an answer she walked out of the room. You and Cath looked at each other and she laughed, does she know something I don't? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou met Raith at the edge of a tree, he said \"I have new weapons for you all.\" then without looking up he said \"Grace here is yours.\" he handed her a small golden rod with the markings of a fighter down the side, he then said \"this will become a spear at the touch of a button, it is made of the strongest metal and Will never break.\" he walked to Cath and handed her a bow \"this Is the Bow of sorrow...it is the best bow in the land...it is light, strong. And will fire at a range that will put all archers to shame.\" the bow was black with silver tinted markings going down the bow. He then walked to you \"Wolf for saveing me you have the sword but for giving me the best fight I've had in years I give you this sheild.\" the sheild was silver but it had a crest of courage on it, this was a cresebt moon with a wolf howling at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you thanked Raith and were on your way the walk to Ersing would only take 2 hours but it would be hard knowing that when you get there Grace and Cath might not be able to come into the city. You then heard Cath and Grace talking and laughing but you couldn't here what they were talking about. You sighed and hoped it wasn't some plot to tie you up and leave you or something. You heard the raven caw, that's a bad sign, you had been told that a raven meant death, but the only other one you have seen<br>\r\nwas Hunter so that theory might be right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater you were nearing Ersing and Grace came up to you and said something, \" hay Wolf I was wondering do you miss your family?\" it was quite a random question but since your brother abd mum had both been killed and it was only your blood thirsty farther left you had to reply \"no I don't...all I ever got from them was sorrow.\" Grace put her paw on your sholder then said \"that's a bit harsh on them don't you think. I mean I miss my sister a lot, I am always hopeing that she is ok.\" she looked at the ground in thought, man it's getting down here I better try to lighten the mood. You smiled to yourself then quickly sidestepped to the right makeing Grace who was leaning on you to fall to the floor getting a laugh from Cath. She got up abd said \" yerr thanks for that!\" but you could tell that she was laughing. Seconds later she pushed you, but you managed to stay standing, you said \"you will have push harder than that you overgrown pussy cat.\" Cath burst out laughing. Grace on the other hand had drawn her spear but still had it as a rod. She put it to your chest and said \"one more comment like that and I will impale you on my spear here.\" then she smiled and shoved you over, \"got you!\" the three of you kept on like this for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErsing was just over the next hill so you picked up your pace. You could hear strange noices ahead so you were also curious to find out what it was. As the three of you went over the hill you were shocked to what you saw.

The man angrly shouted back \"You are with these SCUM!\" he points to grace and cath \"after what they just did to Ersing?!? The real question is what the he'll are YOU doing?!?\" you were about to gut this man seconds before an old lady spoke up \"now now Sam don't you see that they were not even in the battle and also this man is only trying to make peace between anthros and humans again?\" this lady just saved that guys life and she doesn't want this war to go on, I wonder... The lady then said \"Sam I'm sure there are people who require medical help so go help.\" Sam looked at you with the look of hatred and ran off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace and Cath were by your side again, Cath said to the old lady \"thank you for that, I'm sure Wolf here was about to stab that guy.\" the lady smiled \"the names Annie, you seemed to have came from far away, may I ask you three a queston?\" Grace answered this one. \"go ahead but please be quick, we have to find someone.\" Annie smiled \"I have a friend how saved me and my sons life a while back before this war, his name was Hunter, he was a raven, do you know how he is doing?\" you felt your heart sink, you had killed Hunter only a day ago but you had to keep this woman happy, \"yes I do ma'm, he was protecting a few refugees from this attacks on the anthro villages,\" Annie looked at you \"the human armys are attacking villages... No wonder why Ersing was brought to rubble.\" Grace then said something \"can we speak the the general?\" Annie replyed \"I'm sorry but that's not possable, you see somewhere in the burning city he was cut down, I must be leaving it's a long walk to the nearest city.\" and she walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat you dad was now dead, your mission was to give him a message but now it's impossable. You took out the message you had been given on hells hill and read it out loud... 'Sir the anthro's are massing an army we are going to raid villages to slow it down but you must regroup with me at the fort Longstone, good luck sir.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou were kicking yourself, if you had gotten here earlyer then this could have been avoided, Grace who has been listening put her paw on your sholder, \"don't worry wolf I'm sure your dad got out some how.\" you smiled at this \"Grace I don't cate a out my dad... I care about all<br>\r\nthese fighters that could have been saved.\". Cath then said something \"Wolf look around... There was no seigi stuff used, that means the fire started inside and the army attacked then, the battle was over before it begun...the anthro army must have a great leader to do that and get out off here so fast.\" you thought for a second then replyed \"that's a good point Cath, nicely spotted.\" you then looked around \"so what do we do now...\" you remembered the mental note you gave yourself, \"Grace out next mission is to find your tribe.\" her eyes lit up when you said this... \"thank you wolf...thank you.\" wow she's happy, then she lightly kissed you on the lips, time seemed to freeze, Grace blushed like hell and backed off, \"sorry wolf\" you smiled at her and said \"don't worry about it...it was quite nice.\" Grace smiled at you...</span></div></div>",

Cath replyed \"ok Grace let's go there's a lot of injered fighters from both sides over there.\" and with that they both ran off. You sighed and thought about what happened was it just because she was happy, was it she has feelings but is trying to hide them, or is it something else? You checked your sword was still by your side and then walked off to try and find some bread or something you could salvage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Cath was talking to grace, she started by saying \"well Grace are you falling fir wolf?\" Grace replyed \"I-I...shut up!!\" this just made Cath laugh, \"oh come one Grace, he is really cute for a human and according to what you've told me he has saved you, if I was you I would be falling for him.\" Grace looked at the floor and thought 'am I really falling for a human?' Cath was about to dig deeper when they arived at the injered fighters. A doctor saw them and said \"you two go round and make sure everyone is still breathing now!\" the doctor had blood all over his apron. Grace said to Cath \"meet you back here in 1 hour...we've got a lot of work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nback to your POV......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had found nothing worth getting outside the city. But you saw a group of men walk into a gate, probarly a search party for survivors. You ran after them hopeing that there is something in the city worth takeing. You tightened the sheild that was slung on your back so it wouldn't fall off. This sheild is so light, what is it made off?...inside the city...there was dead humans abd anthros everywere, it was hard to keep your breakfast inside you. But you found a bakery still in tact so you went in to see what there was. You entered the building and looked around. It had only caught fire on one side but had died out before spreading. There was a shelf of bread that would be perfect. You dusted them off and put them in a bag that you found. \"that should be enough for a few days atleast.\" you said out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you heard A Weak voice from deeper in the shop, \"h...help me p...please.\" you looked outside and saw the search party outside so you shouted to them \"Theres someone in here still alive!!!\" straight away 4 men ran towards the shop and ran in searching for the voice. They found a human officer. A major by the looks of it. What is he doing here. People of that rank don't fight? The search group brought the man outside and started looking for a way to save him. You on the other hand better get back to the other 2, it'd been almost 1 and a half hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found Cath and Grace sitting on a hill talking and as you got to them you heard Grace say \"shut up he's comming.\" you thought 'ok what are they talking about?' they both had blood on their fur and the first thing cath said to you was \"let's go find a river I need a bath.\" you laughed at her then said there was one just in the woods a few hundred meaters back....10 minutes later they had cleaned up abd were ready to go 'wow Grace's fur looks good gleaming in the sunlight' no...no get those thought out of your head your now on another mission. You asked \"Grace where shall we look for your tribe?\" she thought for a second before pointing north, in the other way you came in. So you had no idea where you were going. She said \"they have hideouts over there, if...if they lived they will be there, the trip should only take...   </span></div></div>",

According to the route you must take you have a half a mile walk on a path to a near by village belonging to a pack of fox anthros, then it's kind of unknown, you only know the direction to walk. So as you set off Grace asked \"what did you get by the way?\" you showed her the bread you picked up from your salvage mission. She said \"if we ration that it should get 3 mabye 4 days but we can hunt for Stuff the rest of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe path you were on was not very often used as you could tell by it being more of an 'open patch of grass leading to a village' but it was all you needed to get there. A little while later you were nearing the village when you started hearing screams. You looked at Grace then at Cath and said \"Lets move!!\" the three of you started running at full speed to get to the village, by the sounds of it they were being attacked, mabye by bandits or someone. You knew Cath could run a lot faster than you so you sent her ahead to see what's happening...you were getting closer. The shouts abd screams were getting louder. Your heart was hammering away at your chest and every breath was making your lungs feel like exloding. Yet you kept on going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinaly you reached Cath standing in a tree, she said down to you \"Human Bandits are attacking the village, I count...16 of them. Wolf shall we do something?\" You looked at Cath in a way to say 'Does it really need answering' and you drew your sword and readyed your sheild. Cath had her spear extended and ready. Cath had already fired ab arrow hitting a bandit in the back, now they know your here,15, you shouted \"It's Fightin' Time!!!!!\" and charged, Grace was with you abd Cath was on your left, Cath fired again,14, you came at a bandit who swung his blade at you, you put your sheild in the way and stabbed at his unguarded flank, 13, Grace had met head on with one with an Axe, he swung it at grace who dropped and rolled under it, getting herself right next to the man and STAB ,SCREAM,12.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCath had taken down 2 more,10, your loseing count. 3 men ran at you all with swords all shouting at you, HACK ,9, you blocked one sword with your sheild and the other with your sword, you twirled and made it so one man was ducking down to try abd dodge you, you kicked him straight in the face and spun again takeing his head with you '8' the last man still trying to get past your sheild was soon cut down '7' You looked over at Grace, she just impailed another man ,6, then at Cath she kicked someone over and fired an arrow at then at point blank range ,5,. The last 5 started running away, so Cath gave one of then a parting gift ,4, Grace and Cath regrouped with you, Cath had a wound on her arm but it wasn't much. Grace was untouched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA male fox anthro came out of his house, he had just seen what you have done and he ran up to you saying \"thank you Heros, thank you\" Heros? You could get use to that. But you had to keep moveing so the three of you walked off getting praised by all the anthros that were still alive. You walked for tge rest of the day until you had ran out if light,so you set up camp.  </span></div></div>",

Cath was up and she had seen how easly Ant had taken down Grace and thought it was smart not to get involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace spoke next \"1 who are you? And 2 GET OFF ME!!\" you laughed at Grace shouting but she soon got up and staired knifves at you which made you shut up. Ant introduced himself.

Mabye those 4 men that got away from you. You looked at Cath, she was on her feet and ready to go, Grace on the other hand was still shocked about Ant, but after Cath wispering something in her ear she blushed, snapped back and was ready to go, what did Cath say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you went on walking to the great oak to re-meet with Ant...you finaly arived and he was standing there, he said \"the men have lost your track...for now...anyway Wolf let's start training, now listen hard.</span></div></div>",

This world is being torn apart by war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were thinking about all this stuff Ant broke your thought track by saying \"Remember that training I gave you?...I surgest you use it.\" you were about to ask why when suddenly a tree came crashing down inbetween you, Cath, Grace and Ant. So you and cath were on one side and the other two were on the other blocking each other off. Seconds later two men came at you with swords. The next few seconds went in slow motion you saw one man going at you and you managed to hit the flat of the sword with your arm and ran your dagger into the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut cath who was too slow turned and the man thrust his sword fwords and it went straight through Caths chest. There was a look of shock on her face, the man withdrew his sword and Carh colapsed. Time went back to normal again, but you could only see Cath and the sword with her blood on it. But in your zoned out state the man rushed at you. Something clicked inside if you are you were back to the real world, you dodged the on comming swing from the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started taunting you by saying \"you friend is dead and you are next, this is for the rest of the men.\" you had pure hatred for this man now you kicked the sword out of his hand, punched him to the ground, pinned him and punched him again and again and  again, you beat the man to<br>\r\nan inch of life then raised your dagger and slammed it into his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then ran over to Cath, she was still breathing and still awake but she was in bad shape. ant and Grace had killed the other two and climbed over the tree. They saw you holding Cath and telling her to hold on. Grace gasped while Ant rushed over to her and looked at her. He said \"I'll do what I can.\" and straight away he started useing herbs and first aid on her with a small hope of keeping her alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCath was coughing and trying to say something but she couldn't. grace was over by her side and was now keeping her calm while Ant worked on her. You on the other hand had seen death, you have dealt death but you have never had something like this happen to a friend. It felt bad, your heart was pumping faster than you thought was possable. Everything seemed to be blury like you were under water. You wispered \"Come on Cath pull through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnt walked over to you, put his hand on your sholder abd said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

You diddnt hear what was being said but you geussed it was things to keep caths spirits up. You walked over to her to inspect the wound. It was wapped in bandages and by the sent of it there was a little but of the mint plant in the wound. Ant clearly knew what he was doing. You said to Cath \"how you holding up there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at you then coughed \"sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou asked \"what for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe replyed \"now we will have to wait longer to get to Graces tribe.\" that hit your heart...hard, she had nearly died abd had only been saved by Ant being quick with the first aid and she is more worried about slowing us down, wow she's a selfless person if she doesn't care about herself at all. Ant then wispered in your ear \"she's had someone close to her die right?\" How did ant just geuss that...you nodded at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held Caths hand in yours, it was shaking, you said \"Cath don't worry about it, the only thing you should care about at the moment is to get better.\" she smiled at you again then said \"That I can do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace then spoke \"who even were those guys?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnt then said \" when I watched you take out those bandits 4 ecsaped, they must have gotten 3 archers and attacked, this armor is from a near by town, it's famous for holding the most musters in the world. Let's avoide that place.\" you caught a glimmer of fear in Ants voice, mabye there might be something to do with his past there, but it's best to listen to him and leave that place of your rouite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnt then saw the crest on your shield and said \"Your friends with Raith arn't you?...I've seen that crest before he only gives that to friends.\" Ant then walked up to a tree climbed it, and sat in a branch, \"Ive met him once, good soul, he saved a village agents a squad of atleast 30 men single handed, I was one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthat got your attention not only did you think that story was a fake tail Raith made up but that means that Ant isn't that old. Ant kept on talking \"it happened a few years ago when I wasn't even a teen yet.\" wait a minute Ant is the best fighter you know and he's only a teenager?!? Beings hybrid must really have it's ups. Ant kept on \"they came in claiming that all our money belonged to the king, when he stared doing this it was one of the things that started the war, but then Raith came in and fought with them with just a sword, a bit like yours, that inspired me to become a protector of innocent...even if they don't acept me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou looked at Ant no matter what he did he would never be accepted so he is an outcast, it must be a hard life, you went back to cath and Grace. Cath was now sleeping abd Grace was just sitting down by a tree. Ant then left to go hunting. You sat by Grace, \"How you doing Grace?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you with sadness in her eyes then said \"not to well, you and Cath are the only true friends I have, and when one is next to death I get worried.\" you sat there in scilence for a little before grace then said \"I really don't know what I would do if one of you died...I mean Cath got hurt and I'm here thinking about the worst.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to try to cheer Grace up. \"Hay Grace don't worry, I'll always be here for you and as soon as Carh wakes up she will probarly say the same thing. No matter how bad things get your never alone, just remember that.\" that should do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace smiled at you and said \"thank you wolf,\" she then kissed you, it seemed to last a few seconds but when she pulled away she was as red as a boiled lobster.

You nodded at Cath, she had a gleam in her eye that showed she was in a good mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then looked at Grace and saw her blushing. \"wait a sec, what have you two been talking about?\" the two of them looked at each other but diddnt say anything, you sighed, there's no way they are going to tell you. \"ok Cath can you stand?\" Cath tryed to stand up but the pain in her side forced her to sit down again. \"geuss not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Ant came back dripping wet but With no blood stains.

Left food fworards and right foot to the side. Left arm held so your hands were just in frount of your face with your left slightly ahead of your right. ants was roughly the same. You stood there faceing each other not moveing, and shuffled his left foot a tiny bit, but just enough to draw your attention, in that spit second you wernt looking at his face he moved in with a quick right hook. You managed to stop this by ajusting your stance so you could lean back, you then hit his right arm with yours to knock it off Corse then you struck With your left, you tryed to jab him in the face but he moved his Head, swung his leg to tripp you abd then dilivered a blow to your chest sending you on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe helped you up and said \"you let your guard down, even when you are attacking don't foget to still be able to defend.\" you nodded at got back in your stance, Ant did the same. This time you gyres something different, you circled him for a few seconds, abd then pretended to slip, he attacked straight away, then since you were fakeing it you righter yourself and punched with your right and hit...his arm as he countered, you managed to stop his kick be stepping back. You wondered how he countered so fast. You tryed another thing then, you ran at him like you were going to punch him but at the last second you dropped into a slide and dodged his blow and used your left leg to hit his side as you passed, you got up feeling pleased that you hit him when. WHAM. You got hit in the back of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat stung a lot, Ant then said \"here's a really helpful tip, don't turn your back on your opponent...oh well that's enough for today.\" he walked up to a tree and jumped into it to sit on a branch, you on the other hand walked over to Cath and Grace rubbing the back of your head. Grace was not watching the Fight, she was talking to Cath, she then heard you approch and let you sit next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCath then said \"we were talking and I should be able to get moveing by tomorrow morning. At the moment it was early evening, mabye around the 18th hour of the day. Wow today's gone fast. You got some of your bread supply and shared it out with Grace, Carh and ant. You had about enough for 2-3 days left. But it might go off before then. You then looked around, there was little wind blowing where you were. And by the looks of the sky it will rain tomorrow.

The simple 'throw a stick to get their attention' trick worked on you? You have very little skill with these kind of things, abd also where you were standing, it was in the open so you were easy to sneak up on. Ok. Now you go off abd I'll patrol.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou walked into tge bushes and waited for around 5 minutes, when you thought enough time had passed you walked back, the ground was crunching under your feet so you thought of a way to counter that. You went Prone to tge ground so you could move slower and be more carefull With the noise. You crawled until you came to a bush. You went behind it and looked through to try to see Ant. You looked left and right but couldn't see him. But then you spotted him, in a tree with his eyes closed, how are you meant to creep up on him if you have to climb a tree?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought for a few seconds. Then you saw the long grass behind the tree. You slowly crawled over to it makeing sure you diddnt lay ok any twigs or something. You finaly made it to the long grass. Ant still had not moved. You stood up slowly and then thought of how to het him down. You could try to climb but it would get you caught no doubt. So in the end you tryed the bird call. You put your hands to your face and blew. You copyed the sound of an owl quite well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnt without looking said \"you should have chosen a bird that would be out at this time, your too late for an owl. But apart from that you did pretty well. You kept low, you stayed quite but you chose the wrong bird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthen it slowly started sending drops of rain comming down, you sighed you had gone so long without rain and it finaly comes down when you are outside  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were thinking \"Damn that was close.\" you then said \"let's see if Cath can move yet.\" the two of you walked back to Grace and Cath. And saw them both sitting up and talking. They then geussed you have been training so diddnt ask. But you asked them \"Cath do you think you can walk?\"   </span></div></div>",

But what supprised you the most was he had a lot of injerys on himself. He came round limping and clutching his right arm which held the blood stained sword. Grace saw the Panther and her eyes went wide with shock. She ran at him shouting \"SAM!!! Are you ok?\" you thought to yourself 'sam? Who's that?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked up and smiled weakly at Grace he said \"Grace? You-you alive?...wow, everyone thought you died.\" you thought since Grace knew this person abd Cath was walking with Grace that he was no threat. So you put your sword back and broke cover.

Until finaly it was me, your sister, Ash and shade...we got attacked again...I told the other 3 to scatter and run while I hold them off.

Cath was so sam could talk to someone and Ant was protection and doctor. Your trip should take a day and a half but since Grace was speed walking it will take a lot less than that. She clearly cares about her sister, you wondered why she never said much about her? You then said \"Grace what was Cath about to say back there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace slowed down a bit but without turning she said \"it-it doesn't matter, she was just makeing a joke.\" you could tell she was hideing something but you diddnt want to push if and annoy her with how longs left. You just looked around enjoying the suns rays bursting through the tree tops and thought to yourself 'the human forces seem to be moveing in groups of about 20...that's odd, they usaly stay in one large army or in patrols of 8...unless... Something is happening like, the humans might be fighting with their selves abd there are outcast groups all over that you keep running into. But why are they fighting thereselves?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCath and Ant..........................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCath was talking to Sam about how brave he was to fight to save everyone else. Ant was hunting again. He was not really trying so he just sat in a tree and waited, this gave him time to think about what it is about Wolf and Cath he seems to relate to, and why Grace still won't trust him. It could be because wolf and Cath has no family...that could be it, they have no family but there friends keep them strong, Ant thought to himself maybe I just Want friends.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCath had learned a bit about Sams attacks and how he had lived wave after wave of human attackers...aparently he was the best swordsman in all of Graces tribe. He sighed and said \"our tribe...our friends 56 strong...down to 4.\" he went back on his memory the people he's seen die the ones that fell to his blade, the friends that have died in his arms. All this blood shed but what for? Why would anyone want this? The Hunan king must be pure evil in his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCath on the other hand was staying possative, she knew that everyones mood would perk up when Wolf and Grace reterned, hopefully Grace has listened to her about what to say to Wolf...she still couldn't understand her feelings though...falling for a human that fast? She laughed and looked at the setting sun...had the day really gone so quickly, It can't have. Cath then thought to herself will she ever find someone who will love her like her mate did. But those times have gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf and Grace................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up and saw the setting sun...you turned to Grace and said \"we should make camp here and find your sister tomorow.\" Grace nodded at your comment abd you both layed down by a tree. You asked Grace who was next to you \"I was wondering, who taught you to use a spear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace replyed \"my sister did. She us a great fighter. She's a roll model to me, that's why I'm so desprate to find her.\" she sobbed slightly thinking that that find her could be an IF question. You put your arm around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said \"don't worry about it, I'm sure she's fine, if she's a better fighter than you then I bet she's better off than we are.\" Grace smiled at you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"thank you wolf...that really helps.\" she put her arm around you and you both drifted off to sleep. </span></div></div>",

You looked at Jade, she wasn't that different to Grace but she has a cut on her right leg and just above her left eye was a black line, a tatto maybe, her arms had black 'bangle' type things by here hands and you geussed they were leather, Her eyes were A dark brown shade. The you spotted something, there was a purple jewl on her right bangel, that looks valueable, you will have to ask about it later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade started talking saying \"you must be wondering what happened?...well when you vanished I had to take over, I moved the tribe to one of our hideouts but we kept getting attacked, I'm sorry sis but so meny of your tribe got killed, but all I have left is dads dagger, mums jewl.\" she grasped the stone on her bangle. So it's a family thing. \"also I've got a water flask that's full of water and about a meals worth of meat. Everything else was left at the huts or lost in the fights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace then saw a tear in her sisters eye \"Jade calm down your stronger than this. Sure the humans are attacking any anthros and not just the main force but they will have an easy time doing it if we give up...remember when we trained togeather you would say to me 'never surrender sis, no matter how hard the fight is we can ALWAYS pull through' remember that?\" Jade nodded at grace<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe then said \"Im so glad your ok Grace I...I thought you were dead, you have no idea what I was going through...by the way who's the human?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace told her you were wolf then started with who you are \"Jade this human is probarly the only fighter you will meet that dosent want to fight anthros...he's such a good person, I wouldn't be here talking to you if Wolf had not helped me.\" you were glad she left out the part where you captured her and the 2 weeks in prison she suffered. \"Not only is he a great human but he's a great fighter... Maybe better than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade said \"no way...no humans better than me.\" you heard a bit of happyness in her voice and smiled knowing what she had planned. \"ok Wolf I challange you to a sparring match hand to hand only.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at grace who just srugged her sholders then you turned to Jade again and said \"sure...first to hit the floor?\" she nodded. You assumed you stance for hand to hand and she took hers, Jades stance was strange, she looked like she was about to pounce. She attacked first with a quick swing to your right, you blocked and jabbed with your left and at the same time grabbed her right with your right and twisted, she twirled to doddge your jab and also to break from your grab, she then with lightning speed started attacking quickly without stopping. You were only just able to block each attack...she was slowly makeing you back up and would make you have your back to a tree so you swiped with your leg, ducked her punches and grabbed her left arm with your left hand, then you twisted and used your other hand to push her back, and finaly with your leg you pulled at the back of her knee makeing her fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thanked Ant fit showing you that move. You helped Jade up from the floor. She said \"I geuss you are a good fighter, your the whole package there wolf.\" that got her a nudge from Grace. Jade and her seem to like playing around. Jade tgen said \"shall we continue?\" and the three of you went back to Sam. You knew that if your timeing was right he should be ok to move when you get back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace then said \"Jade how meny...I mean was is hard to kill all those people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\ngraces sister shuddered and said \"it's not hard to kill, it's just hearing them scream is what gets you. The cry of pain and fear mixed with sorow. It digs deep to my heart.\" Grace knew that before those attacks Jade had never killed anyone. That made you remember your first kill...it took weeks to get over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade then said \"Wolf...what is it a out grace you like?\" this made you skip a beat how does she know. \"I mean just how you two look at each other...it's like you've been friends for a long time and she keeps saying she likes how you fight.\" this brought relief to you, it wasn't a feeling question it was a question about just stuff. Jade said \"I like how's she's always been so surpottive if me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Latipac the human Capital city.......(look at how it's spelt backwards)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe new controlers of the army Genreral Bowan was standing over a map of the land with 6 other officers in the room. He shouted \"We must attack the groups of Anthros dotted around!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the other officers in the room an old Major with thinning hair and a weak face spoke up, \"But sir there main force is moveing towords the City of Polus we should back the troops there up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowan turned to this man, he stroked his beard with his scared right hand, he said \"How stupid are you Major?!?!? We must crush the small groups first otherwise they will attack while our guard is down!!! With a lack of skill like that it's a wonder how you got past training.\" the Major shocked by this outbust said nothing...all he could do was wish that the last General had not been in Ersing at the time of the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother man spoke up, he was a young man who wore the rank of Captian, \"I was there when we left hells hill to attack, I was in the force that got surrounded by these 'Groups' of anthros, and I agree with Bowan that they must be destroyed!...we have also had reports that a human, the old Generals son has sided with these Anthros, if word of this breaks out others will join them, we must keep out attacks on the villages going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......................

Jade then started talking about her dads dagger \"you see before he died our farther gave us this dagger.\" it was very well made with the handle had an emrald on it and it had their family chrest on it. \"you see one day we had gone out playing, we were attacked by a bull charging at us...it was only because Grace had stolen Our farthers Dagger we managed to get out alive.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then saw The others in the distance and walked towards them and saw.    </span></div></div>",

Sam then said \"Im glad your ok Jade.\" you looked over to Sam to see that he was now standing up but only with the surrport of a tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade ran over to Sam and punched his arm. \"I said not to go attack the humans...then I find out that you had to be saved by my sister. Sam I know you never listen to me but almost loseing to humans?!?!?! Come on Sam what happened to your fighting style that 'could never be beaten'.\" Sam looked a bit worried for a moment but caught the hint of laughter in Jades voice abd worked out she was just happy he lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCath then spoke up \"should we go to find Ash and Shade now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade replyed \"don't worry about it they will be fine, they are both archers and Shade is a master of Stealth and Camoflarge and Ash could probarly make the best weapons in the world out of a tree, those two brothers togeather are unbeatable. Let's just wait for Sam to recover...and by the looks of  it you've been stabbed aswell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCath felt the scar that was left on her body before saying \"I'm recovering. In a day I will be fine. Canines heal faster than Felines.\" Ant had walked over to you while the others get to know each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnt said \"So how's it going with Grace?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then asked \"what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe replyed \"I can tell you know...when she's near your pupils dilute...your blood starts to pump faster and you talk differently. So in other words if your trying to keep it a secret your not doing to well.\" Ant enjoyed watching your stunned expression and laughed to himself. \"Dont worry about it Wolf I won't say anything, By the way we should get going today because there's going to be a storm tomorrow...I can feel the static in the air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou said back \"Ok thanks Ant I'll probarly get everyone moveing in a minute, but can Sam really walk with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnt smiled \"The guys got will power and that will overcome his pain and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...................Anthro main war base...................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus the leader of the Anthros main army was thinking to himself \"At this pace they would reach Latipac within the week and then they could crush the humans and end this pointless war...why do these humans still attack the innocent?

It read <i>no matter how bad things get you only fail if you give up</i>, you thought to your self \"good bit of advice there\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe others were up and ready so you said to them \"ok guys we most likely will be attacked so be on your guard... or in Ants case do what you always do.\" this got a little laugh from Grace knowing that Ant hated being singled out. will she ever fully trust Ant, all he's done is help us. your group started walking to the Mountain in hopes of Shade and Ash being there. You checked back to everyone and saw that when you went to get Jade Cath had made a bunch of new arrows for her bow, smart thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou looked around at the clouds passing overhead and at the dry ground under your feet and thought to yourself. \"The country known as 'Eira' to the humans was one of the largest around and one of the most beautiful. but war is tearing this land apart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..........................3 hours later............... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nall of you slumped down by a cluster of rocks to allow Cath and Sam a breather, they have been keeping up very well for their wounds, Cath trys not to show that she is still in pain but you can see her wince every now and then when you were walking, Sam on the other hand, even though trying to look strong in front of everyone was struggling, even for an anthro they wounds he received wont heal fast. He should know he's lucky to be alive. Jade was still walking around so you got up and walked over to her and asked \"everything ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe jumped slightly, she must have been in deep thought \"yerr im fine Wolf...its just i said to everyone Ash and Shade are good fighter, well they are very good archers but in a close range fight even both of them agent one they stand no chance, im just worried becuase i know Ash is not one to stay hidden and he might be hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your hand on her shoulder and replyed \"they should be fine, if they were in the same tribe as you and Grace then they will probably be better than fine.\" that comment made Jade smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe said \"you know your smart as well as cute.\" you sighed she had to go and break the mood didn't she. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace walked over to you two and said \"I heard my name, Jade you better not be telling Wolf about our past.\" Jade looked at you in a way to say 'dont tell her im worried' so you just looked at Grace while thinking of something to say. she said again \"you were weren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou knew in Graces tone of voice that she really didn't want anyone talking about her behind her back so you spoke up to save Jade \"dont worry about it Grace, we were only talking about who will go on the next hunt because Ant has to look after Sam becuase one of his cuts might re-open.\" you thought to yourself 'please buy it please buy it please buy it' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky for you she did and even started giving ideas \"oh, in that case i would like to see hoe humans hunt, so i'll go with Wolf.but there's no point at the moment so we will go just before hitting Malafor.\" you nodded at her and so did Jade, that one went as planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked back to the others and saw and checking on Sam and Cath sitting doing nothing so you walked over to her and sat down beside her and said \"how are you doing, you seem a bit lonely?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe looked up from her bow and said \"I was thinking about Graces tribe, their not the only tribe that had no reason to be attacked and that made me think. there are lots of others like her, its hard to think about all the death and suffering that is happening at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou saw a tear in her eye so you said back \"don't think about it... i think about all the Anthros that are working together and about all the people who keep their spirits up... doing this keeps mine up aswell. now we should camp here because it looks like a storm is coming and these rocks can be used as cover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou looked into the sky as it started raining and a small breeze whirled up. Ant spoke up \"if i was you i would get to cover, there's going to be some rough winds and that cave over there will be good cover.\"  you had not even see that cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou shouted \"Ok lets go in the cave and keep moving tomorrow or until the storm dies down.\"</span></div></div>",

'Let's move men, they've been reported near here!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were looking for someone and your geuss was it was you. The others had now woken up due to the shouting being so close, Grace was about so speak but and put up his clawed hand to scilence her. He then signled you to follow him and keep quiet. Luckly Jade and Grace had moved. Jade was smiling and Grace was blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Ant went Prone and crawled to the cave entrence. As your got there you saw the ones that are shouting. It was a group of 16 humans and by the looks of their armor they are a search and destroy party. You knew because these people always wore sliver armor with a cresent moon symbol on their chests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnt wispered to you \"get the others ready, we are going to have to take these guys out while we've still got suprise on our side.\" you nodded and crawled back to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ok guys get your weapons ready we are going to launch an attack on 16 guys.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam got up grabbed his sword and said \"Yerr I've been itching to use this blade for days.\" you just smiled at Sam knowing you won't be able to convince him that his wounds will stop him fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace had here spear extended, Cath had loaded an arrow into her bow, Jade had drawn a dagger,you had your sword and shield ready and Sam was swinging his sword to warm up. Your heart was beating at quite a fast pace now as you knew of the fight that would soon come. You said \"I think Ant is going to give us a signal so stand by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou then heard \"hay who..what?! No, NOOO!! Glark!!!\" and the sound of a knife slitting a mans neck, that must be the signal..You all charged into the men outside the cave. An arrow wizzed passed your head and struck a man, cath reloaded and continued fireing. Ant was already in the middle of them takeing 5 on by himself. Grace had just impailed someone and Jade was locked in a fight with 2 people. Sam charged swinging his sword hacking at anyone. You on the other hand has to raise your shield to stop an incomming Mace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spiked metal ball smashed Into your shield but the shield remained undammaged, thanks Raith, the force of the strike had knocked you over. The mace weilder had brought his weapon above him and brought it down with all his might. You quickly rolled to your right and just doddged the attack. The man kicked you in the ribs makeing you winch in pain. But you couldn't think about it now. You rolled again abd quickly stood up to face the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then started taunting you \"your a trator you know, no-one will help you, and soon your 'friends' will stab you in the back.\" you ignored his attempts to make you faulter and swung your sword at his right side. He used the metal handle of his mace to block your attack and he quickly countered with a punch to your gut. The blow had winded you and made you stagger. In you few seconds of weakness he had swung his mace again. You just got your shield up in time to stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you you kept on fighting you heard something that made you lose consentrarion it was Jades crys \"SAM NO!!\" you looked over to Sam and saw a sword sticking out of his back. As you were looking away the man swung his mace again. It was comeing twords you to fast. You couldn't stop it. You just closed your eyes ready to die when you were tackled to the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your eyes and saw Ant beside you smiling \"Wolf you owe me one now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man with the mace shouted \"hay get back this is a 1 on 1 fight!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to Ant as you got up and said \"I've got this, you help The others.\" you turned back to tge man and lunged your sword at him. He side stepped to dodge and tryed to punch the back of your head. You had expected this and delibtatly dropped to tge ground so he missed. You then rolled and swung with your sword catching the mans right leg leaving a deep wound. He cryer in pain \"AHHHHHHHH!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou diddnt stop though, as the man fell to one knee you stood up. Raised your sword. And brought it down taking the mans head with it. The headless body stated still for a little while then fell. You were puffing due to the pain you had. But you looked over at others to see all the other men were dead. But Sam was laying on the floor with Grace kelt beside him. You ran up to them and looked at Sam. He was in bad shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said \"Grace...m-make sure that yo-you stay alive ok?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace was crying and replyed \"don't die...you've had worce that this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam replyed \"Say hi to Ash and Shade for me.\" Sam smiled one more time and closed his eyes and stopped breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace shook him \"Sam?...SAM!!!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade ran over to Grace and put her arm on her sisters shoulder. \"Dont worry Grace he fought like one of our trine should..with honnor and courage.\" You could tell Jade was upset but she was keeping a straight face to help Grace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to Ant and saw him looking at the bodies.  He then stopped and kelt down and picked up a bit of paper and read it \"Wolf you will want to see this!!\" you ran over to him and read the paper...it read <i>Bring me the trators head, bring me all his friends heads we must show people what we do with trators...your orders are clear...David Todoe</i> your heart froze...David's Todoe was...      </span></div></div>",

Your head hurt like someone has just hit you with a tree. The first thing you saw was a Leopard anthro standing with Grace and Jade and Ant was no were near you line of vision. You were about to attack this new comer but since Grace and Jade was laughing with him he must be ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood up and thought a friendly approch was needed \"ok who ever hit me, that's one hell of a swing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leopard looked at you with hatred in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou asked \"what did I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace pushed the Leopard and said \"this is shade, our patrol scout and camo expert...Shade this is Wolf, with out him we would have never found you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShade laughed \"I found you Grace....anyway this 'Human' why do you trust him? He will probarly kill you the first chance he gets.\" you hated it when people talked 3rd person of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade answered his question \"Let me put it this way...if this human was not here nor would any of us...also he's being hunted by other humans.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShades eyes went wide \"The human army has sunk so low that it even attacks their own troops?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou replied \"pretty much yerr\" you put out your hand for him to shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShade looked at it and shook \"if you helped these two then you must be different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\njust then Ant came back with a Panther at his heels, he had a bow on his back and a makeshift sling on his arm, you guessed this was Ash. The first thing he said was \"So you are telling the truth about the others, in that case I am sorry.\" he turned to you \"the human you travel with?...he seems weaker than I thought he would.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell atleast Ash doesn't seem to mind your human. grace and Jade jumped at Ash and nearly crushed his arm in the prosess. Cath walked over to you. \"Wolf I've seen that look In your eyes before, what are you planning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCath was standing there with her paw on your shoulder, kind of like the way you would if you were about to say something bad. You replied \"The uncle that I hated from the moment I saw him, how does he know about me? And why is he after me? I have to find out. Even if I have to walk right up to him in his house in 'latipac' the captial city for the human and beat it out of him. I will find out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCath smiled \"I like the sound of beating up a human that you don't like...by the way I need to tell you something about Sam...He told me that his Mate died and he couldn't live without her. He was just going to let himself die before we found him...what I'm trying to say is, in that battle he diddnt block that strike on perpose, don't tell grace and Jade, they won't be able to handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthis info was shocking Sam LET himself get killed? Only because of his mate? But he diddnt seem sad at all. Poor guy. The others had finished with story shareing and were ready to move. Shade had tied a load of grass and things to himself to use as camoflarge he then saw you looking at him and said \"close your eyes human I'll show you why I'm wearing this.\" you did that and Shade laird down in a nearby bush. When you opened your eyes you could not see him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade said \"he's testing you Wolf...look out he might be anywere.\" you searched around seeing nothing. Then there was a knife at your neck. Shade said \"that's why I do it...to sneak up on my pray.\" Jade was laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\ngrace said \"I'm the only one to catch him before he strikes so far.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said \"so what shall we do?\"  </span></div></div>",

Then you heard a shout \"MOVE IN NOW!!\" A group of about 6 men came at you with swords, You ran at them with Shade at your side, He said to you \"I hope you don't mind blood.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShade drew duel knifes and at lightning speed Slashed at the nearest men slicing huge wounds in them and quickly moving to the next. you had now clashed swords with one man, then quickly had to side step left to dodge a swing from another , then duck a third. You rolled back to get all 3 in front of you. An Arrow shot passed by your head and hit one of the men straight in the head knocking him to the ground...dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCath was behind you with bow in hand, you nodded at her and went back to the fight. You ran at them with your sword slightly to the right to make it look like you were going to attack from that side. Then as they went to defend SMASH you hit one of them round with the head with your shield, He fell into a spin and hit the floor hard,if he didn't have that helmet on then his skull would have been smashed. the other one seemed a bit un-nerved by his fellow fighters fate, but he still had aggression in him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swung his blade in a over head swing, you put your shield up but at a slight angle so it would fall to the left. CLANG. the sword scraped your shield and slid off as you planned. you then spun hitting the sword with your shield and knocking it out of his hand, as you finished your spin you sliced at the man's arm taking it right off in one clean swipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Man screamed in pain like there was nothing else in the world at the moment. you thought it would be nice to end his pain. You lunged with your weapon and struck just above his heart. His death was quick. You turned to the others, Shade had gone to back up Ant and grace and Jade were fighting fine. But cath was not doing so well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fighter attacking her had just kicked her to the floor, She had dropped her bow and had no time to pull out a dagger, The Man lifted his sword and brought it down. Cath just managed to roll and the man only hit her left arm leaving a gash on it. You dropped your shield and pulled out a knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTook aim<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Threw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt flew through the air slowly spinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man raised his sword again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knife was getting closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen BAM the knife hit its target, the man's chest. He dropped his weapon and clutched his chest. Cath got up and with her sharp Fox like claws Slit the throat of the man. He fell to his knees and then over to the ground. you looked around, Jade and grace stabbed the last guy at the same time. Jade looked really fearsome with that blood on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnt came back with his blades covered in blood, Shade was close behind him.

Ash smiled \"Damn *cough* why is it always me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou saw Grace smile at that comment, you will have to ask about it later.

Your thought's were cut short when you saw a young boy from the village walking from the houses with a bucket in his hands, he must be going to the river. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back at the others, then you walked up to the boy. He saw you and went wide eyed, he then saw your blood covered sword resting by your side and stared backing off, but fell on his back. You walked up and said in a calm voice \"Dont worry, I'm only looking for supplies, can you show me to your village? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy must be no older that 10, he nodded at you still transfixed on your sword. He got up and said \"My farther can help you s-sir.\" you smiled at him and followed him. The boy turned to you and asked \"Are you a bad man? Farther says they are everywere.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the bit with to aggression in your eyes and said \"No I'm not bad, I'm just comming here to get some medical things for my friend who is hurt.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy seemed to relax a bit, but still kept of looking back at you every few minutes...After a short walk you entered the village. It was small, only a few houses big and a farm round the back. Then a man shouted \"Bowhan! Get away from the stranger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou looked at the man standing outside one of the huts, The boy who you guessed was called Bowhan ran to the man and said \"He's not a bad guy... He's trying to help his friend.\" the man talked to the child for a little bit before Turing to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want stranger?\" his question was straight to the point and had anger in the tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou answered \"My friend got hit by an arrow and I was looking for something that will help him...do you have any healing hearbs?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man said \"we do...but you must give us somethin as payment...you must give us some food...our village is being starved, the General has stopped all help to anyone outside the citys.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought to yourself 'Ant could probarly hunt a few things for them' so you said out loud \"I will be back soon with some meat, just get the hearbs ready.\" you turned and walked back to your group. They had just got out of the river and all saw you comming...you said \"Ant can you go get a deer or something, we can trade it for some hearbs from the village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnt who had somehow got all the blood of himself nodded and ran into the trees to hunt. \"Shade do you think you can help him?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShade flicked his leapord tail and said \"If it will help Ash then I'm on it.\" he dives into a bush and seemed to dissapear all togeather.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n................... An hour later................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnt and shade had comeback with their kills, Ant had a Roe deer with a clean slice on it's neck, and Shade had caught 4 rabbits and a bird of some sort. You said \"this should do fine...nice job you two.\" you picked it all up with a lot of difficulty and lugged it back to the village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man met you there with a shocked expresion \"I didn't think you would come back...the hearbs are ready here you go.\" he handed you an animal skin bag with a load of hearbs inside. You thanked him and was about to leave when he grabbed your arm, \"Sir please...we hate the new General in charge, he only cares about the war...you must stop him... He's inl Laitpac at the moment...only half a days walk from here, please help us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou looked at the man...he was telling the truth.

But after a while it got a bit confusing so you got up to walk and get some air. Your footsteps were the only sound to be heard in the dark night. About 100meaters away from the others was enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the sky. There was little light but most off it came from the moon, just sitting there watching the world spin all the time, without a care about anything. You were thinking about what the rest of the world must be like when you heard a rush of wind...no wait...the rush of something Cutting through the wind...a SWORD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped and rolled to your right seconds before a blade sliced the air where you were standing. You tryed to grab your shield...it wasn't there. You went for your sword, it was not there. You thought 'Damn I left them back With the others' all you had were a few daggers. You drew one in your right hand and searched the darkness for the target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes darted around the area to try to find where he is. Then there was that rushing sound again...behind you. You spun round and saw the flicker of light reflecting of metal, your insticnt was to duck, but the metal was comming at a dioagnle angle and you only had time to raise your dagger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLANG! It was knocked out of your hand but atleast it saved you, you wasted no time in drawing another one. You surrvayed your surroundings, you could make it back to camp and hopefully get the others but it will be hard, you started walking back constently looking around for the attacker. You heard the thump of feet hitting the ground, you looked right and saw a shadow move, you followed it and it turned and went straight for you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you could do was get ready to dodge so you stood ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt got closer <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd closer<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthen you dropped to the floor and swiped your legs at the oncomming foe. It hits it goal and you felt your foot his someone. Then with all the speed you could muster you jabbed with your dagger at where the shaddowed figure was, you only caught clothing. Then voices broke the darkness \"Wolf where are you. We heard a sword clang.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaddowed figure then looked at where the voices came from and ran into the night. Seconds later Ant was by your side asking \"Who was it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still looking around for where the attacker had gone before answering \"I-I don't know.\" </span></div></div>",

Wow the human race is harsh.\"  Ant walked over to Cath who was sitting up now and he then said \"how are you felling cath?\" you could tell that she was weak still but she's not going to admit it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCath said \"I'm fine, I think we can keep on going.\" thought so. Ant checked the wound, it had closed but not healed, Cath winced a bit, she was clearly still in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnt said \"if that sword had gone in a bit more up then you probarly wouldn't have lived so if you are despret to get going then we can make a strecher.\" that wound has healed pretty fast, on a human it would still be bleeding. Ant saw your face and knew you had little knowledge on this subject. \"Grace do you mind telling Wolf a little about anthros.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace looked at you then walked over the tree from last night and sat down, \"Wolf, A canine anthro heals Very fast,A feline anthro, has unmatched stamanar, a horce anthro has unmatched speed, a bird anthro has unmatched eye sight,Ect ect... Each type of anthro has something that makes them different from others...what do they teach you in the human citys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou diddnt want to answer that because they teach that all anthros are murdrers. So you all had some of the things thar Ant has brought back. It looks like it will be atleast a day before going. Grace then wispered into your ear, \"when we get to my tribe you should stay with us,sure your human but the leader thinks your ok and that makes you ok to join.\" that struck you, joining an anthro tribe...it won't be that bad but there's no point thinking about it at the moment. But for now they should just wait for cath to get better and then they can leave.</span></div></div>",

How could she kill something so small, cute and innocent. You hadn't done anything to the anthros and no human is there to protect you. You can't even walk or talk yet, let alone defend yourself. She lowers her sword gently and puts it back in it's sheath. She then says as she picks you up craddles you in her arms, \"How can something as small as you become something so menacing and cruel?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are soon picked up and the fruit your new mother had given you was set on the table. You then are carried out of the hut. You see everyone looking at you, most with curiosity on their faces (But you didn't know, for you were just an infant), some with the 'for a human, this one is really cute' look, and some with 'why did she bring that murderous human here' look. Soon she reaches the village leader, with you in her arms. \"Malena, you are here before us to explain why you have brought a 'human' to our secluded village. Please tell us your story, you and the human will be judge fairly,\" says one leader who was a silver, aged wolf with scar across his right chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kneels with you still in her arms for a moment, rises and then says, \"Wise village leaders, I know that our relations with the humans has not been peaceful as of recent, but there is a reason I have acted the way I did. I was out on patrol, scanning for any signs that the human warriors were about to make move. I had not found any, and on my way back towards the village, that's when I heard a baby cry. I soon came upon this human infant, he was just laying there, so I scanned and sniffed the area for any other signs of adult humans, and none were there. My best conclusion was that he had been abandoned by his own mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gets gasps throughout the entire crowd, for none of them would ever abandon their young ones, Giving Malena a lot of sympathy, even from the ones who disliked humans for what they did. Malena continues, \"My first instinct as a warrior was to kill him on sight, but before I even took a swing of my sword... Well, you could say maternal instinct kicked in. He was all alone helpless, and very frightened, but when he saw me, it was as if he saw me as his mother. I felt I couldn't leave him there to die, after all, he is only an infant, and has done no harm to our people. Most humans humans who fight us these days were taught to hate us. All I ask is that you help me to raise this child, teach him the ways of the anthro, don't make him feel like an outcast and maybe, through him, we can find a way to bring peace between anthros and humans once more. It's your decision wise ones, and I will accept whatever his fate is to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Anthro elders talked amongst each other for a while and Malena had some villagers say to her, \"I think what you did was a noble act.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the elders were finished discussing the elder wolf says, \"Malena, bring forth the child.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brings you up and then they say, \"For a human baby, he sure is a strong one. That will be useful for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalena liked where this was going and soon the elder wolf from before says, \"Your story was very moving. Our first intention was to send the child back where you found it, however, your actions have led us to choose that child stay here with the anthros, be raised as one of our own, and as you said may be our hope for peace. And the counsel and I feel he should not be treated any differently then any other of our people here. I'm sure you will be a fine mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalena smiles and the counsel says to the crowd, \"Is there anyone who thinks differently after hearing our decision? If you do, please feel free to step forward,and state your opinion. It will not bring harm to you or your loved ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd remain silent and no one even raised a hand for they were all moved by her story. \"Then this meeting is adjourned. Everyone may go and enjoy their day,\" says the elder wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe village then dispersed and went about their daily routines. Malena thanks the village counsel and soon heads back towards her hut with you in her arms. Many of the villagers gave her smiles and even some come to greet you and you playfully giggle, as some tickle you or let you hold their finger. Some would say, \"Your son has a strong grip,\" already accepting you as Malena's son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles and soon you are both at her hut. As she was about to enter, a fellow wolfess anthro says, \"Excuse me Malena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalena turns to her and says, \"Rosa, may I help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I was wondering if maybe you would like to use my sons old crib. He has grown out of it, and I thought since you have a new adopted son, he might need it,\" She says with the crib along side her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalena says, \"Thank you very much Rosa, that is very generous of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Least I can do for a friend,\" Rosa says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they are inside and you are soon sleeping in the crib as your new mother and her friend talk and have some dinner, for Malena knew you were too young to eat any solid food, and thankfully she was able to lactate to give you the milk you need. Soon you woke up hungry and begin to lightly cry. \"Aww. The little one is hungry,\" Rosa says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well dinner time for this young one,\" Malena says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she picks you up and places you on her right breast as you begin to suckle. She covers you with a blanket to let you nurse in private as she talks to Rosa. Soon you finish and fall back asleep. \"Well this little guy has had a busy day. In fact we all should get some sleep. You are carried to your crib, which is close to your mothers bed and she sets you down to sleep peacefully. She soon says goodbye to her friend and shuts the door quietly so not to wake you. She then falls asleep herself, and motherly instincts take over as she wakes when you do for changing diapers, and feeding you, which she didn't mind one bit. When you wake it's...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Five years had passed since Malena  had found you and the council had granted you to stay. Your name was Kesh, meaning in ancient anthro language, 'hope'. You had dark brown hair that was in a bit of a shag and navy blue eyes like most of the anthro wolves in the village, only you could not see in the dark like them. You did not know it yet, but all the grownups were having high hopes that you were the one to bring an end to the war. You had the same problems any anthro or human 5 year old would have. You had good friends, but also some rivals. Some of the older kids would tease you, but there were others who would defend you. Some of the anthro wolves around your age were skeptical of your presence in the village, and thought you may join the humans at any moment. Even a few teenagers were just a bit uneasy with you, but knew better then the young ones, including yourself. You did your best to fit in, and all the grownups found it cute how acted more like a anthro pup rather than a human child. Now Malena was a mother to you for a couple years, but tragically, when you were three years of age, Malena had been killed in an ambush that the humans had set up, she and a few other warriors were slain. The village council were deciding what to do with you, when Rosa and Andreas stepped forward and requested to adopt you as their own son. They felt at the very least it would make Malena happy and it would make them happy as well. The council saw no argument in the matter, since there was their son, Soma that was no more then 3 weeks older then him. So they allowed them to take him in as their own. As you grew older, you and Soma did everything together, and were an unbreakable duo in your brotherhood. No matter who tried to tear you two apart, you could not be separated. Even when you were told of your true identity and how you came to be here it still didn't split the two of you up. Some of the older anthro children and teenagers looked up to your example of brotherhood. Today, You and Soma headed to the lake to skip some rocks. You were seeing who could make the most skips, and so far you were winning by one skip. You both realized it was getting close to lunchtime and you say, \"We better get home bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoma nods in agreement, but just as you turned to leave, you see some older rivals. \"Well well, look what have here, the human and his so called brother out alone,\" the older boy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want this time Akru,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now is that any way to speak to your higher in commands,\" Akru says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a break, your no leader. Your nothing but a bully,\" Soma says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkru comes and picks Soma up by his shirt and says, \"I'll teach you some respect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, show him who's boss Akru,\" one of Akru's friends says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you take a dip in this deep end of the lake,\" Akru says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not thaaaaaaa!\" Soma screams as he was thrown in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soma!\" you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoma didn't know how to swim and was starting to drown. You then see him go under. Being given some lessons in swimming, you dive in and swim down to grab your brother. Akru and his gang left before they were caught, or so they thought. As you grab your brother you start to pull him back up. He had already gone unconscious so he didn't make a struggle, but just about halfway back up, you could no longer hold your breath, and start to slip away into unconsciousness as well. Before you pass out, you see an adult anthro wolf figure coming down towards the two of you, and you feel just before passing out an arm wrap around your belly. You were seeing nothing but black, for a bit, but as you came to, you were coughing up water so you could breath. \"Take it easy son, you and Soma have been through quite the ordeal,\" the voice says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision was blurry for a second, but as it cleared up, you see Andreas, the combat teacher (and of course your father), and you see Soma sitting next to him , and wrapped in your dad's dry cloak. \"Dad, (cough)  how did you (cough) (cough) know we were (cough) in trouble? If (cough) (cough) you don't my asking,\" you say through lack of breath and coughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just so happened to be in the right place when Akru was bullying the two of you again. I stayed hidden so I would have eye witness proof that he was being reckless, even outside of his training classes and to back up your story when we go see the council members later on. After I saw Soma get thrown in, I was going to act, but then I see you jump in to try and save him. That was brave of you Kesh, and we need that kind of bravery in warriors, I can see both of you having great potential in becoming warriors,\" your dad says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then hear from not too far away, as you were coughing, \"Oh my goodness, Soma! Kesh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see your mother come running to the three of you and, as you sit up, you realize how cold you are and immediately curl up to keep what body heat you had left. Rosa sees this and takes off her hooded cloak she was wearing to come and wrap it around you. \"What happened to them dear? Why do they look so terrified?\" She asks,wrapping her self around you and Soma to keep you two warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They just had a near death experience honey. They were minding their own business when Akru showed up and threw Soma into the lake. Kesh jumped in after him and had I not been here to see it happen, they both may have drowned. I'm so glad our boys are okay,\" Andreas says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As am I. Come on, let's get these two little ones home and give them a warm bath. They also deserve some of my famous deer stew, their favorite,\" you mom says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dad nods and soon your mom picks you both up and carries you home, along the way saying, \"You boys are getting bigger every day. In a few years or so I won't be able to carry you like this any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you laugh at your mom's comment and lay your heads down on her shoulders giving her a hug. Soon you were home, and your mom sets you down as the two of you head to your shared bedroom to get your wet clothes of as your dad warms up some water to put in your bath.Soon you come out with your parent's cloaks around you both, and your mother laugh as she says, \"Your not getting into your bath with those, your father and I need them later. Besides, it's no like we haven't seen you two without clothes on before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their boy's honey, it's their nature to do that around you,\" your dad says as he pours the last of the warm water into the tub they had built (of course they had no drainage pipes in mid evil times, so the water would stay there till they dumpped it).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two jump into the tub and as your mother cleans you, you splash each other, and she scolds every time she is cleaning one of you. before you know it your bath is done and the stew was ready. You both help yourselves to it and thank your mom for the meal, though you weren't entirely full. Your mom then says, \"Alright boys time for a nap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww,\" you both say in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mom, we're not tired,\" you say with a betraying yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother knew were not going down with out a fight, but she had a way make you fall asleep, without you realizing it. Now human mothers usually stop nursing their children at around a year old, but anthros would do it until their children were six, or when the children decide to ween themselves. You were no exception to their anthro ways for they had not studied how long humans nurse their kids. Your mom then says, \"Well since you two were so brave today, you can have some of my milk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you don't complain, since breast milk tasted sweet to the two of you, and helped the two of you take your little minds off every day five year old stuff. You did not realize that the milk actually helped to make you sleepy and sometimes you unconsciously suckled on her breasts. She then lifts her shirt to let you two latch on and then puts the shirt over your heads to give you privacy. You both nurse until your eyes would no longer stay open and you fall asleep. Your mother then takes the two of you to your room and lays you down gently so not to wake you and the two of you nap contently bellies full. Your dad then went to gather the council members for a private afternoon meeting about your encounter with Akru.</span></div></div>",

You understood you were different from everyone else in the village, but the entire village had come to love you. You had the same teenage problems that any human or anthro would have. Sure, a few of the anthro teenagers teased you now and again for being different, but that is what made you special, and they were still your friends. You had been trained in the art of hand to hand combat since you could walk. All of the warriors helped with your training, and you had become one of their best students. Many of the warriors were talking about hand picking you and some of your anthro friends to join their ranks at a very young age for your special talents. Your Mother, Malena, was hoping for and at the same time dreading this. She didn't want to lose you after so many years of calling you her son. You always found a way to cheer her up, telling her about your day. She never would have dreamed that had accomplished so much, but that made her all the more happy. You spent some of your days at other areas of training such as: medical, blacksmith, archery, cooking, even a little bit of reading and farming was picked up. All these talents would be needed in the future for your war against your own. You had been told of your kind foolish crimes against the anthros, but neither you nor the village blamed you for them. You knew that the war would rage on and on as you got older. You also knew you could confuse your own, because of who you were. No one ever told you, but you felt that you would be the bringer of peace, and you did your best every day to try and prove it. Soon the day was ended, and it was time to head back to the hut. You knew your mother had dinner ready, and hope it was deer, for that was your favorite meat, be it roasted or a stew. You had also developed a good sense of hearing and smell compared to the rest of your kind. You are soon smelling the deer that you had hoped for and run towards the hut. You open the door and your mother says, \"Hello there honey, I made your favorite, Deer stew. How was training today sweetie?\" \"It's was hard, but it was fun mother, and my friend Martin is starting to think I might beat him one of these times if I keep training as hard I do. Oh, I almost forgot, Calvin the baker gave me some free bread today on my way home for helping him out so much in the bakery shop yesterday,\" You say pulling out the bread. \"That's wonderful Lucian, we can have that with the stew tonight. You must have a big appetite tonight after training,\" your mother says, making you both laugh. Soon you sit down to eat and give her the run down on how training went, and then she tells you about her patrol for the day. Soon you finish dinner and both of you head to bed for some sleep. You no longer slept in a crib of course, you slept on your own bed that you had helped to make with one of the carpenters in town when you were little. Soon you and your mother fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were in a nightmare. Standing in the woods surrounded by trees. It's the same as last night, infact this nightmare has been going on for months now. Everything seems to be shrouded in a dark veil making everything look blury and out of focus. Reasently you had been taught to tell when you were alseep or awake as a meditation method so you knew this is a nightmare and you know exactly what's going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see yourself in 3rd person almost like you are spectating a pray from a near by treetop. But the one your watching is the younger you. When you were 6 and got lost in the woods. Your emotions seem to be fueling the sceane as the more worried your youngerself got the darker and more violent the nightmare gets. Soon the trees seemed to be crushing into your sides forcing you to follow that younger version of yourself aimlessly wandering the woods. The trees started reaching out at you and start scraching you with their sharp branches. While the wind howls \"alone, lost, hated, alone, lost, hated.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, you remember this day all too well. When the wolf pups your age had grouped up and started shouting \"Freak! Killer! You don't belong here!\" the day when 3 or your village had been badly by humans while out on a hunt. You ran into the woods crying only to find yourself lost and alone...and hated. But now you know that they only shouted abuse at you because that's what their parents had been saying about the other humans. But back then trying to be recognised as an equal was everything, even at a young age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trees that are clawing at you then start shouting in your ear \"Alone!! Lost!! Hated!!!\" and no matter how many nights you've Been through this it still gets to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then shout back \"I'm not alone, I'm not hated!! Everyone likes me in the village!\"  your younger self then sits down and curled up in a ball terrified. You know then what the nightmare does. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything goes conpleatly silent apart from the echoing sound or your younger versions crying. And your mother seems to just spear right beside you. The trees wrap round you and resrict your movement and your youngerself stops crying, stands up, stares at you with pure black eyes, and smiles a smile that looks like nothing but pure evil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother then talks but her voice is not her own, but of abother females voice your sure you've heard before but can't remember where and she is saying \"your a human, you don't belong with the wolves! You will never be anything to them, you belong with your own kind.\" the scene then seems to fade and go straight to your village. But every building is warped and disorted. But your mother is still beside you and so is your younger swlelf, still smiling and even though the trees are gone you still can't move. you mother then wispers in your ear \"you know what it's going to come to\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the whole village bursts into flames and screaming fills the air. Screaming of all your friends. And you can't bare it. You try to close your eyes and cover your ears but your body won't do that. Then your younger self starts mealting into the fire. Still smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You suddenly shoot awake in a cold sweat breathing heavely. You quickly look around. Your own room, you woke up before the worst part of the nightmare started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up and look outside. Still dark. You take a deep breath of the cool night air to try and clear your mind of the images from the nightmare. You know you will never get too sleep again so you get dressed and head outside for a walk. Just to wall around the village to pass the time. You've barely stepped out of the door when someone says \"hello Lucian\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I just wanted to take a stroll through the village to clear my head,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll come with you, maybe you could tell me what's on your mind,\" Martin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not. I don't mind some company from a friend,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both start walking through the village and everything is peaceful and silent aside from your conversation. \"So what is on your mind Lucian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I had the nightmare again. I was able to wake up before it got any worse. But the images and words still haunt me. I can't help but feel that something bad is going to happen. The nightmare has gotten weaker, but it still terrifies me. I'm trying to think of a way to conquer my nightmare so it will stop coming. I know that it was something that happened long ago, but the nightmare just makes it a hundred times worse. I just hope that the nightmare isn't something that comes true again. It's kind of one reason why I train so hard. So that if I am banished for who knows what reason, I'll be able to defend myself out there. But the main reason is so I can protect this village. Everyone here has respect for me and like being around me, and I don't want to see any of them get hurt. Even if it means I'll have to kill my own kind. Your the best there is Martin. And I would feel sorry for any low lives of my kind that crosses a blade with you,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm always at a stalemate when it comes to fighting you. Your also the best there is Lucian, and no one can tell you different. And this dream of yours, it will pass in time. Maybe It's preparing your for battle. I really wish your kind could see what they did wrong and be more like you, Your the only human who understands our side of the story. We all understand theirs. Your a brilliant warrior in training, and as I see it you may be the only one who could bring about peace. That's all the anthro's want, but we the humans, aside from yourself won't listen to reason. You know, I've been having some bad dreams myself lately. not as frequent as yours but still they bring sadness and terror to me every time I have them. They also bring me a sense of guilt. We were so rotten to you that day, we didn't really mean anything by it, but you didn't know much about sarcasm at that time, then again none of us did. We didn't realize that we had really hurt your feelings until it was too late. After that day, I made sure to always be on your side,\"  Martin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and say, \"And I thank you for being a good friend to me all these years. Say, what do you think the counsel is holding a meeting for at the gathering area later today.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I honestly don't know, but this will be our first time attending without our parents supervision, now that we're old enough. Maybe, it's just routine as always,\" Martin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, maybe your right. Just seems a little odd to have two meetings within a day of each other, or maybe I'm just letting my mind play tricks on me,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows, your not the first it has happened to, and you won't be the last,\" Martin says, and you both laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then you hear a twig break behind you and both of you pull your blades out. \"Show yourself,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy boys, it's just me,\" says your combat  teacher, Andreas, who was a tan colored anthro wolf, with a scar on his left arm from battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andreas, we thought you might have been trouble,\" Martin says as you both put your swords back in their sheaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I see you two are in top form, that will serve you well in battle, but you still need to work on catching the scent of your enemy. Remember, your opponent may not be as noble as you every time and could attack when your back is turned,\" Andreas says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we did catch your scent, we just need to work on knowing how close you are,\" you say and Martin nods in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndreas smiles and says, \"Well, you may have to learn some of these things on your own, maybe even in battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's all head to the gathering area, we'll be able to get a good spot if we're there early, since they are holding the meeting early,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an excellent idea, the early bird always catches the worm,\" Andreas says and you all laugh at his joke as you head to the village gathering area for a good spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndreas knew full well that the meeting was to pick the teenagers who had special talent to join the ranks of the the older anthro wolves. He knew you and Martin would no doubt be picked along with some of your other good friends, and 2 certain she-wolf anthros you and your friend had crushes on.</span></div></div>",

These warriors will be chosen based on their unique talents and not on popularity in the village. Do not feel that you are not worthy of becoming a warrior if you are not picked, for there will always be the next time we hold a meeting like this. Now, will the young men and women 13 years or older please stand before the counsel,\" said an elder anthro wolf (the same that had said you would stay, when you first came to them).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and 13 other teenagers step forward before the counsel. You were a bit nervous, thinking they may not pick you due to the fact that you were a human. 10 of you were here for the first time and 4 of you were here for a second time. \"Our first warrior that we choose today is.... Martin,\" the elder says, after talking it over with the other elders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin takes a step forward as was custom and the crowd gives a big applause and the elder continues \"Our second choice is............... James, or as most of you know as Jimmy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy was a good friend of yours, and was a year older than you, and he and you showed a sigh of relief as he stepped forward. The crowd applauded for him as well, though maybe not as strong. \"Our third choice......................... is Lucian,\" the elder says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis came as a shock to you, for you thought if picked at all, you would be picked last. The crowd gave you a big cheer as you stepped forward. As big as Martin's. The elders picked the other three and as predicted, two of them were the girls you and Martin had eyes for. They all got cheers from the crowd as well and the elder says, \"Congratulations on a job well done young ones. I have no doubt that there will be amazing things in your futures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could have sworn he was looking straight at you when he said the last part. Did he know something about your future that you did not. You didn't let it bother you too much as the elder says, \"The next town meeting will be held in one week. Go and enjoy the rest of your day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ones who were not picked were happy for all of you and congratulated you. You were about to walk off when you and Martin were stopped by one of the elders. \"Martin, Lucian, I know you both just became warriors and will continue to work at it, but we have an assignment for you. There is a human village to the south of us. We need you to do some reconnaissance there for us. Travel lightly take your swords, your bows and arrows and some scout uniforms. We've already had them fitted for each of you. Be careful and report anything suspicious back to us. If you don't find anything come back in four hours and the next group will go. If we send more then two of you, we may get spotted. Good luck to you both, we hope the best for you and know you won't let us down,\" the elder says.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yes sir,\" you both reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both head off to grab your equipment and bid your families farewell as you venture towards the human village, remaining silent and not getting too close for comfort.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You and martin both know the drill, the training you've done togeather instantly shows as the 2 of you silently enter the woods...the sun is now rising and you and martin had had breakfast only a few minutes ago. But this was your first proper mission, martins aswell. The two of you start treading lightly on your paws/feet, but because of your foot shape you have to roll them on each steap to make them silent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you have only just left the village your both on full alert, not wanting to mess this chance up. It's just a simple recon mission anyway. No combat involved. Hopefully. But just encase, you have your weapons...the sword that's almost a short sword by your side. You went for the shorter sword when you frost started using them because it seemed to make switching to un-armed a lot easier and with smaller weapons you cam also pull of a lot of un-armed combat moves. But the bow is just a standard bow...used for ranged combat and hunting. You don't exell at ranged combat and almost always rely of close quarters fighting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and martin walk in single file with a 4 meter gap between you as to make it so if one of you gets caught in a snare or some form of trap then the other has time to react. Martins eyes are covering front and right while yours cover left and back. The only sounds being that of the light morning wind blowing through the trees and the birds singing their summer songs, this mixed togeather with the gentle trickle of the river near the village makes this a very plesent experance. But between you and martin your focus is on what's not clear to see rarther than what is. There is also no speech when on missions, only paw signals and in martins case tail movements are also used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to just fly by from when you left the village to when Martin gives a quick paw signal indercating that the target is in sight. Soundlessly you two get onto your bellies and slowly crawl the last part of the way. The sounds of people talking and laughing start filling your ears. Laughter is a good sign, no-one laughs when they know there's an enemy sneaking up on them. But are humans really an enemy? Can what everyone says be true?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese thoughts are pushed out of your mind as you crawl up beside Martin and move silently into a bush that has a good field of view of the place you are doing a reece (recon mission) of and the sights that fill your eyes are not what you expected. There are humans of both genders there, and most don't look like military personel. There is a lot less people here compared to your village. But they don't seem to be much different than the wolves, just moving around and getting on with their lives. This should be easy to report back, its just a settlement full of non-military personel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Martin pointed something out. \"hey Lucian, look around and tell me what's missing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou reply \"what's missing? Ok well..\" this question stumped you for a until it clicked, it wasn't that there's not much military here it's... \"there's no form of fighting force here at all, not even guards.\" thoughts start swimming through your mind, but one seems to stand out. 'why have no guards unless your not trying to keep them alive and safe.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin seems to be thinking the same thing and wispers \"something wrong\" he then uses paw signals to direct both of you to move round a bit to see what more can be seen. You begin crawling through the under-growth that surrounds the little settlement until you've moved about 50 meters round and you can now see a little bit more. But it still doesn't revile anything new. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly Martin sniffs tha air and signals that some people are comming from right behind them, he signals 20, no 22 people walking towards the village. The two of you go perfectly still and hope that the plants and grass surrounding you are enough to keep you hidden. You think that maybe you shouldn't have moved from your first spot but there's not enough time to go back because now you can hear them. Marching. Maybe the settlements military? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch the reactions of the villgers as thru start to notice the people. They seem confused. You think that if they are confused then they don't expect them. The marching people are very close to your spot now. If they keep going in the same direction then they are going to go straight past the two off you. The next seconds seem to drag on...the people marching closer and closer until they are going straight past you. The villagers are now comming to see what's happening, curious as you are about these people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't even dare to breath, your heart is raceing so fast that if they wernt marching then chances are that they would be able to hear your heart. You've trained for if an enemy walks past but all the training in the world can not ready you for the real thing, if one of them sees you and Martin then who knows what they might do. But finally the last one walks past you and into the village, you then thought 'i knew we should have checked for clearly used entrances to the village' but your eyes are on the people who now stand in the village, a wearing dark blue clothes and wearing face-masks, but the thing that really catches your eyes is that they are all heavily armed, and because of their full body uniforms you can't tell weather they are anthro or human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfusing and fear is filling up the villegers voices now. But one of the masked people step towards and gives an order. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The masked figure, who appears to be the leader of the group removes his mask and you see that it is a human man, who has a scar running diagonally down the middle of his face. He looks back at his comrades and yells, \"Kill them all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after he said that you see the masked figures, who you definitely could tell were all human by this point, start running towards the villagers, swords drawn, and all were giving out a battle cry. What you saw next would scar you for the rest of your life. The masked men started slaying their own kind, and not just the men, but women and children too. You feel a bit sick to your stomach as you watch the bloodshed,and you think, 'How could humans do such a horrible thing to each other. It isn't right.' Your broken out of your train of thought as Martin says, \"I can't stand it. I'm going after them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab him, pull him back under cover and say, \"Martin no. Remember, rule 34, as long as the enemy doesn't see you, stay hidden. Only fight if there is no other alternative. I know it's horrible to watch, but we are here for recon only, if we attack now we may just add to the bodies, plus we've gotta be realistic here. There are two of us and 2 dozen of them, they'd kill us if not capture us. Once they are gone, we will see if any survived or evaded capture, should they take prisoners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin didn't even argue, for he knew you were right. You tired your best not to watch the carnage, but you also had to be careful and watch put for any of the masked men were to come towards you. Finally the bloodshed had ceased and all that remained were the masked men still standing among many dead villagers blood spilling out of their guts and some along with internal organs. \"Good work men, let us be back off to our fortress. We don't want those mangy beast anthros catching us out in the dark. Keep up, because if they catch you, your on your own. Move out,\" the leader orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Soon they march off into the forest back the way they came. You and Martin had taken time during the onslaught to find better cover and wait until the humans are completely out of sight. You then signal martin to move silently as you head toward the village. What you see is exactly what the humans wanted of anthros. To have them eliminated, every direction you look you see dead bodies lying all over the place. You pull your short sword out and say, \"Let's go in, but be quiet, we don't need to make any of those humans aware we are here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It never hurt you to say the word 'human' in an insulting manner, for you always felt more of an anthro then human, and even some of the people in your village said showed qualities of an anthro to them but did not know why and sometimes you wish you were an anthro rather then human. Martin nods and you have your blades at the ready. Every step you took forward, the smell and presence of death encircled you and Martin. You had never seen this kind of bloodshed in all of your life. It was horrific, terrifying, and this was the one thing that would set you apart from your own kind for as long as you lived. This had made you wish you could become an anthro somehow. After seeing this, you would never want to turn to their side, even if they offered you the best treatment, this kind of action filled your heart with hate of any human wanting to kill anthros and their own alike. As you walk on, you all of the sudden see a man moving. You and Martin put away your swords and run over to him and as you see him pinned under a large log that had been cut loose by the masked men you say, \"Martin, help me get this off him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin then helps you lift this off him. The man laid there and said, \"Please, just make it quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing he was wanting to die, you ask, \"Sir, why did those men attack you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, we were wanting to cast aside our differences with the anthro people. Our leader in a neighboring village saw it as treason, and slayed all in his village he knew agreed with us. Now his men came here to finish the job. We never wanted this war in the first place. It was all due to a misunderstanding, we knew that, and we had heard rumors that the anthros had learned it long before we did. It became clear to many when we noticed that the anthros never came to ransack human villages. most of the time they avoid us, unlike you two, and yes we have also heard rumors that one of the anthro villages was raising a human. At first we thought it was a joke, but others claimed to have seen a human child who was playing with anthro children,\" he says through his pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew he meant you and your friends, for there was a few times you had sneaked out of the village to play, and sometimes got in trouble for it. The man finally says, \"Please, make my pain go away. My time has come, and I'll be with my family again. Do not feel guilty, you've done all you can. All you can do now is win and stop the war, for us and for everyone else seeking the peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Martin who gives you a slow silent nod, and a sad expression on his face. You nod back and soon sit above the man and position your knife right towards his heart. You whisper a silent prayer taught from the anthros and soon pierce the man in the heart. He makes one last gasp smiles as his eyes shut for the final time. you keep saying your prayer for a little while and then stand up. Your friend comes over and puts an arm on your shoulders to ease your conflicting thoughts of what had happened. He then says, \"Come on Lucian, lets report back to the village council. The sooner we leave this day behind the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and soon both of you are on the move, keeping your eyes aware of your surroundings for any of the masked figures that could have fallen behind, though luckily none had. As you walk you say to Martin, \"Do you think there is any hope to bring peace between our kinds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think there is, and sometimes hope is the one thing the starts it, though maybe not right away. It was surprising to see a human village that cared about us rather then want us destroyed,\" Martin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes, wish there was a way to be more anthro,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you say that Lucian?\" Martin asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I just feel like I was born into the wrong kind sometimes. Don't get me wrong, I am grateful for the people accepting me for who I am instead of what I am, but I just wish there was a way to make it so I not stand out in a physical nature. I sometimes have the feeling of being a burden for being human,\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucian, you are no burden,\" A voice says, and you it was your teacher, Andreas, who must have followed you to a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continues saying \"You are actually a help to our people. Don't just focus on the big things you have done in the years, think about the small thing you have done, like at the bakery and with the blacksmiths.

They had taught you never to attack a human unless he attacks you first. The humans must have done something to make an anthro wound one of their soldiers.

You quietly head northward, doing your best to stay hidden your just about out of sight when You and Martin accidentally step on a twig.

Your instincts were right, because a human had stopped running and one was taking aim at your friend with a bow and arrow and was about to fire. As the arrow is released, you yell \"No!\" as you jump into the line of fire. The arrow then pierced through a gap in your armor and went into your right shoulder.

Just then a bright light came out of nowhere and blinded everyone. Once it dimmed down, everyone sees anthro spirits from the past. \"Do not fear fellow anthros for we have come to help,\" an anthro spirit says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthros are in complete shock that some faint. The spirit continues saying, \"All the spirits of the past have been watching you for a long time as you raised this young human, granted there were some times you were a bit harsh, but as he has grown he has shown qualities found more in an anthro then in a human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe village had no idea where this was going, but the anthro finishes by saying, \"We have talked it over with the human spirits and they have agreed, since his own kind now turned against him that he will become one of you, a true anthro. Please step back as we perform his transformation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villagers wasted no time in letting them pass. You were slipping into unconsciousness as the spirits form a circle around you and begin your transformation. You were out cold as they lift your body from the ground. Your mother wants to intervene but her fellow anthros hold her back, and she understands. You soon are engulfed in a bright light and once it has faded, you no longer were human, but a silver colored anthro wolf. They soon set your body back down and say, \"Our task is complete. He is now one of you, and will longer be under threat from other anthro villages. He will be out cold for a couple of hours, so just get him back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spirits soon disappear and see you in your anthro body now. Martin inspects closer and says, \"His wound is gone, and so is the arrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd give a sigh of relief and Martin says, \"Lets get my friend Lucian here back home so he can rest comfortably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villagers then pick you up and take you back to you and your mother's hut and set you down on your bed. They soon leave to wake up the other anthros who had fainted and your mother sits close to you as you rest, waiting till you woke up to break the happy news to you.</span></div></div>",

This flicks your mind back to the mission, how it so quickly went from simple recon to running for your life. When you two arived at the village you're not really sure what happened. The pain from the arrow became too intence and you shortly blacked out. But from what you've been told the arrow was removed, but it was a struggle. The arrow had lodged itself into a small gap just under your shoulder blade and to remove it the healers had to cut away some more flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis has now left you with a wound that hurts every time you try and move your right shoulder and to try and decreese movement a sling has Been fitted round your right arm. Seconds after sitting up your mother came rushing in saying so many things at once you only catch a word here and there. \"worried, hurt, arm, brave\" but from these words you can only guess that she's still feeling proud of what you did but sick with worry and also her tone indercates other emotions, guilt maybe. She must be blameing herself for not being there to protect you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally stops fussing you when there is a knock at the door. She stands up and walks away. But you can hear her conversation. \"oh hello there\" <br>\r\nthe other voice replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"is Lucian awake?\" the voice belong to Martin, wait what's the time? Your look outside and see the sun high in the sky. Mid-day already? You silently laugh at this because you constently say to Martin to always be up early. The conversation between your mother and Martin goes on for a little while longer which gives you enough time to painfully get dressed in your dark green shirt and Black Trousers. By the time you've fully dressed Martin bursts through your door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask in a friendly manner \"how are you doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin give you a nervious smile and replies \"that's my line, you took an arrow for me, if you hadn't done that I would be...\" he cuts himself of there and looks at your right arm, silently thinking about how close to death he had been. \"anyway i've done all the reports and boreing stuff like that, and our training instructor seemed to beam with pride when I told him what you did.\" you smile at him in a way of saying thanks. his eyes flock to your shoulder and then he keeps talking \"why did you do it? I might not have died but you go wounded for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou think this over for about a heartbeat and respond \"it's what I do for my friends. No matter what situation they are in or how badly I will get hurt, I will always be there for them. Besides training would be too easy if I couldn't spar with you\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartins eyes light up \"I am glad your my friend Lucian...I bet out of all the humans and anthros your the best of them.\" this comment makes you feel embaressed, you've never really been good with getting praise from others so you quickly change the subject. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask \"Hey want to go walk around the village a bit and maybe grab some breakfast...sorry lunch..,I'm starving\" this brings both of you to laugh at that comment but Martin agrees. So you say where your going to your mother who gives you about a million worried comments before you and Martin can finally escape into the village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin says that the both of you should go to his home to get some lunch, his parents would be more than happy to do it. So you and Martin begin the short walk towards where he lives. But on this short walk everyone you pass seems to look at you, but their eyes show a form of respect. You lean over to Martin and wisper \"news travels quickly doesn't it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin laughs and says \"oh hehe, you have your mother to thank for that, aparently she was talking loud enough for most of the village to hear.\" you laugh again but that movement rewards you with another shot of pain in your shoulder. Martin seems to notice your pain and says \"how much does it hurt?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug your shoulders which brings yet another stab of pain and reply \"it's nothing really, also when the arrow hit it didn't seem like you would expect, I didn't feel huge pain, it just felt like getting punched and then it felt really cold...the pain only came later when we were near the village, thanks for helping me back by the way\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin is about to say something when.</span></div></div>",

It's not in me to cower behind my friends and family, even if it means I have to risk my own life,\" you say, trying not to show embarrassment about getting praise from others (It was a flaw you were doing your best to work on).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish more humans were like Lucian. If they remembered the friendship we had with them, we wouldn't have this conflict. We are all glad you are one who understands, now it just a matter of work to win the rest of the humans friendship back. The ones who are their leaders are becoming obsessed with power, and are poisoning the rest of the humans with false information. The ones in power think that humans are a better race then anthros. I don't mean to say this to offend you though Lucian,\" Ronak says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know sir, and in all honesty, I'm glad to have been brought up by this village, rather then having been raised by the humans. I don't despise them, but I am not about to go and fight for whatever greedy cause they are fighting for, nor will I ever. My place is among you, and after what they did to me, I can see what my training instructor meant by most humans don't listen to reason. It looks like I'll have to fight before I can help to bring about peace,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well for now you need to take it easy and let your wound heal. Oh, and we were going to wait until we knew your awake, so tonight I will have the village gather. There is something I want to give to both of you, so I sure hope you can make it. Make sure you don't do anything rough today,\" Ronak says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, we won't sir. Have good day,\" Martin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have an excellent day yourselves boys,\" Ronak says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was different, not every day we get a compliment from one our counsel members,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. Come on lets get to my place. I can already smell the roast deer that my parents must be cooking,\" Martin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me too,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you keep walking towards Martin's home, your fellow villagers give you compliments on your mission, and how brave you were. You give your thanks and try not to get into to many conversations. Some of the blacksmiths let you and Martin know they have some of their armor ready to be fitted for you when you were back to full strength. You think to yourself, and are sort of hoping in a sense, 'What does everyone plan to do next, start delivering gifts to me and my mother's hut?' You throw the thought aside as you keep walking, getting looks and comments of respect from everyone you pass.</span></div></div>",

When you were aproching you could hear shouting comming from inside \"you can't say that\" said a male voice. An angry female voice swiftly followed by replying \"I can and I will!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartins ears dropped and he spoke to you quitetly \"mum and dad are fighting again, they try and hide it from others but I've known for a while now...ok just make a lot of noise and they will have stopped by the time we are there. So you and Martin start talking about random things but louder than you usally would and quickly after you start you can hear that Martins parents stop talking as to try and hide their quarals from their son. Martin opens the door and happily announces that you two are here giving no evidence that he heard in his voice or actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea how many seconds it took, if seconds is the right words before plates of deer meat were thrust into your paws/hands and once again the praise and complments flooded you, but due to these two being your best friends parents it almost seemed like it would never end. But it made you think, wouldn't this be affecting Martin? He will Now be known as the one you saved. Almost like he was inferiour to yourself. You shake these thoughts out of your mind as you and Martin tuck into the meal that has been given to you. You then ask Martin a question \"I wonder what our next mission is going to be?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin replied \"I'm not sure, but the information we gathered was of intrest to the higher-ups, they were really keen to know as much as they could about those guys that showed up and attacked us. They called them bounty hunters, but bounty hunters only attack their target, they are not paid to go off corse. Also who were they after that required so many of them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't thought about this but Martin was right and you were also curious about whoever those people were trying to find. You reply \"chances are in not going on any until this is healed\" you indercate towards your injered arm. \"who knows, we might even be sent on solo missions.\" you raise a clenched fist above your head then bring it down right infront of Martin and point at him making him flinch. \"Martin! Your mission is to assassinate everysingle military leader the humans have, and do it before lunch time will you we are having freash rabbit?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you laugh at the joke. There is no way you'd be sent on any major missions. Not yet. A line that your training instructor said a lot was 'start low but aim high' so you two are probarly going to be sent on recon and search missions alot within the near future. Still even though you got Hurt, the rush that running for your life gave you was exilerating and more danderious missions would be more fun. A sudden thought strikes you \"Martin did you leave and tracks from where we were seen to our village.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin smiled his calm smile that always makes you trust him \"I sorted that out, I doubled back, went through the river, you know all the anti follow skills we've been taught. I was the best!\" you know that he wasn't the best because both of you only just passed those tests but you trust Martin compleatly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartins farther then broke your conversation \"your going to that meeting tonight right?...make sure you sleep before going, some of the wolves that go there like to drone on for a long time.\" you can see in his eyes that he's trying to say something but instead of saying anymore he just turns and leaves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin then said in a over dramatic tone \"meetings\" then started pretending to be asleep. Which didn't last long as you flick him on the nose. Which made him get up In a start. \"Hey!! You know canines hate that\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile \"exactly\" and once again you start laughing.</span></div></div>",

You know how she is sometimes,\" You say to Martin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, remember that time we fell into the deep end of the pond. She wouldn't let us leave the area around the hut for a week,\" Martin replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, 'Please don't go past the the fig tree, it could be dangerous young ones',\" you say imitating your mother, making everyone laugh, including yourself to an extent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess I'll see you at the 'meeting'. Zzzzzzzzzzz,\" Martin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY WARRIOR, FACE FORWARD, EYES OPEN, CHEST OUT, SHOULDERS BACK, EARS ON!\" you yell, imitating one of the humans you had watched in training, when the teachers showed you what some humans do at a safe distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made everyone laugh again as Martin imitated what you were saying. Once again you feel the pain in your shoulder. \"Well, I'll see you there, or on the way,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin nods and you soon take off, once again, being swarmed by many of the villagers as the compliment you on your bravery. Since you were alone this time, it was ten times worse. When you were with Martin, some of the comments were made towards him for helping you get back and outsmarting the humans, but now it was all about you. You were not used to such a big crowd, that you make your way through quickly but carefully, so it was not to hurt your arm. You finally get back to you and your mother's hut. Once inside, you closed the door quickly so no one else would come up and ask to come in. You don't like to be rude, but right now you were a little overwhelmed by all this publicity in the village, it made you wonder would word spread to villages other then your own, human and anthro alike, but in two different ways, one human's p.o.v. and one anthro's p.o.v., and if it did, how fast. You then hear your mother say, \"Oh your finally back honey, I was beginning to worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see your mother and she is in her best clothing that you are a little dumbfounded, wondering why she was dressed that way. You then snap back into reality and say, \"Mom, you shouldn't worry so much about me. I'm not that little any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but your still my son, and it is my job to worry about you, no matter how old you are,\" she says as she comes up and ruffles you hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, come on, you know that's my weakness,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, because it gets you into a good mood all the time,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't argue there. Whenever you were down she always did that to cheer you up, but you didn't understand why it made you happy, especially as of recently (past few months). You threw your thoughts aside and said, \"I'm going to sleep some before going to the meeting tonight. I know more then likely this meeting will be long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother nods and says, \"They usually are honey. I'll wake you up when we need to get you ready, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and soon lay your head down. You don't take long in drifting off to bed. Once you were asleep you start to dream. You expected to see that same vision of you as a child, but instead see something that throws you for a loop. You are in your childhood body and are being scorned once again by the anthro children and they all have darkness in their eyes. You start to run into the forest crying and you feel cold, alone, and unwanted, wishing it would end. You knew this was just a dream but you couldn't escape this one. You then feel a sense of warmth around you. It was your mother wrapping herself around you, this time she didn't have the dark eyes you had seen in so many of your nightmares, they were of light (not literally, but you get what I mean). You also did not split from your body and forest trees were not holding you back. Your mother in your dream acts like she did when the event happened and soon you head back to the village. The children all apologize and vow never to do that to you again and everyone  hugs you, which was odd, because you didn't remember the hugging ever happening. Your mother then says, \"Great work my son, you have overcome your nightmare by protecting a friend from danger. The dream will never be strong enough to make you tremble in fear again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in complete bewilderment and say nothing, kind of enjoying your moment of belonging. You then hear your mother say, \"Time to to get up my little one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that your eyes shot open, realizing that she really had said that. \"It's time to get you ready for the village meeting tonight. Come along son,\" your mother says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up slowly so your arm would not hurt. Then you let your mother help you get your best attire on. It wasn't much, but it was enough to impress the counsel.<br>\r\nYour mother and you are soon out of the door. Your mother had packed a few supplies in case you needed anything for your arm. She also brought along some of her famous deer stew, that the whole village would die for to know the recipe, but she kept it a secret, and you could hardly remember most of the ingredients.</span></div></div>",

Some of the older teen anthros were actually talking about how this could help you both get a girl. You were always a tad bit shy when it came to girls. For some reason you always were at a loss for words and often try to avoid talking to them. There was a lot of commotion among the crowd, then Ronak one of the council member's you talked to earlier today steps forward and says, \"Attention, your attention please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd soon settles down and Ronak says, \"Thank you. Now we have gathered here tonight for a special reason, if Lucian and Martin could kindly come forth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin helps you to your feet to avoid you hurting yourself more. You walk up and stand next to Ronak and he says, \"The reason we are here, you all may have figured by now is to honor two of our brave bravest warriors, Martin and Lucian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd clapped and he continued, \"Yesterday, they took a big risk in heading toward a human village to the south, in which we have learned is housing bounty hunters.

Lucian had notice an arrow headed straight for Martin and did the noble act of jumping into the line of fire. had it not been for Lucian's presence and loyalty to his friend and village, Martin might not have made it, and had it not been for Martin's presence and loyalty, Lucian may not have come back either. These are qualities that we rarely find in the humans, but Lucian is the exception for he has proven he will stick with his people to the death (when I say people, I mean the anthros). Martin is also credited for his kindness, loyalty and bravery in the escape from the human village, for instead of running to save himself and leaving his friend to die, like most humans do (Ronak looks at you and gestures it is not towards you and you nod), he risked his own safety to help his closest friend get back to the village and also to lead the humans in the wrong direction. Their skills and training, I would say have paid off, or they might not be here tonight. That is why I am presenting them each with a medal of valor in honor of their outstanding performance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire crowd cheers and everyone stands as they applaud to the two of you. Ronak has the medal on a necklace and they have the north star on them, which to you and the anthros, stood for freedom and equality on them. Ronak places the medals on each of your necks and you and Martin raise a hand in the air to show that it was a great honor. You and Martin look at each other and smile. This ceremonial meeting had made you feel like brothers. It was like nothing could come between you. You then say to Martin, \"So I guess the girls will drool and pant every time they see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughs and says, \"Same could be said for you 'brother', he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sort of shocked you a bit and he explains, \"The reason I say that is because ever since we were little, you were always one to let go and forgive, even when others insulted you. You were always coming up with new ideas to have fun, even when it was just the two of us and when we got  older and started training I never went easy, because you are one to compete with, always at stalemate, and both of us gave it our all. You and I together are a force to be reckoned with. When you took that arrow yesterday, you were like a brother to me more that day then you have ever been before, and I would gladly do the same for you. Not many humans can say they have anthro for a brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or a mother,\" you point out and smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both laugh and soon take drinks and Ronak says having heard your conversation, \"A toast. To Lucian and Martin, brothers in arms, heart and in head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheers,\" you, Martin and the crowd say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were bit surprised that no one seemed to strike it as odd, but you went with it. After having some dinner and drinks you then see the girls you and Martin have had your eyes on as the crowd starts to dance to their cheerful music. \"Go on Lucian, ask Rosy for a dance,\" Martin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look nervously and say, \"I Think I'll just have another drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't,\" Martin says as he pulls away with your good arm and sends you into a dance with Rosy, who is careful with your arm. Martin Laughs a bit before taking up a dance with Helen. You dance for a long time before finally stopping and your mother comes over, not with anger that you risked hurting your arm, but with happiness that you were finally interacting with girls.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the gathering your head was felt light. Not because you were drunk, you can't stand Alcahole. You felt light headed because of dancing with Rosy. Through out the whole time your nerves were getting the better off you. You laugh silently as you think about jumping in-front of an arrow doesn't scare you but talking to someone makes you act like a lost puppy. Who said those meetings were boreing?  Your mother left about 30 minutes earlier than you because she said that she was on patrol tomorrow morning. But now after saying farewell to everyone you began the walk home. Rosy seemed kind of unhappy about your departure but was quickly swarmed by her giggling friends and you knew they would all be talking about you so you got out of there as fast as you could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were walking back through the village taking your time to breath the night air. Only after a few minutes did you notice that your shoulder is flareing With pain, you has taken it out of the sling before leaving because it felt ok, but now it feel like someone has raked their claws down your right shoulder blade. \"must have been the danceing\" you say out loud. But quickly stop as you hear a very distant shuffleing sound followed by a 'huuurrkk' kind of sound. Probarly someone being ill, one of the reasons you avoid getting drunk. But still you were drawn to the sound, something just seems off. It came from south and only the guards would be down there. Curiousoty got the better of you and you changed your corse and started walking toward the sound and away from the sounds of the gathering happening. As you get closer another thing strikes you as strange, why has there Been no further sounds?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis really doesn't feel right, somethings wrong. You reach for your dagger and find nothing. You left your weapons at home, why would you need them at the meeting. You then start a half crouched jog towards the source of the sound while remaining compleatly silent. You've been trained well enough to know that if you're not sure about the situation then stat alert. It's better to look silly than to be dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour very close to where the guard should be, why hasen't he called for ID yet? You move into the shadows to hide your own shadow cast by the 3/4 moon above. Your training taught you the '5 S's and M' of camoflauge and conselment: Shape, Shine, Shadow, Siloet, Sound and Movement. If all of these can be masked then you'll be very hard to spot. Then you stopped dead. Right where the guards meant to be there's a line in the dirt, a line of something or someone that's been pulled away and into the darkness. You move closer to it and follow the track round the corner and close to the guard-hut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you see it. The guards body with a great gapping chunk of his throat sliced open with blood pouring out and around the body. You recoil in horror and make a scuffing sound. Then a figure you didn't see straight away who's by the body look towards you. He's wearing a mask just like the ones you saw before. His movements are like lightening and within a second there is a kinfe hurteling towards your head. Instint, not reactions is what makes you drop to the ground and sail right over your head, it achally cuts your fur on the top of your head. The figure then gets up and bolts towards the woods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only have seconds to act, you quickly shout at the top of your lungs \"South side!! Guard is down!! I'm in pursuit!!\" you then grab a knife from the guards body and hold it in your left hand due to your right being hurt and sprint after him. What makes you go after him alone is unknown to you, all you know is he killed the guard and your not going to just let him leave.</span></div></div>",

You didn't care about the pain in your arm at this moment, all you know is the human was not gonna get away with killing one of your people. Once you were close enough, you make leap for it and tackle him. Both of you hit the ground and he scrambles to his feet as do you. He then starts to fight you in hand to hand combat. Luckily you had trained to use either hand in combat and block each attack. You are looking for a vulnerable spot to strike as you defend yourself, but then the dizziness comes back to you and you fall onto the ground. You think it is the end for you, but your fighting with the bounty hunter had given the rest of the warriors in the village enough time to catch up and they pin him to the ground. Other warriors, Martin included, come to see how you are holding up and your training instructor, Andreas says, \"That took guts boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No guts, no glory,\" you joke, making the warriors laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's get you back to your mother, I don't think any of us will hear the end of this one, once she finds out,\" Martin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all laugh and head toward the village, some of the warriors taking the human to their jail that had rarely been used, but was very strong, and unable to break out of. You know that he will be telling the council the humans plans, and in turn all warriors, yourself included will find out. Will then says, \"Seems you and Martin need to catch a break, first they try to kill you for reasons outside of our village, and now this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It not so much fighting that worries me sir. I fear for the little ones and the people who are not trained as warriors. Do you think we should move the villagers who are not trained in combat to a safer location? I mean if one of them knows where we are, who's to say more won't come? Possibly in great numbers,\" You say with seriousness in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well once we've gotten the information we need from the bounty hunter, we'll decide the best plan of action. Until then, all you need to do is let you arm heal. Don't want one of my best warrior students becoming a cripple on me,\" Will says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gonna take more than an arrow to stop me from fighting for good, or send me to the pearly gates for that matter,\" You joke once again, and laugh about it with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you reach the hut and you bid you friend and your teacher a good night. Soon you get you clothes off, but this wakes your mother and she asks why your back so late. You tell her what happen, dumbing down on the life threatening part, and she was in a nervous wreak. Questions like, 'What possessed you to do it?' or 'Why didn't you wait for help?' arose and you told her that you couldn't let him get away. You were pretty stubborn about backing down from fights or missions,  as was Martin and your mother, and that is why you and Martin were so lethal in combat. That is why other warriors in training almost always gave up, for they knew eventually they would be beat by you or Martin. You soon say to your mother, \"Mom, please be careful on patrol tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry son I will. I always have been. Now get some sleep,\" your mom says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally lay your head down and rest, as does your mother.</span></div></div>",

But due to you being the only witness you've got to go and say what you saw. So here you are sitting in a circle of wolves surrounding the human flanked by your mother on the right, who reasently finished her patrol and another village member on your left who you only ever see cleaning weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main speaker of the trial, if it can even be called that, is standing next to the human who's paws are tied behind his back. The humans face mask has been removed and his face is bloody but he's smiling. The trial can't really be called a trial, it's just witnesses say what they saw, the accused says something and then he's judged. The speaker looks at you and said \"Lucian please tell us here what you witnessed yesterday evening while everyone else was asleep or at the gathering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou explain what happened about hearing the sound and with the guards death right up to when he was captured. Throughout your explanation of this there was murrnors going around the crowd and every now and then someone shouted some form of abuse. when you had finished speaking the wolf in the middle let everyone discuss this for a few minutes before turning to the human and asking \"so, do you have anything to say about this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human started laughing slightly. This unerved you, what could he possable be finding funny. He then spoke almost like he was talking to himself \"so the rumors were true, there really is a Human working with the anthros of this village...perhaps we should have believed that human village we came across instead of killing every 3rd villager.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis comment brought a shocked gasp from most wolves there which gained another fit of laughing from the Human. The wolf beside you shouted \"you even murder your own kind?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe human stared straight at the wolf who spoke which seemed to make the wolf shrink down. He then replied \"murder? Hardly. They were harbouring a crimenal and also had wolves from this village right on their door step...not murder. JUSTISE!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyour heart sank, the village he's talking about was the one you and Martin reconed, they killed some of them just because of a petty reason like that? \"why would a group of humans attack innocent villagers let alone anyone without just cause!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human turned his ice cold gaze right at you, but you held it. His eyes then flicked to your right shoulder. \"ah...so your the one we shot, you know you could have just knocked your friend out of the way\" he then laughed some more at his own little joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the crowd shouted \"I've heard enough!! Kill him!!\" 3 of the crowd drew their weapons and advanced on the human who just stayed smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as they were about to end the humans life he spoke loud enough for you to hear. \"ever wondered what those dying villagers felt?\" this comment would have made you not act, but something in the way he said he, something in how his eyes flicked up just for a seconds made you react. You turned around just in time to see an arrow comming straight towards you, you ducked it and it landed right next to the human. This arrow hitting the ground halted the wolves. Everything went silent. Everything apart from a small hissing from the arrow. Everything until.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arrow was tipped with something and it exploded into a huge cloud of gray smoke. The wolves and yourself were compleatly confused. Your mother drew her sword and started scanning around. She said \"it's a smoke bomb, they'll be ok, look for who fired it.\" she then handed you a sna knife she had on her belt and looked you in the eyes \"just encase\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon afterwards in the confusion and chaos that the smoke had caused several other explotions happened and quickly smoke was everywhere. You could hardly see anywhere but you could clearly hear a few crys of rage and pain around you, but from where? Then sword clangs joined the mess of noise, they are in the smoke. How many? Who? Where? You couldn't focus on anything and suddenly a lone figured was lunging themselves at you. It happened so fast and so suddenly that they bowled into you knocking you flat on your back them them on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hit your head as you fell over making you feel dizzy and without control. But you could see another mask figure on top of you, raising his own knife. He brought it down at you with the speed of am arrow. This is is. Your life flashed before your eyes. When you heard a thump sound and a sharp searing pain in your chest. All you could think about is \"in hit, the pain, so much pain\" you opened your eyes and saw your mother standing over the now unmoving masked figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said \"that was close\" and held her paw out to you. That's when she noticed the dagger sticking out of your lower chest and the pool of blood forming around it. Her eyes went wide and instantly she dropped down and put pressure of the wound while leaving the dagger in to slow the blood flow. \"Lucian!!! Lucian!! Hold on!! Do not die!!\" her eyes were filling with tears as she called your name. But slowly the world started fading. You give your mother a weak smile, anything to show that it's going to be ok. You try to speak but end up coughing blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaguly you can tell that around you the smoke is clearing, and apart from your mothers voice one other was getting through to you. \"I told you not to kill the human!!\"...the man who was being trialed? You couldn't tell. He then spoke again \" well leave you for now, but know this, this is only farewell, not goodbye!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon that voice faded aswell until you could only hear your mothers crying, but that was getting more and more distant. The last thing you regestered was paniced shouts and paws grabbing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...nothing...  </span></div></div>",

I was so worried you would never wake up,\" she says through her tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how long have I been out?\" you ask with agony in your voice, remembering that you had just been stabbed in the chest after you tried to move and felt searing pain across your whole chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been out cold for the past four days honey. The entire village has been worried sick about you,\" your mother says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many of the villagers have been hurt?\" you ask, more worried about the villages safety then your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some got minor injuries in the fight, but we drove the humans off, so they won't bother us for a while and we treated every one's wounds. Yours is the most serious right now,\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is it when ever I get close to humans or their villages, I end up bleeding?\" you ask in a joking tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother chuckles and says, \"You're lucky, that dagger nearly pierced your heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou silently laugh but that just sends more pain through your chest. \"You'll need to stay in bed for a few more days honey. The doctors say that your body should fully recover by then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to put up an argument with her you simply nod and say, \"Well, if people want to come see me, don't let them in unless it's someone important, or if it's one my good friends like Mark or Jimmy, or if it's my teacher Andreas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or Rosy,\" your mom adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rosy has been worried sick about you almost as  much as I have. She may have a tomboyish personality, but she has her feminine and maternal side to her. She has been coming in every day to see if you were awake. She'll probably be in after the doctors check up on you. I'm going to make you some dear stew honey, you just need to rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mom,\" you say feeling a little embarrassed that you couldn't get to your feet without feeling pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay there for a while until you hear a knock at the door of your hut. When your mother opened the door, it was Martin and Jimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there boys, good to see you,\" your mother says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has Lucian awoken yet ma'am?\" Jimmy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he is awake,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May we come in and speak with him?\" Martin asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" your mother says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lucian, how are you?\" Martin asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In pain, but what else is new?\" you joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I wish I had been there to help. I could have prevented this,\" Martin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, Martin, the last thing we need it 'two' of the best warriors in training in a severely wounded state,\" Jimmy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jimmy's got a point. You might have just added to the confusion and injury,\" you say as you lay there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but still,\" Martin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, who was the human that got killed? One of the last things I heard before passing out was 'I told you not to kill the human',\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, actually the human's think they killed you. After seeing you lying on the ground like you were, that's what they assumed. The dagger was lodged in there pretty deep and the doctors had to be careful not to cut any vital organs pulling it out, they stitched it up pretty good though so it will heal in no time,\" Martin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, It's gonna take more then that to send me off to the pearly gates, though that was close,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they may use your death as leverage against us, but then again, you have the element of surprise on your side,\" Jimmy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what does the council have to say about what happened?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they want to gather up the surrounding anthro villages and track the bounty hunters. But they also want to wait till you have fully recovered, they know you'll want to settle your score with them,\" Martin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got that right. Say, how are things with you and Helen by the way?\" You ask to change topic to a lighter mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going great, though she won't stop talking about how you and I narrowly escaped death from the human village. This will only add to that never ending story that's giving us so much praise,\" Martin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm guessing the whole village is talking about it. this might be good for us if the surrounding villages hear about everything that has been going on. Heck most of them might trust me more,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's for sure. Anyways, we need to get going, our folks are going to be ballistic if we are gone from home to long, most parents won't even let the young ones go outside after what happened,\" Jimmy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for good reason, heck I wouldn't want them being outdoors. It will calm down eventually though,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, your right. Well I hope to see you on your feet soon and we'll be coming by either later today or tomorrow,\" Martin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya guys later,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey soon head out the door and back to their huts and your mom comes over with the stew she had promised. Soon you are carefully sitting up so that you can eat your meal properly, even though your mother has to feed you for it was to painful to move your arms. \"Just like when you were just a toddler,\" She says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter swallowing you say, \"Don't be getting all mother of a two year old on me again, and don't get any ideas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember one time you had gotten sick at the age of seven and she had treated you as if you were a baby again. You weren't even allowed to used the outhouse during that time and had to use diapers. You hoped this time she wouldn't do that, for it would feel embarrassing at this age especially.</span></div></div>",

But every time you seemed to close your eyes or look at the Walls you saw that man lunging at you knife at the ready. You rub your hands over the stiched wound on your chest, just a hole held togeather by thread where a knife was sticking out. You had come so close to death, the other insdents were not life threatening, arrow to the shoulder hurt, guy who killed the guard didn't seem to have the intent. But in the smoke. If your mother had stabbed that guy a tenth of a second later then you might not be laying here right now. Also those words were echoing in your mind 'i told you not to kill the human' that means the attack was planned almost like that bounty hunter planned to get caught. But why? Just to see if you were here? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour chain of thought was broken as a tall female wolf with light brown fur and a kind smile walked into the room. She was carrying a wooden case with the name 'Dr. Viola' she has a White patch of fur on the right side of her face around her eye. Some slightly darker brown fur cover her paws and end at her wrists almost like she's wearing gloves and her ears are tipped With black fur. She's the village's only true doctor. Doctor Farlow and Tarin both died about a year ago and Viola came from a near by village to help us out. Sure we have a few field medics but Voila's training and expertiese outmatches them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spoke in her usural calm voice \"ah I see your awake, well that's better than some of the ones that were attacked.\" she then opens up her case that is full of small medical tools and bottles of things which you have no idea about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reply \"the ones that got injered aswell, are they still out cold?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out a few herbs and started crushing them up in a bowl. \"oh no your the last one to wake up, well the last that's going to wake up.\"  she had said that last comment With a hint of sadness, you could easily tell that she meant there has been fatalitys. So all you asked was \"how many?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued crushing the herbs which were giving of a sent that tickeled your nose. \"3 in the attack, 4 of the wounds, one of which only died a few hours ago.\" this made you think, wolves you know and probarly saw every day. Gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you thought to ask \"does anyone know why it happened?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe answered truefully \"not fully no, but it seemed like a rescue mission, it was to cordenated not to be planned, you also seemed to be a target but I don't think they intended to stab you.\" that's another reason you like Viola, no matter what you ask she won't hold anything back, she'll just answer truefully and not lie at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen out of no-where an idea struck you \"if I was one of their targets then I wonder how they would react to the news that I've been killed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola said \"they would probarly be pretty annoyed, but they've got spies in the woods so as soon as you step into the daylight they'll know you're alive.\" then her eyes went wide and she said \"wait, your not planning to make them think...\" your smile was all the yes she needed. \"hmm...so If we pretend your dead then they'll think they messed up and you'll no longer be a target. But...how are we going to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe's right, you have no idea how you would be able to fake your death, and your not a stratigest so comming up with a plan would be tough. But you do have one idea. \"in training we were taught that if you don't want a plan to be heard by the enemy but knew they listening then make one up and use a code to tell your allys it's fake...I was told to scrach your right ear 3 times as a sign.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola put the herbs into some water and handed it to you \"then we could spread the roumor that you have died but with that action everyone will know what's going on...but then what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother flaw. Then what do you do. Going and living in the woods won't be very good because of the humans there. \"how far's your village?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola replied \"they won't be nearly as acepting as this village is, chances are they'll hand you over to the bounty hunters...but...maybe.\" she started mumbleing to herself for a few seconds and then said \"drink those herbs by the way, also the fox village up north owe this village a favor for when we saved a few of their elders. I'm sure we can convince them to help, but then you couldn't go alone and someone else will be dragged into this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went back to thinking so you drank the liqued she gave you and almost coughed it up, it seemed to burn your throat. \"I don't want anyone else caught up in this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola then explained while getting up \"just with the rumor alone everyone will be pitching in...if I was you I would chose a few friends and go tonight, pack light and move fast. So...who's going with you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly Martin came straight to your mind and so did your mother and Rosy, but you just couldn't drag Rosy any further into this and your mother would be too troublesome to take. But maybe.. \"Martin and Jimmy. I know those 2 will come even if I tell them not to.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola nodded \"I'll sort everything out, stay here and your 2 friends will come for you with a few weapons and supplies alone with some dark green clothing when it's time to go.\" she was about to leave when she turned back \"oh and tell your mother about this, you might not be comming back for some time.\" then she left to arange your escape plan. But was it really a smart idea?    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Throughout the day you went and told your mother the situation, and after a while of arguing, she finally agreed to it. You had packed lightly, as viola had instructed, and packed all the necessary items needed for the road. You had also packed a wooden dagger your mom had made for you when you were little. It was something you used to play games with your friends. Now it was just an item that held memories for you. You packed it to take the memories with you. Soon night had fallen, and you hear a knock at the hut. It was Martin and Jimmy with the equipment you needed, so your mom opens the door and invites them in, but then someone walked in who you didn't expect to see. It was Rosy. You were about to ask Martin when he beat you to the punch saying, \"She wanted to come see you before we took off, she refused to not come, I couldn't stop her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only smiled and said, \"It's fine. Uh, h-hi Rosy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. You know you shouldn't have to do this,\" Rosy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-if I don't the entire village is still at risk of another attack,\" you say trying to not sound nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know, but it's just that I, I...\" She didn't even finish her sentence as she jumps at you and pulls you into a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your friends were in complete shock. Not once had you been kissed aside from your mother kissing you on the cheek, but as you were kissing human lip to wolf lip with Rosy, you started to feel as if you were melting. It was the oddest feeling in the world, but you were tingling all over and you didn't want to stop kissing. Rosy finally pulled away and said, \"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have done that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her and say, \"Rosy, I-I never thought that you felt that way about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I do, I know it seems odd, but I don't care about that. I...\" You cut her off by covering her mouth and then say, \"Rosy, I've felt the same way about you. I just never had the spine to tell you. I was afraid you would reject me. Martin was always trying to get me to go out with you, but I froze every time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true,\" Martin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, you feel the same way?\" Rosy asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I just didn't know how you would react,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't go Lucian,\" Rosy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to go Rosy, it's the only way we can make the humans believe I really died,\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'm coming with you,\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Rosy, your safer here then out there. I don't want to risk your life, and if too many of us leave, the humans may get too suspicious. we're already risking a lot with just me, Martin and Jimmy alone,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want to lose you,\" Rosy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither does my mom, and you won't. Besides, the foxes owe us one for helping them in the past, like Viola said,\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be careful,\" Rosy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Rosy when I get back would you, well, I don't know how else to say this, would you be my g-girlfriend?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I will. Just make sure you do come back,\" Rosy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I will. You can hold me to that,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Lucian it's time to go,\" Jimmy says, trying to make it so it would be less hard to say goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give Rosy a quick kiss and head over to Jimmy and Martin. Your mother then pulls you into a hug and says, \"You be careful out there, you hear me. Don't make me lose my son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry mom. If every thing goes the way it should, I'll be back before you can say 'gifted bounty hunters',\" You joke making everyone laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom releases you and says, \"Martin, you watch over your brother, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry ma'am, he may be a bit fragile right now, but when he is back up to full strength, he will be fiercer then ever,\" Martin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get moving guys,\" Jimmy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You come back for both of us, okay Lucian?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries mom,\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you were outside the village and into the forest. you kept to the shadows so you weren't easily spotted. You knew the Bounty hunters would not be operating at night, for the anthros were on high alert and had far better vision then humans, but that didn't mean other humans were trying to use the nigh  as cover. You also didn't want to be seen by other anthros who may mistaken you for a murderous human. You then notices something as you progressed through the forest. Your eye sight become clearer. you thought maybe it was due to how long you've been walking. You then say, \"I sure hope the other anthro villages are doing okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy then says, \"They're fine, in fact word has been spreading to the other village leaders and their people about what you have done for us. This may gain us an advantage to gather them up and help set up a defense should the humans try and attack again. I'm sure they smile upon you or will in the near future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you know, I'm sure many anthros will accept your relationship with Rosy. I know I..... Hey what's up with your eyes?\" Martin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis completely threw you for a loop at how fast he had changed subject. Martin had also taken notice and you ask, \"What's wrong with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's nothing wrong, they just don't look human anymore, they look.....,\" Martin was cut of as you went to a near by pond to look at your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look and you see that they were indeed correct. Your eyes did no longer look human, they were wolf like. \"Wolf, you were going to say they look wolf like weren't you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin nods and you say, \"Well now it makes sense of how I can all of the sudden see better, must have been a gift from the ancestors. This should make the trip easier. Come on, let's get moving.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(sorry weatherman, I deleated your last paragraph and changed one of the choices...it just seemed way too rushed...and I had plans XD)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three of you silently moved through the night your eyes started going blury and soon they were giving you a huge headache. Martin noticed this and signaled a stop. Jimmy walked into the dark to scan the area for any form of threat while martin came over to you. \"what's wrong?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reply I..I don't know, the wolf eyes started burning and my head felt like the time we fell out of that tree.\" you recal the memory when you and martin were sitting in a tree and the branch broke, bothof you spent days with throbbing heads. You then closed your eyes and they felt like something was moving over them, you re-opened them and everything seemed pitch black. No not purely, you could see the outlines of the trees, like normal. Martin then said \"hey your eyes are Hunan again. How'd you do that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reply \"if I knew then I would have been doing this long ago, I guess I'm not ready for it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin commented \"or your bodies not ready for it, you know how when you learn a fighting move it takes a while before it feels right to do? Yeah...same princeable\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy seemed to just spear next to you like a ghost \"it's clear but it won't be for long, we are right on a human patrol route.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin turned to jimmy \"Lucians eyes have changed again\" he turned back to you \"ok follow my lead and stay close to me just like we've trained, Jimmy you take Tail, I'll take nose, lucian you've got chest\" you recall these words meaning Your going to move in a collun with Jimmy at the back and Martin in front. \"Ok 2 stride spread ears open we being ghosts\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you once again got up and started moving. While this was happening your mind raced over the suppies that Viola has collected for you 3 combined: 5 days worth of rations, 6 daggers, 2 sets of clothing each, a signed letter from your village elder saying what's going one, 3 full water skins, spark stones which are just flints for striking to make a fire. So nothing that'll make the 3 day hike to the fox village any fun but enough to make and enough to get through any troubles that rise. Martin had tryed securing some bows and swords but they would be to big and noise for this mission. You then think over the 2 wolves moving with you, without hesertation they dived head first into danger just for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo doubt they got an earful from their parents at first but here they are without a single word of complaint. Risking everything. But you couldn't be happier that these 2 are the ones your with, Martin and you make a perfect team and combine with Jimmys stealth and Trap skills it makes a very strong trio. Your mind flashes back to all those childhood games of Wolf hunt where 4 of you would run and hide for as long as possable without getting caught by the 2 hunters, Jimmy was always the last one to be caught and sometimes even set traps, you remember being caught in one of his snares once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin stapped you out if your dream state by quickly putting his right clenched paw in the air then crouching to one knee. This meant 'stop' so you and jimmy did. The three of you waited for a few seconds while you strained your sences against the dark trying to pinpoint why you've stopped. A few more tense seconds dragged on until Martin moved his paw above his head and stuck 2 fingers up then turned them to his left. Meaning 'just a deer, moving left'. He shook his paw twice quickly abs got up, you repeated all of the movements to Jimmy and got up and followed again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's only then that you relise you were holding your breath. Sure it was only a deer but what if it was a hostile? What if they saw you 3? Your mind swirled with fear but also exitent. This was fun, more fun than training against other groups of wolves, but also scary knowing that at any moment someone could end your life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis fast progress continued throught the next few hours, stopping at every noise and movement. Until the sun started rising and you were getting tired, Jimmys was aswell and even though he was trying not to show it so was Martin. So the three of you stopped for a rest. Now thinking that you were far enough away from the humans you asked \"so, anyone got any ideas on what the fox village is like?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin shrugged his shoulders but Jimmy spoke up \"it's smaller than our village and there's far less tree cover, but it's right next to a huge lake with crystal clear water that gleams in the morning sunlight, their fighters prefer the use of tooth and claw over weapons like us, but they are very good with them, an adult fox is smaller than an adult wolf but that in no way makes them any less capable in what they do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou asked curiously \"been there before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe shook his head \"nope...but I'm friends with a few foxes there and they've told me about it...I wonder if we'll see them there?\" Martin pulled out a water skin from a bag and drank a mouthful before handing it to you. You drank a mouthful and could instantly feel the cool liqued moving down yoir system and it made you relise just how peaceful of place your sitting right now With your friends. The tree's going endlessly in all directions, the tip of the western moutains showing on the horizen. If only it could stay like this.</span></div></div>",

Looks like it used to be the stronghold, in case any other kingdoms tried to attack out of fighting for land.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be, let's go check it out?\" Martin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, come on Jimmy, what's life with out a little risk,\" you say giving him a sly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy shrugs his shoulders and you hide your belongings in some overgrowth and take out the six daggers, two for each of you. Your arm had fully recovered, but you still had your chest to deal with, so this wasn't going to be easy, should you run into any trouble, and should the medicine wear off. You progress slowly, daggers at the ready and make sure to be aware of your surroundings. You had been told of these ruins, and some rumors said it was haunted, others said evil spirits dwell or did once dwell here. When you were little, it was the one thing that kept you and the others from traveling alone away from the village, but when you got older you were more curious about it. No one had been there since the war between the humans and anthros began. You and your friends were still curious and wanted to find out what happened here. Sure you were told the stories from your parents and some other grownups, but they were only bits and pieces of it. Maybe something here could give the full answer. Everything seemed so gloomy and you felt the presence of death here, but you didn't let it bother you. You pressed on looking for any signs of anyone who still may dwell here or anything that may explain what really caused the war. Jimmy had accidentally stepped on a twig and you and Martin swing around thinking your being followed. \"I'm sorry that was me,\" Jimmy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both lower your daggers and you say, \"Man, I wouldn't have expected that from you Jimmy, but hey, even the best mess up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin and Jimmy smile at your joke and you continue looking around, You then see a building still in tact, but still in need of repair. It was mostly brick, but the roof and windows were wood. It looked like a meeting hall for council members or something, like what both humans and anthro's had, for the council members to use to meet in private. But there were vines growing all over the walls and on the door, blocking it, so this was abandoned far before you or your friends had probably even been born. You then put your Daggers in their sheaths that they had been brought and were strapped to your backs and grab the vines and start pull them from the door. Your friends pitch in and soon the door was clear enough to open it up. You put your hand on the latch and push, the door starts to creek as it opens. You pull your Daggers out again and you ask Martin and Jimmy, \"Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey nod and you carefully walk into the hall the whole place was empty of life, except for the three of you. You give a whistle of amazement at how old this place was. \"Man I wonder what this place looked like in its glory days,\" Jimmy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the sudden the three of you hear a voice. You jump back in surprise and hold your daggers at the ready, all of you heading in the same direction towards where the light was beaming through the hole in the roof. The voice kept traveling. It was a males voice, but it was unfamiliar to any of you and you. As soon as you three were in the light your bodies become frozen and none of you can move. You then have what you can only describe as an out of body experience. All of the sudden the three of you were in some place that looked as if it were home, but different and your daggers were no longer with you. There was then a figure who stood before the three of you, a anthro wolf with silver fur and black stripes running from the tip of his forehead down the middle of his back to the tip of hit tail. \"Hello Jimmy, hello Martin and hello son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight there you were in shock when he said 'son', what did he mean by son? Before you or your friends could talk, the wolf spoke again and says, \"I know that you have questions and they will be answered in time. My name is Marcus and you three are the first to have come to this realm in over two hundred years. There are few alive who remember the real story of what happened here at Caramona, a city that once thrived with both humans and anthros alike. As you can see right now in this vision of the past I am showing you, Anthros and humans are friends to one another. Notice how some have their disagreements over the simple things whether it be between anthro and human, human and human, or anthro and anthro. The warriors, both human and anthro alike make quick to resolve the differences and they make up. Life seemed like it would never change. Then a day came where everything had changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the sudden it look like you had gone through a tunnel and you see that your in the hall once again, but is was filled with angry villagers and their council members, and Marcus says, \"Here a few weeks later, a human council member had been murdered by means of a poisoned drink. No one knew who was to blame, but the humans pointed it at the anthros in general, though it was actually one of their own who had done it, but without the proof, the evidence was against us, for an anthro had been first to arrive not to soon before the humans spotted him, even though he had claimed he was innocent. Then one of our own kind from another realm far from where this war is taking place wanted to make it so the humans were to be separated from the anthros and had a council member of each anthro species poisoned as well. The humans had truthfully claimed no knowledge of the incident, but we had not believed them at the time. We then got into a conflict the ravaged the city until it was destroyed. The humans fled to the south, thinking ways to take back the land they now thought was theirs. The anthros soon realized their mistake but it was too late, we vowed that we would try to bring a common peace, but until that time, they thought it best to separate the clans into separate villages until such a time would come that we lived in peace again. We still met with each other and some clans had to have more then one village, such as the wolves. Wolves were some of the most highly respected among the anthros, but of course you already know this for they still are. There are some human villages that are tired of battling against the anthros and also wish to share a common peace. But they are ones that are much farther from the border. Now I'm going to show you something that happened a little while before you were born.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon are going through another tunnel, and you see Marcus, a bit younger, but still him. He was heading into a human village in a cloak and heading towards a hut that seemed somewhat familiar to you. You then see him walk into the hut where you followed by just going through the wall. Marcus then takes off his cloak and you see a female human looking at him and hugging him. \"That woman there is your human mother Lucian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drop to your knees as you see your true mother, the woman who had forsaken you to the wild to be found by your adopted anthro mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marcus, you know it's not safe here,\" your 'mother' says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to see you again Felicity,\" Marcus says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the humans might catch you here,\" Felicity says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel it's worth the risk. You are someone I care about, and I would give my life for you,\" Marcus says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Lucian, Your mother and I were trying to find a way to bring peace, but then she heard rumors, lies if you will, from the village leaders, and was getting suspicious. For a while she did not want to believe them, and one night she and I talk and one thing led to another and.....\" Marcus stopped talking as you see them walk into Felicity's bedroom and you knew what he meant. Marcus progresses to a few weeks later and you see Marcus and Felicity in an argument. \"Marcus, you have betrayed me,\" Felicity says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about Felicity?\" Marcus says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and your kind raided one of our shipments, and left no survivors,\" Felicity says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felicity, I ....\" Marcus was cut off as Felicity says, \"Don't lie, I saw the carnage, and I saw the symbol of your village there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felicity what has happened to you,\" Marcus says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get out of here! I never want to see you again!\" Felicity yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fled and never saw her after that. A few weeks later some of my friends and I were caught by surprise by humans. The same humans that had attacked you. Only one of us made it to let my village, your village now, know what had happened. After I had died, I learned of your mother being pregnant with you, my son. She had not mated with any of the humans, which led me to know that you were my child she was carrying. She never let anyone know of what had happened. The day you were born, there was mark on your right shoulder. When your mother saw this, she knew you were not fully human, even though you look it,\" Marcus says.</span></div></div>",

It was a wolf's or in this case, anthro wolf's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So wait your telling me I'm half anthro, and you, your my father,\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, a few days after you were born, your mother abandoned you in the forest. She had hoped of you not surviving, and that has kept her from me even now. I can no longer be with her, for what she has done to you and me. Your anthro mother, Malena was a good friend of mine and had sympathy for humans, but did not push the boundaries like I did, that is, until she found you and took you in as her son. Your story may not have a happy beginning Lucian, but that does not make you who you truly are, it is your choices. And you will have a very important choice to make in the coming weeks, but I can not tell you what it is. I just hope you choose wisely my son,\" Marcus says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why didn't you visit me when I was a child?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The time was not right and the other spirits wouldn't allow it. The reason I have shown you three what you have seen, is so you know the truth you have been seeking. And one more thing you should know. Martin's mother is my sister,\" Marcus says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Martin's jaws drop. \"So, we are cousins?\" Martin asks out of shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus nods. \"Well, that may explain why we work so well together, and why we felt like brothers, in a manner of speaking,\" Martin adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I never would have guessed. But where does that put Jimmy, father?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jimmy is actually related through Martin's father, remember?\" Marcus asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, that's right,\" You say, recalling that Jimmy was Martin's older cousin, even though Martin's father rarely spoke to Jimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you see your connected in more ways then one. This is why the three of you were chosen to these visions, though I hope this does not effect your relationship in any way,\" Marcus says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, it won't sir, er, uncle,\" Jimmy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Martin nod and Marcus says, \"Good, I must go now. Be brave, what you have seen should help you find a way to bring peace. You will be visited again, but it might be by me. Good luck young ones, the ancestors and I will be watching,\" Marcus says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon he disappears and the three of you are greet by a white light. Soon you feel yourselves return to your bodies, and once you see the place where you had been standing, you felt so dizzy that the three of you dropped to your knees, your daggers released from your grip. All three of you grab your heads, rubbing them to help the blood flow back to your head. As you fully come to, you say, \"Well, I would say a lot of questions have been answered, some I wasn't even expecting to be, at least not here anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your telling me, that was a lot to take in. I wonder how long we were standing there, cause my head is throbbing,\" Martin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the position of the sun, calculate in your head and say, \"Roughly an hour, give or take five minutes, judging by the sun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, let's go get some water cousins, that should help our heads stop hurting,\" Jimmy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Martin smile at the fact that he had said cousins and agree as you slowly, but surely get back to your feet, after placing your daggers back in their sheaths. You walk to where you had left your supplies and picked up one of the water skins, each of you taking what was needed. After a few minutes, you no longer feel your heads throbbing and you say, \"We should either get moving or seek some shelter for a good rest. Which would you guys prefer?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You smile and say \"hey remember rule 12 that our instructor gave us?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin and Jimmy say at the same \"yeah...yeah we do, if you an still speak then you can still walk\" the 3 of you think about all the times you've been pushed to the point of colapse before. It always turned into a rilvary thing between you and Martin about seeing who could stay standing the longest...but 60% of the time Martin won. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the reason you gave the others to get moving but in yoir head you just wanted something to do, everything you thought you knew about yourself has just been proven wrong. Your not even the species you thought you were, what would a half anthro half human be called anyway? A huthro? An Anman? You laugh at your own little joke, because your mind is so confused right now. Your dead father randomly came and told you thar you are not who you think you are. It's not everyday that happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lucian come on!! Rule 12 remember?\" Jimmys words snapped you back to reality and you relised that the other 2 were already moving. You followed them but so unfocused on anything that you could be walking straight into a Human camp without knowing it. But luckly for you Martin was still alert. You put your hand on your birth mark. Everyone always said it looked like a wolf, but you always thought it looked like a moutain. Why would a wolf head birth mark be on you? even if you were half anthro, you sigh as thinking about these things makes your head hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then quickly pull your hand of your shoulder as it spikes with pain, but not from your wound. You look at your hand and see the nails look sharper and more pointed. You dismiss this as nothing and start taking in your surroundings. The woods around you seem a lot more open than the ones at your village, there was also slight breeze wistlling through the tree tops causing that rustling sound you so much enjoy and every now and then a quick shuffeling sound of an animal escapeing from you 3 as you move at a slightly faster than walking pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flex your arms and roll your shoulders. You feel Human, well no different than normal. But how would you know what it feels like to be Human if you are not one? 'No!' You think to yourself 'don't think about things that don't matter, think about now. Live for now and not the past'. Your mind flicks to your village. Are they ok? Has there been another attack? Did the roumor work? A small twig suddenly whips your face and you once again relise you were daydreaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours go by with nothing happening at all. The day drags on with you constantly slipping into daydreams about what you've learnt. When Jimmy says \"Stop...what's that sent?\" his nose is raised towards where the wind is blowing from which is from your left hand side. Martin does the same. Jimmy then speaks \"isn't that?...come on let's check it out.\" you don't know what they have picked up because your Human sences are still weaker than there's by a long way. So you follow Jimmy's lead toward the sent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take very long until you reach a clearing in the woods, and right in the middle is a feline. Face down. Soaked in blood... Fresh blood. Jimmy then said \"I thought I had picked up the sent of blood, but why's a feline out here? The nearest settlement is weeks away.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou survey the scene. The body is in the dead center of the small clearing that's only as big as 2 huts side by side. There's something in it's paws. Paper maybe. But something wrong, why's the body there? And why's it so quiet? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

It could be a trap, but instinct keeps telling me that we should take a look at the body.\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but what if that's exactly what who ever did that to them wants, we could be next,\" Jimmy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all ponder for a bit on what to do and you finally say, \"That's I'm going in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll take tail and follow,\" Martin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and the three of you move in to investigate, with your daggers out in case of unfriendly encounters. You keep aware of your surroundings, including the ground, for humans were notorious for setting up traps that were easy to miss if you were not careful. You kept your daggers raised, for you had a strange feeling that if you were there to long something bad could happen. You finally made it to the body, and you gently role it over. You see that the feline is female and ask, \"Ma'am, are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answer, you put two fingers on her neck to check for a pulse. There was one but it was very faint, telling you that she didn't have much longer to live. All of the sudden she begins to moan. Your attention immediately makes your head jerk to where her face is at. \"A human? What are you doing so far into anthro country,by yourself?\" she asks weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, I was raised by anthros, not humans,\" you say not bothering to tell her you were half human, half anthro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your the human who defied his own kinds evil ways and took the arrow for an anthro wolf? I thought you were just rumor, it is true,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is true. Now ma'am, can you tell us who did this to you?\" Jimmy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The humans, they attacked my village. We were right next to the border, and they caught us by surprise. I got away, but was badly hurt. I don't think I have much time left. Please I need you to take this to any anthro village close by, even if it is not feline,\" she says as she hands you the parchment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take it and she says, \"I hope you may help end this war. You know the ways of the anthro, and we need to find what ever way possible to bring peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am that's all we want,\" Martin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now you should go. I don't know if the humans have tracked me, but if they have, then you three are in danger if you stay here. Please go now,\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles as she takes one last breath of air and closes her eyes. You check once again for a heartbeat, but you get nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The least we can do is give her a burial, don't you think?\" you ask your cousins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey agreed, and soon the three of you use your daggers and hands best you can, and you notice that it was a lot easier to dig with sharper nails, but then like it happened with your eyes, as soon as you had just finished digging, the nails become flat ad dull again, in a painful process. Your cousins had taken notice, and Martin says, \"Huh, seems the ancestors and your dad are trying to see how you do with anthro body parts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, or it could be something else,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the three of you place the feline in  the grave you made for her and begin to bury her. You hadn't taken into account that everything around you seemed to be back to normal. The animals had started making their noises again and you say as you finish burying the feline anthro, \"Guess the animals wish to stay quiet in the presence of death. Come on lets go, better heed her warning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin and Jimmy nod, and soon the three of you gain your footing for lost time. You wondered what was on the peace of parchment that you had been given, but knew you would find out soon enough, for right now, it was with the other parchment you were carrying. You kept going making sure to keep to the shadows. Soon it became dark and Martin says, \"We should rest for the night, Jimmy, you gather wood to start a small fire. I'll see if I can find us some game to eat. Lucian, you stay here with the supplies and grab the food rations we need for tonight, just in case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jimmy nod and soon take on your duties. It didn't take long for Jimmy to find fire wood and get a fire going, and you had sorted out among the tree of you the food rations for the night. All you waited on was Martin, and for a brief moment, you felt something had happened to him. You were about to go look  for him when he walks up and says, \"Sorry that took so long, and sorry I couldn't find anything bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had caught three rabbits, and they look very plump, meaning a good amount of meat was on them. \"Well, should we have them roasted or stewed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say stewed,\" Martin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I second that,\" Jimmy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stew it is then,\" You say, and you pull out the necessary equipment to make the stew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were the best at cooking out of the three, and did your best to make sure it didn't burn. Soon it was ready to eat and the three of you dig in. \"Seems your mother taught you well Lucian, the stew is good,\" Jimmy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin nods in agreement and you say, \"Thanks guys, but my mom is the one  who makes a mean rabbit stew, and I still can't figure out what she puts in it to make it so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Cousins shrug their shoulders, and you shrug your as well. \"Well it's time to get some sleep,\" Martin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got first watch,\"  You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin and Jimmy nod and soon fall asleep. This gave you time to yourself to think about all that has happened to you in recent days, and where your future is going to take you. 'Should I tell the village back home what I am? What would my mom think of me? Will she still love me? And what will rosy think? But what happens if I don't tell them, and they find out through other means?' All these questions go through your head as you keep a keen eye for any trouble that may arise. You figure one of two thing can only occur if you do or if you don't tell them. You push the thoughts out of your head and resume your watch. It was going to be a long one, but you were prepared.</span></div></div>",

Go down to the well and full it NOW!  If that water is not boiling by the time your father gets home I'll-\" She stops as she sees you walking into thier village. You were simply looking around at the village. Not too much, a bunch of huts, a road through the middle, a well at the end of the road. Then you notice a fpemale fox, staring at you with the widest eyes you've ever seen. You kept it together, trying not to stare as that would probably frighten her. But it was too late to prevent that.<br>\r\n\"Human!\" She yells, and the surrounding few anthros were running frantically, grabbing weapons,  running into huts and so on. <br>\r\nIn a few seconds, there's 5 foxes in front of you, clutching weapons. but not raising them.<br>\r\nYou, and your friends did  not know what to do. Finally an older fox with a deep voice said to you, \"What is the meaning of this human?  You wear our armour and wield an anthro sword, but are not anthro. Could you be the rumored Lucian everyone is talking about?\"<br>\r\nYou and your friends snap out of it. \"Yes,\" you reply, \"We are from the wolf village. This is Martin and That's Jimmy. And I believe Jimmy has a letter for your council.\" \"I will take it to them.\" He said. \"But first, will you tell us on what business you come here for.\" \"We need your help. As you may recall, we rescued you elders some time back, and now find ourselves in need. You see, the humans attacked the village because of me. They apparently didn't want any kind of \"bad example\"  rumors running around thief own kind. We captured one of them, and a rescue attempt was made during his trial. I was stabbed. It was very close to my liver, but I survived. Before I blacked out I heard the words from thief general, \" I told you not to kill him\" with quite a bit of rage.  They now believe me to be dead. If the humans see me there again they'll only attack again.\" Jimmy interupted. \"He may the key to peace between anthros and humans.\" <br>\r\nThe fix anthros became rather shocked at this, and one of them immeadiately ran off  with the letter.<br>\r\nOne of them, a woman, said \"I'm sure you all will have a warm welcome, after the shock wears off\". The three of you gigled at that, as did a few of the fox warriors. <br>\r\nA few minutes later a fox dressed on clothes that were more expensive than all the others came up to you and said;<br>\r\n\"Hello Lucian, jimmy, and martion is it?\" Martin was a little shocked, but simply pronounced his name correctly. \"Sorry, the head council member mumbled a little when he read the names. My name is Lansing. The council has decided to welcome you to our village, for as long as you need. We have a spare hut not far from here where visitors of high esteem usually come. It is empty now, so that's where you'll be staying. You all must be tired from you journey, Would you like to go there now? No one has any objections so he motions for you all to follow him as you walk to this hut. He was not lieing when he said visitors of high esteem, for it was nicely decorated, had two floors, 4 beds, 2 tables, 8 chairs, a nice view of the countryside and a fire pit in the back. \"I hope you like it, it was the best I could come up with.\" Jimmy replied \"Its amazing! I've never seen a place like this. You all (except Lansing) nod in agreement. \"You can hunt in the forest for dinner or there's some money on the table by the window. If you don't need anything else I will be back tomorrow.\" You thanked and excused him, but the others were both too interested in something or other. <br>\r\nLater, jimmy went out hunting, and you and Martin were left alone. So you went outside and spared/trained, you with your memory dagger and Martin with a stick of about the same length, until he got back with a doe. But you two didn't stop. You couldn't. Niether of you wanted another stalemate, so you simply didn't stop. That one match lasted 90 minutes. By that time you had gathered quite a crowd of people just watching and betting on who would be the victor. More anthros  tended to bet for martin, because he was anthro. Neither you nor Martin really paid attention to the crowd. Suddenly, your foot slipped just a little bit during a kick at just the right second, and WHACK your other foot hit his stick right out of his hands.<br>\r\nThen came the applause.<br>\r\nThat's when you two realized the crowd you had attracted. There was around 100 anthros there. It was a full 20 minutes later when they had finally sorted out who won what and you and Martin figured out what had happened. \"I'd say that was another stalemate.\" You said, \" I slipped!\"  \"I dunno kid\" said one of the council members, \"Looked to me like I lost my wager\" \"yep\", said Martin, who was panting and wiping the sweat off his fur, \"you beat me fair and square, even if it was just by luck. Oh drat... The deer's probably cold by now.\"<br>\r\nWell it wasn't. Jimmy had cooked it and kept it warm for them, although he had almost burned it a few times, while he watched the sparing.</span></div></div>",

You were about to take a leap forward to stab him in the right shoulder, but then you see that he is not alone. You know you are out numbered and turn to head for the village, but as you turn, you see you are surrounded by bounty hunters. Your not sure if you can evade them, but maybe if you use some of the skills you were taught you could have enough time to get back to the village and get help, but then again, they may get into the village themselves and kill as many as possible. You don't want them getting in and think of maybe stalling them long enough to have some warriors help you out. You make a break for the village and start using your good arm to fight them off. \"Don't let him escape,\" a human says (possibly their leader).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to fight in close range combat trying to get through them swinging as hard as you could  every time it was blocked. As you slowly moved through them, every time your blades hit one another, sparks would show for a split second, showing that neither you or them would let up. \"I always liked a good duel,\" you say to hide your fear of capture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep up a good fight until your arm caused you unbearable pain. Soon all you were doing was blocking attacks that came at you. \"That's enough, he's reached his limit. Get him up,\" the human says again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey bounty hunters get you to your feet and you yell out in pain as they grab your injured arm. They bring you to their leader who was sitting on a horse and he takes off his mask and shows a man who has one eye that is completely blind an a scar running below it and is barely growing out his beard. You don't flinch for you were more pissed off then hurt. \"So your the kid who is working with the anthros. The gossips were right, and here I thought the king who had hired us was sending us on a wild goose chase. Well I guess we were wrong but to finally see you in person, I have to say you are one tough young boy, most of my men, who are much older then you, seem tired after fighting you. But you don't seem too tired aside from the wound my second in command gave you. Seems you didn't have enough time to push him out of the way. Now we have you and the anthro who wounded one of my men,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he says that, you see another anthro wolf who was someone you knew from a neighboring village, your friend Kiron, who was a black anthro wolf with a white underbelly and a year older then you like Jimmy. 'Oh shit, not him too' you thought. The human then says, \"Now lets take you back and that anthro back to the human village for some questioning along with that criminal the village is holding who we were hired to bring to justice as well. Or you could leave your anthro ways and join us on our conquest to destroy them, we could use your skills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight there you were insulted by such a thought and spit in the mans face before saying, \"Go to hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man wipes the spit of his face and shows a disappointed/insulted frown before saying, \"Alright, bind his hands and neck together so he doesn't try to reach for his or your weapons, and search him for weapons he may be hiding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they bind your hands and neck together and take your knife you were using and as they start search you for weapons you see some of the warriors who had heard you call out the alert were hiding in the treetops ready to ambush them. You send them a signal by brushing your eyebrow twice, which meant do not attack, stay hidden and follow you from a distance once they headed off. The warriors got the signal and waited in the trees. You knew your mother would be frantic and would want to come looking for you. Soon the human leader says, \"Alright men lets move out. Back to the village with our prisoners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you were on the move, two soldiers grabbing hold of you and another two grabbing hold of Kiron. You knew you had to come up with a plan to get you and him out of there. It was going to be a challenge, but you were good with coming up with strategies. The humans take you farther away from your home and you hope that your fellow warriors don't follow too close or the plan might fail. You and Kiron were dragged through the forest for five hours until you finally are in the village that you had done recon on a day ago. Villagers who are still awake watch as you are taken to the human's jail. You get comments like 'traitor' or 'anthro lover'. The second comment was true about you, but they used it as an insult. Soon you and Kiron are untied and thrown into a holding cell together, and finally you and Kiron hug each other in a friendly manner, watching out for your injured arm. Kiron then says, \"Lucian, you are one stubborn kid aren't you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you too Kiron,\" you say as you grab your arm that was in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me have a look at that Lucian,\" Korin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou show him your bad arm and he inspects it closely. After a while he says, \"Yep it's been dislocated from that arrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after he says that he pushes it hard into your shoulder and you hear a load crack or pop, as he has put it back into place. At the same time you scream, \"Yeeoooow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry but it had to be done, you arm should be up to full strength in a few hours,\" Kiron says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, guess I owe you one,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it,\" Kiron says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both then hear a man laughing. He is shadowed but you ask in annoyance, \"May I ask what you find so amusing sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two. A human and a anthro working together, I never thought I would see the day. It's no wonder your mother probably abandoned you. Or were you too young to remember her walking out on you,\" the man says in a deep voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up to the edge of the bars that separated you and stood firm saying \"I was only an infant when my human mother abandoned me, for reasons unknown to me. I was lucky to be found by the anthro I call my mother who loves me dearly and I her. It's my human mother's loss that she gave me up. Your people speak of destroying mine. Well I listened to the stories told by human adults when I was young and trained to become a warrior. Then I listened to the anthro side and knew humans were wrong about anthros. That is why I fight on their side, but all we want is peace. It's people like you that stops that from happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stands up and comes face to face with you, yet his face was still in the dark and says, \"People like me? Helping the anthros is what got me thrown in here in the first place. I've been here for 3 weeks and was dreading what was to become of me. Now you arrive. Your the first human I've heard of that has been raised by the anthros. I only just realized the errors of my ways a year ago. For a while I stay under the radar, but then I need to take more drastic measures when they started mass killings in some of the villages. I was able to hamper their progress y warning some anthro villages. I stopped at a wolf anthro village that was close to here, but obviously not where you live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, Jason?\" Kiron says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so you do recognize me. I was wondering when you would catch on Kiron,\" Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait you know him?\" you ask.</span></div></div>",

Jason has been in our village for the past 6 and a half months. At first we didn't trust him, but as time went on we realized he was truly on our side. He was valuable ally to our quest for peace. More people in my village have now taken a liking to both of you, especially the elders. He has been talking to human villages near the border to see what they intend to do. A few seem to have wanted to make peace, but they keep their mouths shut when that king's men come around. The human village we are in right now does not take well to anthros, and in your case traitors to their kind. No offence,\" Kiron says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken,\" you and Jason say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please continue,\" you finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess word slipped from someone outside this village that he was with us, he was taken prisoner here upon his return. As soon as we got word of his capture, we discussed if we should get him out. At first some people were against it, but after remembering the countless times he got us out of a scramble, everyone agreed that it was not right to leave him here. Me and some of the older warriors in my village were sent to break him out, but then we hit trouble. Word had not gotten to us that the human king had sent bounty hunters to take him from here and to the king. That's when their leader ordered an attack on us. Most of us headed for the trees and were out of harms way, but then one of the humans caught up to a friend of mine and I had to act fast so I wounded the bounty hunter in the fight. My friend got away but then I became separated from the rest after they had taken off knowing there were too many. The next day I was heading for my village and I was ambushed and captured, that's when I heard the lead bounty hunter say 'We got the anthro, now it's time to get that human kid we shot with the arrow away from the safety of his village.' That's how I knew about your wound and why you saw me when we left your village. Now we need to decide the best course of action for getting the three of us out of here and back to the safety of anthro country. I know your village warriors followed us and are probably making plans of their own,\" Kiron finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's talk about how we are going to escape,\" Jason says, finally stepping into the moonlight to reveal a tall man with spiked black hair and blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the three of you come up with ideas on how to escape and see who has the better idea after discussing it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The day had come and gone but the three of you still plotted a way out, you knew the wolves from your village would wait fir some form of signal so all you had to do was get into the cover of some trees. The hard part was getting passed the guards. Some looked pretty weak but most had a gleam in there eyes that looked like they would kill you just from a stare. But there was a few people around that you had not seen before. 4 of them. All dressed in a different form of clothing than the others, it was the same colour apart from a black trimming round the edges if it and each of them carried very strange weapons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of then who you guessed was female was carrying Kurni's which you didn't even know were used anymore, the second one had an exposed left a with what looked like tally mark scars on his left arm and carried 2 hooks in his hands that looked very lethal, the third was armed with a slingshot his eyes were constently alert and the way he held his weapon make it look like he was going to be nasty even in close quarters, the final one seemed to keep switching his weapons around from hammers to axes and maces. These 4 seemed to passed by every 30 minutes and each time he was carrying a different weapon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had asked Jason about these people and he had told you this \"those 4 are their own band of hunter, they are only hired and not allowed to join any groups because their meathods are...let just say when they fight the word 'bloodbath' becomes a little more literal.\" even some guards are constently by your holding cell shake when those 4 get anywhere near. Jason had also said \"they don't mind a bit of friendly fire aswell, so why they are here I'll never know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last when the moon was fully up the three of you had a plan. It started with Kiron asking waiting until only 1 guard was in sight and then saying \"err...excuse me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard spoke back but he was clearly tired. Perfect. \"no talking!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiron when on as planned \"sorry? What was that I didn't catch it.\" he lent slightly closer to the caged door as he said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard lent closer and once again said \"no talking!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiron put his ear right close to the door and asked it once more, the guare sighed, put his face right close to his ear and took a deep breath ready to shout. Now. You quickly grabbed him and gave a swift and accurate chop to the back of his neck. The guard silently fell to the ground out cold, you smile silently as you remember that you should never get in paws reach of a captive. Jason franticly looked around ready of alert you if anyone came back. You quickly set to action searching the guard for keys. But you couldn't find any. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kiron pushed you aside and grabbed some small bits of metal from the guard and quickly fiddled about with the until it clicked open, he went to open Jasons lock and gave you an innocent smile that was clearly meant to mean 'what?'. You just smiled back as a reply. But this smile didn't last long as a guard came back, saw you 3 standing there, then shouted loudly \"prisoners escaping!!! To arms!!! Stop the<br>\r\n!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard then drew his sword and charged at the three if you. You didn't think about what to do, your body just acted on it's own. The guard brought his sword Dow. Towards you from a high swipe, you spun right to dodge, grabbed his sword arm with your unharmed arm and brought your knee straight into his face with a loud crack. Then without having to say it the three off you ran, since it was night you were conpleatly relying on Kiron to lead you. The air was filling with the noise of people shouting and running around. But Kaion was running straight towards the nearest way into the woods as planned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever none of your planning could have got you ready for what happened next. A group of about 8 of the bounty hunters ran straight into you 3 without even relising, this knocked you off your feet. The hunters regained their bearing and saw the three of you, without hesertating they drew their weapons and attacked.  But you were lucky, them drawing their weapons gave you 3 just enough time to get up and run left away from them. You are positave you felt a sword cut the heel of your boot though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again it was back to running blind, hopping that yoir friend would lead you correctly. Then Jason said \"guys, I've remembered something really importent!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shout back \"it can wait.\" you catch up with Kiron and Jason takes your left flank. The effot was starting to make your lungs burn and lack of anything to eat was also not helping. But you pressed on. Your feet were pounding the ground but you couldn't hear it...all you could hear was the shouts of people chasing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the next thing that happened would stat with you, haunt you, tourcher you for the rest of you life. Out of the darkness the guy with hooks jumps out and dug his hook straight into kaion's arm. You and Jason stopped to go and help him but a metal bulbareing smashed Into Jasons leg bringing him to one knee,probarly the slingshot guy, the girl with the Kurni's was then on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou relised with the worst kind of fear that you could not save both of them. Their eyes were locked with yours. Pleading. You knew you had to choose fast but also wisely. Jason had something importent to say and could be a valuable asset. But Kaion was your friend. With a cry of rage you run to save...   </span></div></div>",

As the man with hooks was going for a death blow with his free hook, your right arm was now at full strength and you hit the man with a right upper cut. The man was sent flying back and his hooks with him, as it tore through some of Kiron's flesh. He screamed as the hook the hook came out and after the man laid on the ground dead as a door nail after one of his hooks went into his heart, Korin says, \"A little rough, but I think we can call this even.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile back in reply, but it was soon gone as you and Kiron turn to go help Jason. As you come up on him you see him trying to dodge the kunai's that the woman is throwing at him, but then just as he jump from one of them the woman was quick to throw another clear at his heart. \"Noooo!!!\" You scream, as Jason falls to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see that the woman has one kunai left on her and she has it tied to a rope. As she pulls it out, she swings it at you, but you were able to dodge just in time and use this chance to pull the other kunai out of Jason's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment you see the woman go for another swing at Kiron, but you jump and cut the rope in mid swing, sending it flying into the direction of the village and knock the woman out. You see it went flying into one of her partner,s the guy with the slingshot, making him fall dead. \"I hate hitting a lady, now all we have to deal with is the guy with the heavy weapons, her, the other bounty hunters, and the villagers,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we better get back to the forest,\" Kiron says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about Jason?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's gone, Lucian,\" Kiron says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over and see Jason's body laying on the ground lifeless and not breathing. You hang your head low feeling so much guilt. \"Lucian, it's not your fault, you did everything you could, he died as a brave man and sacrificed himself to let us live. The least we can do is stay alive for him. Come on, lets get going,\" Kiron says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod silently as you drop the kunai and run for the forest. The villagers and bounty hunters come to see the two of running and see Jason and the woman and the man with hooks laying on the ground. They soon are chasing after the two of you as you run and soon see that you are safely in the forest. You then whistle as a signal that you made it out, but are in trouble, and soon you see your anthro people descending from the treetops. Some of the warriors were archers ready to fire with flaming arrows. As you make it behind them, the archers fire the arrows and soon there is a wall of fire between you and the villagers as they had planned. Finally able to rest you see Martin come up to you and say, \"Seems you forgot the first lesson that our teacher had taught us, never fight alone, especially when you are out numbered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well you know me, I'm to stubborn to back down easily. I'll strive to be more selfless,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And more observant,\" Andreas says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andreas, please forgive me for not being aware of my surroundings and going it alone,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a one off thing, your forgiven. Besides, we might not have gotten Kiron back so soon or even at all if you hadn't been for you getting captured. Just don't let it go to your head,\" Andreas says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I will,\" you say looking toward Kiron once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we better get out of here while that fire line holds them off and in the barrier of their village,\" Martin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let's head for the river,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you can swim on your own?\" Andreas asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swing your right arm around and say, \"Yeah, Kiron fixed me up, otherwise, I might not have been able to take on those two.... Whatever kind of bounty hunters they were. That woman seemed very foreign, unlike most humans we have encountered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well descriptions will have to wait. Right now we need to get Kiron back to his village,\" Martin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and soon you were off toward the river while the bounty hunters and villagers wait to put out the fire. You run further south and soon came to the river. You jumped in and let the current carry you north into anthro country. Soon you came to a safe haven deep in anthro country and terrain that was familiar to you, all of you get out of the water and everyone shakes themselves off (you being human, couldn't shake the water off like they did, so you'll be drenched for a bit). \"Man, am I going to get a such mouthful when I get home. I'll never hear the end of it from my mom,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it could be worse, she was begging to come along, but the council wouldn't let her. It took three of our warriors to hold her back,\" Martin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you let her come along?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two reasons. One, she needed to stay so that she would still be around to take care of you, and two, she probably would have been on a rampage with the human villagers just to get you out of there. The humans in that village hate us too much already, and her going in there would have made the humans resent us even more,\" Andreas says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeesh, that wouldn't be good. Well let's get Kiron back to his people,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right behind ya,\" Martin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you start heading to Kiron's village, and think about Jason along the way.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once you get to Kiron's village, you see a guard as he says, \"Sir we have Kiron coming in with some fellow anthros, and a human is with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it Jason? Did they get him out?\" a deep voice says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jason's name came up, you knew that this was going to be a hard story to tell. After the guard gets a closer look at you he says, \"No sir it's Lucian from the neighboring village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then see an elder wolf (one of the council members of this village) walk out into sight and he says, \"Greetings friends, I see you have brought Kiron back safely, now forgive me for being rude, but what news do you have of Jason?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looks at you and Kiron as you hang your head low and say, \"Jason didn't make it. He died when we were caught in a fight with some, shall I say, specially trained bounty hunters. He died to protect me and Kiron. He did not deserve the punishment of death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucian, you can't blame yourself for his death. Sir, if I may be so bold to speak, Jason felt he knew what he was doing, and told Lucian to help me and not him. He wouldn't have done so if he did not care about our people. I know for a fact that Lucian wanted to help both of us, and he had a hard decision to make. Jason felt he should decide for him. I am thankful that Lucian came to help me. Jason's death was not in vein, because he died so we may live. He will always be remembered as one who fought for peace,\" Kiron says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That he will boys, Jason was a brave human. Braver then most could ever hope to be. But he knew what he was risking and his journey here on Earth has ended. We would disgrace his memory if we were to sulk in his absence, and his death will be in vein if we do not continue our quest for peace. Even though we have not been able to retrieve his body, we will have a funeral for him in two weeks. For right now, you must rest easy, I'm sure you are all famished and require some food and drinks. Please follow me,\" the council member says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then all of the sudden sneeze from being drenched in your clothes. \"Oh, forgive me, we best find everyone some dry clothes as well,\" the elder wolf says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all follow him as he orders some of the villagers to get some dry clothes for all of you. You finally make it to their where they hold their gatherings and there was food waiting for all of you. After getting some dry clothes on, you all take a seat and begin eating your meal, though you were lost in thought at what had happened that you were eating pretty slowly. You are unaware that your friends are watching you as you eat slowly, and just as you had just finished your last bite, Kiron nudges you and says, \"Hey Lucian, you have to stop thinking about what happened. It's not healthy to be so glum dwelling on the past.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why couldn't I have saved him. I was sure I could have. He didn't deserve what they gave him,\" you say, with tears forming in your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucian, there was nothing you could have done. Sometimes there are things that we can't change by ourselves. Believe me, I wish that things were better between my folks, but the only way that is going to happen is if the change the way they think about thing themselves,\" Martin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ancestors knew it was his time, there was nothing that would have stopped it from happening. If you had tried to help him, all three of you may be dead now, but you are still here, and Jason would have wanted the two of you to stay alive,\" Andreas says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Jason had something important to tell us, and because we couldn't save him, we might never know what it is,\" you say, speaking through your tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to stop blaming yourself Lucian, he knew that one of us needed to be saved, and he didn't want to see another young anthro's blood spilled. He acted in a noble manner, as did you. You saved my life, and he sacrificed himself to let us live. If you keep dwelling on his death, then it will have been in vein. He would want us to keep fighting and live on. We've already lost one good human to this war. Let's not lose another to grief,\" Kiron says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(sniff) Your right, we need to bring about a peace. This war can't go on forever. It was nice to know there was another human fighting for the anthros. I just hope he can find a way to help us from the afterlife,\" you say, regaining your composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit kid, now I'm sure that there is much to tell about these special bounty hunters you encountered, but we will wait until you have finished your drink and the village council comes by to get yours and Kiron's report,\" Andreas says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" you say as you finish up your drink (It was sort of a mid evil soda for kids your age).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finished up, you soon see the council members walk up to you and say, \"Hello once again Lucian, I must say your visit was quite unexpected this time, but word has traveled fast about what you have done for your own village. You are one brave lad indeed, and I'm glad to have you on our side. I know it must be hard for you after what has happened, but I must ask for all of us here, who are these special bounty hunters you spoke of? What do they do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, one or two of them have died. There was a man who carried hooks, his skin was far darker then mine, so I imagine he comes from a coastal area south of here, and his tactics seemed pretty lethal. Kiron had the unfortunate encounter with his hooks,\" you says as you point at Kiron who had a deep cut in his arm,where blood had clotted up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The man with hooks sort of killed himself after I hit him with an upper cut, so we won't have to worry about him. Then there's a man who carries a sling shot. Now I know those seem old fashioned, but that man is very lethal and accurate with it, so I would watch out. His skin seem lighter, and he was smaller in size compared to the hook man's build, but I suspect these two bounty hunters were not far from each other. Now we did see a knife get thrown at him, but we did not have enough time to see if it had actually hit a vital organ in his chest or abdominal area, so I will presume slightly to severely injured at this point. Then there's a man that seems to be local to the area, but knows the others pretty  well. He is a big fellow, very toned and seems to have a liking for the heavy weapons such as Maces, axes, spiked clubs, even the large hammer, so I advise attacking him from a distance or when his back is turned, if you have enough time. Then there's a women warrior, now she seems very different form the others. Her favorite weapon appears to be the kunai. I was surprised myself to find out myself that they are still in use, and I'm sure Kiron is too. The woman may be from a land that's across the sea,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure,\" the council member says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with him sir, It seems one of the human kings will go to any extreme to push the anthros farther north or wipe us out for good, and the only human clans that I know that still use kunai are those who live in the far eastern part of the world,\" Kiron says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now that we have this information, we will be sending messengers to the other villages to let them know what we have found out. I'm sure you will be reporting this to your own village,\" the councils member says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I suppose we will let you and your fellow village warriors be on your way if you want to make it home before late afternoon. Remember, your welcome to our village anytime you wish to visit, and thank you for bringing back Kiron safely,\" the council member says again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe holds out his paw and you shake it with yours. Soon after, you walk over and give Kiron a friendship hug, bidding him farewell as you and your fellow warriors take off.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was Fifteen years later and you had grown into a fine strong human (Stronger then most of your own kind). Your had brought to the village when you were just an infant by your adopted mother, Lila, a Tan colored anthro wolfess with long brown hair, who vowed to raise you as her own, and she had named you Terra, which meant strong heart in their time. The anthros (all wolves) were touched rather then disgusted by her actions, for they had never seen a human baby before and all knew that if they raised you from this age and taught you the ways of the anthro and how the humans had wronged them for false crimes, you would find a way to bring about a common peace. The Council of the central village in which you now dwell and was the anthros stronghold in case of a large scale attack, easily accepted you and vowed to help with your protection against enemy forces. The village had kept you and the anthro children far from the humans for ten years and finally let you see what the humans did and said about anthros so you could know why the humans hated them. Not all surrounding anthro wolf villages approved of your presence among them and were always on alert when they were around you, though you always showed them kindness and trust and would not turn your back on the anthros no matter what, even after hearing the human side of the story. You always knew you were different in appearance, but many of the anthro adults had taken to notice the your personality was of anthro origin. At first they thought it was because of the way your adopted mother had raised you, but then found out a far deeper secret that explained why you were who you were and possibly why fate had brought you to them in the first place. When the other villages had learned of the secret, they understood why you were placed among them and treated you with more gratitude. What the secret was, you did not know, but would be told when the time was right. Tonight, you were heading back home from the the archery range with your bow and arrows, which archery was what you excelled in, even though you had some skill in swordsmanship, as did most, your one weakness was in spear throwing. You could easily jab, for you had good footing, but when you threw, your spear never seemed hit the target right at dead center, of course you weren't the only one who showed that weakness. Your best friend Aden, who was same age as you and was an anthro wolf with brown fur, also showed that flaw. As you walk home, you think about what tomorrow will bring, for tomorrow was choosing day, where you would be chosen to perform a certain specialty for the rest of your life. You hoped you and you friend Aden would become knights or anything that came close, such as the anthros rangers (who in this story are the ones of stealth and agility), who always seemed mysterious for some reason, and were of interest to you, even though they rarely were chosen. You hoped not to be place in some boring job such as farming, even though you knew how to farm a bit. You felt it would disgrace your mothers image if that happened. Your train thought stopped as a silver colored anthro wolf named Luri, Aden's year older sister and a girl you had major crush on, but were always afraid to talk to (which was another one of your weaknesses), comes up to you and asks, \"How did you do at the archery range today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.....okay I g-guess,\" You say nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuri giggles at your nervousness and says, \"It was better than okay from what I've heard Terra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh nervously and Aden walks up and says, \"I see my sister is making you nervous again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is it going Aden?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh not to bad, getting ready for the choosing tomorrow. How do you feel about it?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little overwhelmed. I don't want to disappoint my mother and hope I don't get assigned to some low type job. But hey, if that is what happens I can't change it,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm pretty nervous myself. Hope they don't make me a cook because of my sister, because I know diddly squat about cooking, no offense sis,\" Aden says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken little bro,\" Luri says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, your one of the best young archers the village has seen in years. They definitely have to give you something good,\" Aden says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terra, Dinners ready. Better get it while it's hot,\" Your mother says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lived right next door to your friend and had always played with him and his sister in your early years. His Parents and your mother were good friends and always talked about how the three of you got along. \"Well I'll see you at the choosing tomorrow. Hopefully we both get something good,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya,\" they both say as they head over to their parents who had been watching you all with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get inside and your mother had just pull out some oven roasted ham slices and bread. She had also made some broccoli, which wasn't your most favorite, but you would still  eat it. You soon start eating as your mother  asks, \"So how was your day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow and say, \"It was okay, had a few sloppy practice shots then used my concentration and hit the bulls-eye every time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good honey, that should help you in the choosing tomorrow,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure hope so,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, whatever duty they assign you, it will be for a reason, and I'll be proud of you no matter what,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom,\" you say, with a little doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon finish your meal and your mother says, \"You better get a good night's rest dear. You'll need to be up bright and early tomorrow for the choosing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mom,\" you agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon get changed into your evening attire and drift off to sleep, as does your mother.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was finally the day of the choosing, and you did your best to hide your nervousness. Your mother stood in the crowd and waited as each 15 year old was being assigned their jobs. Some were assigned a blacksmith's apprentice, some a stable master's apprentice, some were assigned as a cook's apprentice, some were apprenticed to Scribes or council members, and some were knight's apprentices, it came to you. You were to go just before Aden and you stand in front of the council members and the instructors. You then hear one of the council members say, \"State your name son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terra sir,\" You answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell us young Terra, what skills do feel you have to offer our village?\" a council member says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have some skill with the blade sir, but I am also a fair archer as well,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better then fair from what we've heard and observed,\" They say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was something that you did not expect to hear and say, \"I wish to be a warrior sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe council member then says, \"Well you do show some of the skill set needed for a knight, then again......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir wait, I must speak with you,\" Ranger says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure what they were taking about, until you hear another council member say, \"We have discussed it and have decided to make you *dramatic pause* a ranger's apprentice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis came as a shock to you and others and you were completely speechless. Rangers rarely pick apprentices, and to be picked by one was a great honor, but you soon realized that you had the skills needed for the job. You were fast, agile, and on several occasions were able to sneak up on your friends without them sensing your presence, even with their keen sense of smell. You were also good at climbing, and at one time or another, escaped danger from wild animals by seeking safety in the trees. \"So do you accept young one?\" the council member asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir, I do accept,\" you say with quick enthusiasm.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Then take your place by your new teacher,\" The council member says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bow in respect and walk to your new teacher, who is a Black colored anthro wolf in a camouflage cloak. He nods and gives a quick smile as you stand next to him. Your friend was next and he too became the ranger's apprentice. Both of you were honored to have been picked by him and soon the rest were assigned to their new duties as apprentices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meet me here at eight tomorrow boys. I'll let you enjoy today. You two are going to have a lot of training coming your way. By the way, my name's Talcane,\" the ranger says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's honor to be your apprentices sir,\" You say and Aden nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well off with you two now. I'm sure you are both eager to tell your folks if they don't already know,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both nod and take off to see your mother, who congrats both of you for your apprenticeship. \"We better go home and celebrate with Aden's folks,\" she says, and you are soon off towards your homes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your name is Troy Conner. It was the year 1994 when it all happened, your family and you are part of a group of humans who are friends with anthro Wolves and Foxes (Which are the only two types of anthros in this story). You had many friends who were anthros, especially my best friend, Jones Martin(or as you like to call him Jonesey), who was an anthro wolf that had silver fur and green eyes, and you also had human friends. Jones, you, your twin brother James Conner, and some of your other friends went and joined the military, Navy S.E.A.L.s to be exact, and took out what ever enemies threatened your way of life in your once proud country. But all that changed when after a few weeks of being home from your last mission, the human President of the United States declares war against all the anthros and anyone who will side with them, after a massacre of a small city (that was made mostly of humans) had taken place and all ships and human soldiers were called back home and ordered to bring in all anthro military personnel. When the declaration of war had been declared, your friends, you and your brother knew that you were all in danger, and had to get yourselves out of California, where you were stationed, and back to the north bordering states, so that night you found what ammunition and firearms that you could, grabbed your belongings, got in your trucks and headed north towards your hometown in Sydney, Montana using whatever back roads you could to avoid the Californian authorities. When you got home to Sydney, Montana five days later, you were greeted by family and friends and were given the full story of what had happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthros and their human friends who stayed loyal to them, yourself, your brother and your human friends included, had fled major human populated areas in the southern, eastern, and southwestern states after the order was given, but not all of your people made it out and were either locked up or killed. Those of you who managed to escape had set up a defense in the northern part of the country in the states of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Nebraska, and Iowa, for these states had many anthro populations alongside humans in small towns and the humans in theses states had nothing against them, and those humans who did and would rather save their own skin and abandon their anthro friends fled to the part of the country the anthros had fled from. Three weeks later these twelve states had become known as the Allied States of America (A.S.A.) and you soon claimed independence from the United States of America two months after the order was given. Most of the Naval ships had been taken by the anthros in the Pacific and some in the Atlantic and made their way to Washington and Oregon. Most Ships that were under full human control had remained in port in the state of California, and the states on the eastern coast. Large military planes had also been taken by the anthros to get the anthro ground troops home, and any of the human soldiers who sided with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthros outside of the country were safe from harm for the time being, but you didn't know if the war would spread. Any anthros across the border of Mexico would have a hard time getting into the states if they took the land crossing approach and some even fled to Mexico when the order was given, but they had it a lot easier if they took the water route off the west coast to get to the northern states. The Canadian anthros had no problem, for Canada was not against the anthros and allowed them safe passage to and from their country. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was finally known that these northern states had sided with the anthros, the President gave an order to eliminate all towns in these states. But when the order had been given, the A.S.A. had many military personnel capable of piloting air crafts, including anthros, and also had been given enough time to organize their defense. Our people held their soldiers to a stand still, and the President had lost too many air crafts to make a clean sweep over the A.S.A. with an airstrike and their ground troops had fared no better, so the President was unable to push forward. Once we had established the areas that our people were free to roam, we focused on winning back the rest of the states to be united once again, and without the threat of anthros being killed on sight. For a little while we did not have a leader, but soon your S.E.A.L.s mentor, and close anthro wolf friend John Raymond who had black fur, took charge when no one else stood up to the plate, and made it so that if the United States made a move, you would be prepared, and he usually sent you, your brother and your friends on rescue missions to get any anthros and humans fighting for them who were still alive but had been captured, out of their prisons and back to safety, and you were doing a great job, but you were just getting started. Two days ago you had just finished a rescue mission of 2,000 anthros and humans who had been stuck in the United States and now you were back home for a break. You and your friends were all of age and walk into your favorite bar in town, 'The Pub', as it was ironically named and say after finding some seats, \"Hey Scarlet, how about a round of your best whiskey for me and my friends here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming right up boys, this one will be on me,\" Scarlet says. Scarlet Jennings was an anthro arctic fox who had of course white fur, and Navy blue eyes. She was the single owner of this bar, with no current husband, having taken the place over after her father had died of old age and her mother could not longer run it. Her siblings got into other lines of work, including her brother, Leo Jennings, who was one of your friends and had been a S.E.A.L. with you, and is currently sitting with you. Soon Scarlet came over with the drinks and sits down with all of you to swap conversation.</span></div></div>",
