Both of her parents and the pilot died almost instantly. But she miraculously survived but was unconscious for a few hours but recovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately she had enough rations for a week and various books to read that was somehow not burnt by the plane crash. The area was not urban but rural. Since she had some training in Jungle Survival, she built a fire and a decent lean-to.

Living in Africa has not been easy in spite of her  training and great fighting skills and strength. Some people still look down on her since she was female. Even though she had her supporters, Sheena was upset last night at a village chief 's rejection for her help in finding a vile game hunter trespassing in his territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile jogging, she thought <i>' well, let the chief lose his livestock one by one to that hunter' </i> After a hour jogging she was just breaking a slight sweat, Sheena heard an eagle calling to her about a lost young girl nearby at a campfire who might need her help. Quickly Sheena jogged in that direction and found the smoke from the fire. Sheena found Sherri eating an apricot with a worried face. Sheena approached Sherri with a smile and said<b><span class=\"cmagenta\"> Peace, I am not here to hurt you but to help you.</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherri looked at her with a puzzled look on the face and said  'How could you help me?

When Sheena asked with respect to be able to take the necklace for Sherri, the elderly remembered everything the Amazon savanna had done to their land, and they agreed. Both satisfied and excited, the two girls came out of the hut with the artifact and returned to the place where they had met for the first time.

After a quick breakfast, they packed a few supplies and headed on the journey to the Temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way, Sherri was impressed with the reasonable size of  Sheena's biceps. It was about the size of an good female athlete. Sherri said ' Do you think that the water will get my biceps to your size?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheena replied ' It depends on how much you drink, The size of the biceps can be more too.But, after all, surviving in the jungle is far more than just strength. It is building a decent shelter, finding food, water, recognizing animals and insects, and knowing where you are....and knowing how to fight.' <br>\r\nSherri nodded.

It looks like its hurt!\"  Sheena started running over to it with Sherri right behind her.  When they got up to it, Sheena placed a consoling hand on it trying to comfort it.  From the looks of it, the wound was very serious and was caused not by another beast, but by a human.  The giraffe was in serious pain and was growling almost non-stop.  Sheena said to the giraffe softly, \"I'm sorry, there is nothing I can do to heal you.  I can at least save you from the pain and give you a proper burial.  Would that be okay?\"  Sherri was surprised that Sheena was able to communicate with an injured animal like this, but was even more amazed that the giraffe seemed to nod at her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout so much as a blink, Sheena took out her knife and stabbed the giraffe, ending its life.  Sherri cried out in shock and Sheena too was almost crying.  After giving it a proper burial and consoling each other, Sheena told Sherri, \"Sadly, this is the law of the jungle.  There are certain animals that we do not hunt nor prey on.  Giraffe's are one of them.  They are considered sacred creatures to this jungle.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women looked at the small mound of earth where they had buried the animal and continued their hike through the mountains.  Along the way, Sheena began explaining the basics of survival, how to find food, water and shelter.  For example, determining the time of the day by the sun's position and determining where north was.  She also explained using the natural geography and features to pinpoint and locate oneself with respect to another location.  Sherri was quiet as the other athletic woman explained this to her.  She was still a bit shaken from what she saw earlier, but nonetheless steeled herself for what was about to come later on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after a long hike they finally come across... </span></div></div>",

And it was hard.But Sheena shook her head ' It is OK..but you need more. My biceps is 13 and 3/4. She revealed her biceps. Sheena continued ' I do not always reveal its bigness. But I want YOU to drink some more of it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherri was puzzled...But why don't you want to drink more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheena said.... Well, I could but I have my reasons for not doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherri drank a little bit more and now she looked like one of the best female bodybuilder, and perhaps possibly the best.<br>\r\nSherri laughed and said ' How about this ? It is bigger than your biceps now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheena said ' Impressive but there are male that are stronger. But remember that I want you to be strong enough to break out of here through those walls. Not even Arnold Schzennagger can break through even in his prime.' Sheena found a discarded cup and filled it to the brim.  Sheena said ' This should do it without bruising or bleeding your hands. Drink up. Don't worry, It is OK to be stronger than me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherri pleaded to Sheena  'Okay, only if you drink a tiny bit more from the pond, even if it is a tiny bit. It would make me feel better since you are giving me this gift.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheena sighed and said ' Okay, but just a tiny bit more' Sheena cupped her hand and drink a tiny bit.  The biceps on Sheena's arms grew another inch.   Sheena said ' That is enough for me. The pond is meant far more for you than me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherri then drank the entire portion from the cup. Then at the time, Sherri became a big, strong, young woman that could be compared to the Green Hulk....without the Green skin, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherri then asked  ' is this OK now?'  Sheena smiled broadly and said YES.  <br>\r\nMeanwhile the pond of water disappeared so nobody else could drink except for Sherri and maybe Sheena too (if Sherri approves).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheena led Sherri to one of the cavern hardened walls and told her to punch away. Sherri was hesitating at first. But some of the rock in the wall gave way and a hole appeared.  Sherri gasped and said ' Hope that I am not too strong for you.'... Sheena laughed and said ' Nonsense, tell you what,let's pretend that an evil ruler trapped us in here and I needed medical help. Punch the wall as quickly and hard as you can.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherri sighed and said ' okay, I will give it my best shot and as hard as I can.'<br>\r\nShe did want Sheena wanted. Getting out of the 100 yard rock wall took about 3 or 4 minutes since it WAS truly a hard challenge. Finally they could see the outside.   Sherri got excited and gave it one mighty kick this time. And her kick created a final hole that they both could get through. That final kick created a small boulder that rolled down into a valley before stopping. Then they both stepped through and gave each other a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheena smiled ' Nobody would want to mess with you unless he was stupid'  They walked toward to the camp where Sheena first met Sherri. On the way, Sheena and Sherri saw someone standing in the trail blocking their way. It was <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
