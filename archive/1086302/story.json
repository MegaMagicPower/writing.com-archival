There something large hops in front of you and tosses you in the air with a powerful hop that causes the ground to crack and people to run screaming. You land on your back and look up at the colossus. It was a rabbit, a very large and very chubby gray-furred rabbit, female from the looks of it, with a bright pink nose that was twitching. However, this rabbit was no ordinary rabbit as she was 800ft tall. You could not believe how big the rabbit was. \"That is the biggest rabbit I've ever seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit hops again, creating earthquakes as her wrecking ball-sized cottontail wiggles. She bends down as she eats a patch of grass as big as a football field and you watch in amazement at such a monstrously big rabbit. \"How did that rabbit get so big?\" You then hear a thunderous caw and then look in the sky to see a crow flying overhead and your jaw drops as the crow is also massive. While not nearly as big as the rabbit, the crow was so huge that a jumbo jet could land on its beak. You then turn and see a mouse run by and the mouse was half as big as the rabbit, making it just as colossal. \"All the animals are super huge,\" you think to yourself. \"What happened? Did a meteor strike? A radiation leak? A magic spell? What happened.\" The entire ground shakes beneath you. That rabbit is far from the only giant animal in the area and she was now hopping away and one of her hops propelled you up into the air as you scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you fall down, you land...</span></div></div>",

But before you could consider the possibility of crashing on the ground, something grabs you in its mighty talons. You look to your sides and see that you had been grabbed by a giant bird of some kind, a bird that was 50 times as big as a jumbo jet. You hear a cooing sound and you look up to see that the bird that caught you was a giant purplish gray pigeon who was flapping her wings as she flew through the air. You then see a flock of several other pigeons flying behind her and cooing as well. You watch as a good majority of the pigeons then proceed to descend down from the sky, flapping their wings violently and create storms of feathers that were larger than trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then hear screaming as down people dozens of people are fleeing as the rest of the flock of pigeons fly down and start to root around the city. One pigeon even crushes a car under its talons while another uproots a pipe in the ground by pecking. Several of the pigeons even start to chase the fleeing people and knock them down with their beaks. Some of the pigeons grab the people and fly away, dragging them along, kind of like this enormous female pigeon that grabbed you. You then gasp as one pigeon grabs a car with several people inside and then tosses it into the air before grabbing it and gulping it down its throat like a bread crumb as the people inside scream. You look in pure hour as more pigeons even begin to take apart large skyscrapers with their beaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was there that you realize that maybe it wasn't a good idea to let this massive pigeon hold onto you and then grunt as you start an attempt to free yourself. The pigeon feels you and coos as she attempts to tighten her grip and snaps her beak slightly as she starts to fly overseas. You keep on struggling to free yourself from the island-sized bird that captured you and even bite the pigeon. However, she barely feels it as she keeps trying to tighten her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that point that the pigeon... </span></div></div>",

No way were you going to end up as pigeon food and this flying vermin was NOT putting you on her menu tonight. As the pigeon attempts to tighten her grip one more time, you fight back and twist the skin on the end of one of her toes. The pigeon lets out a pained shriek and jerks her legs back and forth, loosening your grip. But at that moment, you stop and realize that you were tens of thousands of feet up in the sky and gasp. You did not think your escape plan through. \"Wait!\" you yell to the giant pigeon. \"Don't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, the pigeon is in just too much pain and tosses you up further into the air as you yell and then start to plummet. You flap your arms but it's no use. First the giant rabbit, then the giant pigeon and now this. If you don't sprout wings and fly yourself, you'd fall and splat. It was at this point that you were beginning to think that being in a pigeon's belly probably wasn't so bad. As you're screaming and falling down, you see the rest of the pigeon flock flying away, some with people in their talons. From the looks of it, they were much better off than you. All you can do is cross your fingers and hope something happens. At this point, you wouldn't mind if anyone bird showed up and grabbed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you fall down, down, down towards what awaits you below, you remember that at one point the pigeon was flying over the ocean, which meant you were falling towards a whole new part of the world that you had never seen up close and personal before. However, from where you are currently up in the sky, you can't quite see where you're going. But that all changes as you fall on a cloud bank and let out a yell. You burst through the clouds and look down to see that you were landed in an enormous...</span></div></div>",

No killing of the main character. He can be eaten, but not killed, which means coming out the other end is a must when eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. You can have a group of the same animal get huge, like 5 dogs, but not a mixture, IE 2 dogs and 4 cats. If you want another animal(s) grown, shrink the first ones and gorw the next ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. No short additions. Make it intresting.</td>",
