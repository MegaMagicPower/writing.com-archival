Unfortunately, in one of the sinister looking narrow alleyways, a masked robber was currently running away from a white anthropomorphic Labrador wearing nothing but a police hat, holding a portable radio device, tightly clutched in his right front-paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe burglar was panicking, sweat forming in his forehead, trying to get away from the police dog. It seemed to be working as he was steadily increasing the distance between him. Holding onto a suitcase full of money, he ran through the dark alleys and swerved at the barely visible obstacles that served as an obstacle for him as if he knew the streets well. Brian was still hot on his tail but the dog wasn't as quick as him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" the talking dog commanded, regretting the fact that he should've asked for a gun earlier, \"Seriously just stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's just rude Brian. We pay you to lock up prisoners!\" a response came from the intercom<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't talking to you Joe,\" Brian yelled into his portable intercom, \"I was obviously talking to the thief! He's getting away! Do something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Brian but we already dispatched all our units down at The Clam. Peter accidentally set fire to the entire bar... again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't we have a Firefighter's department in Quahog?\" Brian asked, clearly annoyed. The masked runaway hit the end of a T-junction and ran to the left side. Brian was slowly losing energy from the constant running but he still persevered on, determined on catching the petty criminal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way you're getting away from me like that time Demi Lovato deci-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time for Flashbacks!\" Joe ordered, \"Just catch him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Brian said, nodding quietly before disconnecting his communication with Joe, \"This is your last warning man... or woman. Hands up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robber didn't vocally respond to Brian's question but instead ran even faster, breaking into a full-on sprint, knowing he was only a couple of metres out to safety. Suddenly feeling exhausted, Brian stopped to catch his breath, fully aware that he's probably going to get away. Taking a few breaths in between, Brian could see the robber just barely out of sight. However, what happened in  the next few seconds put a smile on Brian's face as the would-be getaway was blocked and tackled by...</span></div></div>",

It is preferred that the story focuses on the 2nd person perspective whenever you, the main character, are the focus. 1st and 3rd person are welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Actual names given to 2nd person characters is better than (insert your name here), __________ blank spaces, and such. Just remove any direct references to the name if the character should remain nameless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.  The main character, you, can be either boy or girl. So, include that choice in some way before or once they're introduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. No macro/micro, transformation, \"love potion\" moments, et cetera... UNLESS they actually serve the plot in some way. Given how kooky some of the source material could be, it's better not to completely rule it all out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Sex is allowed. Just don't go insane; note the above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6.
