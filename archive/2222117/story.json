It was move in day for his first year at college, and he couldn't be more excited, other than at the size of his room. He barely fit through the door, and laying down on the bed his long legs and size 15 nikes were hanging off the mattress. His broad shoulders and muscled biceps made it difficult to squeeze through the door. However, being 6'5 and 245 lbs of muscle, he was used to being the biggest person in the room. His concerns about the size of the room were put aside when he saw his roommate come through the door, who was ____</span></div></div>",

Of course, he looked good. All the ladies (and guys) loved him. He had short cut blonde hair, sparkling blue eyes, a dazzling smile, and a strong jaw. All this was connected to a thick neck on broad shoulders, where both his 21\" biceps and chest threatened to rip his shirt at any time. Looking down towards his long torso was 6 pack abs, a dirty blonde happy trail leading to his 9\" cock, with long legs and feet that barely fit the length of the bathroom. His self admiration was interrupted as he heard a box drop in the main room - his roommate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad exited the bathroom and met his roommate who was putting boxes down, who reached out to shake his hand.<br>\r\n\"What's up man? I'm Noah\" he said. Noah was also good looking. He was probably around 6'3-6'4, and well muscled with long brown hair and thick eyesbrows. He had a similar build, not as muscled as Brad, but definitely someone he could work out with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two began unpacking their belongings, bonding over playing football and seeking out frats for the year. Brad felt like Noah was definitely a guy he could become friends with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter unpacking everything, the boys hopped on their beds, which creaked under their weight. <br>\r\n\"Jeez, you think these come any bigger?\" Noah complained, also having too long legs to fit the bed and broad shoulders fit the width. <br>\r\n\"They better, I barely fit in anything in this dorm.\" Brad said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this is what we get for looking this good and being big guys.\" Noah joked.<br>\r\n\"Hey, you up for something to eat?\" Brad asked, realizing now how hungry he was.<br>\r\n\"Always, man.\" Noah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad and Noah were lucky enough to have a 24 hour McDonald's right next to their dormhall, something envied by the other dorm halls. The guys jumped down the stairs to head to the McDonalds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two guys were really hungry after setting up their dorm room all day. But, ____ ordered more food.</span></div></div>",

The track and field season had just ended and already he was taking full advantage of the extra time. At least he thought he was. His roommates, Tyler and Phil, often argued he was wasting it all sleeping. He didn't care though. It wasn't like he really needed any to exercise. He also didn't need a job because his sports scholarship covered all his tuition, which being a senior this year he didn't need to worry about it after this, and his parents supplied him with a generous allowance that covered room and board in the apartment.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Still, it was after 1 so it was probably time to get up, if for no other reason than to get something to eat.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sleeping Beauty is finally awake! Did you send him a kiss with that wake up call Tyler?\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phil dodged a stale bagel Tyler threw at him which Zack picked up as he reached the base of the stairs and bit right into.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's stale.\" He mumbled through a full mouth.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And dirty. It's five days old and you left it out on the counter, so I'm not surprised it's stale.\" Tyler informed him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Zack shrugged and continued chowing down on the bagel.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Have any plans Zack?\" Phil asked as he plopped onto the couch and staring at the TV screen.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah. Enjoy my free time. Don't you have to get to work Phil?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Zack stuck his tongue out at Phil's scowling reflection in the TV.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Come on Phil. Let's get out of here. Zack, try not to eat everything while we're gone.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two headed out, leaving Zack alone on the couch. The moment he heard the door click, he pulled his laptop off the lamp stand and pulled up Pizza Hut. Typing in his account info, he ordered two large stuffed crust meat lovers pizza. His favorite. And now he could indulge since there was no need to restrict his diet and he didn't need to share if he could finish them before Tyler and Phil got back.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Half an hour later, the doorbell rang. Still in his boxers, he ran to get his pizzas, startling the delivery girl with his appearance.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Time to really start enjoying myself!\" He grinned as he dug into the first slice.</span></div></div>",
