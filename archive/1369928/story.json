Why do you ask?\" The guy then said \"you should just give up. No one in town has beaten the gym leader except for one person.\" I reply \"Well then. You're looking at the second guy who going to beat your gym leader!\" I ran before he could finish his next statement. I saw this big gym and I said \"So this is a gym.

His next pokemon was onix but I wasn't scared. He commented that he's hasn't had a fight like this since that one trainer came. Despite the fact that charamander was about to faint, it defeated the Onix with the last bit of his energy. I mentioned I had a pikachu I hadn't used for the match and he handed me the boulder badge.

I told the police that team rocket was here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police told me that team rocket is an evil organization that uses pokemon for evil purposes. I kept them in mind and left.

I'll have to train hard so I can keep up!\" I went to the Cerulean city gym and fought Misty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was tough but I won with the help of my pikachu.

Ninetales used flamethrower and Charmander managed to avoid a serious hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber covered Charmander with razor leaf but it did little damage.

I then attacked with Charmander and hit it with metal claw but ninetales let itself get hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinetales then hit Charmander with a flamethrower followed by a quick attack.

You win some you lose some. It's just that simple.\" I then said \"I guess that's reasonable.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman then says \"I've got something for you.\" The woman hands Amber a pokeball.

I then realized that the haunter was a distraction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought (That jerk! He must have had his partner use sand attack on pikachu when I wasn't looking!) I then said \"Pikachu! Get the sand out of your eyes!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu was trying hard to get the sand it had in it's eyes but it was hard to do that and move at the same time. Amber covered me with vine whip and razor leaf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then took my attention back to the haunter that hasn't reappeared. I then saw  Haunter behind Amber again but this time, I said \"Pikachu! Come to me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu picked up on my voice and ran to me and then I grabbed him and threw him in amber's direction. Amber realized what I was doing and jump to the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then said \"Use thunder wave!\" pikachu then used an electric field and hit the haunter. Haunter couldn't move then and then I said \"Pikachu! Use thunder shock all around you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu then hit Haunter with amazing damage.

Use Thunder shock!\" Pikachu managed to hit the evasive Murkrow and defeat it in one shot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Haunter came out of no where and nailed me in the back of the head. Amber saw me fall and said \"Bulbasaur cover me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber ran to my side as Bulbasaur fended off the enemy. I could barely see her as she begged me to stay awake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to stay awake but then I see the female grunt try to attack Amber and said \"Watch out!\" I pushed her out of the way again and I took the hit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't remember much after that.

The Pikachu doesn't seem too happy at the moment though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your hard work working your way around the natural maze you finally reach Pewter City. It's getting rather dark so you decide to find a Pok\u00e9mon Centre and to rest both you and your Pok\u00e9mon. You soon find one and go inside to heal your Pok\u00e9mon. While waiting you find Amber who is also staying at the Pok\u00e9mon centre. You walk towards Amber and greet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Amber!\" you greet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey there. Are you here to challenge the Gym tomorrow?\" Amber asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, probably. I just caught a Pikachu.\" you reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I caught one too... but it's very shy.\" Amber gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's both get our Pikachus out and lets see how they react.\" you suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! Let's try!\" agreed Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Amber both send out your Pikachu and immediately they start interacting. A few minutes later you see that they are playing with each other and enjoying themselves. You let them play for a while while you and Amber eat, shower, toothbrush and dress up in your pyjamas getting ready to fall asleep on the 2nd floor (Which was basically like a mini hotel) of the centre. You then call back your Pikachu readying to go to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to the Museum tomorrow. You want to come?\" asks Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reply...</span></div></div>",

You check your watch to see the current time; 10:04am. Luckily you have brought your backpack that your mum gave you before you actually officially left your hometown. You've got your water bottle, pok\u00e9balls, and wallet with precisely enough money to survive for a week. You and Amber then step in, starting the day off. You are instantly greeted by a middle-aged man in a brown suit looking like one of the officials in the museum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the Pewter City Museum of Science. It's 100 Pok\u00e9-Dollars for 2 all-day child tickets to the museum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Amber.

The space exhibit and the fossil exhibit. Which one do you want to see first?</span></div></div>",

Seeing an image of a Venusaur powering up a ground shaking hyper beam and immediately decide that a balbasaur was the perfect starter for you. You quickly grab it and the pokedex next to it. Then walk back to where the others are standing.<br>\r\nThe next girl was called over and she picked a Squirtle. Right after she picked the squirtle you heard Zach scream out in joy. He said \u201cyes\u2026 I get the coolest of the three both of you can suck it now.\u201d After he grabbed his and got back in line oak told them that if they need any help or are looking for some field work to give him a call and he would be happy to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he finished speaking Zach started to leave as fast as he could barely saying thanks for the Pok\u00e9mon. You and the girl patently thank oak and then walk out of his lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce out the girl looks over at you and says \u201cman that guy was so rude\u2026my name is Lisa\u201d you tell her that your name was Ryu and agree that he was really rude.<br>\r\nShe looked a little nervous now and asked \u201cI know we just met Ryu but I think it would be a good idea to travel with someone right now, would you like to form a team with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou  thought about it for a second and decide\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Okay, picture this. You're a kid living a simple life in a small town off the westernmost coast of the Kanto region. While it may not look like much, this small town isn't as a grand as Saffron's tallest buildings or Vermilion City's gorgeous ports, but it still holds significance. For one, it is home to one of Kanto's proudest residents and revered champion the world over. His name is...Samuel Oak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis powerful ball of charisma used to be a champion of Kanto's Elite 4 Branch, but as a devoted educator, he retired from his position and went on to the studying of human and pokemon interaction. He went on to become a Professor as a profession. Don't believe me? Well, as much as I would love to go on and on and exploit an engaging backstory, this is a story about a trainer who wants to follow in his foosteps. Actually, two! This is our story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, there's me. My name is Jack Ashton, one of the professor's prized student. As a human being, I am inspired to make my mark on the world and become famous. Then there's his grandson, Gareth Oak, the self-proclaimed prodigy of the Oak family. We were friends at one time, but as we got older, Gary became cocky and arrogant, pulling supremacy over me, taunting my less than interesting lifestyle. Knowing he did it in good fun, we became competitive rivals ever since. And today of all days, is the day we both are given a starter Pokemon under the guidance of the good professor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of my room, I told my mom I was heading to the lab, to which she responds, \"Of course! All boys leave home someday. It said so on TV. PROF. OAK next door was looking for you!\" At this point, I thought she was reading that out of a card. Anyways, I head to his house, until his granddaughter, the gorgeous Daisy Oak, points me to the open field leading out of Pallet Town, where I saw the Professor block the road. He walks up to me, warning me of wild Pokemon before leading me back to the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe head inside when Gareth greeted me, \"Well, if it isn't Jack? Gramps, you're finally here!\" before turning to his grandfather, \"I was fed up with waiting! Where were you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring his grandson's question, the Professor congratulates us as diplomats before reaching the table. He turned to us, saying, \"Here, boys! There are three Pokemon here! They are held inside these Poke Balls.\" At this point, he summarizes his entire life before permitting us to take any Pokemon we want!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh! I already know which one I want. I'll let Jack pick first!\" Gary retorts. Without missing a beat, I approached the desk with the 3 Poke Balls. These Pokemon are so cool! But, which one should I choose as my starter? First, there's Bulbasaur. He's a great supporter and a strong grass type. Not many trainers start off with them. Then there's Squirtle. A sturdy tank and a great water type. Finally, there's Charmander. He's quite popular with newcomers, bearing power and searing fire type moves. They're so cool, but I don't know which...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Just pick a Pokemon already!\" Gary and the professor snap. Finally out of my stupor like a drooling Mankey, I decided to choose...</span></div></div>",

After coming out of his stupor like a drooling Mankey, Jack approached Squir...tle? What?! I bid my rage inwardly, not showing any signs of aggression. How could he choose the Pokemon I want? Either way, it was my turn after showing courtesy to my lesser rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoosing my starter would've been hard hadn't Jack sto...taken my targeted choice. But I didn't waste any time choosing Bulbasaur. \"I'll take this Pokemon, then.\" As Jack was leaving, I want to up and challenge him right then and there, but I waited until we were outside to proclaim, \"Wait, Jack! Let's check out our Pokemon! Come on! I'll take you on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur first battle was less than eventful, our Pokemon just colliding back and forth like Unovan football players. I think most of the townsfolk were cheering me on. Jack was having the upper hand, his Squirtle wagging its taunting tail to ire Bulbasaur. I shouted Bulbasaur not to attack, allowing Squirtle an opening offensive. I flinched. Me and my big mouth. But just as we were clinging to the edge of the match, something unexpected happened. Through sheer tenacity, Bulbasaur learned Leech Seed. Launching the seedling against Squirtle's hard shell, stems of vines grew rapidly, wrapping itself against Squirtle's body. As Bulbasaur regain some of its health, we went in for a finishing blow, claiming victory of our first rival battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as I wanted to jump with excitement, I kept myself grounded. I had a lot of work to do with Bulbasaur before we could engage in future Pokemon battles. \"Okay! I'll make my Pokemon battle more to toughen it up. Jack! Gramps! Smell you later!\" I didn't know where that come from, but I hope that doesn't become a running gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing through Kanto Route 01, I arrived in Viridian City in less than an hour...actually, four hours if you were ambushed by a pack of wild Mankeys. Just after getting my Bulbasaur fixed in the Pokemon Center from all that wild Pokemon battling, I stopped by the Poke Mart to buy some Poke Balls, but as I checked my backpack, I realized that I had forgotten my trainer's allowance back home. Shoot! I knew I was gonna need to travel back to Pallet Town anyways, waste of my time, but I wanted to pick up something grandpa had ask me earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI asked the receptionist of my grandpa's delivery, until he exclaims that he didn't have it. \"What? What do you mean you don't have it?!\" The receptionist flinched at my retort, before exclaiming that someone had already taken it! Was Jack here? I hurried back to the open field before I saw a wild Primeape wreaking havoc around town. Seeing a pack of wild bruised Mankeys behind it left me with a pang of guilt for these people, but as I approached, a battalion of trainers approached the thrashing beast. They looked like they had it all under control, giving me enough time to get back home, but...</span></div></div>",

Citizens are sheltering in their homes, as more than a dozen trainers are attempting to tame the wild beast. The local police has evacuated most of the denizens off the streets...\" Watching the Kanto News Network covering these attacks was too much for the old professor, and yet, he couldn't turn off his TV after seeing his grandson among the group of trainers. But it wasn't his grandson's appearance that had drawn his attention, as the Bulbasaur he had raised from an egg has grown quite strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm...\" The professor blinked, turning to meet Jack's view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Jack! How is my old Pokemon?\" Jack nudged Squirtle forward, the Pokemon greeting the good professor with a smile. \"Well, it seems to be growing more attached to you. You must be skilled as a Pokemon trainer.\" Jack grinned happily, before fidgeting with his backpack, taking out an important package. \"What's that? You have something for me?\" Jack hands the delivered package to the professor. \"Ah! It's the custom Poke Ball I ordered. Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he opened the package, the door opens. \"Gramps!\" Professor Oak and Jack turn to the voice. \"Gramps, my Pokemon has grown stronger! Check it out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! I saw your feat on TV. And what good timing! I needed to ask both of you to do something for me.\" Professor Oak led us to his work desk, two handhelds laying there. \"On the desk here are my invention, PC Tech approved, the Pokedex. It is a portable device that records data on Pokemon you've seen or caught. It's a high tech encyclopedia.\" He turns to us. \"During my youth, I wanted to make a complete guide on all the Pokemon in the world. It was my dream. But back then, we didn't have these devices. And I've reached the age I can't get the job done. As my personal students, I want you two to fulfill my dream. Jack and Gary. Take these with you!\" Professor Oak hands them the Pokedex. Gary and Jack respond in gratitude. \"You two are among the first trainers to use these devices. This is a great undertaking in Pokemon history. So get going, you two! Your adventure starts now!\" Gary and Jack jump with victorious ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, be sure to stop by the Poke Mart to buy Poke Balls. You can't get fully detailed data on Pokemon by just seeing them. You must catch them to obtain individual data. I'd have given you two Poke Balls, but...\" The Professor nervously finished, both trainers deadpanning at his remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, noted! Alright, gramps. Leave it all to me.\" Jack double-takes at Gary's remarks. \"Heh! No need to get all hot, Jack. You won't be necessary for this, given your attention span. Besides, you'll get lost in the big bad world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack turned away, frowning, \"You're right! I'll just borrow a map from your sister!\" After that sass, Jack makes a mad dash for the door, with Gary right behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both boys leave the lab behind them, Professor Oak giggled to himself, sighing in reminisce, \"Jack Ashton, my faithful student. Always headstrong with a kind heart. I've watched him grow to a fine lad, but he is quite naive, less attentive. Sometimes he can be a bit careless. I can only imagine his path won't be easy, but it will lead him to great friends along the way. And Gary, my grandson. You're quite smart, tenacious and brave, but sometimes, you can be too cocky for your own good. You're never one to back down from a fight, always striving to win. It's no wonder you want to live up to our family name. But what keeps me connected to them, it's their rivalry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Oak began to recap their relationship, \"Jack has always resented Gary's popularity in town, always striving for the same level of respect. Not just from the world, but from Gary as well. And Gary resents how much Jack is stronger than him, never giving his rival the recognition he oh so desires. The depth of the drama these two bear against one another can be a blessing, but it can also be dangerous! How will they fare? How will the world record their journeys, struggles and views on the path to victory?\"</span></div></div>",

We own everything to you and your friends.\u201d She pauses for a second before asking, \u201c...but you know now that your role has ended, don\u2019t you?\u201d I look away from her eyes, crestfallen. I have to leave the world and the Pokemon I had come to call friends. Fighting the urge not to cry, I nodded in response. \u201cWorld building falls into their hands now. Soon, you must return to your world. You still have time to bid farewell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...can\u2019t! I just can\u2019t!\u201d I retort in response, wanting nothing more than to spare their feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf that is what you want, I won\u2019t stop you.\u201d Gardevoir fades away. My body shimmers, as it gradually becomes lighter, no longer tied to the ground beneath my feet. I could feel my own being caressed in the wind\u2019s embrace before I heard a voice behind me speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Cyndaquil.\u201d Chikorita and Riolu call out, the ladder with the first response, \u201cSnubbull is getting a party started to celebrate our success\u2026\u201d They gasp, surprised of my shimmering body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-Cyndaquil!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY...Your body! What\u2019s happening to you?!\u201d Chikorita chimes with fright before I could speak. I could only down, depressed that they see me like this. I have to explain things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI brought my head up to their eye levels before speaking, \u201cRii...Cheeks! I\u2019m sorry. I have to leave you now! I\u2019m going back...back to the human world...where I belong.\u201d Sadness reach their surprised gasps. I could swear Riolu turned away to cry his eyes out. \u201cPlease...don\u2019t tell everyone about this. I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d I struggled to speak, trembling with my voice, \u201cI don\u2019t want them to worry!\u201d Chikorita\u2019s whine breaks me in tears, but it was his hug that stung me into audible bawls. I whisper my apologies before my body ascended, caressed by the wind\u2019s embrace. Our saddened eyes met, before my soul skyrockets into the heavens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\nI struggled to voice out any rebellion. All I can of now is the people back in the world I once knew. I materialised in full, expecting to be a full fleshed human. Sadly, that was not the case when I saw my reflection. Assessing my situation, I find myself not in a town or a city, but in an open field of grass filled with Pokemon. Before I motion my body to move, I hear a rustle in grass.

Anywho, I currently live in Twinleaf town in the Sinnoh region. I'm the middle child in the family, I have a younger brother and an older sister that I never meet before, all my parents will tell me is that she is some sort of amazing trainer and researcher somwehere in this region. Now before I we get this story on the road, there are a few things you should know about my family. At least half of us have some sort of ability that was passed down from a ansesstor, my brother and I were no exeption, apparently my sister was thou. Anyway, I'm a fairly unique case, because Ihave a power that no one in our family has ever had before, an unusually high ability to manipulate my aura. Add that with the color and most poeple shun within a few minutes of meeting me. My brother was fast, I'm not talking the flash fast, but inhumanly fast, know what I mean? I doen't want to bore you any more with myself, so I'm going to ask you 1 question...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you coming along or not?</span></div></div>",

Read carefully, you never know when a clue may be given. Good luck to all!!!)<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________ (Derek's POV)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was eating my breakfast in the kitchen, when my dad leaned in and asked if I could go and wake up Zack, my older brother. My jaw dropped at that question. \"Are you insane!? Do you know what he'll do to me if I wake him up this early? I like to piss him off yeah, but I know my boundaries. One of which is never wake him up early, especially on his birthday.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad just shrugged and turned away. \"I know just tell him that I sent you and to meet me in my office after he eats breakfast. Oh, tell Zeke, and Luke too, please.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" I said as I rolled my eyes and finished my breakfast. I put my dishes in the dishes washer and headed up to my brothers room, which was conveniently decorated with \"Do not disturb\" and \"Keep out\" signs. I was about to open the door when a voice behind me scared the ever living hell out of me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Derek, what the hell are you doing?\" The voice said. I turned around quickly and saw a Shiny Zoroark behind me and giving a questioning expression. His name was Zeke. He came here as a shiny Zoroa with my mom when she moved to Sinnoh from the Unova region. By the time I was born, he had already evolved into the beast he is today and he had already become great friends with Zack and Luke, our Lucario. He can speak English, because mom taught him after he evolved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God dammit Zeke! You know I hate it when you do that.\" I said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smirked then answered with and amused tone in his voice. \"I know, That's why I love doing it. Anyway, you didn't answer my question. Why were you about to go into Zack's room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that. Dad wanted me to wake up Zack so he could she him in his office after breakfast. He wanted to see you and Luke too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you let me tell him then? He won't want to rip me in half if I wake him up. You on the other hand...\" He cringed \"I not so sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, I didn't even want to wake him up in the first place.\" I said as I speed down stairs and into the living room in a matter of seconds. Then I plop down and turn on some cartoons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-(POV change to Zeke)-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Never stops amazing me how fast that kid can move. Aw well, better wake them up.' Now when I say 'them' I mean Zack and Luke. They share Zack's room and his bed. They practically do everything together. So it wasn't that surprising when they started sharing the bed. I opened to door and walked in. Zack's room was average sized with dark blue walls and black furniture. He had a large flat screen on the right wall across from his bed with an Xbox 360 and PS3 in an entertainment center underneath. There was a desk with a computer on the far wall and a dresser next to it. I looked at the bed and saw Zack, and Luke sleeping peacefully. I grinned widely. 'Oh, this will be fun'. I walk up to the bed and lean down over Zack and place my mouth near his ear. \"Oh Zack... It's time to WAKE UP!!!!\" I yelled as he sprang up startled. Luke was a different case, he just opened his eyes and gave me a death glare. Zack looked around frantically as if unsure where he was. When he saw me he looked at the clock on the side of the bed then flopped back down in the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, it is waay to early to be waking me up. 9 o'clock minimum. Now go away and leave me alone to sleep.\" He rolled over away from me and snuggled into Luke a bit, which I found absolutely adorable, and tried to go back to sleep. Luke, still giving me a death glare, nodded in agreement, closed his eyes and unconsciously, at least in my mind, wrapped an arm around Zack and pulled him a bit closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry bud, wish I could but it's time to get up.\" I grabbed his shoulders and dragged him up and out of bed, placing him before me. He groaned in protest but walked over to his dresser and got dressed. the end result was a red t-shirt, black jeans, his black and white running shoes, and the cross his Ex had given him before he moved away. He then went over to the bed and and got Luke to get up as well. He was one of the few people that could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why in the hell did you wake me up this early in the morning?\" He asked slightly irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"According to your  brother, who was about to wake you up himself, Your dad wants to see you, me and Luke in his office when your done eating breakfast. Oh and Happy Birthday.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K, thanks Zeke.\" He said as he scratched me behind the ears and walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does Mark want to talk to us, do you know?\" Luke asked as he stood beside me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No clue what so ever. Aw well, we're going to find out soon right?\" I said as I walked out followed by Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Absentmindily, we walked over and grabbed some pokefood and sat on either side of him. He smiled and gave us both a pat on the head and started eating hus own breakfast that had just been brought over by the tendrils. After we finished eating,  we put our dishes away before going back upstairs to Mark's study. Zack knocked on the door once and walked in. Mark wasat his desk doing some paper work for something or other. When we walked in he looked up and gave us a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are! I was wondering when you boys were goung to get here.\" He said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah. So, why did you want to see us?\" Zack asked with a slight cock of the head. Mark smiled a bit wider and pulled open a drawr on his desk and he pulled out two items. One was a brand new backpack and the other was little machine of some sort, and when Zack saw it his eyes lit up and a huge smile broke across his face \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, go get packed bud, you are foing on a journey. And you two,\"He he turned to me and Luke\" are going with him.\" All our faces lit up and we sped out of the room followed by the hearty laugh of Zacks dad.</span></div></div>",

He looked back down at his now stuffed backpack, filled with anything he could need and still room for anything new. Next to it was his favorite coat and the pok\u00e9's pok\u00e9balls. He quickly pocketed the balls and put on his coat, shouldering his back pack. Zack left his room after giving it one last look over and closed the door. He paused for a moment and just let it all sink in. He was finally going on a journey! Not just that, but with his two best friends since, like, forever! He was pulled out of his thoughts by a paw on his shoulder, causing him to jump. \"Holy!\" *he looked over and found Luke giving him a look of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Are you alright Zack?\"</i> he asked. <i>\"You looked like you spaced out there.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah I'm fine bud. I'm just letting it all sink in.\" When he saw Luke cock his head in the way that meant he was confused, he continued. \"I mean, I'm finally going on a journey. And not only that  but with you AND Zeke.\" He smile and ruffled Luke's head fur a bit, before walking downstairs to be greeted by his family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother, Jen, a short women, but only a few inches shorter then him, with bright yellow blonde hair and green eyes. She was a part time nurse at the local human hospital, it helps that her \"inherit power\" was being able to access any wound and know exactly what to do to heal it. She refuses to become a full time doctor to be home with the family. She is kind hearted and understanding (which is why she was the one he went to first to tell that he was Gay) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis father, a tall man with an average build. He has paler skin and brown hair that started to grey at the ends, but the most startling feature was the pair of bright gold eyes that danced with joy and playfulness. He worked as the head of a local home supply warehouse, anything needs to build or furnish a house could be found there. He works at home most days but has to go the warehouse occasionally to check up on things personally. He himself was also an exception like Zack older sister, not having an inherit power. He was fun loving and out going, always looking for something fun to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, his little brother. He was a tall kid for his age, tanner skin from mom and brown hair from dad. His eyes were green as well, but a darker almost evergreen. He was mischievous and annoying, but he knew his limits. Zack smiled at his family as he reached the foot of the stairs and put down his bag. He walked over and hugged his mother tightly, who happily returned it. \"I'm so happy that you can finally go on your journey, it's all you ever talked about! Now you can go and fulfill your dream bud.\" She smiled and kissed his cheek \"But I'm gonna miss you. It's going to be a bit harder to make the meals without a few extra \"hands\" to help out in the kitchen.\" They laughed and Zack turned to his father. He had on his usual smile as he held out a hand. When Zack grasped it he was pulled into a hug with a few added back slaps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll do great out there kid! I'll be sure to watch your battles when you enter any tournaments or when you win the league!\" He laughed as he embraced his grinning son. Zack thanked him and turned to look down at his little brother. He was a mix of happily and sad shooting across his face at the same time. Zack smiled and they preformed their secret handshake and ruffling his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it will be hard, but try to stay out of trouble will you? We won't be here to pull your ass out of the fire if you get in trouble ok?\" Zack asked as he his brother huffed and nodded. Zack chuckled as he looked over his shoulder to see Zeke smiling as he leaned against the door frame to the living room. He stood up and his eyes shined for a moment as he made himself look like an older teen, lean and toned with nicely tanned skin and golden eyes. His hair was long purple toned , the occasional rustic red steak here and there tied at the end with a bright gold bead. He wore mostly grey clothes with his jacket shoulders matching the color of his \"highlights\" while his nails were painted to match his hair. He walked over and explained the transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Less attention will be drawn by this form then by a shiny Zoroark in Sinnoh.\" He chuckled and went to stand by the door with Luke, after grabbing a duffle bag from Zack's dad, later explained to be a tent for three and sleeping bags. Zack walked over with them and turned back to the family with a broad grin. He gave everyone one last hug, even his little brother who immediately returned it, clinging onto him a bit. He chuckled and pat his head he gave his mom and hug and a kiss on the cheek. He went over to his dad and gave him a firm hand shake, his father's eyes shining with pride as he went over and took up his bag again from Luke, who had grabbed it on the way by. He did one last look over of all his stuff and smiled, saying his final goodbyes and walked out with his partners. He stopped at the end of his yard and looked back, remembering all that had gone on in the house and adjusted his bag and they headed down the road, heading for prof. Rowan's lab to get his badge case. He looked up into the sky as they walked, thinking of all the things that could happen during their journey. He then looked back down and between that two Pok\u00e9mon at his sides. He grinned and wrapped an arm around both of them and pulling them close to them as they laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be the start of a great adventure</span></div></div>",

I hope to see stories of adventure and romance from you amazing minds full of stories! I find that some people need to let go of limitations and today, I'm going to do just that so I'll allow the use of other pokemon from other regions but if you plan to do that, you should explain a little history behind how the trainer and the pokemon met. It's not a requirement but it would be nice so think about it. Anyways, as professor oak says \"Welcome to the world of pokemon!\" </td>",
