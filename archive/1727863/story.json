There's a package addressed to you... which is odd, because you didn't order anything. You go inside and open the package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's inside is a strange black box and a small book that seems to contain instructions. Reading them over, you have to admit it sounds unbelievable, but it seems simple enough to test. It says that if you put a picture of a fictional girl inside and close the lid, the box creates a figurine of the girl. Then there's a lot of other instructions, but testing the thing comes first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you have any fictional girls in mind? If so, what piece of fiction are they from?</span></div></div>",

So, you went online, printed out a picture of Mikoto, and put it in the box and closed the lid. You waited three seconds, not sure if you wanted to know if it was real, and then opened the lid. Inside was a perfect, 3\" tall figurine of Mikoto in a casual pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReferencing the instructions, you decided the next thing to do was to give it a command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou removed the figurine, set it on the computer desk, and said, \"Mikoto Misaka, grow three inches and maintain current proportions.\" The figurine grew to 6\u201d, and then\u2026 started moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt yawned, stretched its arms over its head, and said something in Japanese, which you didn\u2019t understand. Then it spotted you and clearly became afraid of the towering person looking at it with an expression of disbelief, although it\u2026 no, she did a pretty good job of covering it up and started shouting what it didn\u2019t take a Japanese speaker to figure out was a string of threats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMikoto Misaka, speak English,\u201d you ordered simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell, you moron!?\u201d Mikoto yelled at you. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I can just speak English at the drop of a hat, you know!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing it right now,\u201d you observed.\u2019\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I said, there\u2019s no way that I\u2026 I\u2026 huh?\u201d Mikoto trailed off as she became conscious of the words she was speaking. \u201cI\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook,\u201d you said. \u201cI don\u2019t mean you any harm, and you\u2019re powerless to resist even if I do. So would it be too much for you to ask to calm down and accept your fate?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell yeah it is!\u201d Mikoto yelled. She started running at you, and then she made a flying leap off the desk right at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMikoto Misaka, hold current position,\u201d you said while she was in the middle of her jump, and she froze in place \u2013 literally! She was suspended in the air, in blatant defiance of gravity. She looked around, and down, and realized she wasn\u2019t going anywhere. \u201cSee?\u201d you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you let me down from here?\u201d Mikoto asked meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d you said. \u201cMikoto Misaka, return to the table.\u201d Mikoto immediately reversed her trajectory and returned to the edge of the desk. \u201cNow, I basically have full power when it comes to you. Understand? So I want to know how you\u2019d like your body changed, just so you can\u2019t cry foul over my not asking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Mikoto thought.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a slight pause in your search when you came across a particular female ninja, a well known one at that. The image you had stumbled across was that of Hinata Hyuga, the shy black haired girl with a crush on the main character, Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow unlike most guys who would probably jump at the chance to pick out the hottest babe in anime for their own perverted pleasures, you wanted to choose Hinata as a test subject for different reasons. You weren't going to fool yourself, you were very curious as to the powers behind the box and if they were true or not. But there was one big reason why you wanted to choose Hinata. You felt like she and you were relatable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone at one point in their life could base the craziness in their daily routines to a show or an anime. Admittedly, you probably wouldn't be a very good main character. You were quiet and often didn't like speaking unless you had something important to say, your parents have often considered you to be shy and you just sort of ran with it. Maybe you didn't stutter like Hinata did or get easily embarrassed, but you were definitely a very quiet person. Considering most of your friends were talkative and blabbly, you were usually the black sheep of the group. In a sense, you felt similar to Hinata but there was one key point in how both of you differed in terms of personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had her heart set on someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason you had thought your life was relatable to a drama was because of after one particular case concerning a girl from school, Amelia. You didn't care much for girls, though your parents didn't think much of it. You were sixteen, there was still time to be dating, plenty of time in college you figured. But this one girl, Amelia...She struck you as different from everyone else. Sure, you had had crushes, most of them you were too chicken to do anything about. But you felt... different around Amelia. The last time you tried to do some deep thinking about the feeling you had for her, you ended up in tears in front of a YouTube Linkin Park music video... That was down-right embarrassing and you didn't want to try it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you couldn't shake that one feeling. It was nagging you, even now which was months later. You couldn't talk to your friends about it, they all knew and talked to Amelia. If you discussed this sort of thing with them A.) You wouldn't hear the end of it, B.) They'd tell Amelia, and C.) The feeling might go away. If you talked with your parents, they'd probably tell you to stop being such a pussy and talk to the girl. It was strange, you wanted to have this feeling for her yet you didn't know what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is why you wanted to test this on Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis shy little girl who seemed a lot like you. A miniature therapist. Another you who you could physically converse with. Maybe you were just crazy to even try something like this, maybe your parents were right and you were being too much of weakling about this. But you had a \"magic box\" that needed testing and questions that needed to be answered. And as is said about many of the greatest strides in humanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the hell not?\"</span></div></div>",

Someone who was closer to your age and could maybe see things in a better light than a younger person could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was decided, you were going to bring to life a Hinata that was your age from Shippuden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarrowing your search on Google even further with the words \"Hinata Shippuden\", coming up with the perfect full body picture of her in her older form. Once you were satisfied, you printed it out and set it square folded in the small black box. Everything was in order, all you had to do was close the lid and wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathed in sharply as you opened the box not sure what you were going to find. It can as a relief when you discovered that the picture was gone and in its place was the most perfectly accurate three inch figure of Hinata Hyuga in an idle pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\" You almost didn't expect it to work, a cruel joke placed on you by some strangers for a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut here she was, well a figurine of her anyway. Hinata the shy ninja, a character you could most relate to. Perhaps a stronger friend than any of your real friends at school, someone with answers for you in this crazy time of your life. The only problem was she didn't appear to be moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, you took another look at the instructions. Apparently, you had to speak every specific command for the magic to work. You thanked god that you were in the privacy of your room with your parents out, else you might have been embarrassed for speaking such odd things aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Hinata,\" you decided to start simple first. \"Awaken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jolted in your seat as the tiny figurine's eyes suddenly blinked a few eyes and watched as the small toy rose from the bottom of the box and stretched. The Hinata figure looked around a bit and seemed confused judging by how she muttered to herself. Because she was so small, you couldn't really make out the words but somehow you detected they were Japanese. It made sense, considering the origin of the character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were going to have to fix that if you wanted to set things right. \"Hinata, speak English please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly took notice to you and looked up at your towering form, eyes widened.

You still couldn't make out most of them, but you could tell they were definitely in English now and certainly sounded panicked. She stared up at you with big wide eyes and fell backwards right on her small bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Hinata, speak up please so I can hear you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-hat are y-you!? W-What do you want from me!? W-Why is everything so big!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly decided that asking to hear her was a big mistake and covered your ears. \"Hinata, please be quiet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's mouth was still moving but no words were coming out, she grabbed her throat in shock and looked more freaked out then ever. This was getting you absolutely no where fast. Slowly, but surely, you were understanding just how powerful this box was and how specific you were going to have to be with the commands. You decided to try your luck again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Hinata. Just calm down please. Stop. Don't freak out. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny girl took a deep breath and nodded her head. You sighed in relief. \"Alright, now you can speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still trying to come to grips with what was going on, but at least now she didn't appear as frightened as she was before. Her first question was a simple one. \"W-Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who am I?\" you repeated, not quite sure where to begin. \"Um, my name is Nick. I'm just a normal sixteen year old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Are you a g-giant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? Nah, I mean, I guess I am pretty tall for someone my age but I'm not a giant. I guess it doesn't feel that way considering how tall you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I don't quite know how to explain this to you other than the basic facts because I'm not entirely sure how things work myself. For starters, I'm not a giant. You're just around three inches tall so I guess I do seem like a giant to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-Three inches tall!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus began the long tedious process of explaining everything to the shrunken Hinata, well maybe not everything. You didn't want to explain to her why you 'summoned' her to your world, but you did want to at least give a vivid clarification to her so she'd calm down more, it didn't seem fair for you to keep using the commands against her. She didn't seem to keen on the idea of complete control over her either, she shuddered when you mentioned the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You wouldn't abuse that power, would you N-Nick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed at the thought of it, it had crossed your mind but deep down you weren't that kind of person. \"Don't be silly, of course not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed a little bit more relieved now and relaxed as you answered the remainder of her questions including where she was, how she got there, how you knew her, and who you were. She seemed slightly interested in everything but was still clearly shaken. You reasoned that she probably still felt very small, using the power of the box you could probably up her height a little bit and get her to be more comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, Hinata, would you want me to make you a little taller? I think with the box I can do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata nodded quite calmly but you saw the eagerness in her face. So far she hadn't said much about herself, maybe if you rewarded her with a boost she'd open up a little more not that she was ever vocal in the Naruto series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty then, Hinata grow to...\"</span></div></div>",

Did the box make a noise when it created a figure like a microwave or did he have to know how long it would take for the box to make them and then remove it. It was all over his head, however after a five minute wait he decided to take a peek and slowly opening the lid of the box there he saw laying on it's back was a figure of Miranda Lawson in her white outfit from the mass effect 2 game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly he picked the figure up and looked at it. It was very well made and look quite real, even the figure face felt real. Still this was weird and so placing the Miranda figure on his computer table laying down with her arms beside her and her legs in stretched out in front. Nick then went back to the box to see if there was anything else he was suppose to do only then to hear a grunt coming from the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly turn around with box in hand and to his surprise the Miranda figure got to her fee rubbing her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arr. Where am I?\" Miranda said aloud thinking she had landed on some strange planet. It was then Nick slowly moved towards her catch her attention did she jump back before shouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop right where you are!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at that Nick did. He was only a few centimetres away from her and to Miranda he looked to be a huge giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a officer of Cerberus I demand to know where and am and how I got here?\" she says sounding as tough as she did in the games. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick didn't really know what to say, but he guess first he should say he comes in peace before beginning to explain about the box and how it works. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Miranda said taking it all in. \"So you managed to create me in your world and now even through I retain my personality and clothes, you have powers to control me yes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick nodded realising how bad that made him sound. It was then Miranda asked him what he purpose was to do with the box? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me as a man with all that power, what do you plan to do with it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick however didn't really know how to answer after all he could use it the box for so many things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could create himself an army of video game women who could help him and perhaps the world or he could misuse it. After all, Nick wasn't thick and after his recent mess with relationships perhaps he could get what ever guy his age wanted without that. He could abuse the power and become a man of greed, lust and desire.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end Nick said to Miranda..</span></div></div>",

It's not that your awkward around girls, in fact the opposite. They find you kind, charming and polite. It's just that you've never been very interested with the girls at your school. You are interested in girls, in fact you do have a kind of crush on a certain girl. The only problem is the fact that this girl isn't real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's Supergirl, more specifically the one from the Superman animated adventures. You don't know why but you always had a crush on her. Your favorite episodes were the one where she was featured on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless you only had eyes for her, that's why you were a little excited when you were shopping last week. You ran into this weird stall at a festival which your at least 200% sure that person was a wizard. He even had a long grey beard. Anyway he offered you a box, and he said that 'anything I put in there comes to life'. At first I didn't believe him, but once he drew a picture and put it into the box, you were amazed at the fact that not only did it come alive, but it was a miniature figurine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, you bought the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when you got home, you printed out one of the photos of Supergirl you had on your computer and placed it in the box. You brought it to your head and preyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please work, please come to life. Please work so I don't have to die alone\" you prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid the box down on your table and slowly opened the box.

They left this morning (Friday) and will be back on Monday, meaning you have the entire weekend to spend with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two woke up on Saturday morning.

The heat coming from her body radiated under the blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she woke up giving you a big cuddle. You two got dress and went downstairs towards the kitchen, since you don't have Supergirl's clothes that are her size, you might have to shrink her down. But you kind of like her that size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get cooking, making pancakes in a pan for both you and Supergirl. She was waiting at the table for you, giving you a loving smile as you smile back at her.

She's only a couple more feet, yet she's eating as if she was fifty foot tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she finished you got ready for a day on the town with your new girlfriend. You don't want to say it is so you can show off your girlfriend to everyone, but thats the main reason.

If you put a picture of a fictional girl inside, and then open it, you get a completely lifelike figurine of that fictional girl. If you speak the name of that fictional girl and a change you want to happen to them, they come to life, and the change happens to them. While alive, they must do what you say IF you insist upon it. They retain their personalities, but they also have to obey your every order (eventually, unless you specify a time, such as \u201cNow\u201d).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo killing Nick off or ending the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe box is six inches by six inches by four inches. Any figurines created will fit within the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick must be holding the box to make changes to girls, but not necessarily to command them. Any girl brought to life by the box cannot touch the box, although they may try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe box\u2019s changing power works on naturally real girls too, but you cannot control them like you can fictional girls unless you could control them anyway. (Fat chance of that.) The subject's clothes change with them, so they can't rip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you put multiple pictures of girls inside, the box creates one figurine for each. If you put multiple pictures of the same girl inside, the box creates one figurine. If you put pictures of different versions of girls inside (like Esper Form Terra and Normal Terra), they do not respond to their name unless you specify the version first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change happens even if it would normally be impossible for them to survive it. For instance, you could say \u201cMikoto Misaka, expose your heart\u201d, and she would rip her chest open to show you her still-beating heart, and she would be none the worse off for it. (Not that you\u2019d want to see her heart.) The command system is very metaphor/sarcasm-sensitive, so telling a girl to \u201cspill her guts\u201d does not necessarily translate into seppuku, and telling her to turn her shirt inside out and sing while dancing on one foot does not register if it\u2019s said sarcastically. (Code Geass R2 reference there.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimilarly, you could say \"Kazumi Yoshida, lift the desk\" while she's just a foot high and she'd do it, even though it would normally be impossible for her on account of both her size and her frailty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main character is as follows:<br>\r\n-Nick\u2019s appearance: He\u2019s tall and has short black hair. His skin is somewhere between tan and pale, and he tends to wear casual wear (aside from pocket T\u2019s.) His favorite shirt is a gray one that states, \u201cA clear conscience is the sign of a bad memory\u201d.<br>\r\n-Nick\u2019s personality: Nick tends not to talk much. When he does talk, he\u2019s often concise, that is to say, short and to the point. He\u2019s very observant and intelligent, and will often make observations that surprise people. He\u2019s more of a foul-weather friend than anything \u2013 he dislikes social gatherings, but likes to help out. He likes anime and video games. He likes Amelia but doesn\u2019t know he likes her, however he is perfectly aware that Amelia likes him. The one time he tried to dig up feelings for her, he ended up watching Linkin Park OMVs on Youtube until he cried, and then going to bed early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther characters:<br>\r\n-Amelia: Amelia is pale-skinned, with long black hair, an unimpressive figure, and a slight frame. (She\u2019s not goth, she just looks like she is.) As for her personality, she\u2019s cynical, sarcastic, somewhat spiteful, and often rude. She has a crush on Nick, but doesn\u2019t know it, but she knows Nick well enough to know that he likes her. The one time she tried to dig up feelings for Nick, she ended up getting extremely confused, watching Linkin Park OMVs on YouTube until she cried, and then going to bed early. (This is ironic for obvious reasons.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reserve the right to update, delete, or add rules as I see fit. I also reserve the right to alter or delete chapters as I see fit. I do not hold grudges so do not worry that I will delete a well-written chapter simply because I don\u2019t like the writer.</td>",
