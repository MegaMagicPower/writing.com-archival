IN A LAST DITCH EFFORT, SEVEN SPACE SHIPS CALLED SKY ARKS WERE BUILT TO HELP HUMANS ESCAPE THE INVASION AND FIND GREENER PASTURES. OF ALL THE SKY ARKS, ONLY SKY ARK 5 IS EQUIPPED WITH A SPACE FOLD ENGINE. THIS IS THE SHIP'S THIRD ATTEMPT IN SPACE FOLDING.

GOING FOR AN ORBITAL APPROACH.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMIKO: GETTING LOTS OF TECTONIC ACTIVITY, VOLCANISM, FRESH WATER LAKES.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRINAYA: THIS COULD BE WHAT WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTE: LOOKS GOOD SO FAR COMMANDER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSAM: NO ANIMAL LIFE SIGNS ON THE SURFACE, BUT I SEE A LOT OF UNDERGROUND ACTIVITY.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTE: COULD BE TOO VOLCANIC FOR OUR NEEDS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRINAYA: LET'S NOT JUMP THE GUN ON THIS WORLD. CELESTE, I WANT YOU TO TAKE AN AWAY TEAM DOWN TO INVESTIGATE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTE: YES COMMANDER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAS THE SKY ARK 5 DRAWS CLOSER TO THE PLANET MORE INFORMATION BEGINS TO ROLL IN FROM PRELIMINARY SCANS. THE SHIP IS ALMOST WITHIN RANGE TO SEND A COMBAT SHUTTLE TO THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSAM: STILL AL OT OF TECTONIC ACTIVITY BUT I THINK I FOUND A SUITABLE LANDING ZONE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRINAYA: SO YOU JUST WANT TO SEND YOURSELF AND MIKO TO THE SURFACE?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTE: THERE'S SO FEW OF US LEFT THAT IS WOULD BE A RISK TO SEND MORE THAN TWO AT A TIME.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRINAYA: MAKE IT SO.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTE'S CRAFT ENTERS THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE STRANGE ROCKY WORLD<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTE: A LOT OF TURBULENCE, BUT I THINK I CAN MANAGE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLOWLY LANDS<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTE: THIS SPOT IS AS GOOD AS ANY.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE TWO EXITS THE CRAFT<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTE: SO FAR SECURITY ISSUES ARE MINIMAL LOOKS GOOD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMIKO: LOOKS LIKE MY ASSUMPTION IS CORRECT. THE ROCKS ARE ACTUALLY STRANGE FORM OF TREE. INSIDE ARE PHOTOSYNTHETIC PROTEINS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTE: AS OF NOW I SUGGEST THAT WE DO A THERMAL AND SEISMIC SCAN OF THE SUB SURFACE. I FEEL A LOT OF TREMORS DOWN HERE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMIKO: UNLIMITED FOOD SOURCES. THIS PLANET IS A GOLD MINE. I CAN;T BELIEVE HOW LUCKY WE ARE. THIS PLACE IS ALMOST TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE, FRESH WATER, FOODS AND GEOTHERMAL HEAT FOR ENERGY!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTE: STILL NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE TREMORS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMIKO: LET'S NOT GET ALL SCARED OF A FEW EARTHQUAKES. IT'S LIKE COLUMBUS BEING AFRAID OF WATER ON THE WAY TO THE NEW WORLD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTE: YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S DOWN THERE MIKO!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMIKO: COULD BE AN ISOLATED PLATE SHIFT! THIS WHOLE WORLD IS HUMONGOUS, WE COULD FIND ANOTHER SPOT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUNKNOWN TO THE TWO A SNAKE-LIKE BEAST CRAWLS BEHIND THEM AND THEN HISSES. CELESTE DRAWS OUT HER PISTOL AND FIRES, BUT THE LASERS SIMPLY BOUNCES OFF.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTE: YOU WERE SAYING?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE LARGE SNAKE-LIKE BEAST SLOWLY MAKES IT'S WAY TOWARD THE OUTGUNNED AWAY TEAM. THE CREATURE APPEARED TO BE A SNAKE / DRAGON HYBRID. IT'S HUNGER WAS OBVIOUS TO THE FRIGHTENED GIRLS WHO WERE QUICKLY RUNNING OUT OF OPTIONS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTE: SKY ARK 5! THIS IS CELESTE! WE ARE ENCOUNTERING HOSTILES! COME ON YOU BASTARD! DIE ALREADY!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTE FIRES ANOTHER SHOT STRAIGHT TO THE UNDERBELLY KILLING THE BEAST.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMIKO: GOOD SHOT CELESTE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE BEAST FALLS TO THE GROUND AND DIE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTE: SKY ARK 5 COM IN! WE ARE HEADING BACK TO REGROUP AND REPORT! WE GOTTA GET BACK TO THE SHIP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMIKO: WE SHOULD TREAD CAREFULLY! THE CREATURES HERE MUST BE ABLE TO SENSE THE SEISMIC ACTIVITY OF OUR FOOTSTEPS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTE: WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMIKO: WELL IF WE HAD TIME WE COULD WAIT FOR ANOTHER TRANSPORT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTE: WE DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF TIME MIKO. I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE A BREAK FOR THE SHUTTLE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMIKO: FOOLISH IDEA, WE SHOULD TRY TO STAY ON THE TREE FORMATIONS AS THEY WOULD ABSORB A LOT OF SOUNDWAVES OF US WALKING AS WE MAKE OUR WAY BACK TO THE SHUTTLE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSUDDENLY A DINOSAUR LIKE CREATURE APPEARS FROM UNDERGROUND WITH ITS MOUTH OPEN BENEATH MIKO.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMIKO: WHA! HELP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTE: MIKO! NOO!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMIKO: IT'S EATING MEE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTE: M...M...MIKO!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTE WATCHES HELPLESSLY AS THE LARGE REPTILIAN CREATURE SAILS THROUGH THE AIR WITH MIKO CAUGHT IN IT'S MOUTH. TIME SEEMED TO FLOW IN SLOW MOTION FOR CELESTE BUT IN REALITY IT ONLY TOOK AND INSTANT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMIKO: NNNN...OOOOO.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTE: MIIII...KOOO...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE BEAST CLOSES IT'S MOUTH AND DIGS UNDERGROUND.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTE: OH! GOD! MIKO!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMIKO: NNGH! NOO! SLIDING DOWN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSAFE UNDERGROUND THE LARGE CREATURE SWALLOWS ITS PREY. IT FEELS HER STRUGGLING BODY FIGHTING HER DESCENT. THE CREATURE MAKES A SATISFYING GRIN AS MIKO SOON DEPOSITED IN HIS GROANING BELLY.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE CREATURE'S FLAT BELLY EXTENDS AS MIKO FINALLY REACHES HIS STEAMING BELLY. THE BEAST SETTLES INTO HIS HOLE TO ALLOW HIS RATHER LARGE MEAL TO DIGEST IN PEACE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMIKO: NNGH! HARD TO BREATHE! CAN'T END LIKE THIS!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBACK IN THE SURFACE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTE: SKY ARK THIS IS CELESTE! GOING TO THE SHIP TO RECON FOR MIKO! SHE HAS BEEN EATEN BY SOME LARGE REPTILE CREATURE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMEANWHILE SAM SMITH BEGINS PREPARATIONS FOR THE EVACUATION OF THE AWAY TEAM WHEN SUDDENLY...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSAM: DON'T GET WHY CELESTE ONLY WANTED TO TAKE TWO ON THE AWAY TEAM...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA LARGE FLASH OF LIGHT APPEARS IN FRONT OF HIM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSAM: NNGH! WHAT THE HELL? IS OUR SHIP UNDER ATTACK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSAM LOOKS UP AND SEES A FAMILIAR PERSON.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSAM: IT... IT CAN'T BE... I MUST BE DREAMING...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGIRL: NNG! WHU?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSAM: ITS YOU! IT IS REALLY YOU! MY BELOVED... DEBRA...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDEBRA: SSAM... NNGH... HOLD ME.... UHH....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nELSEWHERE ON THE SKY ARK, CAPTAIN LEFLEUR IS ENJOYING SOME OF THE PERKS OF BEING ONE OF THE ONLY THREE MEN LEFT ON A SHIP WITH SEVEN WOMEN.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGIRL: (GASP)(GIGGLE!) OH MY! CAPTAIN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDANtE: SO GORGEOUS!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGRABS HER BREAST.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKARINA: MMM... FEELS GOOD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nINSERTS HIS DICK TO HER PUSSY.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDANtE: I WANT TO MAKE YOU MINE KARINA!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKARINA: TAKE ME CAPTAIN LEFLEUR.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDANtE: PLEASE... NNGH! CALL ME DANtE...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKARINA: GUH! NNGH! DANTE!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCOMM: CAPTAIN LEFLEUR TO THE BRIDGE IMMEDIATELY! PRIORITY DISTRESS SENT BY AWAY TEAM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDANtE: DAMMIT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKARINA: IF YOU HAVE TO GO I UNDERSTAND.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDANtE: HELL NO! MY FIRST OFFICER IS FULLY CAPABLE OF HANDLING THIS SITUATION.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKARINA: SHH... IIIT. SO GOOD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDANtE: RIGHT NOW I WANT YOU!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKARINA: NNGH! OGK! COMING! GOD YOU DO ME RIGHT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCOMM.: CAPTAIN LEFLEUR TO THE BRIDE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKARINA: NNGH! UNN... MMM... GAH... YOU SHOULD GO SOON... SOUNDS IMPORTANT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDANtE: SHUT UP! HUFF... HUFF... NNGH! COMING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKARINA: OH GOD! I FEEL IT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBACK ON THE PLANET.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTE: GOTTA STAY PUT...

OH SHIT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT-REX: GRRR,,,,, GROWL!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTE: GOD, YOU LOOK HUNGRY!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE T-REX KNOCKS HER OUT WITH A SWIPE OF A CLAW.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTE: NNGH! OH GOD! EEYAHH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFALLS TO THE GROUND.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTE: NUH... NO... UHN...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE LARGE BEAST INSPECTS HIS UNCONSCIOUS MEAL AS HE PREPARES TO TAKE CELESTE BACK TO HIS LAIR TO DEVOUR AT HIS LEISURE. ALL THE WHILE CAPTAIN LEFLEUR ENTERTAINS HIMSELF WITH THE LOVELY KARINA, WHO HAS NOW GIVEN UP TRYING TO GET THE PRE-OCCUPIED CAPTAIN TO ASSIST IN CELESTE'S RESCUE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKARINA: LOVE IT FROM BEHIND! GO DEEPER DANtE! OHHH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDANtE: NNGH! NICE AND TIGHT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE LARGE BEAST HAS NEVER SEEN FOOD LIKE THIS BEFORE. HE CAREFULLY PICKS UP CELESTE AND MAKES HIS WAY BACK TO HIS UNDERGROUND LAIR TO FEST ON HER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTE: THE CHOICES ARE VERY LONG.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPATH 1: MIKO GETS COMPLETELY DIGESTED AND CELESTE IS EATEN BY THE LARGE LEOPARD CREATURE AND IS DIGESTED COMPLETELY AS WELL. MARCUS AND JOANNA GO TO THE SURFACE PREPARED FOR BATTLE AND FIND NOTHING BUT TROUBLE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPATH 2: MIKO STRUGGLES ENOUGH FOR THE CROCODILE TO REGURGITATE HER. THE CREATURE RE-GROUPS FOR ROUND TWO TO EAT MIKO. AS SHE IS BEING SWALLOWED SHE IS SAVED BY MARCUS AND JOANNA. CELESTE IS EATEN AND DIGESTED.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPATH 3: MIKO IS DIGESTED COMPLETELY. CELESTE IS SAVED BY MARCUS AND JOANNA, BUT ALL THREE ARE ATTACKED BY MORE SNAKE CREATURES. MARCUS IS KILLED AND THEIR SHUTTLES ARE NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. CELESTE AND JOANNA ARE EATEN BY THE SNAKE CREATURES.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPATH 4: MIKO STRUGGLES AND IS REGURGITATED BY THE CROCODILE. CELESTE IS EATEN BY THE LARGE ANIMAL, BUT IS SAVED BY MARCUS AND JOANNA BEFORE SHE IS DIGESTED. MIKO ESCAPES THE CROCODILE AND ALL FOUR AWAY TEAM MEMBERS RE-GROUP. THEY FIND THEIR SHUTTLES DESTROYED BY THE CREATURES ON THE PLANET AND MUST NOW FIND ANOTHER WAY TO GET THE SKY ARK 5 TO COME TO RESCUE THEM. AT THE END THEY ARE ATTACKED BY MORE SNAKE CREATURES.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPATH 5: MIKO AND CELESTE ARE BOTH EATEN AND DIGESTED. MARCUS AND JOANNA ARRIVE TO SAVE THEM BUT ARE ATTACKED BY LARGE SNAKE CREATURES. MARCUS IS INJURED HORRIBLY AND JOANNA IS EATEN AND DIGESTED.</span></div></div>",

BUT\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDANTE: WE CAN\u2019T AFFORD TO LOSE ANY MORE CREW MEMBERS TO A HOSTILE WORLD! THESE ARE SLIM TIMES MINKOVINSKI! WE MUST MAKE HARD DECISIONS IF WE ARE TO SURVIVE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKARINA: I UNDERSTAND CAPTAIN, BUT THIS PLANET MAY BE WORTH A GOOD FIGHT! CELESTE'S LAST TRANSMISSION REVEALS SHE KILLED ONE OF THE NATIVE BEASTS THERE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDANTE: SO YOU WOULD PREFER A WAR THAT COULD ENDANGER ALL OF US INSTEAD OF TRYING TO KEEP HUMANITY FROM THE BRINK OF DESTRUCTION!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKARINA: NO, CAPTAIN I\u2026 I JUST THINK\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRINAYA: ...SHE HAS A POINT CAPTAIN...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDANTE: (SIGH!) COMMANDER SIMMONS. IF YOU WANT TO FEED YOURSELVES TO THE BEASTS DOWN BELOW BY ALL MEANS, I WON\u2019T STOP YOU! BUT IF THIS LATEST AWAY TEAM MISSION FAILS WE WILL HAVE TO VOTE ON WHAT TO DO.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRINAYA: SAM WON\u2019T FAIL US. HE\u2019S TAKING OUR ASSAULT TANK. ALSO WE HAVE ANOTHER ISSUE TO DEAL WITH. APPARENTLY WE HAVE SOME STOWAWAYS ON BOARD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDANTE: STOWAWAYS? WELL I AM IN NO POSITION TO COMPLAIN, TE MORE HUMANS ON BOARD THE BETTER!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRINAYA: WELL NOT ALL OF THEM ARE HUMAN\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKARINA: WHAT DO YOU MEAN COMMANDER?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDANTE: YES, WHAT DO YOU MEAN? AND WHY WASN\u2019T I NOTIFIED?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKARINA: CAPTAIN, I THINK IT WAS BECAUSE YOU AND I\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDANTE: \u2026 SHUT UP KARINA!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRINAYA: ONE IS A FORMER RESISTANCE FIGHTER BRIANNA SAKAI, SHE CONFIDED IN ME ABOUT HER PRESENCE. ANOTHER IS DEBRA ALONSO, SHE IS A \u201cCLONE\u201d OF A FORMER EARTH RESISTANCE FIGHTER. SHE HAS THE POWER TO TELEPORT APARENTLY. SHE TELEPORTED HERE WITH THE LAST STOWAWAY\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDANTE: A TELEPORTER, HUH? WHO IS THE LAST?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRINAYA: NOT SURE, SENSORS PICKED UP ANOTHER BEING TELEPORTING ABOARD. SOMETHING BIG, AND THAT WORRIES ME.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDANTE: IF DEBRA TELEPORTED HERE SHE MUST HAVE BEEN ON THE RUN. MAYBE SOMETHING FOLLOWED HER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKARINA: YOU MEAN A KHAL? OH GOD! THEY ARE THE WHOLE REASON WE ARE OUT HERE PORTING AROUND THE UNIVERSE!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDANTE: CALM DOWN MINKOVININSKI\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKARINA: NO! YOU CALM DOWN, DANTE! AND WAKE UP! WE NEED TO HUNT THIS THING DOWN BEFORE IT EATS US ALL! I\u2019VE BEEN EATEN BY A KHAL BEFORE, AND I DON\u2019T PLAN TO BE EATEN AGAIN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDANTE: KARINA\u2026 I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL. I WILL DO ALL IN MY POWER TO KEEP YOU SAFE. BT WE NEED TO SUIT UP IN CASE WHAT EVER IS STALKING US WILL NOT HAVE A GOOD DAY ONCE IT FINDS US.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKARINA: O\u2026 OKAY\u2026 JUST KEEP ME OUT OF A KHAL\u2019S STOMACH, DANTE! KEEP ME SAFE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nELSEWHERE\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGLUTTON: MY STOMACH ACHES FOR YOU DEBRA!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDEBRA: NNGH! (CAN\u2019T MOVE\u2026 AT LEAST MY EYES ARE OPEN\u2026 DAMMIT, ON SOME PLANET\u2026 THIS MUST BE THE PLANET SAM WAS TELLING ME ABOUT. SHIT I GOTTA GET UP!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGLUTTON: I CAN SMELL YOU GIRL!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDEBRA: NNGH! NUH! NO\u2026 (CRAP! I DIDN\u2019T TELEPORT FAR AT ALL! THAT OTHER GIRL! HOPE SHE IS OKAY!

TIME TO JOIN YOUR THREE FRIENDS IN MY BELLY!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGLUTTON OPENS HIS MOUTH AND SWALLOWS DEBRA HEAD FIRST.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDEBRA: (THREE? NOO! HE ATE THE OTHER GIRL ALREADY?) YOU BASTARD JUST LEAVE ME ALONE! (IT CAN\u2019T END LIKE THIS! WE WORKED TOO HARD FOR THIS!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nONLY DEBRA\u2019S LEGS REMAINS FREE AS GLUTTON LIFTS UP HIS HEAD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDEBRA: (HE\u2019S LIFTING ME UP! HE WON\u2019T EVEN GIVE ME A CHANVE TO LIVE!) PLEASE GLUTTON! NOT NOW! I BEG YOU!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGLUTTON STARTS SWALLOWING.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDEBRA: NOOOO!!!! MMPH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDEBRA\u2019S SLIM SALIVA COATED BODY SLIDES HELPLESSLY DOWN GLUTTON\u2019S THROAT. SHE FEELS THE COOL AIR BRUSH UP AGAINST HER LEGS AND BACK AS HER HEAD AND BREASTS ENTER GLUTTON\u2019S THROAT.GLUTTON FEELS THE SATISFACTION OF DEBRA\u2019S BODY SURRENDERING TO HIS POWERFUL HUNGER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDEBRA: MMPH! NUUU!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEVENTUALLY HER ENTIRE BODY IS SWALLOWED.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGLUTTON: ULP! MMM! EVEN MORE DELICIOUS THE SECOND TIME! TIME TO UNLEASH MY STAGE TWO ACID TO FINISH YOU OFF! CAN\u2019T TAKE A CHANCE OF YOU TELEPORTING AGAIN! OF COURSE I WILL BE MISSING OUT ON SOME NUTRIENTS, BUT THERE ARE MORE FEMALES ON THE SHIP TO CHOOSE FROM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDEBRA KNOWS ALL TOO WELL WHAT STAGE TWO ACID IS CAPABLE OF. SHE FEELS HER HEART SINK AS SHE SLIDES DOWN GLUTTON\u2019S THROAT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDEBRA: STAGE TWO ACID? NOO!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDEBRA REACHES GLUTTON\u2019S STOMACH.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGLUTTON: GAH! THERE YOU GO! YOU HAVE ABOUT TWO MINUTES BEFORE YOU ARE COMPLETELY ABSORBED! TOO BAD I WANTED YOU TO SUFFER! YEP, JUST LIKE CLOCKWORK\u2026 YOU FOUGHT HARD DEBRA, BUT IT\u2019S OVER FOR YOU!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nINSIDE, DEBRA\u2019S PARTIALLY DIGESTED CARCASS FINALLY GIVES IN TO HER FATE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nELSEWHERE ON THE PLANET\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTE REGAINS CONSCIOUS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTE: NNGH!  IT\u2026 IT WORKED! SHE DID IT! BUT I\u2019M NOT ON THE SKY ARK! (GOTTA FIND THE TRANSPORT AND GET BACK TO THE SHIP! GOTTA CALL OFF ALL OTHER AWAY TEAM ATTEMPTS.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSUDDENLY SHE FEELS THE GROUND SHAKING.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTE: WHA? RUMBLING?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA LARGE WORM LIKE CREATURE BURSTS OUR OF THE GROUND AND ENGULFS CELESTE UP TO HER HIPS!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELESTE: SHIT! IT\u2019S A LOCAL! NNGH!
