One of those women was none other than Princess Peach herself, easily recognizable with her long blonde hair and pink dress. Walking beside her, with brown hair and distinctive yellow dress, was the princess of the kingdom of Sarasaland, Daisy. Both had been victims of kidnapping at some point by tyrannical leaders with dreams of grandeur. Mario himself had been their savior at those times, and their mutual circumstances had brought about the beginning of their friendship. Now the two met fairly regularly, whether for some tea, a match of tennis or even for one of Mario's parties. Today's meeting had been one of leisure, just a friendly visit that led to a conversation in the royal garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That tea was pretty awesome, Peach.\" Daisy complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach smiled and nodded her head gently. \"Thank you. I'm afraid I can't take credit for it though. Toadsworth grew and made the blend himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy seemed impressed. \"Man, Peach. Your toads are pretty rad. They're a pretty inventive bunch. They seem to be able to do everything around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach once again smiled at the compliment. \"They do so much for me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink Princess suddenly stopped, seeming to remember something important. Daisy looked confused, and a little bit concerned. \"Everything alright, Peach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Peach muttered, clearly lost in thought. \"Oh, that's right. All this talk about the toads just reminded me. My toad scientists wanted to show me some of their newest developments. They're working on altering a lot of the power up items in the kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that sounds pretty cool!\" remarked Daisy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome to join me, if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy would have been lying if she said she wasn't the least bit interested...</span></div></div>",

Would it kill ya to be more fucking specific?\" She growled, her enormous breasts jiggling in her rage, straining her already overstretched tanktop. Of course, still ranting, Revy continued, \"And why the hell'd you even buy that bullshit anyways; you get your rocks off on me turning into a piece of fucking fruit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRock turned away, blowing a puff of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt then dawned on the berrified gunslinger, to which she then retorted, \"Jesus fucking Christ, Rock, that's why you did it? Fucking pathetic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Rock sighed again, a light blush making itself known on his cheeks as he replied, \"...I didn't really think it'd work, if that makes you feel any better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you, Rock. You're not the one who feels like a beached whale cuz of you being a sick fuck.\" Revy snarled, only to soon feel Blueberry Juice beginning to dribble out from her nipples, thus staining her tanktop in the process. Still frustrated, she growled out an unamused sigh and grunted, \"...And now I'm lactating juice, huh; Of fucking course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRock took another drag, wrapping an arm around her head and patting what used to be her shoulder as he calmly quipped, \"That's it, Revy, get it all out. We'll have you good as new tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you fucking better.\" She growled, \"I can't shoot people like this, now can I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah...\" He moaned, scratching his neck. In an attempt to take their minds off the subject, Rock tried to compliment Ruby's spherical physique as he began, \"...You know, you do actually look-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you compliment me as this ugly-ass ball of puss, I'll rip you a new asshole when I'm back to normal, you got me dipshit?\" She snarled, not willing to hear what her coworker had to say regarding her spherically bloated figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Rock had been in the Black Lagoon Company for a decent amount of time to know where Revy's buttons were. \"...Yeah, I got you.\" He said solemnly, patting her gently. A moment passed with nothing said between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Egh,  it's... not too bad once you get used to the pressure.\" She said, as an annoyed blush spread across her cheeks. Needing something familiar to take her mind off of things, Revy glared back at her coworker and continued, \"...Still irritable as fuck, though. Rock, you got an extra cig?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.\" He answered, taking out a cigarette and sticking it in Revy's lips. \"Here, I'll light it for you.\" He quipped, leaning in towards her, pressing the lit end of his cigarette to her's,  lighting it up in the process. From there, Revy's blush deepened,  accompanied by a scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Thanks, Rock.\" She said curtly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence passed in the night as both drew on their cigarettes, the acrid smoke of burning tobacco mixing with the sweet fragrance of Revy's juices. Rock ran his hands through her hair gently, smiling some as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You do smell nice like this, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Fuck off, Rock.\" Revy bluntly growled, doing her best to at least tolerate her fetish-related predicament. Several minutes of silence had passed until a large vehicle parked in front of them, which revealed it's occupants to be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Didn't expect it would be you, Two Hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice rang out, as a familiar individual stepped out of a luxury sedan, backed by Russian soldiers. In appearance, she wore a wine red skirt business suit, with black stockings and black high heels, along with a Russian military coat draped off her shoulders. Her long blonde hair was done up in a huge ponytail, and aside from her piercing blue eyes, the most distinct features of this woman were the scars across her face, neck, breasts, and leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo everyone who resides in the crinne-filled streets of Roanapur, this scarred femme fatale was none other than Balalaika, leader of the up-and-coming criminal organization known as Hotel Moscow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs to her connections to the Lagoon Company, she frequently employs the group, mostly due to an apparent mutual respect towards the Lagoon Company leader, Dutch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, she was the last person Revy wanted to see her in her current bloated state of being, as a furiously embarrassed blush manifested upon her puffed out, deep blue cheeks, only able to muster a frustratingly flustered sentence as she hesitantly said, \"...Hey, Sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, the Russian woman can clearly see the immobile woman's eyes refusing to look towards her, most likely in some form of personal shame on her part. Though, she certainly wouldn't admit it, for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRock, on the other hand, stood in attention before the boss of Hotel Moscow, who calmly made her way over towards the oddity that was the berrified Revy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Balalaika...\" He said in an almost absentmimded manner. Like a Bengal Tiger, Balalaika slowly circled around the humongously spherical cobalt abnormality before her and her armed entourage, with the occasional light poke or jab here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, such physical contact didn't sit well with the infamous \"Two Hands\", especially since her sense of touch was now stupidly sensitive due to becoming a giant human blueberry. Suffice to say, Revy forced her mouth shut to stifle the sexual moans bubbling it's way up her throat, which seemed almost impossible with her cheeks puffed up like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, it wasn't until the Russian was soon standing face to face with the bloated gunslinger, clearly noting Revy's juice-lactating mammaries, just as the blueberry juice leaking from her bloated breasts had formed a small puddle around her front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile slowly formed upon the woman's hardened and scarred face, obviously getting a chuckle from seeing Revy in a morbidly adorable conundrum, to which she cheekily quipped, \"...Well, if I didn't know any better, I'd say you got a turn-on from all that prodding.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-YOU SHUT IT!! It's not like I fucking wanted to get turned into <b>*growl*</b> THIS!\" Revy bluntly exclaimed, flailing her stumpy, conical arms and legs in protest, which made the juice inside of her bloated form churn from the rapid violent movements, resulting in her libido spiking just a tad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after having a good chuckle, Balalaika snapped her fingers, thus summoning her second-in-command, Boris, to her side, to which the scarred woman then calmly elaborated, \"Have Ms. Lee here loaded up and ready for transport.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" The man retorted, where he then barked out an order to his subordinates in the Russian dialect, to which the soldiers then promptly approached the spherical Revy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before they proceeded to roll the human blueberry, Balalaika spoke to her men and gently said, \"Oh, and please be gentle with her, men. She looks to be rather...<i>ripe</i>, as it were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Capitan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the Russian soldiers promptly rolled the bloated gunslinger. Of course, knowing Revy, the sudden motion combined with being stuffed to the brim with berry juice didn't sit well with her, as the woman shouted, \"What are you- Hey, HEY!! QUIT IT, YOU FUCKHEADS!! WHO SAID YOU IDIOTS CAN DO THIS?! <b>*Glorp!*</b> I said STOP, DAMMIT! I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA PUKE JUICE SHIT OVER HERE!! ARE YOU EVEN FUCKING LISTENING, DIPSHITS!?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, Revy felt like being on a shitty Tilt-A-Whirl after eating a buffets' worth of pizza, only she's unable to use her hands to prevent herself from vomiting, while Rock watched as the members of Hotel Moscow messily loaded up Revy and secured her in place on the widened flatbed trailer via custom-made straps and vices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter wards, Balalaika soon gazed upon Rock, whose eyes were focused on the massive blueberry that was Revy, only snapping out of such a glare when the Russian mused, \"You'll owe me one for this, lover boy~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blush appeared on Rock's face, promptly reminding him to accompany Revy on the ride back to...wherever they're taking Revy.</span></div></div>",

With a groan, he struggled to his feet, whilst the sunlight shone through the nearby window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's.... call it a night...\" He said, pushing up on the nightstand so he could sit on the other side of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRevy grunted, her body shivering due to the mixture of juice and sweat clinging to her now permanent indigo skin pigment, as she too struggled to stand up, hiking her distended daisy dukes up around her still-thick waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Thanks</i>, Rock. I'm still a fucking fatass. She moaned before yawning. \"Still, I guess it <i>could</i> be worse, given how much of a complete shithead you turned out to be.\" She turned around, walking over to the table to collect her things, which were once drenched in unwarranted blueberry juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Rock laid down on the bed, crossing his legs and pulling out a cigarette from the carton on the nightstand. \"Don't act so high and mighty, Revy.\" He said with a smirk, sticking it in his mouth and lighting it up. \"I know you liked it; or were all those moans just a joke?\" He began undoing his juice stained shirt, snickering internally from getting a great view of the <i>\"New\"</i> Revy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, she was no longer the overripe spherical ball of a woman the night before, but there was still a decent enough amount of nectar-like blueberry juice churning about within Revy's systems to give her a more fuller figure than previously remembered. But hey, Rock simply enjoyed the new look for Two Hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRevy, however, chuckled darkly with her back turned to Rock as she lit up a cig of her own. \"That's right, a <i>joke</i>.\" She stuck it in her mouth and took a drag. \"Just like how you fucking me up with that drink was just a <i>joke</i>.\" From there, she picked up one of her signature custom Beretta 92F pistols, commonly referring them as her <i>\"Cutlasses\"</i>. She pulled back the slide, chambering a round, then repeating the process with the other. <i>\"No harm done, right?\"</i> She said with a grin, spinning around with her Berettas held up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRock's smirk vanished, his cigarette drooping as his lip quivered, \"What are you getting at-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you know what, <i>Rock</i>?\" She said, methodically strutting towards him. \"Maybe you're not the only one here with a fucked-up fetish, hmm?\" She leaned in to him, her indigo hand pressing down against his arm, still clutching her pistol. In a quick motion, she threw her thickened leg over his and was quickly straddling him, her extra weight easily pinning him to the bed. Rock gasped at the increased pressure on his pelvis, though it was not the only involuntary response he felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Revy!\" He stuttered, squirming underneath her. \"What are-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maaaaybe,\" She said, her grin widening ever more as she pressed the barrel of her right M92 into the side of his head. \"<i>I</i> have a fetish for putting a little extra lead in your skull.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You're joking, right?\" He squealed; it was impossible to hide his discomfort now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRevy scoffed, tilting her head. \"Come now, Rock. You see how hot and bothered I get when I'm pluggin' holes in fuckers.\" She licked her lips, berry saliva falling onto Rock. \"Standing at the precipice of death, and pushing another poor fuck over the edge; it's the greatest pleasure erotic pleasure of them all, much better than your faggy fruit shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You wouldn't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, <i>Rock</i>. What makes you any different than any other dumbass gangbanger here that crosses me?\" She dug the barrel deeper into his cheek. \"You poison me, turn me into your bloated sex toy, and after eight hours of slapping my tits around, you think I'd just put all this behind me, right?\" Suddenly she then lifted her left pistol up and fired a shot into the ceiling, and continued, \"Because I'm <i>well-known</i> for my fucking understanding and compassion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Revy!\" He said, panting. \"I never-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut the fuck up and laugh, pig.\" She replied, grinning ear to ear. \"Because remember, <i>this is all a joke</i>. This amused you, right? Me being a blue fat fuck tickles your funny bone, doesn't it? So I wanna hear you fucking laugh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily, Rock managed a wheezing guffaw, his eyes wide and his body shivering in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRevy stared Rock down for a moment before frowning. \"Jesus, you're such a dipshit, Rock.\" She pulled the pistol away from his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRock sighed in relief, only to then feel Revy lean in, pulling the cigarettes from their respective mouths before softly kissing him on the lips. Rock's cheeks flushed red from the unsolicited romantic intimacy, but he tried to maintain what little composure he had left, as some of Revy's blueberry saliva dripped into his mouth a little. After a few fleeting seconds, she slid her head across his cheek, bringing her mouth to his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Rock,\" She whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, Revy?\" Rock stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You ever pull a fucked-up stunt like this on me again, I'll fucking smother you to death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just as quick, the barrel of Revy's pistol came down hard across Rock's head, thus knocking him out cold. </span></div></div>",

With Rock K.O'd for the time being, she might as well assess the damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blech! Thanks a fucking lot, Rock.\" She growled lowly, quickly noticing how much her now plump thighs subtly rubbed against one another as she walked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what little she could recall from last night after being loaded up on that flatbed, she was taken back to the Lagoon Company's shithole they call home. Between all the juicing and fucking, the only thing she could make out from all the sexual tension was that she was basically stuck like this for the rest of her fucking life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, her eyes soon wandered towards the second most obvious change to her aside the blue skin; her budding paunch of a belly. Gone were the hardened six-pack, as it was nowadays buried underneath a gallon or two of blueberry juice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck. This is just fucking great.\" She muttered, poking her unwanted waterweight with the barrel of her Cutlass once or twice, obviously unamused with the additional liquid weight churning through her systems. \"...Who the fuck's gonna take me seriously if I look like the fucking Pillsbury Doughboy's in-bred cousin?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, as if to add some crude irony to her situation, Revy soon heard the tell-tale sounds of a hungry stomach, which didn't exactly sit well with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, much to her reluctance, Revy had no alternative but to comply with her bodily urges, as she pointed the barrel of her gun at where she thought her stomach organ was located and snarled, \"You better not fucking turn me into a blimp, dipshit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with one last glance at the unconscious Rock, she lowly growled, \"...You fucking owe me for your little shitty fetish, dumbass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>== 30 Minutes Later... ==</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say that she was famished was an understatement, as Revy had downed an entire pan of pizza in one sitting. Currently, she was lounging on the couch, looking rather annoyed at how she'll possibly blimp up to being a blue fat bitch like last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Plus, the fact that everything she consumned now tastes like blueberries didn't help to quell the seething venom she wanted to spew about in a good long rant.

Despite his ebony skin, bald scalp, and deep graveled voice, Revy knew him more than long enough to know that he can be trusted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small smirk made itself known on her indigo skin, which was only a small welcome given her new...<i>attributes</i>, as it were. Heading over to her, Dutch calmly placed the duffle bags on the coffee table before them, then proceeded to sit adjacent to the chubby, blue-skinned gunslinger. His face remained as stone-faced as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Balalaika already told me about what happened last night between you and Rock.\" He explained, pulling out a cig and lighting it. And yet, despite Revy's current predicament, Dutch didn't show any visible change of emotion, especially when it came to his colleagues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. I bet Benny had a good chuckle about Rock turnin' me into a fucking blue fat ball of puss. Fuckin' dipshit.\" Revy grunted, kicking the side of the coffee table in mild frustration with juice-stained combat boots for a brief second or two, then letting out a frustrated huff afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, being with her the longest, Dutch had a bit of a knack as to what made Revy tick, chuckling to himself briefly at the thought of Benny getting knock upside the head a little from making a remark about the gunslinger's new look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. Yeah, I guess so.\" He remarked, only for a question to arise. \"...How are you feeling?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About fuckin' what?\" She asked, to which Dutch answered, \"...About you and Rock hooking up. And I'm guessing your look's a result of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph! You're fucking right it's his fucking fault.\" She sneered angrily, not amused at what Dutch was implying. \"...I wouldn't be like this if he didn't fuck me over like this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, judging from the sounds of unconscious breathing in the next room, the black Vietnam vet can easily tell that Rock was still in the land of the living, as a slight but subtle twitch of his lips curved upwards on his ebony face, only for him to quip, \"...Seeing as how Rock isn't singing kumbaya with Jimi Hendrix right now, I'm guessing you didn't put a cap in his skull, Two-Hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to her own surprise, Revy was now blushing a little, causing her deep cobalt cheeks to take on a violet hue, due to not being well-acquainted with affairs of romance and intimacy, which left the cold-blooded killer stammering, \"C-Can it, Dutch! I-I-It's so not fuckin' like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\" He retorted, puffing out a fresh spray of smoke from the cigarette. \"...Otherwise, why'd you let him turn you into a human fruit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*frustrated sigh*</b> Whatever...\" She flatly huffed, crossing her blue-skinned arms against her now fatter blueberry boobs, wanting to take her mind off the subject. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it wasn't until her curiosity got her, hook, line, and sinker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What's with the bags?\" Revy asked, noting the two duffle bags splayed out on the coffee table before them. Of course, Dutch responded, \"Figured you were gonna ask sooner or later, Revy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, as he stood up and reached out towards the pair of bags, and with a swift series of actions, Dutch unzipped the duffle bags to reveal something necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Figured you might need some new digs.\" He said, pulling out what appeared to be...</span></div></div>",

While Violet was quite amazed by all the various contraptions and gizmos around her, Scarlett was more interested in Mr. Wonka, seeing how wealthy he was she thought that this was her ticket to move up in the world. Though she did believe in her little champion and her ability to win this little contest, yet it was a good idea to have a little insurance in someone\u2019s back pocket just-in-case their first choice doesn\u2019t pan out,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Mr. Wonka, is there a Mrs. Wonka at all?\u201d Scarlett asked, a grin on her face as she tried to make some kind of moves on the rich chocolatier,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026..ewww\u2026 No why would I there is so much to do\u201d he giggled, social politeness wasn\u2019t something that Wonka didn\u2019t care for nor human interaction in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Scarlett just stop in her tracks, she just didn\u2019t understand why this man could ever turn down having a night with a two-time beauty contest champion from 92\u2019-93\u2019. Violet couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at the failings of her mother, their relationship was always been just both of them taking jabs at one another, this was just another iteration of that kind of love. While Scarlett tried to get Wonka ensnared on her trap, Violet didn\u2019t even notice that she had her person who was trying to ensnare her in their beauty. Veruca didn\u2019t know why but this blonde hussy had gotten under her skin, the girl who had everything now wanted just one thing and that thing\u2019s name was Violet. Veruca didn\u2019t want to be this girl\u2019s friend nor even just acquaintance, no someone who is as spoiled and rich like Veruca wanted was one thing from Violet and that was complete and utter obedience. Violet thought was unaware of this twisted idea that was stirring inside the head of Veruca nor did she want anything apart of it if she knew about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo why did you get into this kind of contest, Violet\u201d Veruca asked trying to know the girl she had recently been infatuated with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was just something that happened I wasn\u2019t usually known for eating chocolate, but if this is a competition I\u2019m going to win, no matter what\u201d Violet was quite proud of her exclamation. Both hands on her hips as she jutted her chest out in pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie couldn\u2019t help but sigh in disbelief, how emboldened could you be real, the girl in the blue tracksuit didn\u2019t have any shame did she? Veruca wondered if there was anything in this maze of mechanical wonders that could make it easier for her to take this girl away from the rest of the group and make Violet hers. Her father didn\u2019t know why her daughter was know wanted this girl, not once did she think about buying people before, it didn\u2019t matter though if it would shut her up then a plaything is what she would get. Handing over a blank cheque to the girl just to shut her up about it, he didn\u2019t know if this was a good thing or a bad thing though if it got his daughter off his back then all the more reason to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome around children there are quite many different things that I want to show you in the slim time we have with each other\u201d gesturing everyone to group around him Wonka was about to unveil one of his many inventions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up what looked to be some sort of orb, perhaps a gumball or maybe a jawbreaker this candy was quite new, to say the least? Charlie and his grandfather were the only two who hinged on every word of the eccentric chocolatier\u2019s words knowing that he may be peculiar but  he was a genius when it came to his craft. Veruca saw this as an opportunity to talk with Scarlett about selling her daughter perhaps? Tugging the woman away from trying to make the moves on Wonka seemed to be easier said than done though, she was still trying to make the man her\u2019s. There wasn\u2019t anything that she wouldn\u2019t do to move up in the world, Veruca hoped this meant things were looking up for her prospects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026 you don\u2019t say, Mr. Wonka, you mean this will never go bad or lose its flavoring?\u201d Scarlett was quite disinterested with what marvels the everlasting gobstopper as though it wasn\u2019t entirely unknown to her the implications of such an invention, she just didn\u2019t care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving the woman over to Veruca was now much easier as Wonka went into a tirade of his creation, fixing her hair and blue tracksuit, Scarlett wondered why this prissy rich girl wanted to talk to her. Away from prying eyes and the other adults, Veruca met with Violet's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n with a stern \"what, do you want\u201d Scarlett wasn\u2019t in the mood for games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get straight to the point then as I can see you are already short with people\u201d Brushing her hair out of her face the little British girl with a tongue of silver begun to seduce this woman with honeyed words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get straight to the point then, I want your daughter as my pet, I\u2019m willing to pay you for her\u201d waving the blank cheque in front of Scarlett as a means to sway the decision of the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour more horrid than I gave you credit for, Violet is my Champion, as long as she wins you can\u2019t have her\u201d Smugly Scarlett responded before waving goodbye to Veruca as she returned to the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n With her plan of just buying Violet up in smokes, Veruca saw this as her chance to explore the room not knowing what she would find, anything to loosen the tight grip of Scarlett from her champion, stopping in front of quite a large machine as the little people shoved things inside it, stuff that she couldn\u2019t tell what it was. Taking a closer look it seemed to be just various meals, from rhubarb pies to a steak dinner, things were shoved into this strange machine but to what end?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cstrange machine right?\u201d a voice asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cyeah why are they putting some meals into it to what end?\u201d she responded not thinking who asked her in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked, to say the least, Veruca spun around quite quickly to see that Wonka and the rest of the group had caught up to her. Stepping in front of Veruca, Wonka hit a few levers and buttons to some effect. Lights and sounds came from the machine as it whirled awake, like some sort of creature it came alive to do some unknown order. Working overtime the machine shoved all manner of liquid through its many tubes to what end Veruca didn\u2019t quite know. A metallic shaft unfolding right in front of them to produce something, looking at more closely it looked like\u2026\u2026</span></div></div>",
