Suddenly there was a loud bang and a flash of orange light flooded the room momentarily. Tom looked up startled yet nobody else seemed to have noticed. He left his seat and got up to go and investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going in such a hurry?\" asked his mum. \"It's your favourite programme!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err, I need a drink.\" he replied, already in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, but hurry back or you'll miss it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom opened the kitchen door and snuck outside onto the back garden to investigate the noise and light. In the far corner he could see what looked like a small glowing hole of some sort. He couldn't see anything on the other side as it looked like a cloth had been draped across it from the inside. Tom looked back at the house and then towards the hole again.</span></div></div>",

He put his head through the opening and peered inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the drape it looked like a long white corridor that went on for eternity. Each side of the corridor was lined with many hundreds of holes with drapes. They were all the same colour and none were labeled in any way so that they all looked identical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom let go of the curtain-like drape with his hand and was immediately pulled into the corridor. As soon as he was in, the holes on the walls began to spin around and rearrange themselves. Tom could only stare and try to follow where his exit was going. His attempts failed. He now had no idea of how to get out, back to his home and family. He stood staring as he tried to make a decision on which other hole to try. He eventually decides on...</span></div></div>",

It was very fast for a hole, quicker than Tom was. It moved away from him. Tom wasn't about to let it get away though. He chased after it. Every time he almost had it, it slipped away. One time it dissapeared right before his eyes, only to re-appear right behind him as he hit the floor from his diving attempt to reach it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Tom got smart about it. He figured out that things weren't right in this corridor. Tom began to head the other way, away from the portal. He walked away for only ten minutes before the blue hole started chasing him. He led it in a circle and then jumped on it. He had one hand firmly in the hole, the other grasping at it's side. To his surprise the hole started getting bigger.</span></div></div>",

Despite Tom's terror, he was inexplicably drawn to the woman's exotic beauty.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here my darling\", the woman / creature cooed and Tom felt himself walking toward her.  She took his hand and led him out of the bathroom toward the living room.  Tom realized two things immediately.  The woman's touch was cold!  He gasped as he also realized that what he thought was his familiar bedroom was nothing but an illusion created by the aliens for his benefit. Now as he was being led toward the living room, the bathroom and his bedroom disintegrated and were replaced with plain gray space with nothing else to  distinguish it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom whimpered as he felt drawn by some powerful force that was impelling him toward an inexplicable obedience to this alien being.  He was also deeply scared about what he would encounter next. Tom desperately wished for another hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no....\", Tom whimpered as he was finally led into the \"living room\" where other beings were assembled.  Just as happened before, Tom was able to briefly see the true alien forms before they all transformed into different versions of beautiful and exotic females.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What punishment shall we inflict for this latest attempt to escape us?\", the creature that had found him in the bathroom hissed.  A strikingly attractive creature, presumably the leader, hissed \"We shall confine it to the portal of terror\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom shuddered as he grappled with what unspeakable torture this \"portal of terror\" would be.  Before he could do anything, he was held by other cold hands and dragged toward the front door and placed in a strange glowing vehicle.  After what seemed like seconds, Tom felt the vehicle stop and his captors pulled him outside where he found a portal being guarded by two aliens in their true forms.  Tom noticed that neither alien bothered to hide their repulsive appearance.  In fact, once outside the vehicle, all the creatures assumed their true forms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are being punished for your latest attempt to escape.  For this you will be sent for seven earth days to the portal of terror where you will meet the thing that you fear most.  Very few creatures survive beyond the first day.\", the lead creature hissed, with unearthly laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom trembled and he felt his knees go suddenly weak and it took great effort for him to remain upright.  He looked around and saw for the first time that the green skies and black clouds were nothing like what he would have seen on earth.  The ground was also a strange spongy gray material.  Tom also noticed that beside the guarded portal was another portal that was much larger.  It was to that portal that he was being led.  Tom suddenly thought that the portal he was being taken was the punishing \"portal of terror\", but what of the portal being guarded, could this be his way out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment that Tom decided to make a desperate break from his captors. </span></div></div>",

Before he could think of how he could have reached this state, he was startled by a voice outside the bathroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom did not recognize the female voice and hesitated before replying, \"Yes,...Just a minute...\" His deep voice startled him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be a good boy and open the door!\", the voice said soothingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom dried his face, as he thought again that this series of events was vaguely familiar. Is this my wife or girlfriend? he wondered. He slowly opened the door, hoping that the woman he would see would at least be attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door was thrown open by the female and Tom screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are.  You have been a bad boy and must be punished!\", the female creature hissed as Tom stepped back from her in fear.</span></div></div>",

Despite Tom's terror, he was inexplicably drawn to the woman's exotic beauty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here my darling\", the woman / creature cooed and Tom felt himself walking toward her. Tom however recognized that he had gone through this already and he resolved to change this. She took his hand and led him out of the bathroom toward the living room. Tom realized two things immediately. The woman's touch was cold! He gasped as he also realized that what he thought was his familiar bedroom was nothing but an illusion created by the aliens for his benefit. Now as he was being led toward the living room, the bathroom and his bedroom disintegrated and were replaced with plain gray space with nothing else to distinguish it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom whispered \"this is not real.  This is not real\".  As he did so, the hypnotic hold of the alien creature on him was broken and Tom saw the creature's true form, every slimy, slithering detail. Tom desperately wished for another hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not real.  This is not real\", Tom repeated aloud and all the creatures assembled in the \"living room\" began to flicker, as though they were intangible light.

He stares around in awe before placing eyesight on the big doors in front of him, he runs to them because they were perhaps his only way out but he trips, feeling exhausted, and tumbles down five of the steps that led from the place he appeared, almost like a ritual looking place.<br>\r\n   Tom feels a pain spread across his face and lets out a slight laugh at himself because of how ridiculous the situation is, he needed to recieve help. He felt exhausted like he had been running a marathon so stopped to gather his senses.<br>\r\n   The doors ahead of him opened quickly, slamming as they did, making him realize the doors were much lighter than they looked. Standing there is some twelve or thirteen year old girl draped in such old looking clothes. Even if they look newly made they seemed like the Medieval kind, some kind of robe perhaps, it looked fancy though so she may be very wealthy. She seemed panicked so Tom got up on my left knee and raised his head to listen to her.<br>\r\n   \"It can't be, how can a hero summon himself, how do I explain this? How strong is he, can he understand my language? Is this a premonition, is it good? Bad? Is he a hero?\" Tom just stared in silence with a blank face thinking things may take awhile.<br>\r\n   Tom looks at her and interrupts. \"Just to clear it up, I am not from here. I saw some glowy thingy, a hole by the looks, back in my own world. I touched it and it pulled me somewhere with more hole-looking things. I got drawn to a glowing bright one and it brought me here, I tried heading to those doors but I feel a huge amount of exhaustion, like I ran a marathon!!!\" <br>\r\n   She gasps and starts doing calculations with her fingers. \"It seems you were victimized by your own magic, your power was activated to send you here once the conditions were unlocked, I don't think you will ever realize the conditions but you summoned yourself here it seems and hero's only come in time of need. Currently it is peaceful here so either you aren't a hero but instead you are the majesty's guest. By the way, I am his daughter so it would be nice to welcome you. The second possibility is that you came here by fate and something will happen or is happening that needs to be stopped that we are yet unaware of. We will get you patched up right away and I can sense a lot of strength from you. I don't think I have heard much about self-summoning magic, it wasn't portal or teleport magic from what you described but it isn't anything the kingdom would know about. Maybe you can ask a great sage if you manage to find one.\" She declares politely while moving her hand over Tom's body. It was kind of like some sort of analysis or diagnostic, it seemed. Tom wished she would stop because being examined seems kind of like an invasion of personal space that he wasn't ready for. She helps him up with a hand and he walks with her through the door and down the halls. She brings him to a medical room where he lies down and waits for treatment.<br>\r\n   Tom looks around bored of what can and can't be done and thinks of many things he wants to do but can't. Suddenly a games console appears in front of him just as he was thinking of one but it disappears as his mind goes blurry and he passes out.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

A strange British girl called Kazumi just told him to jump to another building. Figuring it was better than being here, He tried the same thing that she did. Tom was shocked at seeing himself several hundred meters above the ground, hurtling towards another building.<br>\r\nSuddenly, the other building was right on him, and he came crashing down onto the floor.<br>\r\n\"Well, first times a charm\" Kazumi said, picking him up. Fortunately, that's the only jump for a while.<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Tom asked.<br>\r\n\"I just said; the physics in this world is vastly different to Earth... You'll get used to it\" She said. \"Come on\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazumi led Tom through a myriad of abandoned rooms and halls, down a few flights of stairs and then up one.<br>\r\n\"All this used to be populated, one mans dream of a world away from the frights of Earth. Well, that's what people say anyway\" Kazumi said, leading Tom. \"Except it backfired. He wanted to open it up to people to come and live in a world of peace, and so a few people thought they could rule the place with guns. The machine holding this world together got broken and hey, look at it now\"<br>\r\n\"So this place is virtual?\" Tom asked.<br>\r\n\"No, not as far as anyone can work out. More that it's in another dimension of sorts. But because the machine was broken, random portals on earth open up, suck a few things through and then dump it here. A few rare times people come through, sometimes it's a few useful tools and the like, but mostly it's junk\"<br>\r\n\"Sounds terrible\"<br>\r\n\"My name is Kazumi, I am nineteen years old and I have lived in this world for two years, three months and sixteen days\"<br>\r\n\"What?\" Tom asked in surprise.<br>\r\n\"I tell myself that everyday, as proof of two things. That I am alive and I havent gone insane... yet\"<br>\r\n\"Yea, about that\" Tom said. \"Arent you British? Whats with a name like Kazumi?\"<br>\r\nKazumi laughed a little. \"It was my player name in an online game a long time ago. I felt it fitted better here in this world than my Earth name\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe myriad of halls and abandoned rooms eventually opened up to a plaza. Kazumi walked along a covered walkway, taking care to not go in the light. A flying vehicle suddenly passed overhead, making a sound similar to a plane. It passed harmlessly overhead, heading towards where Tom had appeared in this world.</span></div></div>",

He was holding a rifle in his hands. As soon as Tom and Kazumi were inside, he closed it again, saying nothing.<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" Tom said. \"Who are yo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazumi had quickly put her hand over his mouth, staring flatly at him and shaking her head slowly.<br>\r\n\"You don't talk to a savant\" She said. \"Something else I'll explain later. In fact, it's probably for the best that you don't say anything at all right now and keep your stuff hidden.\"<br>\r\nKazumi led Tom down a long flight of stairs and opened another door. They walked through onto a catwalk above a huge - massive open storage shed. While it once might have been used for a shed, it was now a shanty town, filled with people in poor quality clothing milling around doing what they could to survive. A few looked up at Tom and Kazumi but couldnt care less about the newcomer. Kazumi led Tom down the catwalk into the 'streets'. After a few minutes walking, they came to a railway track and headed into a tunnel.<br>\r\n\"Used to be a service depot for a subway\" Kazumi said. \"Now we call it New Haven. One of the last few villages in this wasteland that the Overlords havent yet discovered. I'll take you to my place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe subway tunnel was poorly lit by an array of lamps that were jammed into the ceiling. There were an innunermerable number of houses occupying two thirds of the tunnel, while the last third was for public access, but really was only large enough for one person to walk at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, Kazumi welcomed Tom into her home, a ramshackle hut with a half broken wooden door on the front. This also appeared to be right on the edge of town, as only two houses further down, the tunnel was blocked by a massive pile of metal and rubbish.<br>\r\nKazumi's house was suprisingly well furnished, and it looked like she had somehow dug out a part of the tunnel wall to massively increase the size of her residence.<br>\r\n\"Welcome home\" She said, smiling slightly and flopping down onto an old wooden chair. There was a potbelly stove in the corner, a torn rug on the ground and a fair sized table against one wall with some paper and a few pens on it.<br>\r\nTom sat down on another chair which looked a little sturdier.<br>\r\n\"So, could you please explain everything for me?\" He asked, extremely confused about everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll start at the beginning. You've just been pulled into this place we call the Metaworld. The physics are different here, as you found out. If you've got batteries in that torch, for some reason they'll never burn out - ever. There's a few other differences as well, but the need for food and water hasnt changed, making anything consumable highly valued.\"<br>\r\n\"So thats why you told me to hide my stuff\"<br>\r\n\"Exactly. I can give you all the food and water you want, but I should inform you that the fizzy drink and biscuits you have are valued far more uneaten than they are consumed. If you want, I can find you a good buyer\"<br>\r\n\"Uhh... Thanks... I guess\" Tom said.<br>\r\n\"Anyway, about that Savant guy. You heard the men in the building, how they sounded werid?\"<br>\r\n\"Yea?\" Tom asked.<br>\r\n\"That's because they undergo surgery to modify their bodys, which includes a vocalizer that changes the way they speak. Before the memory implantation, there's a small window where we can rescue them. We call them savants... \"lucky saved\". They guard our borders with their lives, but without the memory implantation, they have no idea how to work the vocalizers aside from making a few grunts and squeals... A small price for freedom\"</span></div></div>",
