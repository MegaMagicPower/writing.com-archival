A walk through the desert, trudging for a few days while evading the occasional patrol here and there. A painstakingly careful move into what appeared to be little more than a shack - which sprawled downwards into Gods know how many different halls and rooms. So many guards, and the sounds of people locked away in rooms being tormented... it's hard not to remember that, at least. Laughter. Lots of it. That's what goes on in these places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd that you're thinking about it so seriously, but it <i>is</i> a little menacing. At that, the image of a gorgeous woman flashes in your mind. While her features remain indistinct, they appear as something you cannot describe, no matter how hard you think - her visage painted in your mind's eye inspires fear, and... kind of makes your heart skip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's then that you remember. A hand cupping your jaw, and a cocky grin on her face making your heart sink as a headset is removed from atop your head. Somehow, and for some reason... you'd been set up. A handler from the Agency had gotten you in here, only for the Empire to be informed of your location and the time you would be there. And then words form...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ah, you're just as cute as they said you were,</i> a sultry voice echoes in the reaches of your mind. <i>How lovely. You may just be worth it after all... once you've cracked, that is.</i> It's HER voice. It's hard to believe, but she really is a person - with a name, a face, that can be pinned down. It's... surreal. Almost enchanting, to think about her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>One day, Agent, you will recognize my superiority. One day, you will realize what you deserve, and where you belong. One day, you will submit - not because you feel you must, but because you truly feel that is what you want. One day, Agent...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a pause, and you remember the feeling of pillowy lips against yours - a tongue invading your mouth briefly, setting off alarm bells of all varieties in your head. And yet, you can't recall struggling, not in the slightest. Then, that voice returns to you. <i>You will be mine, and I will welcome you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a cold sweat you jerk up into a sit. A blanket flies up and off of you, and you struggle to catch your breath. Your arm runs across your forehead, following up by gently rubbing sleep from your eyes with a pair of fingers. You feel... <i>odd</i> - you know that was too vivid to not have any basis in reality, and yet it feels so distant. Especially so, as you take a look around and find yourself in some sort of strange one-room home. There's a note at the edge of the bed, which you reach for and read over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good morning, Agent. You may tell me your name when you first submit to me, but that day may wait.</i> Instantly, you know who it is. <i>My finest have escorted you to one of the middle-lower levels of this facility you so rudely attempted to sabotage. Fortunately, we were prepared, and so your new living quarters was readied in advance. While the amenities here are minimal, they should be serviceable to keep you alive and well while you explore your future desires here.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuture desires? You raise a brow curiously, for a moment, then furrow them, as you realize what that means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You should have no difficulty finding food here - a small chute off to the side near the table in the corner will bring down a small elevator with a meal on a plate should you find yourself needing something to eat. If you damage your clothing, go to the opposite end of the room and throw whatever ruined articles you can into the chute going downwards. Before long, they should shoot back up repaired and ready to be worn again. That, if nothing else, should keep you close to home, shouldn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, you have little to fear in this one room. So long as you do not harm yourself, you may remain in that room uncontested. But the moment you step out of that room, you will be considered an escapee by the facility's guards, should they notice you. And if they capture you... expect to be played with!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy yourself, and don't be afraid of getting caught!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou doubt you'll be running around getting your clothes torn apart, and taking food from her seems a bit <i>eerie</i>, but the prospect of the Empress being this courteous towards you is... odd. Your knowledge, if limited, of prisoner treatment on part of the Empire is much more brutal than this - so you have to wonder what her goal here is. Does she really want <i>you</i> that badly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get your legs out from under your blanket and set your feet down on the floor, standing up and letting out a sigh. It looks as though some of your clothes have been taken from you - not to mention a lot of gear. You never did carry weapons, but a comm headset or a lockpicking kit would be nice right about now. True to her word, there is a table in the corner with a chair set close - and near it is what appears to be a plate-sized opening in the wall for lowering food down. Opposite that is a faintly lit, round hole in the wall labeled 'REPAIR HATCH', which you figure is where you're meant to throw clothes if they're damaged, not that you're entirely sure you trust that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Well, it looks as though you're in a tight spot. While you're not one to sit and mope about doom and gloom, you're not entirely sure where to go from here - the goal of getting to the Empress somehow stands very strongly in your mind, but what to do with her when you get there, and how to even get there in the first place is as unclear as unclear gets. This is anything but good. But anything but good is what you're trained to work with, fortunately, and you've not been left without ANY hand to play with. You're exposed, you're unarmed, you have no tools, and you're vastly outnumbered, but your wits haven't left you. Now just to use them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few options jump to mind. For one, you could stick around here. The bed looks comfortable, so you could always just take a nap, now. In fact, that's what your heart says - as passionate as it may be about getting... <i>something</i> out of the Empress, the warm embrace of a blanket sounds pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively, you could nose around this room, just to see if you can find anything useful or fun. While the letter covered most of the contents of this rather compact and featureless room, you might be able to find something if you investigate the place more thoroughly. Besides, she guaranteed this room was safe - maybe she was telling the truth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, there's a couple of doors on a wall. Two of them, left and right respectively, have signs above them with staircase indicators on them. Leading up and down, you assume, whether you want to delve farther into this place or try to get farther up and out of it. The center one simply indicates forward - so you could always just explore this floor. You notice a note on the center door, though - this Empress seems to like leaving them, if only here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Choose a door wisely. Once you enter one, the others will jam, and you will not be able to open them. May I suggest going down? I hear the girls down in R&amp;D could use a new test subject for our latest toys - They'd LOVE you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Well, that helps with your decision-making, doesn't it? Going down, almost certainly, is going to result in getting tickled a lot. But at the same time... she just tipped her hand. Maybe getting in there, learning about their operation, and getting out is just what you need. But if you're caught, who says they'll EVER let you out, except directly into the Empress's hands?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecisions, decisions...</span></div></div>",

You turn back around and lay back down in bed, curling yourself up in the blankets and resting your head on the pillow, contented at least by this comfort. You shut your eyes, let out a little sigh, and faintly smile as the looming embrace of sleep closes on you and brings you sweetness for a short time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt puts you at ease, and gives you a bit of time to think without thinking. Your mind whirs with unconscious thought, dreams of this and that, and before you know it, you're awake again and feeling much more refreshed, even if you're still in the same predicament you were when you fell asleep. But... maybe it's not <i>that</i> bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think it over for a few moments, sitting upright on the bed for a short time before a note flutters down from the ceiling, landing atop your blissfully unaware head. Once it registers that it's there, you take it and give it a read, curious as to what the third of these has to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You didn't leave yet? Really? You're still in bed? Would you please do SOMETHING? I set aside my break time today to watch you, so could you please be entertaining? Please?</i> the note begins, looking a little... scribbled. It's about as frustrated as you've ever seen the written word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If you don't want to go out to the facility, I can bring the facility in to you. If this interests you, please indicate as much to one of the upper corners of the room. If it does not interest you, would you at least do something that isn't simply sleeping?</i> the note continues, and you can't help but get a little chuckle out over it. And then another note flutters down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wonderful! That's what I like to hear. More of that, please!</i> is all it says, and you're left entirely to your thoughts. Did she... ask for you to laugh? Did she <i>like</i> when you laughed? What was that? What's she getting at? And why would you do anything for HER, the embodiment of all you've fought to stand against?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Though you're hesitant to give it even a moment's listen, a voice in the back of your head is curious about what she meant by bringing the facility to you, in here. You're also curious about her 'more of that' comment. The fact she's watching you makes you blush, if not because of what you have done already, then because of what you could have done - Gods know what sorts of odd situations she's set up outside of this room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could indulge her request, if you wanted. But you could also continue to be as boring as possible. Or, if you were feeling particularly generous, you could even try to ask her what she wants. It's unlikely you'll get an answer, you figure, but it could be worth a shot, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what's worth trying?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You pause for a moment, then let out a little snort, roll your eyes, and make a rude gesture to one of the upper corners of the room. You can assume she's got cameras in the corners of the room, now, so she probably got to see that. Having the pleasure of doing that, at least, makes this whole predicament kind of worth it, you decide. You get into bed, pulling the blankets over you and letting out a relaxed sigh as you get comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, a note flutters down, creased halfway down the center and parted open at your nose. You pinch and lift it with a pair of fingers, squinting as you begin to read. <i>This will be the LAST of the notes you receive from me, until you learn manners. Know that you, in your brash action, have made your one safe haven become just as dangerous as the rest of that facility. While I had issued an order for all personnel to keep out of the room you currently occupy, that order has been revoked as of now. Never forget that all you possess - even your own security, I am free to take as I please. You, Agent, will be mine. No petty attempt at defiance will result in you besting me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little intimidating, you admit, but what's she going to do? Send this whole place to dog-pile you while you're sleeping? This shoebox of a room might fit half a dozen people at best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe note continues. <i>You may be thinking of some way you can belittle my authority at this very moment. I dare you to try it. Thwart me, and I will ensure that you not only love your torment, but beg for it to never stop.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink a few times at that peculiar end. That's... an odd threat, on top of that. What's that supposed to mean, anyways? You shake your head and shrug. Your plan was to sleep, but knowing what you do now, are you sure you'd still like to do that?</span></div></div>",

If she was so kind as to not throw you into a cell to rot, you figure you may as well look around a bit. Aside from the basics she pointed out in the first note, there doesn't seem to be too much - just a bunch of blank walls and empty containers, including but not limited to a dresser, a treasure chest (which you really wish had <i>anything</i> in it) and a bedside table. But otherwise...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head over to a wall. This wall has absolutely nothing on it, and there are no doors against it. Potentially, it serves no purpose, except to separate the interior from the exterior. But you recall an old trick from your early days of training, and press your ear to the wall. You then lightly knock on the wall and... an echo! Perfect! You take a step back - there's clearly something on the other side of this wall, but what, you're not sure. How to get it open is another matter entirely--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh! Knocking on it, it appears, was just the way to open it. A pair of panels slide apart to reveal the inside of a wardrobe, which is almost entirely empty. It's quite dark inside, so it's hard to see what all is within - there's a number of hangers along a horizontal pole at about shoulder height, but otherwise, there seems to be little. Except, you notice, a belt hanging over one of the hangers. Without a moment's hesitation, you pluck it from the closet and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...oh, no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize your mistake only a moment too late. You try to pull it away, but the belt seems to have a mind of its own. Through air expelled from the belt at its joints, it pushes your arms closer to your sides and weaves its way into the belt-loops of your pants. You can't stop it before it's closed a buckle just below your navel with a big, red button on it - after which you feel it follow up by wrapping an additional strap between your legs, forcing them to remain a bit apart uncomfortably. You know what this is - it's a tickle belt. If someone presses the button on this thing, the point pressing your back will start sending signals up and down your spine like every sensitive nerve in your body is getting toyed with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne last note flutters down. You're almost too dazed by your predicament worsening to catch it properly - your hand slips a bit and you hear a little <i>beep,</i> the likes of which you're worried may have just doomed you, as you notice you just pressed the button yourself with your shaky hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe note reads: <i>It seems quite clear you're capable of amusing me on your own. I'll keep quiet, for now. Remember, you can give up any time you'd like!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill runs up your spine, and a faint \"pfffft\" slips out your lips. You're in for a long, agonizing ride with this thing - and it's not going away after it's had its fun.</span></div></div>",

Sure enough, that was the sound of a locking mechanism shattering irreparably. She meant what she said, because of course she did, which means you're definitely not getting through either of those doors now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a few steps of tile before a staircase leading up. It's dimly-lit here, with only a few flickering lights along the ceiling as you travel on down. There's a handrail on both sides you can hold onto - odd that the Empire has safety regulations, you think passingly, hoping to distract yourself from your predicament. Your thoughts, however, prove ineffective in distracting you from the deafening silence, broken only by the sound of your bare soles slapping gently against each stair following the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk is mind-numbing, and seems to last far longer than it should. Getting back to the room - to safety - quickly is going to be a gamble at best, impossible at worst, unless you're willing to fall down the stairs. It's as you think over how retreat might even work in a situation like this that you realize you've reached a change of scenery - a straight hallway, with a little chest-high barrier to hide behind separating a pair of doors. There's a guard at the end of the hall, a slender woman about two heads taller than you, who doesn't seem to be paying much attention... though it looks like she might notice you, if you don't move now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

Either way, it's a look you know well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hey,\" she replies, tone confused more than anything. She opens her mouth to keep speaking, and then she pauses, eyes looking you up and over curiously, from head to toe and right back to your eyes again. \"Aren't you the Agent we just caught?\" the guard asks at last, smirking with amusement. So she <i>does</i> recognize you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The very same,\" you confirm, thumbs in your pockets as you continue your approach. Not like you could deny that - you're almost certainly the only girl walking around in a tickle-crazed place without shoes.

It's unlikely you'll be passing through either of those doors any time soon, if at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that your choice stands obviously before you, you head on through, and down a short hallway. The hallway quickly opens up into a large, square lobby of sorts, with <i>numerous</i> doors - there must be at least a dozen in this area alone. There are a few raised, supported bits of ground above you held aloft by truss and suspension cables, which you assume lead to more doors, though there only appear to be two floors of those above you, thankfully. Besides that, the most notable door seems to be a tough, steel double-door with a number above it, a pair of buttons labeled with up and down arrows, and a plaque on the opposite side. Curious, you approach and read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>LAUGH IN AN ELEVATOR</i> is its headline, instantly catching your attention. Beneath that is a body of text which you begin to read. <i>The Empire's most beloved break-time game now has a spot in your facility! The first person to enter the elevator is bound tightly upon entry, and is forced to ride the elevator to its next call. The person or group which called second boards the elevator without issue, and may tickle, tease, and otherwise play with the captive rider of the elevator until it makes its next stop! The next time the door opens, the captive is freed, but the person or group who called second may choose to ride as long as they wish without opening the door. Further, they may choose where the captive rider gets off, but they must also get off there as well.</i> As you read, it increasingly degrades to fine print, and beyond that, it's far too small for you to read properly. You'd need a magnifying glass, if you cared, but the gist of it remains clear: it seems a useful tool, if one that you're almost certain could doom you very easily. With your luck, you'd always be the first aboard, you think passingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to weigh your options, you take a further glance around. There's a couple doors here and there - one says 'Guard Barracks', which could either be a very good or very bad idea to enter, depending on how many people are in there and if anyone left anything useful lying around. One is labeled 'Delivery Chutes', though you figure that's just a good way to get yourself farther down into this place, if any are even fit for a person to ride - otherwise, it's just for trash or objects, neither of which you have to spare. Lastly, there's hallways to the left and right, branching diagonally ahead. Those might lead someplace interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo where do you head now?</span></div></div>",

Sure enough, that was the sound of a locking mechanism shattering irreparably. She meant what she said, because <i>of course she did,</i> which means you're definitely not getting through either of those doors now. Finding a way out of here is going to turn out trickier than just returning here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a few steps of tile before a staircase leading down. It's dimly-lit here, with only a few flickering lights along the ceiling as you travel on down. There's a handrail on both sides you can hold onto - odd that the Empire has safety regulations, you think passingly, hoping to distract yourself from your predicament. Your thoughts, however, prove ineffective in distracting you from the deafening silence, broken only by the sound of your bare soles slapping gently against each stair following the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk is mind-numbing, and seems to last far longer than it should. Getting back to the room - to safety - quickly is going to be a gamble at best, impossible at worst. It's as you think over how retreat might even work in a situation like this that you realize you've reached a break in the path, one leading forward and one leading right. Not far down the right path is a door in the far wall labeled 'break room', and on the opposite wall is a door labeled 'equipment room'. Down the hall directly ahead is a lone door <i>also</i> leading into the break room. There also appears to be a vent about at chest level with the grating removed, with nothing but a bit of warning tape over it indicating it shouldn't be entered. Maybe they meant to replace it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond that, the path straight ahead seems to stop being tile past the door and vent and looks like it's... <i>wriggling.</i> Your toes curl at the sight of rubbery-looking purplish feelers, about the length of a finger each, numbering easily in the thousands affixed to the floor - <i>acting</i> as the floor, as a sort of writhing carpet, up ahead. Going that way sounds like a bad idea, unless you're looking to laugh a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe right hallway seems to reach a dead end, eventually, but there's another door on the other side of the tendril-y floor. Maybe you could travel through the break room, to avoid walking barefoot across those - but someone could be in there. Crawling through the vents occurs to you as an idea, but it looks like a bit of a squeeze. Then there's the equipment room, which could be valuable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what to do?</span></div></div>",

So down the hall you go, stepping carefully and quietly, until you reach the door and head through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side, you find... all sorts of things. This room's pretty big - about four times the size of 'your' room, if you had to guess, and it's filled to the brim with <i>stuff.</i> The issue is, there's everything here from stationary restraints in various forms along the walls to what appears to be cabinets of standard-issue gear for the guards.

There's a moment where it looks like the bot before you is processing something - after which she turns around on a dime and begins to walk rather quickly. \"<b>Please follow me, guest user,</b>\" she requests, and with a moment's hesitation, you do, running to ensure you keep up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to weave between stacks of equipment, towered so high you don't even really know where you're going or how to get back out. It's at the point you start to worry about this that you feel a pair of hands firmly placed on your wrists - the android's, whirling you around and into the air, plopping you down and knocking the air from your lungs as you land in a hefty metallic chair. Once your behind has collided with a cushion on the center of the seat, you feel a pair of thick metal restraints clasp around your wrists, replacing the android's hands. She ducks down and uses her now-freed hands to clasp your ankles in place before you've had a chance to say a word of objection - and before you know it, your ankles are restrained to opposite legs of the chair, unable to so much as kick even an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Guest user equipped.

You don't even have a moment to say a word to the android before you notice thick, serpentine metal cords worming about in the air, capped off by white-gloved hands. There's a tremendous number of them - more than you could ever fight off, even if you weren't restrained - but suddenly your position makes a lot more sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hands begin to close in on you. You gulp as the first one slowly begins to trace circles around your navel, biting your lip to force back giggles. Another pair start to stroke up and down your underarms, making you start wiggling your hips, trying to get your torso away - only for that to move you directly into a pair of fingers near your sides, which prod at you the more you squirm. Lastly, showing a total lack of restraint, you feel - just for a moment - a pair of hands spider their fingers wildly along the soles of your feet, making you burst out laughing out of shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahahaha! Aaaah-- ahahaha--! Ngh...!\" You press your lips together hard and suck in a long breath through your nose, knowing you're not going to get out of this easy.

Nothing could prepare you for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes in and you're gripping at the ends of the chair's arms, holding your breath for quarters of a minute at a time before sputtering, gasping, giggling for a second or two, then barely catching your breath. You've found a pattern, but even in the slightest mistake you feel yourself faltering on the brink. Even as it feels like you've learned how the many sets of hands play with you, they try something new, driving you further up the wall and closer towards madness. You've tried scrunching your toes, but then they poke under your arms, or clasping your upper arms to your sides makes a finger wiggle in your navel, and you just can't protect everything at once. They always get something. There's <i>so many.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes in and you're beyond the point of having broken a sweat. A couple times you've burst out laughing for a few seconds, but you've managed to rein yourself in by the skin of your teeth. There's a short time where you notice them all stop, and you're left to gasp and pant and watch the mass of hovering hands wiggle their fingers over your fatigued body. You know they're going to keep at it. It's just a matter of when, and that's the worst part. Every time you let your breath go, it feels as though your heart is going to stop, out of fear that's when they'll finally close in again. But miraculously, they fall back upon you when you've got half a breath left in you. You've recovered just enough not to totally lose it, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour, though, and you're far gone again. You don't have the energy to try and actively resist anymore - you feel too heavy. The best you can hope to do is politely ask your body to move at some point, but that's mostly just interpreted as effort-wasting squirming and twitching. Rather than getting used to it, it feels like it's getting worse - like this thing is learning where and how it gets the best reactions. You're certain, thirty-five minutes in, that it can't possibly get worse... and then, to your horror, you notice a pair of feathers and a pair of electric toothbrushes get passed between various hands in a moment of pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForty-five minutes in, and you feel as though nothing could possibly make this more tortuous, though your mind knows better - with what little it can stand to think, it's learned that there will <i>always</i> be more ways for this damned chair to try and make you squeal. Fortunately, you're not sure you even have the breath for that anymore. You're still managing to resist laughing, if only just barely, but it's driving you mad. You're damp with sweat, and you feel like you lost bladder control a long time ago, but you're not sure... it might be something else, because you're starting to think, whether you like it or not, that this might just feel nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels like it's been an eternity. You don't have it in you to even tense your muscles, now, so all your vulnerabilities are worn bare and totally exposed. The many hands still ruthlessly exploring every inch of your skin with the most tortuous of soft touches leave you now gasping and panting - you don't have it left in you to laugh, but you can't hold your breath any longer, or your lungs protest. Still, you can't help but feel a smile forced across your face, leaving you looking as though you're in exhausted bliss, whether you are or not... and you're thinking that look is honest. You want it to end, but it feels kind of pleasant. It's humiliating, but you're the only one laughing. And the whole time, in the back of your mind, a certain someone remains. You're thinking of her. She wanted this. No, she wants this, still. She's probably watching, even now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>One hour elapsed. Equipment relief protocol active.</b>\" You gasp as you feel your restraints close back into the chair, and the hands rubbing at your body shrink away out of sight. You can't turn your head to see where - you can barely lift a muscle, at this point - but you do see the android from earlier return to you. You'd love to curse at her or beg her for help or stumble away or do <i>anything</i> but simply lay in the chair like a ragdoll, but your body refuses every command you give it, leaving to fate what happens as you're picked up by the wrists. Your legs dangle beneath you uselessly and you pant for breath, reddened cheeks streaming with laughter-induced tears. \"<b>Prisoner Analysis... complete. Dehydrated. Requires bathing. Evacuated bowels. Appears aroused. May require further testing...</b>\" she states, hiding not a bit of her mechanical, cold, and calculating nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..You pause for a moment. Did you hear that right? Further testing? Aroused?! No! No, you won't be put through more of this! A second wind comes over you - you feel the energy to speak, to move, to fight flow through you again. It's not much, but it's enough, or at least you think, but what this comes from is beyond you. Do you use it while it lasts?</span></div></div>",

It's a bit dim, making you wish you had some kind of light source, but given you don't even have shoes right now, that seems a bit much to ask for. Even still, there <i>is</i> a flickering white light around one of the corners here, so you're not entirely blind. You can't see behind you, but you can see ahead.

You can reach farther in, but you can't move yourself forward like this. Nothing is within reach of your hands, so you can't grasp at things to try and pull yourself forward. You kick your legs around behind you, only to find you lack any means of gaining leverage to push yourself back out. You manage to squeeze your shapely behind out of the narrow gap you've forced yourself into, if only a bit, but it's clear it's not going to budge anymore. Helplessly you start to kick and flail about, hoping to make some progress, only to end up accidentally pushing your crate beyond reach. Your feet don't quite reach the ground, so now you're stuck here - a pair of legs and an ass protruding from a hole in the wall. You hope you can get out before someone sees you, or worse, tries doing something to you while you're stuck like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as if someone out there can read your mind, you hear something. A door opening, then a few footsteps, and... \"...Aaah!\" you gasp, slapping your hands over your mouth as you feel <i>something</i> gently stroke the sole of your foot.

There's a soft smack, like the sound of lips - and then it hits you. She-- ah, that's weird! She just kissed your foot! Flustered, you beat on the side of the vent with one of your fists repeatedly and start kicking your legs wildly. Who <i>is</i> this freak?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahaha! Did I startle you?\" she teases, and then you can hear something... else. Something like a chain? Then... clicking. It's hard to concentrate on it enough to determine what it is, but then you feel it and immediately know what it is. Something clasps around one of your ankles, then the other, forcing them together - except as you try to kick with your bound-together legs, you find they won't move from being rather low to the ground. \"Well, you startled me. Haven't you heard, it's rude to kick people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou seethe in your improvised restraint. You'd like to shoot back some witty comment, but before you have the chance, you can feel a pair of long-nailed hands gently squeezing your thighs, as if prodding for weaknesses. \"Mmm, such shapely legs...\" she comments, and before you have the chance to say a word, she earns a squeak out of you by planting her hands on your rear - palming and gently kneading her fingers into your cheeks, making you start to buck in your impromptu prison. \"And what I would do for a chance to play with this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lets out a saddened sigh, and there's a moment of silence. \"Unfortunately, the Empress <i>insists</i> your first time is to be with her... perhaps some other time, I can have some REAL fun with you.\" She giggles, and then you feel a sharp smack of a palm crossing your ass hard. Your face feels hot at the realization you've just been <i>spanked</i> while stuck like this... and it didn't feel entirely bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... but there are a <i>few</i> things I could do with you. Yes, I'm sure you'd love to test out some <i>interrogation</i> tools of ours. Or maybe I should just give you a few toys to play with, until someone else catches you.\" She pauses thoughtfully for a few moments, and you can't help but jump a bit once she speaks up again. \"Or I could get you out of there, let you decide once you can get a good look at me. What do <i>you</i> think?\" You feel her nails start to dance along your inner thighs - not being able to see her or where she's getting at leaves you unable to hold back, so you find yourself quickly letting out bubbly giggles into the vent. No doubt all sorts of people can hear you like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you answer?</span></div></div>",

Your feet writhe helplessly beneath you, struggling to hold up your weight as your forward movement ceases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few ways, this is worse.

Moving had them brushing up against you, but now, they're limited to the little movements they themselves can make, which are a lot more limited.

You turn on your heel and start to run backwards, but your shortness of breath forces a laugh out of you - and before you know it, you're laughing uncontrollably and struggling to stay upright. The more you move, the more these things tickle. Your knees threaten to buckle under you, but you can't stop. You have to get off these things. You have to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou <i>had</i> to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to reach the edge, just barely, but not without falling over. No, only half of you has reached safety - the other half, from the waist down, is lying face-down on the carpet of writhing wormy fingers. Your eyes go wide and you start grasping desperately at the tile floor, trying to crawl off the tickling floor to no success as you feel not only your feet consumed by them, but the backs of your knees, your thighs - your entire legs surrounded and coated by the squirming mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHAHAHAHAHAHA! STAHAHAHAHP! STOP, STOP!\" You beg, kicking helplessly as tears stream down your giddy-looking laughing face - but it's too late. You look over your shoulder and see your legs coated even after you've raised them off the carpet. But they're not staying still: they're moving, and you notice they're settling themselves under your clothes! A belt of them has formed around your waist, which squirm down the top of your pants, while the rest make their way up the legs. You pull yourself farther from the carpet of tendrils in an attempt to avoid getting <i>more</i> of these things on you, then try to remove your pants before they manage to do whatever it is they want to do, but you don't have time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instant you start trying, all the strength in your body fades as you feel the entirety of your lower body consumed by unbearable ticklish sensations, from toes to hips. Your mouth simply hands open wide and silent as you lack the air to laugh - only to make up for it moments later with a long squeal that trails into unrestrainable belly-laughter. \"NAHAHAHAHAHAHA! NO, STAHP-- STAHAHAHAHAHA--!\" You shout through laughter, and receive no response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how long will this last?</span></div></div>",

As the they tear, more and more of the tendril like carpet protrudes underneath your pants. Tears begin to roll down your cheeks as more and more laughter pours from your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ticklish sensations begin to rise as you feel and tendril reach inside your belly button. Soon even higher. As you feel one graze your bottom rib you look over your shoulder once again to find your body beginning to slide further and further into the pit of tendrils. You flip your body over, hoping to get more leverage to push yourself out, but to know avail as one of these wormy fingers graze upon your armpit. Once more you collapse as your entire body is pulled into the mass of tickly carpet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, they begin to protrude underneath your clothes. You hear the cloth begin to tear, not with holes, but the entirety of the shirt is ripped in half as the wiggly tendril like carpet is free to explore the entirety of your bra-less torso. Hundreds slide into your armpits as your arms are pinned above your head. Hundreds lightly brush and torture your neck, alone only producing small giggles. However, along with this, a small team of five tortures your naval as they spin and wiggle freely in your deep innie. You feel hundreds more brushing against your sides and ribs and some of the longer ones able to reach around and cover your belly button. And thousands of the tendril like carpet tickle your sensitive breasts. Poking and prodding around the sides and under areas of your fairly large chest and spinning and squirming around your hyper sensitive nipples. Not to mention, your jeans had been pulled down beneath your butt leaving your bare bottom to be explored by the wiggly finger-like carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you can do is laugh and cry, praying that the tendrils would stop \"NOOOHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\" you scream \"I CAHAHAHAHAHANTTT!!!!\" You immediately fall into silent laughter as a series of black dots form all around your line of sight slowly dialating until your entire vision is black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up with what you passed out with. Extremely holey jeans exposing almost the entirety of your legs (pulled back up above your butt), and your shirt having ripped in half. Portraying more of a vest, leaving you with very little protection. But where are you?</span></div></div>",

        "created":1541651400,
        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">In a time and world unknown, the globe threatens to be swallowed by a powerful, if peculiar organization - a force simply calling itself the Empire, the likes of which unites itself under a belief that the strong should dominate, humiliate, and take and use all as they please. The Empire maintains control over a vast number of countries and employs among the strongest, smartest and most capable women to staff its many facilities throughout the world, the likes of which it uses as launching points for further conquering and for the collection and breaking of beautiful women into the 'toys' of Empire soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, despite this rather anarchistic view, those rallied under its name hold an almost reverent respect for a woman calling herself the Empress - someone who pulled together an army that has conquered continents, for one reason; a desire to stake a <i>personal</i> claim on all the most beautiful women in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough many who work against the Empire quickly crumble under their might, one organization has managed to throw wrenches in their plans time and again - an all-female civilian group calling itself the Agency, advocating for freedom against tyranny. Unfortunately for them, their numbers have been thinning of late - and when captured, the Empire has taken to tickling their newfound captives, often taking video of their captives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 torment for the purpose of taunting the Agency. After realizing how effective the method was, tickling became the go-to method for the Empire to assert its dominance - and as the Empire now threatens to take over the world through its bizarre method, the Agency sends one of its finest on a high-risk intel-gathering mission... or so the Agent behind the job thinks. In truth, she's an offering: being sent at the Empire as a gift to the Empress, in the hopes she will show mercy and spare the rest of the Agency from a life of torment for their treachery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow this deal goes, you - the Agent - will never know. All you know is that the Empress likes you <i>quite</i> a bit. She wants you, personally, to be one of the many women in her own harem. While you've been dropped into a highly secure underground facility in the desert, and told you may fruitlessly struggle all you please until you're willing to submit... the Empress will await you with open arms, ready to lovingly punish you for all eternity once you've had your fun. But will you take this as a moment of hubris, an opportunity? A chance to try, if foolishly, to escape? Or will you get to know the tastes of what will inevitably be your future mistress by playing around with the assortment of toys and traps strewn about this facility you're being held in by Gods-know-how-many guards?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat portion of your fate, at least, is left up to you. How will you choose to submit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Agent -- Everything You Need to Know</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, the reader, enter the mind of the Agent by reading this story. Her perspective is your perspective. All you know are things she, reasonably, would know. The story is never to be described in a fashion where you, the reader, know more than the Agent. The story is to be written in second person, as a result (eg. 'you read the paragraph about perspective, and find it lacking'). Now, if you are to enter the mind of the Agent, there are a few things you should know about her - a number of things, actually, which will almost certainly be relevant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Agent is a petite, curvy woman of about twenty-one years. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s youthful and energetic, but quiet and only uncommonly chooses to speak - though one must not mistake her for being cold or bitter. Even to her enemies, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite friendly, and at times even teasingly flirts. However, most if not all of her words come in the form of thoughts, bouncing around in her own head. She has learned quite well that silence is golden - silence keeps her alive and free, even if she does like to laugh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 kind of. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Agent, despite her bubbly personality, is calculating and in truth nearly a genius. While not very formally educated, her wit is far above par, and when she puts her mind to it, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite adept at reading others. However, she can be a bit lazy. She tires easily, and is quite quick to forget the gravity of a situation she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s involved in, and so rather than performing an important or necessary act, she may very well simply sit down someplace a bit out of sight and take a nap, or yawn openly in the midst of a serious conversation. While she has quick reflexes, could outrun most people, and has a good eye for evading (but not disabling) traps, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite lacking in physical strength. Any task that involves brawn which cannot be worked around cleverly is one she will certainly fail in. While she could very well nimbly escape a hold someone has on her, for example, she could not break it with force or put a hold on someone with her own strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Agent stands at about five feet and three inches tall, and weighs about one hundred and forty-six pounds. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s curvy, with a build that fills out her clothes rather tightly. Her skin is fair, though nearly pale, due to how much her work forces her to operate at night. She keeps her brown hair a bit short, but lets it run shoulder-length (she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always liked it long, but accepts it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not practical). Her stomach is a bit podgy, which she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sensitive about, and most of her body is a little squishy - she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a heavy girl, but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decently built, if lacking in defined muscle. Her feet are about average size, if a little bigger, roughly fitting a size seven shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Agent does not have a most ticklish spot. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very sensitive just about everywhere - including but not limited to her neck, ribs, breasts, sides, stomach, thighs, behind her knees, on her feet, and between her toes. Because of how common it is for an agent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most sensitive spot to be their feet, she is particularly embarrassed by being tickled there for non-personal reasons, and her self-consciousness about her larger thighs, stomach and chest result in her being embarrassed by contact there for more personal reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Agent currently wears only a ribbed white tank top which cuts off above the navel, and a pair of black form-fitting jeans which cut off at the ankle. Upon her capture, her bra, panties, socks, shoes, and equipment were taken from her, and so she is not wearing them as of the beginning of the story - though they may be returned to her later, with devious modifications...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you're struggling to form a mental image of how the Agent looks, try this: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/rIMaZVz.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/rIMaZVz.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ground Rules</b> (for writers, mostly)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re free to contribute to this story in all kinds of ways, but I do have preferences for how you contribute - a few rules, which I'll go in-depth on. While I'd like you to read them fully, the gist of each rule is in the first sentence. If you break a rule in an egregious way, I reserve the right to either edit your written portion or delete it. I'll put in my best effort not to be an arse about doing this, mind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the most part, I intend to be pretty lax. For instance, what level of tech is around is going to be pretty vague and up to the writer - you could involve robots with highly-sophisticated AI you can't distinguish from a human just as easily as you could toss in a pair of plain old wooden stocks right out of the Dark Ages, but here's a few things I'm gonna be picky about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Active members of the Empire, be they guards or some other variety of actor, should be female. The Empress is trying to make the Agent break, after all. Why give her an interest in men when her desire is to make the Agent willing to submit to the Empress herself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) The Agent may never, under any circumstances, actually escape. She may attempt escape (and, in fact, that is the main point of this entire story). She may even seem to be succeeding at escape. You may go so far as to make her think she has, in fact, succeeded in escaping. But she may not actually get out and away. If she vanishes into the surrounding desert, something will catch her - if you got her that far, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your job to figure out how to get her back. The goal of this game is not to \u00e2\u0080\u0098win\u00e2\u0080\u0099 by escaping, but to try to win and fail in the most amusing, humiliating, and ticklish ways possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.) The Agent is not to be seriously harmed, and she is not to have her body permanently mutilated or marred. Minor pain is fine, and anything that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t leave marks is okay - in fact, things which cause little bits of pain might be good to use if you want to make her get caught, by making noise. But the Agent is not to be given cuts, bruises, scars, or other signs of bodily damage, and is not to be made to suffer in excessively unpleasant ways. She is, further, not to have her body changed drastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.) The Agent is not to be given a highly-detailed personal profile. She does have a gender (female), and all that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s truly significant about her is detailed above. The reader does not need to know about how she loved to play with her dog when she was seven. What matters is that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ticklish, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in an Empire facility now, and her life is now centered around being toyed with. In fact, this goes for just about everything - unless it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s necessary, and as long as it makes at least some sense without context, exposition is something to avoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.) The Agent is never, under any circumstances, to act as a dominant. The Agent is in all circumstances to be either a willing or unwilling submissive. The Agent may tease, flirt, and attempt to dominate others, but if she does attempt this, she will not succeed at maintaining an upper hand long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6.) The Agent, as of the beginning of the story, does not have any desires beyond escape. She is indifferent (if still willing to experiment with) tickling and restraints, but she does not have any particularly potent lust for such things already. If you as a writer/reader want her to have that, she has to work up to it gradually - though she may do things such as subject herself to capture, traps, or other torment willingly out of morbid curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7.) The Agent is not to be stripped of her clothing long-term. She may be forced into additional equipment, but her basic outfit is not to be taken from her or heavily damaged. If it is damaged, it should be repaired eventually. While anyone and everyone is allowed to toy with the Agent, the Empress has made it quite clear to all her subordinates that she would like the Agent to remain a virgin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8.) The Empress is not to play a direct role in the story. She has many important things to do, and while she does have an interest in the Agent and her actions, she limits herself quite strictly to observance (and occasional input, if she gets a good idea). If she is involved for any reason, she has a particular fondness for the Agent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s laugh, likes use of restraints which completely immobilize, and never wastes an opportunity to let the Agent know she is free to surrender herself at any time. At her most direct, the Empress may leave short notes for the Agent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9.) No challenge should ever be truly insurmountable for the Agent. Should she fully put her mind to something and should she act in a clever enough fashion, the Agent can do just about anything (aside from escape, use brute force successfully, and act as a true dominant).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10.) No actor on part of the Empire is to join the Agent or defect from the Empire. Those who are a part of the Empire view the Agency as inferior and a force which does not deserve to be considered even an equal. At best, active members of the Empire may sympathize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11.) Obviously, keep your head screwed on and keep your common sense intact. For example, children aren't to be involved in this story, given the nature of it. On a less serious note, things from our world (ie. modern slang, music, and other cultural elements) wouldn't exist in a different world like this.</td>",
