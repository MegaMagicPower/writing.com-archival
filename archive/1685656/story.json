            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been few months since the Ragnarok incident at Area Zero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter much searching, the Resistance managed to eventually find Zero, heavily damaged but intact. Ciel was overjoyed and personally oversaw his recovery, and a little while after Zero was back to normal. On the  other side, Neo Arcadia was again under the control of Copy X, who was being carefully watched by the Four Guardians, who were also revealed to have survived the incident. In light of these events, a shaky truce had emerged between the two factions, and for a moment, all was well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this meant things got terribly boring. Sure, there was an occasional Maverick attack every once in a while, but such problems were easily dealt with. So, day in, day out, there was nothing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was the beginning of just one of those days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero was pulling on his armor and clothes in the Resistance Base and staring at himself in the mirror. He looked the same at he always did. Nothing had changed. Smirking slightly, he slipped on his gauntlets, his boots, his vest, and finally his helmet before walking out the door and into the hallway. He was going to pick something up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReploids scurried around him as he jogged to the elevator. Although things at the Resistance had died down quite a bit, there was still some things to do, it seemed. Zero nodded at a few passing Reploids that he recognized, and entered the elevator, pressing the button for the bottom floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the elevator hummed slowly down, Zero's thoughts drifted to Ciel. The young scientist and leader of the Resistance was still the same as ever, except for, perhaps, her apparent liking for Zero as more than a friend. It was no secret that Ciel liked, or even loved, the legendary Reploid, and many a time Zero had noticed other Resistance members smirking knowingly when he ever talked to her at length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero didn't really like Ciel in that way, he was perfectly fine being her friend. At least, that's what he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Maybe...but you'd think she was hot if she gained a few pounds, right?\"</i> Zero blushed at this thought, and shook the thoughts out of his head as the elevator doors opened. The truth was, he was a FA, or \"Fat Admirer.\" In short, he liked fat girls. He didn't know how exactly he developed this particular fetish, but he noticed it when some of the bigger female members of the Resistance talked to him and he felt his eyes drifting to their large chest or swaying behind when they walked away. Apparently he liked it. And this was the reason why he was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crimson Reploid had stopped in front of an abandoned room on the bottom floor. He looked around to make sure no one was looking, then quickly and quietly entered the room towards a pile of holomags on the floor. The room used to be occupied by another member long ago; now all that was left was a small collection of old holomags. However, these holomags were filled with pictures of curvy, plus-sized female Reploids; they were, in short, BBW magazines. Guilty pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero picked up the topmost one and glanced at the cover, feeling a familiar heat rise to his face. Suddenly, he stopped. <i>\"Why am I looking at this? What if someone finds out?\"</i> The Reploid shook his head. <i>\"This is stupid. I don't need this.\"</i> He wanted to just toss the magazine away and never come here again, but a certain part of his mind stopped himself. <i>\"Come on...look at how hot this is. Why don't you just take this back to your room for some \"privacy?\"</i> Zero shook his head, trying to clear his perverted thoughts, when suddenly the door opened behind him. \"What are you doing here, Zero?\" It was Ciel's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Reploid jumped and tossed the holomag he was holding into the small pile in front of him, and quickly slid the pile with his foot into the darkened corner of the room. Then he jogged over to the slightly-opened door, where he could see Ciel's face via the light filtering through. His mind raced. \"Um, nothing. Just exploring the bottom floor.\" Ciel said nothing, so he continued nervously, \"And so I found this room and, uh, there was nothing there, so I decided to...\" (As he said this Zero stepped through the door and shut it softly behind him) \"...leave the room, and then, um, you showed up, and I think I have a training session right now so I'llseeyoulaterbye!\" With that, Zero sprinted full tilt down the hallway and practically dived into the elevator, the doors shutting behind him. Ciel was still standing in the same position, utterly speechless. \"What...was that about?\" Frowning, she opened the door Zero had just closed and stepped into the darkened room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first glance, there was nothing of importance inside the room, only gray steel walls all around. However, on further examination, there seemed to be a stack of holomagazines haphazardly strewn in the corner. The blonde scientist walked over to the pile of magazines and picked up one. Turning it over, she stared at the cover and instantly blushed. <i>\"Is this...is this what I think it is?\"</i> Scantily-clad female Reploids and humans stared suggestively back at her as she flipped through the magazine, eyes wide. <i>\"Was Zero...was Zero actually looking at this? Does that mean...does that mean he likes it?\"</i> She flipped through a few more pages and then put the holomag down, thinking. In truth it wasn't that weird. Zero was a Reploid, sure, but he was also still a guy. Ciel smirked, amused. He always acted so innocent and cute, but apparently he had another side to him. The scientist giggled and then frowned, looking back down at the holomag. <i>\"So...if I was...bigger, he would like me?\"</i> She always wondered why Zero would seem distracted when a curvy female Resistance member walked by him, but she never thought it was...this. But...would that meant that if she gained weight, Zero would notice her? The truth was, she always wanted to see what would happen if she just let herself go, and now...now there was a reason to do so. Ciel looked down and placed a hand on her trim stomach, wondering what it would feel like to be bigger. She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would she do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ciel nodded to herself in the silence of the darkened room, blushing slightly. <i>\"Ok...I guess I'll try to get as big as I can. But where to start...?\"</i> Suddenly, she had an idea, and her eyes brightened. \"I've got it!\" She then walked briskly out the doorway and into the hall, determined to set her plan into action. As she waited in the elevator she smiled to herself. Zero would be hers in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, Ciel was sitting in her room, with various trays, carts, and plates of food surrounding her. On all of them were piles of fattening foods, from French fries to bacon cheeseburgers to pizza to frozen dinners, all ready and prepared for her to eat. Ciel was sitting on her pink bed and gazing at the absolute feast that awaited her, wondering which dish she would eat first. She then stood and walked over to her door, making sure it was firmly locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't actually that hard to get all this food from the Resistance supply depot, since she, the only human in the base, was the only one who needed to eat anyway. That's why none of the members raised any questions as she walked back and forth with large amounts of food in her arms; they didn't need it, they didn't care what she was doing with it. And so the process didn't take very long at all; the scientist didn't run into Zero either, of which she was thankful. But now she was committed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting back on her bed, she sighed and rolled one of the trays of food closer to her. \"Well, I guess I better get started. She wasn't quite sure how much she was going to eat; she was just going to eat as much as she could. So she started with a large bacon cheeseburger, and brought it to her lips, taking a small bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chewed slowly and softly, like a girl her age was expected to do, and swallowed, the meat sliding down her throat. Soon a large smile appeared on the girl's face. \"Wow! This actually tastes really good!\" And with that, she took a larger bite out of the cheeseburger, with some of the cheese getting on her face, and chewed faster and less daintily. After finishing the burger, Ciel rubbed her stomach and moaned at the taste. \"I have to eat more...\" She concluded, and reached for another burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time flew by as Ciel continued to eat, finishing all of the burgers and moving onto other foods like the large sausage pizzas, some subs, and a giant bag of barbucue chips. As she kept going Ciel found herself eating less and less politely; she soon started eating two portions at the same time, getting bits of food all over her face and clothes, and chewing with her mouth open because there was so much food in it. As she got into it she started literally shoving food as fast as she could into her mouth, pausing often to belch loudly and rub her swollen stomach. Finally, she lay back, moaning, on her bed, when she couldn't eat any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh...*urp* I'm so stuffed...\" Ciel burped again and blushed at her manners, but still rubbed her stomach because it hurt so much. \"Excuse me...\" She had managed to eat quite a sizable amount of food; still, there was a lot more of it to go. Ciel slowly stood up, groaning, and looked at herself in her full-length mirror. She looked completely the same, except her stomach now pushed out a few inches, making her look like she was just starting pregnancy. It was quite noticeable, Ciel realized, and she wondered how she was going to explain her expanded belly to Zero the next day. It was already late at night, and the scientist wanted nothing more than to go to sleep and digest her meal. She brushed some of the aftereffects of her all-day gorge off the covers of her bed, and lay down. She then closed her eyes, let out a small hiccup, and drifted off to sleep. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ciel was woken from her sleep by a loud roar. Startled, she stood up and looked at her clock, which confirmed it was the next day. She looked around the room, but there was nothing there except for the large tray of food. So what had made that noise?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer came when Ciel heard heard the the roar again, and realized it came from her stomach. Blushing, she said to herself, \"I guess I've gotten a bigger appetite now.\" Ciel's belly had never roared in hunger like that before in her life. Ciel had also never felt so hungry before either. She realized that as she continued to eat more, her body was going to start craving more food, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother roar of hunger came from Ciel's belly, along with sharp hunger pains. \"Okay, okay,\" Ciel said to her belly in some vain hope that her stomach with stop growling, \" I'll go make breakfast.\" Her belly gave a roar of agreement, and Ciel started to make breakfast by selecting specific types of food from the tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, Ciel was finished making her breakfast, which consisted of toast, eggs, bacon, pancakes, waffles and doughnuts. There was two bottles of syrup there, and a carton of milk along with a gallon of juice to help wash her meal down. Ciel licked her lips in anticipation, and her stomach roared with hunger again. Ciel began to dig in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter yesterday's first binge, Ciel had lost most of her manners. She was starting to eat like a pig, and despite being embarrassed at her piggish manners, all she wanted to do was wolf down as much as possible. She didn't care how she ate them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started off with her pancakes. The pancake stack was huge, and was made of dozens of pancakes, and looked like a tower on the plate. Ciel began to open her syrup bottle and poured on her tower of pancakes, but she was so hungry that she decided unscrewed the top, meaning that instead of the syrup being poured gently onto the pancakes, it just spilled out of the bottle in a flood of syrup, and drenched the pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel cut out a large piece of the top pancake and ate it. Ciel enjoyed the taste of the hot pancake in her mouth, especially now that it was drenched in syrup, and wanted more.She started to cut out larger pieces of pancakes, but Ciel thought this took too long, and started to take entire stacks of pancakes with her forks. Soon the entire tower of pancakes was gone, leaving behind only a plate full of syrup to indicate it had existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel unscrewed another syrup bottle, and spilled it over her tower of waffles, similar to her tower of pancakes. However, Ciel had discarded her fork, and picked up entire stacks with her hands. She kept putting in more and more waffles into her greedy mouth, and started spilling crumbs out of her mouth, covering her mouth in a coat of syrup. Soon, the tower of waffles was gone, and Ciel started to lick off the syrup she had on her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went after her toast next. As she started eating them however, she was feeling unsatisfied. She eyed the eggs and bacon, and got an idea. She started stuffing each eggs and bacon between two slices of toast and ended up making sandwiches. She wolfed down the sandwich she had made, leaving behind several crumbs and covered her cheeks with grease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Ciel went after the two dozen boxes of doughnuts she had brought. Ciel didn't really have a favorite type of doughnut, so her boxes were filled with many different types. From glazed to powdered, from chocolate to jelly-filled, Ciel ate them all, although Ciel's face now had Jelly and powder added to her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Ciel was done with her meal, and as a finishing touch, reached for her gallon of juice so she could quench her thirst. But Ciel had forgotten to bring a cup. As Ceil began to get up, she eyed her gallon of juice. She remembered how she wolfed everything down like a pig and decided to go one step further. She sat down, picked up her gallon of juice, unscrewed the cap, and started to chug it down. Like a baby drinking it's bottle, Ciel started to chug it down, and only sound being made in the room was Ciel gulping down her juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Ciel had finished her gallon of juice. She reached for her milk to wash her breakfast down. She opened the carton, and like with the gallon of juice, and drank it straight from the carton. Gulp... gulp... gulp... that was the only sound being made in the room as Ciel drank the cool liquid and had it slide down her throat. Not all of it reached her mouth however. Some of the milk had spilled on her face, but at this point Ciel was more interested in her milk then what was on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a few minutes, Ciel had emptied her carton. and put it on her desk. Her stomach growled, and Ciel put a fist to her mouth and let out a huge burp, even bigger then the ones she had yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, unlike yesterday, when she was embarrassed by it, this time she just giggled and patted her slightly bigger stomach while letting out a content sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that was a big one! But all that gas had to come out, sooner or later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel grinned, rubbed her stomach, and enjoyed the feeling of being stuffed, though not as much as yesterday. After she was done rubbing, she got up and took a look at her self in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach was now protruding outwards more than it had been yesterday, and her shirt was lifting up a little and showing her belly button. Since she had never cleaned herself after yesterday's binge, Ciel face's face looked like a mess, covered now in jelly, grease, syrup, powder, and other such things. Her face had gotten a little chubbier, and Ciel thought it made her look cuter. Her breasts had also grown, and Ciel held them up, examining the couple of cup sizes she had gone up in the last two days. She also turned around and looked at her butt, which was a little more rounder and curvier than it was before. Ciel smiled softly and gave it a little shake, then went to the bathroom to clean up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she washed her face and clothes, Ciel grew a little worried about what Zero was going to say about this. Granted, she knew that Zero liked big girls, but she was worried that he thought she had grown too big, or that she grown to little. But as she pondered this for a while, she realized that even if Zero didn't like her, she had already started her binge, and she should finish it and gain a few pounds no matter what Zero's reaction was. She smiled and patted her belly, letting out a small burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*urp* \"Excuse me...\" The girl giggled and wondered what Zero was doing...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Ciel was left wondering in her room where Zero was, Zero was currently in the training room polishing up on his fighting skills. The training room consisted of an gridded white space where random enemies were generated and expected to be defeated. Zero was doing just that with his Z-Saber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwirling the sword around him, he spun and cut a Pantheon in half before rolling to avoid the shots of another. Jumping up, he brought the hilt of the sword crashing down on the other Pantheon's head, denting the casing and smashing the red light that was inside. The two enemies disappeared and twelve more appeared in their place. Zero quickly switched weapons; putting his saber away and pulling out his shield boomerang. He spun once to gain momentum before hurling it into the path of his twelve foes. After the boomerang left his hand he dashed forward and flicked his wrists, pulling and activating the Recoil Rod and spinning them in his hands before bringing them to bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shield boomerang cut through two of the enemies before flying further down the room and out of sight. Zero dashed into the remaining group of Pantheons and stabbed his right tonfa into one robot's head. Twisting and crouching, he ripped the head from the body and threw it at another assailant, smacking it in the face with a resounding <i>crack</i>. He spun quickly, cutting four enemies in half completely, before ducking and kicking 360 degrees around him like an expert breakdancer, dodging the bullets flying over him and tripping up several of the robots. At this time the shield boomerang came back around from its long journey down the room and cut through three Pantheons in midair. The last two Pantheons aimed and pulled their triggers as Zero rose, firing directly at the Reploid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero raised the Recoil Rod and spun them expertly in front of him, deflecting all the bullets and slowly taking a step forward as the robots continuing rapid-firing. The distance slowly closed until Zero was a couple feet away, still blocking the never-ending hail of bullets pouring from the Pantheon's guns.Suddenly he jumped, over the path of bullets, and before the enemies could adjust their aim he twirled and split-kicked, hitting both of them in the head at the same time. Then he twisted once more and brought the tonfa around, slicing them cleanly in half before landing. With a flick of his wrist and arms, he sheathed the weapons with a <i>click</i> as the final two Pantheons crashed to the floor behind him. Smirking to himself and clearly satisfied, he left the training room to take a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later, Zero emerged from the bathroom, his helmet and jacket off as he walked down the hall, drying his still-wet hair with a towel. He was going to Ciel's room to see how she was doing, as he hadn't seen her since that embarrassing incident on the bottom floor. As he walked down the endless hallway he could feel the stares of several female Reploids on him; undoubtedly admiring his toned physic and cooing. The red Reploid blushed and avoided their stares as he pulled his signature red jacket over himself and zipped it up. Soon he found himself in front of Ciel's room. He knocked on the door. \"Coming!\" A familiar female voice sounded inside and Zero smiled to himself. He liked Ciel, but not necessarily \"like that,\" as many of the female Reploids in the base thought. <i>\"But what if she was bigger?\"</i> a voice in his head said, <i>\"What if she was a lot bigger? All curvy and bloated and huge...\"</i> Zero mentally slapped himself and blushed bright red. <i>\"No, stop it! She's my friend, for God's sake! Just a friend! She's not some sex doll! Control yourself!\"</i> At that moment the door opened and Ciel appeared, staring at the Reploid (who was still a little red) and was mid-way through drying the rest of his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Zero!\"</span></div></div>",

Zero chuckled and slung the towel over his shoulder, his hair sufficiently dry. \"What are you up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing really. Just keeping up with the daily reports and monitoring Neo Arcadia. The usual. What about you?\" The blonde girl had cleaned up significantly since her last stuffing, so her room looked the same as it always did; there were no chip bags, stains, and certainly no carts that carried tons of food earlier that morning. Ciel was wearing the same thing she usually was, so at first glance all was fine. However, as the girl moved over and sat down on her bed, Zero frowned. Was she...bigger than usual? The black fabric that covered her arms and legs seemed to be clinging tighter to her than when he saw her last. As he nonchalantly leaned up against the frame of the door and pretended to mess with his gloves, his eyes took a cursory look at her legs. Was it just him, or did her thighs seem to be thicker; her hips wider? It certainly looked like it, by at least an amount that was noticeable. Had she decided to gain weight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel, on the other hand, tried to suppress a smile as she watched Zero take quick glances at her body. She wanted him to know, and to notice. Smirking a little, she closed her eyes and stretched, arching her back and pushing her bigger chest outwards. Opening her eyes, she smirked again as she noticed Zero had turned his head, a slight blush evident on his cheeks. Oh yeah, he noticed all right. \"Zero? Something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero blinked and turned back to the girl, slightly distracted. \"Huh? Oh...I was just in the training room, that's all. Trying not to go rusty. Playing around with all the weapons.\" He paused. \"The usual.\" Yeah, there was no doubt about it: Ciel had gained a little weight. Not that he was complaining, but noticing her cuter face and curvier proportions was distracting him in more ways than one. He shifted, feeling something synthetic harden slightly in his pants. <i>Damn it, not now...</i> Slipping on his helmet, he nodded at Ciel. \"Well, I'm actually feeling a little tired, so I think I'm going to take a nap in my room. Call me if you need anything, ok?\" With that, he tapped the door frame with his hand and walked out. Shaking his head in the hallway, he couldn't help but feel a little confused. On one hand, he was glad at the changes that were occurring, but he wondered why she had suddenly decided to do this. <i>Maybe she knows something I don't.</i> Either way, he was definitely going to watch and see what happened next.</span></div></div>",

From pasta to pizza, from cakes to doughnuts, from chicken to turkey, she had a whole lot of food in front of her. Ciel began to dig in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel went after her pasta first. She grabbed her fork, picked up a whole lot of spaghetti from one plate, and dumbed into her mouth,. She slurped it up quite loudly, as she didn't care if anyone heard her or not. She slurped up several plates of spaghetti before she went for the meat lover\u2019s pizza she had on her plates. She ripped off two slices at a time and stuffed them down her throat. Some of the cheese fell from her pizza and onto her shirt, but Ciel was too busy eating to notice. She let out a hearty burp after she finished most of her pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel lifted up her cheeseburger. The cheeseburger were what people with have called a triple quarter pounder centuries ago. But Ciel didn't care what they were called as she scarfed them down. Her black undershirt had slowly risen to make more room for her growing belly. She paused as she rubbed her belly to fell how big it was, enjoying how big it was getting, and covering it in grease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tore several bags of chips, and scarfed them all down. Then she went to the bags of butter popcorn she had made and scarfed them down too. She enjoyed the taste of the butter as it went down her throat. Ciel's undershirt had risen even further, and covered half of her stomach now. Her pink shirt was clingy tightly against her growing chest, and her pants got tighter around her butt. Still, Ciel took no notice of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel went after the turkeys next. These turkeys were the ones you would see at a Thanksgiving dinner. Broke of a wing on one of them, and wolfed it down until only the bones were left. Soon, all the turkeys were gone, leaving only behind their bones. Ciel quickly began to scarf down a bunch of doughnuts she had bought along, leaving crumbs behind on her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel began to wolf down her tacos next. She had stuffed them with so much meat, that it filled almost the entire taco. Ciel ate each taco in two bites, although some of the meet landed on her face and on her stomach. Ciel reached for the pot of beans she had gotten, and wolfed them down. After she emptied the pot, Ciel laid a huge, wet fart, but only giggled and said, 'Ah... that felt good.\" and did another one. Ciel was enjoying farting, as she liked the feeling of all that gas being built up inside of her and then coming out all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel scarfed down as many things as she could. Pretzels, subs, ham, juicy steaks, it didn't matter. Ciel ate them all. her clothes were feeling extremely tight now, with her black under shirt and pink over shirt booty having tears in them from Ciel's belly. Her shorts suffered the worst of it however, since a lot of the food went to her thighs and butt. Her shorts were clinging very tightly to booty, and had a few tears that showed a bit of Ciel's ass. But Ciel still didn't noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel was almost full now, and decided to finish off with dessert. She had made several large scoops of chocolate sundaes that she had made. She got her spooned and took out large portions of it, and drank up what was left of, leaving her face covered in chocolate. After leaving most of the sundaes behind for a later meal, she went over to and picked up some of the chocolate cakes she had made, and cut large portions with her knife. What was left of the cake was put into a fridge along with her ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel finished several cupcakes, and cookies, and brownies before she admitted she was full. This was Ciel's biggest binge yet, and it really showed. Her belly had grown and now she looked like a 9 month old woman about to give birth. Her breasts had grown into D-cups, and were squished inside her bra. Her face, covered in chocolate and grease, was now chubby and made her face cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as before, it seemed that Ciel's biggest growth was in her booty. Now it grown massive and each cheek were as big as basketballs now. Ciel loved her new booty, and shaked it a bit to see jiggle, and afterwards gave it a big slap to watch how it jiggled even more. CIel laid back on her chair and sighed. that was the last straw for her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRIP! RIP! RIP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel's under shirt, unable to take the growth of her belly, ripped apart. Likewise, her pink over shirt ripped apart too. Except for a bra that was barely holding in her boobs, Ciel's stomach was now naked, and didn't have any pressure on it anymore. Her shorts also ripped apart, showing Ciel's giant booty along with her bright pink panties; although her ass were so big that it stretched the panties into a thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this had happened before Ciel decided to gain, she would have been horrified and disgusted with herself. Instead, she laughed, patted her belly sand said, \"Wow, I've really gotten big! My clothes don't fit me anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeil looked at herslef and reliased she was still covered in grease and chocolate and waht what was left of her meal. She conidered going to take a bath and finding new clothes. Oo the other hand, she would like to play around a bit with her new bigger body...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ciel grinned as she looked at herself in the mirror. She liked seeing how big she had become. A bath could wait. Ciel wanted some fun for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel looked at her giant belly. She smiled as she rubbed her belly so she could feel how soft and jello like it had become. This also had the effect of spreading the chocolate and grease on her belly, given her a shiney, dark tan. She patted her stomach abd giggled as she jumped a bit to watch it shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel unhooked her bra and let freed her breasts for their confiments. For a girl who had been flat for most of her life, Ciel was delighted to have such big breasts. She rubbed them, and moaned in pleasure. She contiuned rubbing them for several moments before she finnaly stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Ciel concetrated on what was big as her belly, if not bigger: her booty. For a girl who barely had a butt, Ciel loved her butt the most. She loved how big and jiggly it had gotten, and how it swayed when she walked. She also noticed that some people were staring at it, in shock. Ciel slapped it, and watched it jiggle for a few moments before it stopped<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she took a bath, Ciel wanted to do one last moment to have fun with. She remembered something. Back when she was researching on ways to create a new type of information, she acdiently discovered old files from centureis ago. the file contained several things, including information about art, culture, literature, and music. Ciel was fascinated with it, and liked listening to old music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was one song that stayed with her. The song was called 'Baby Got Back\" and when Ciel heard, she thought it was the most perverted song she had ever heard. But it got her thinking, what would she be like if she had a big booty. Se ended up having dreams in where she had a booty so big, that all the men loved it, including Zero. In fact, one of the reasons she had always secretly desired to gain weight was so that she would have a giant ass the shake. She memorised the lyrics, and danced while singing, shaking her small butt while dreaming of having a big ass. While, she didn't have to dream anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel went to her private computer and found her music files and pressed play. Ciel sang in sync with the song, singing\" I like big butts and I cannot lie, you other brothers may deny,\" all the while dancing to the beat. Most of the dancing was centered around shaking her booty. But her panties, already staring on her bloated ass, were slowly staring to come part. But Ciel took no notice, as she was having too much fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer panties were really straining by the time Ciel got to, \"I like 'em round, and big, and when I'm throwing a gig.\" Her panties, already straining on her butt, were gaining more pressure because of her dancing. Still, Ciel paid no attention to it. In her mind, she was on stage, with Zreo watching, blushing and grinning as he witnessed Ciel's booty dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And kick tehem nasty thoughts, baby got back!\" The song finally finshed, and Ciel stopped dancing. This was the most fun she had in a long time, and enjoyed her giant booty's shaking and jiggling during the dance. Her panties were still on, but they had stating tearing up, and was one wrong movement away from ripping apart. Meanwhile, Ciel was finshed her fantasy. She imagined Zero clapping loudly, and Ciel decided to bow. That was also end of her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRIP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel was brought back to reality by the sound of something ripping apart. She couldn't look down because her breasts and belly were in the way, so Ciel moved a bit back. She saw her panties, now torn in two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel looked at them and laughed, declaring, 'My booty was too big for my panties to handle! But they were meant for the old Ciel! The new Ciel's got a fine behind that those panties ocouldn't take! Look out world: Ciel's got back!\" And with that, she gave her ass a good slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore all this weight ganing had started, Ciel had been a modest woman, and didn't brag about her body. But when still starting eating and brought out her repressed eating habits, it also brought out repressed parts of her personality. While she was still kind, sweet, and loyal to her firends, Ciel was also much more perverted now. She enjoyed bursting outt of her clothes, and loved seeing herself naked, and wanted to  play around with her bigger body. She was proud of big body, and wanted to burst out of some more clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But fist, a bath...\" Ciel mumured to herself. She  threw away her clothes, and went to take a bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel came out hours later. She had found a bigger pair of bra and panties that were quite tight on her, but it was going to take a while to make a bigger set of her old clothes, espically since she had ordered the set to be bigger then she was right now, becuase she kenw she would be bigger by the time it came. She was currently wearing a pair of  pinkbutton up pajamas, partly becuase she wanted tohet so big that the buttons would pop off. The bottom button was showing sings of stress, while the top one was showing no signs of stress. Her pants were quite tight on her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel yawned and feel asleep.</span></div></div>",

First she ripped open a bag of potato chips. She brought handfuls of the chips to her hand, crunching away at the bunches in her hands. The grease slapped against her face, as she greedily ate up all the chips as the crumbs fell onto her clothes. Five minutes later, she finished the bag and licked her hands of the grease. She ripped open three other bags and dug into them as well, filling herself up with more chips and getting more grease and crumbs on herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, she opened up a bucket of chicken legs and chowed down into them. She chomped on the skin and poured the gravy sauce into her mouth, swirling the food with the sauce as she continued to gorge into the chicken legs. She sucked all the meat off the bones and burped loudly as she dug into the rest of the bucket. Within two minutes she managed to scarf down over 20 chicken legs and tabs of gravy, the fried bits sitting on her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach had expanded a bit, sitting between 350 and 400 pounds as the once thin Ciel was now more than she imagined. A large fart erupted from her ass and shook her seat, as she sleepily giggled and patted her butt. She opened up a bag of chocolate bars and started shoving them into her mouth one by one, getting chocolate on her face and teeth. She washed them down with a bottle of cola soda, guzzling it down straight from the bottle and burping with each chug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next hour, Ciel kept unconciously devouring more food. Tacos, burgers, fries, turkey and beans completely vanished into her stomach. She washed them all down with gallons of milk, soda and maple syrup. Her stomach was several inches larger, popping open several buttons on her shirt, and her pants ripped open to expose her pantied ass. Her face was dirty with grease and crumbs and her pajamas would need a good cleaning to get off all the mess she left on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel was showing no signs of waking up, until...</span></div></div>",

Since it was early, Zero was dressed in his usual clothes, leaving behind his helmet. Finally, Zero found the room where the noise was coming from, and opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the room layed Ciel surroned by a ton of food. As he opened the door, Ciel was grabbing food and stuffing herself with it. She was covered in chocolate and grease that was on her mouth and stomach. Her patns had ripped and most of her shrit's buttons had popped off because of her larger body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero blushed redder then his outfit once he got a good look at Ciel's body. He kept staring at her  giant belly, and her giant ass that had ripped her pants. Zero suddently took notice that Ciel kept eating as though he hadn't entered the room. He also noticed that the last button that covered belly was quivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ciel?\" Zero spoke to Ciel but she didn't respong. \"Ciel!\" Zero spoke louder now, but Ciel was completely absorbed into her eating. Ciel was scarfing down several boxes of pizza, covering her in more grease. As she happily gorged herself, the button was shaking from the growing pressure of Ciel's stomach, trying to hanle her growing stomach, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe button couldn't handle the pressure anymore, and just popped off Ciel's shirt. It wasn't the last button on her PJ's, but it was the last button covering her belly. With it gone, there was nothing holding back Ciel's stomach, and it spilled over CIel's lap with a htud. Ciel pasued at this, let out a huge burp, nad patted her belly while giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero was completely shock at all this. He had never seen Ciel act like this before. But he wasn't sigusted by this. Rather, he liked Ciel stuffing herself, and though that she looked beatuful like this. But he was wondering why Ciel hadn't noticed, when he saw Ciel's closed eyes. \"No way... is she sleepwalking?\" Zero though to himself. He walked towards, Ciel shook her really hard, and yelled' \"Ciel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel blinked and opened her eyes. \"Zero? What's going on?\" Ciel was confused as to what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero responded with, \"You were sleepwalking, and ate a bunch of food.\" Ciel blinked, got up, and looked at herself. She saw her large, stuffed belly, and turned around to see her giant ass. Ciel was both shocked at what she while she was aslppe, and happy at how big she had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ciel.. what's going on? Why have you been gaining so much weight recently?\" Zero was determined to find out why Ciel was eating so much. Ciel considrred lying to Zero, but she knew he wouldn't accept a lie, and decided to tell him the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zero... I've been gaining weight recently because I now you like fat girls. I thought you would love me if I gained weight. But after a while, I realised I liked gaining weight. I love the feeling of being stuffed, and I love eating, and I love being fat.\" Ciel looked nervously at Zero. While Zero did like fat girls, she was worried that she had become too fat in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love it too.\" Zero looked at Ciel, blushing so red that she thought he was overheating. \"I've never seen anyone look as hot and sexy as tou. I don't want you to lose a single pound of fat ever, and I want you to keep gaining weight. I love you Ciel\" And with that, Zero kissed Ciel deeply, shocking Ciel, who quickly returned it. The two of them were in pure bliss, enjoying the kiss, when they broke away, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zero, I'm tired? Would you take me to my room?\" Ciel asked him. Zero replied with, \"Sure, Ciel. Let's get moving.\" The new couple began walking to Ciel's room, although Zero couldn't help but take a few peeks at Ciel's giant ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two enterted Ciel's room. Zero tucked into Ciel's into her bed, kissed her on the head, and said,\" Good night.\" And with that he left the room. Ciel went right back to sleep, smiling peacefully, as she dreamt of Zero feeding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWehn Ciel awoke the next morning...</span></div></div>",

Because of the recent peace between the two factions, the two now considered themselves friendly rivals, although their old habits toward each other emerged from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Quite outdated technology, Zero.\" The green reploid appeared at Zero's side and crossed his arms. \"The transervers at Neo Arcadia are far superior.\" Zero huffed. \"Well, they work perfectly fine, if you ask me. Now...\" (The red Reploid raised his hand and gave a mocking flourish) \"Can we continue?\" The two exited and walked down the hallway. They hadn't gotten far when a young Reploid girl suddenly sprinted around the corner and ran into them. \"Oof!\" The girl was knocked back onto the ground, and the two Reploids stared at her. Harpuia crossed his arms. \"And <b>who</b> is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, who appeared to be about eight years of age, looked up and blushed. \"Ah...Mr. Zero! M-Mr. Harpuia!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero sighed and picked the girl off the floor, dusting her off briefly. \"Harpuia, this is Alouette. She's essentially Ciel's daughter.\" The red Reploid smiled at Alouette, making the young girl turn red and clutch her neko doll closer to her chest. \"You mean she is your daughter too, then?\" Harpuia eyed the girl briefly before turning to Zero, smirking slightly. Zero blushed and looked away, knowing what Harpuia was getting at. \"No...but since we're on this topic, how are things with Leviathan?\" Harpuia turned an interesting shade of red and also looked away. \"I have absolutely no idea what you are talking about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Zero turned back to Alouette and patted her head, making the girl clutch her doll more tightly. \"So, Alouette, this is Harpuia, but you can call him Sage, ok?\" Harpuia huffed at this, but said nothing. Alouette nodded and stared at Harpuia, who gave a small nod. Blushing, Alouette whispered \"Bye\" to the two Reploids and scurried away. Zero sighed and stood up, shaking his head. \"Sometimes I don't understand that girl.\" Harpuia shrugged. \"Anyway, Zero, I must be going. Neo Arcadia needs me.\" The red Reploid rolled his eyes. \"You always say that when you need to go.\" The Guardian shrugged again. \"That's because it's always true.\" With that, Harpuia gave a crisp salute, and then turned and walked down the corridor toward the transerver. Zero nodded, then jogged down the hallway, heading to the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...</span></div></div>",

At this fact, Alouette sighed and walked over to the small mirror that stood at the corner of her room; examining herself, she realized that the two legendary Reploids would never like her in that way unless she somehow became older.
