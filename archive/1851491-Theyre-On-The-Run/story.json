I knew that new guard wouldn't be able to pass up a blowjob, and when he saw that he could have two of us for the price of one, it was just a matter of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys reflected on that moment when the guard dropped his pants, as well as his defenses. It was child's play to overpower him, take his keys and make their way out of the facility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a guard a blowjob was nothing new to the boys. That was part of life at the facility. Typically they didn't mind, since both of them had a near-compulsive urge to be sexual at all times. That's what got them in the facility in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys were handsome and charismatic, so finding willing sex partners had been easy for them since they were 12 years old. They started getting in trouble when parents of boys and girls all over the city began to learn what the twins were doing with their children. Ironically, what got them in the biggest trouble wasn't sex with an underage person -- it was with a consenting adult. Unfortunately, she happened to be the wife of the captain of the state police, who walked in and found his wife on all fours, sucking off Aron, as Adam banged away at her from behind. She claimed rape, rather than fess up to the fact that she had been having threesomes with these boys since they were 14. Soon they were classified as sexual predators, and off to the facility they went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they assessed their situation, they realized they needed a place to hide while something more permanent presented itself. Within easy walking distance were the following options:</span></div></div>",

The thirteen year old boy brushed the long, blonde strands of hair out of his eyes, looking up at his older friend's face hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as long as we keep our voice down,\" Kaleil replied. \"Let's go a little deeper into the cave, though, just to be safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe motioned with his hand, and Arzil followed as they carefully walked along the cave floor, watching out for any signs of wild animals -- or worse, human activity. So far, the cave appeared to be deserted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they had gotten a good hundred feet or so from the entrance, Kaleil stopped. \"That should be far enough,\" he said, having a seat on a large outcropping of rock. He pulled his sunstone from his pocket. It was weak and didn't provide enough light to fill the cavern like it would have if it had been fully charged, but it was more than enough to make it through the night safely. And, he reasoned, the less light they had, the less likely someone would spot them from the outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugghh...\" Arzil sighed as he sat, then lied down on the rock next to Kaleil. \"This has been quite a day. First, I find that my parents have been arrested for treason, then I just escape getting caught myself. I'm lucky that you came along when you did, Kaleil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" the fifteen year old shrugged, smiling, \"how could I let my best friend just get locked away in jail like that? I'd miss you so much that I would just have to break you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm glad you don't have to worry about that.\" Arzil leaned back against Kaleil, his head resting against Kaleil's shoulder for a moment, until Kaleil repositioned himself and allowed Arzil to lie down with his head in his lap. \"I'd know you could do it, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh, yeah, probably.\" Arzil smiled as he looked into Kaleil's eyes, thankful that, after all that they'd gone through today, things finally seemed to be quieting down.</span></div></div>",

Kaleil lifted the sunstone, trying to provide as much light as he could, but the shadows it threw everywhere made it difficult to--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?!\" Arzil whispered, pointing his finger out towards a direction where he thought he saw movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cavern was silent for a moment, but both boys soon made out the sound of heavy footsteps, slowly getting closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Kaleil whispered back, \"but whatever it is, it's probably not friendly.\" He reached to his hip where his pocketblade was hanging, his hand trembling as he unfolded it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think it's Inquisitors?\" Arzil asked, trembling more and more as the footsteps got closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds much bigger than that,\" Kaleil said, shaking his head. \"And it's coming from the back of the cave. Whatever it is, it's not human.\" He took a deep breath. \"We need to get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys turned to start fleeing, but were stopped when they heard the sound of a voice, low and booming. \"Don't be afraid. I'm not here to hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stopped, hesitant whether or not to trust the voice. Braving his fears, Kaleil turned around, holding up his sunstone again. This time, the outline of a figure was clearly visible, though the details were still shrouded in the darkness. But it's size\u2026 whatever it was, it was huge, at least twelve feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the blood of the stones,\" the voice said, sounding surprised , \"you're-- you're human. I thought humans had been extinct for centuries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaleil was taken aback at this. \"Extinct? What? There's a citydome of over four hundred million of us less than ten miles from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure paused before responding, \"Amazing. Simply amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, Arzil had turned around as well. \"W-who -- or what -- are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, the figure stepped forward, moving closer to the light. This made it easier to make out what kind of creature they were speaking to. As far as they could tell, the large figure was\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once Arzil realized that the look he was giving Kaleil wasn't one of platonic admiration, but of something deeper, he started to blush a deep red and sat up. \"Kaleil...since it looks like we're going to be living together for the foreseeable future...there's something I have to get off my chest.\" He shut his eyes and took a deep breath before, wracked with nerves, he continued, \"I--I love you, Kaleil. I have for a while now...and after all you've done for me today, I think you should know. I understand if this means you don't want to travel with me anymore...I just can't keep lying to you about how I feel!\" He looked back into Kaleil's eyes, desperately searching for a reaction--any reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaleil just sat in stunned silence for fifteen seconds before he could respond. \"I...I don't know what to say, Arzil.\" The younger boy started to frown. He had hoped that Kaleil might reciprocate his feelings...but now he realized how foolish that hope had been. His thought process was interpreted as his friend continued. \"So let me show you instead.\" He grabbed his younger friend's torso with both arms, pulling him closer to his body and ultimately propping up Arzil's back with his left arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaleil...what are you-\" Arzil began to ask, but quickly found himself cut off as his older friend leaned down and started to kiss him. Neither of them had much experience, but any concerns Arzil had about how well he was doing melted away as he realized Kaleil felt the same way that he did. After the kiss ended, Arzil found himself looking into Kaleil's eyes. They were a deep, dark blue, a color that reminded him of the few times he had visited Lake Arokal with his family. They almost seemed to shimmer in the light the sunstone provided, and despite everything he had been through over the last 12 hours, Arzil couldn't help but smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had a crush on you for the longest time, Arzil,\" Kaleil explained as he began to stroke Arzil's blond hair. \"I never thought you'd actually be interested in me, though. I was serious when I said I couldn't live without you--I'm so happy you're here with me and not rotting away in some dark cell.\" Once he was done talking, he leaned down and gave Arzil another kiss, much shorter than the last one but just as sensual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Arzil moved his right arm so that he could wrap it around his friend's muscular torso, he unintentional rubbed up against Kaleil's lap. Unexpectedly, he found that Kaleil's length was already stiff. Suppressing his innate bashfulness, Arzil gave Kaleil a sly look. \"Looks like you want to do more than just kiss me,\" he said, some of his embarrassment still showing underneath his coy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaleil returned his look with a grin of his own--a lusty one. \"Very much,\" he said simply, and with one swift movement, he grabbed the bottom of Arzil's shirt and pulled it up and over his head. In the low light the sunstone provided, Kaleil could just make out the younger boy's paleish skin tone and his lightly defined musculature. He had seen the sight many times before, of course, like when they went swimming together, or even the few times he'd seen Arzil leave the shower with nothing but a towel wrapped around his groin region. Briefly propping Arzil up so that he didn't get in the way, Kaleil followed suit, taking his pale blue shirt off and revealing his clear cut musculature. He wasn't beefy like many of the boys he'd seen in his classes at the Lyceum, but he was decidedly more muscular than Arzil, and his skin was much darker as well. They both smiled at each other's half-naked forms; both of them had definite bulges showing through their shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they could begin, however, Kaleil noticed something was wrong.</span></div></div>",

As she swims her handsome 12-year-old son, Kevin Wilson screams, \u201cCANNON BALL\u201d and jumps into the pool out of nowhere. He is dressed in a dark colored, speed-o like swimsuit, and that is all. The wave that Kevin created with that stunt splashes over Amber\u2019s smooth, fair skin, and gets her blond hair that she has been trying to keep dry wet. She was not worried about her hair turning green or anything like that; there was no chlorine in the pool. She just did not want her medium length blond hair getting wet. Her son comes out of the water to take a breath, and as the water rolls off his smooth, lightly tanned skin, and off his short lit-brown hair, he looks at his mom, cringes, than says, \u201coops, sorry mom.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As the two of them look at each other with their matching blue eyes, they hear something in the distance, and then see something heading right for them. They see a ball of green light heading right for them and naturally, they make a run for it. However, they never make it and the ball engulfs them both, and then vanishes. A split second later they both find themselves on a strange street, unharmed, still dressed in their skimpy swim suites. As they both stand up to dust off their still damp skin, they hear thunderous voices nearby. They look around and discover that\u2026  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Amber and Kevin look around in alarm because everything they saw around them looks strangely distorted, almost alien, and yet strangely familiar. As they look around their surroundings, the first thing they see is buildings the size of Mountains all around them. They also notice they are standing next to a trashcan that is easily the size of King Kong. The alleyway or Small Street that are on is as big as the Mississippi River to them, maybe bigger. They also see steam vents on the sides of the Small Street, or alleyway that look like the size of houses to them, and massive amounts of steam are coming out of them. They also see behind them a gigantic, empty can of Coke, an empty brown paper bag, and an empty banana peel. Kevin then says, \u201cthis can\u2019t be happening mom, where are we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d Amber says, \u201cbut judging by the size of everything around us, we are either having a hallucination, or we have shrunk down to the size of small action figures, maybe even smaller. I am not sure, but I bet we are around 2 to 3 inches tall, with me still being slightly taller than you are son. We both can\u2019t be having the same hallucinations, so we must have somehow shrunk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHow do we end up in the city?\u201d Kevin asks, \u201cAnd how we get so small?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAgain I don\u2019t know. I would rather be having hallucinations. Because our current sizes anything is a threat to us. Most animals will look at us as an easy meal, and I can tell you what most normal sized people might do to us,\u201d Amber says with dread in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cLike what?\u201d Kevin asks, \u201cWe would be much better off if the human found us, the giant are not, then if a spider or bird found us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI don\u2019t really know?\u201d Amber said, \u201cIf we run the wrong sort of people they could easily harm us, or do anything they want to us. I just don\u2019t want take the chance, we have to be careful who we seek help from, understood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kevin nods his head yes, and after their talk they continue to hear loud, thunderous voices nearby and they sound like they are getting closer. The voices also appear to be coming from at least two adolescent boys, maybe more. Kevin and Amber take a peek around the huge trashcan and see three young boys around Kevin\u2019s age, maybe older extremely close to them talking trash. These boys look like troublemakers, and every fiber of their tiny being tells them to avoid these three boys at all cost. However, fate can sometimes be a bitch. One of the boys looks down and sees the tiny mother and son hiding behind a trashcan. At first the normal size, yet giant boy assumes they are just dolls, lifelike dolls, but when he sees their heads move, everything changes. The normal size boy alerts his two friends to the presence of a tiny mother and son. Being extremely curious, the free bisexual boys naturally investigate. Before Kevin and Amber could react, the three giant boys have surrounded them. As Kevin and Amber hold on to one another and fear, one of these boys says with a smirk, \u201cWell, well, well, what do we have here? Two lifelike dolls or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMaybe they\u2019re just tiny people or something,\u201d another boy said. \u201cThey\u2019re too lifelike dolls, and they move around on their own. Maybe they\u2019re from another planet full of tiny people, or maybe their normal size people which somehow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI don\u2019t know, but the tiny woman is hot, and the boy is cute too. Maybe we could make some money or become famous if we take them to a university or sell them at a pet store,\u201d the third boy says. \u201cOr maybe we could keep them for ourselves, have fun with them, and make them do it. Have sex and make more tiny people. We do keep this breeding pair, and sell their babies to rich people. Heck we have a hot male and hot female here we might as well use them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYeah, I would sure like to watch them fuck. It would be like watching a tiny porno,\u201d the first boy says with lust in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In a tiny mouse like voice, Kevin says defiantly, \u201cstop it you perverts, she is my mom, and you can\u2019t make me do crap, especially to my mom. That\u2019s just plain sick!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYour mom hue, well I guess the tiny babies you two make might be retarded, two headed or something, but you might as well get used to it, you two will be doing the nasty before long,\u201d the second boy told them with a grin on his face, and a bulge in his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI sure wish we could feed them to something like a big snake,\u201d the third boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNo, how many times do we find tiny people. We just cannot kill them. However sex is another story,\u201d the first boy says with a lustful voice. \u201cIf we could find out how they shrunk, and make more shrunken people, that would be different, but until then we keep these two alive, understood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The three boys nodded their heads yes an agreement. However, before the boys to capture the tiny mom and son, an adult male, a pet store owner yells at them to leave, and gives them five minutes to do so. As the three boys talk to the adult, Kevin and Amber make a run for it. As a run for their lives\u2026</span></div></div>",

The old pet store owner, 50-year-old Tony is right behind them, barking orders at them. The tiny people watch as the giants literally turn over boxes, look behind garbage cans, in bags, and they even try calling them back to them saying in loud voices, \u201cCome on back, we didn\u2019t mean it. We were just joking.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The tiny mom and son continue to run as fast as they could, holding onto each others hands, and as then they run, they hear a thunderous voice above them, \u201cGOTCHA!\u201d Before the tiny people knew what was happening, they saw a giant open hand coming down for them, and the huge fingers gently, yet quickly wrapped around them both. As the two tiny people struggle in the giant\u2019s fist, they both look up to see they are in the huge fist of Eric. As Eric smiles down upon them with evil, lustful eyes, the tiny people see Eric walking over to the old man. Eric shows the tiny mom and son to the old man who still cannot believe his eyes. Eric hands them to the Tony and he loves how the tiny people feel when they squirm in the palm of his hand. Tony brings the tiny people into his office, and he says, \u201cCan you three find me more specimens like these two? I will pay for more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The boys having no idea how the mom and son got that way, smile and naturally, lie, \u201cSure we can\u201d Eric says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tony smiles and decides too\u2026</span></div></div>",
