            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It all started with a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the hectic things going on Shirou expected it to be another dream about the fire that haunted him. He never expected to have a dream about girls of all things, such a typical teenager thing was just...well it wasn't odd it just seemed to come at a bad time. The Holy Grail War was underway, it was all Shirou could do to survive against the relentless other Masters and their Servants. It was not a time to do anything at leisure, so it was odd that his mind seemed to linger on the opposite sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrior to the Holy Grail War there were a couple notable females in his life, Sakura and Taiga. They'd become something of his family over the years. Sakura was an increasingly attractive younger student and Taiga, a teacher, evolved into something of an elderly sister role. Then the War started and suddenly Shirou found himself surrounded by all these special girls. Rin Tohsaka, the perfect idol at his school now stayed with him and fought alongside him. Ilyasviel Von Einsbern, master magus and one of the most likely to win the war. The servant Rider, quiet and intimidating yet her beauty was still mesmerizing. Caster, whose face remained unknown to Shirou but radiated power and weakness at the same time. And then there was the most important one, the one who Shirou could never get off of his mind: Saber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber was...different from anything he'd ever met. She was strong yet frail. Stern but kind. Human but at the same time otherworldly. She was a one of kind woman. How he got such a Servant he didn't know. But to him she was a person first and then a Servant, not vice-versa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it was that thought process that explained the dream. All these people, attractive in their own ways, be they enemies or friends just looked like people right now. Shirou stood before them all. Relationships, past events, none of that mattered. All that seemed relevant was the fact he was a man, and they were women. Maybe his frustrated teenage libido was just affecting his dreams, but the reason didn't change their presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully Shirou took a step forward to Saber, her stern eyes were uncharacteristically shy. \"Shirou...\" Her voice sounded frail, like she would crack at any second and do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to pick her over me?!\" A voice shouted from the side, Shirou stared dumbfoundedly at Tohsaka. \"Idiot! Don't you know quality?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's precisely why he won't pick you.\" A young voice mockingly stated. Shirou's gaze turned to Ilya. \"Shirou wants to be with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that were true...\" A monotone voice broke in, now on the opposite side was Rider. \"Why am I even here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same could be said for me.\" Caster chirped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already live with him!\" A shy voice exclaimed, behind Shirou Sakura was blushing profusely. Beside her was Taiga who was strangely silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shirou.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" The young man looked back to Saber. She looked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...pick me right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's it going to be Shirou?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Go ahead and tell em!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voices began to conglomerate. The women surrounding Shirou seem to inch closer and closer until he finally just screamed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aah!!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small shout left his lips, he was alone again, in his room. \"Just a dream...\" Relief flooded into him. The memories of his nightmare quickly began to vanish. \"I wonder what that was all about?\" Shirou's hand reached up to scratch his scalp but something felt off. His room was really dark for some reason it seemed a lot more spacious. Everything looked different too. It still felt like his room but...it was off. As he kept looking around Shirou noticed an opening on his ceiling, outside it looked bright as day. \"Couldn't be...\" Shirou had a sneaking feeling in his gut. He approached the wall and gripped it, it was soft like a cushion. Eyes narrowed the young man climbed up to follow his instincts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's just no way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe neared the top and suddenly the area looked a lot more familiar. His room looked exactly as he left it, with one major difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shrunk?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the room was now a massive plain that would take hours to cross. Shirou couldn't have been more than a couple inches tall. Beneath him were his blankets he just crawled from. \"What di- Whe-How?!\" After failing to form several questions he finally settled on that one word. The alarm to his house didn't go off. No one was around him. So why was he shrunken?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe questions quickly lost their significance. Loud footsteps came from the outside. Shirou noticed his room door sliding open. A female figure stepped in...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Large and intimidating as she looked, Shirou couldn't help but calm down once Saber walked in. There was no way Saber wouldn't notice him! Towering over his small frame, Saber took two steps into his room and looked around. A hand lazily grabbed at her hip as she started a double take, \"Shirou?\" Her stocking clad foot impatiently tapped on the ground whilst her eyes scanned the room yet a third time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saber! Saber down here!\" Atop his bed sheets Shirou jumped up and down with his arms flailing. Surely Saber would...Yes! She saw him! Almost immediately Saber's stern eyes locked onto him and...she did not look happy. \"What's wrong Saber?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to ask you the same thing.\" The Servant replied dully, clear distaste in her voice. \"What is the meaning of this?\" She took a step forward, now directly before Shirou and totally towering over him. \"Is there something you want to tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Huh?! I don't know what happened! I just woke up. Now I'm tiny and...and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant Servant looked appalled, \"Don't tell me...Shirou...do you know what you've done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at your Command Seal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Okay.\" Even a casual glance told Shirou what was wrong, \"Why is one missing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You used it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! When?! I don't remember doing that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber paused, \"It occurred minutes ago. I was eating breakfast when I felt you use a Command Seal.\" The girl's face quickly gave her Master a sour look, \"So pray, explain why I come in here to find you so tiny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am I supposed to know?! I wasn't even awake a couple minutes ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber's eyes widened, \"...Oh...Maybe that explains the strange command you gave...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou's eyes widened, \"Saber...What did I order you to do...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing, you must have been dreaming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saber.\" Even tiny Shirou felt her voice grow more demanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...\" The Servant's face changed abruptly. The stern, sour look she'd been giving Shirou since finding him quickly vanished as she recalled something she tried to forget. Her face turned a tinge of red when she finally said it. \"You commanded me...to make you mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Yours...you mean like....\" Now it was Shirou's turn to start blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Saber took a breath. \"The command was very vague. As a result I know not what effect it has had on me...Although it looks like you were affected more than I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what I needed.\" Shirou sighed, \"Tiny and one Command Seal short. How am I supposed to win the Holy Grail War like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Shirou heard something he never expected in a million years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is winning the Holy Grail so important?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the words left Saber's mouth she gasped, \"I'm sorry...I don't know where that came from. I just...For a moment...the Grail didn't seem important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Given how weird this morning is I can't blame you.\" The young Master smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...that's what it is...\" Saber mumbled. \"Honestly Shirou...\" She sighed, \"You were already a Master at a disadvantage before but now...Truly you lack discipline.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can lecture me all you want when I get back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...Normal...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you take me to Tohsaka? She'll know what to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an odd pause before Saber responded.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Saber thought for a moment, before saying \u201cThat might be a good idea. It\u2019d be good to check how your size will affect how much mana you can provide me as well, Shirou. Rin would probably know about all of that.\u201d And with that, Saber smiled down at Shirou and picked him up, before gently placing him in her front shirt pocket. She announced to Shirou, \u201cI\u2019ll make sure to walk carefully, so you don\u2019t get knocked around in there. But we\u2019ll make it to Rin\u2019s place soon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Saber made her way to Rin Tohsaka\u2019s house, keeping an eye down by her pocket to make sure that Shirou wasn\u2019t too jostled around down there, and after a short walk, she makes it to Rin\u2019s estate. Saber presses the door bell, and she can hear Rin shout, presumably to herself \u201cOh now what??\u201d She opens the door and yells \u201cWho?? \u2026 oh, Saber! What brings you here today?\u201d Saber saw Rin\u2019s face quickly shift from anger and frustration to relief, so she says \u201cHello, Rin. Are you well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin frowns and sighs, before saying \u201cThings have been awful, Saber! Come on in, and I\u2019ll explain over some snacks.\u201d Saber\u2019s eyes light up in anticipation as Rin leads her inside, and then Rin sets her down on her living room couch while she grabbed some cookies. Once Rin gets back, she plops down next to Saber and removes her school shoes, and Saber does the same with her boots, wanting to feel a bit more comfortable too. Rin hands Saber a cookie, and starts to explain her situation, saying \u201cIt all stated this morning!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou, who was also curious, made sure to listen as well, so he\u2019d be in the loop once Saber showed him to Rin. Rin said \u201cI woke up and made myself some breakfast, and then I went into the study to make up some plans based on what I know about the other masters and servants. And then I call Archer over, to get his input, but he doesn\u2019t appear!\u201d Saber gasped, and said \u201cWhat? What happened to Archer?\u201d Rin continued, saying \u201cAt first I just thought that he was being annoying, and ignoring me, but then I eventually saw a tiny doll that looked just like him on the table, expect it was waving at me. Archer shrunk somehow, and now I\u2019m effectively stuck without a servant now, in the middle of the Holy Grail War!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber frowned, and said \u201cThat\u2019s awful Rin! So where is Archer?\u201d And Rin just sighs and says \u201cHe\u2019s not very happy about his new size either, so he\u2019s probably off sulking somewhere.\u201d Saber nods, but then her eyes light up again, and she says, \u201cOh yes, that reminds me; I need to show you something, Rin.\u201d Saber then reaches into her pocket, and pulls Shirou out and places him on her palm, before presenting him in front of Rin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin leans in close to the tiny Shirou, and the features of her face were magnified many times over for him. Her piercing aqua colored eyes seemed like they could gaze right into his diminished soul, and things only got more intense as she continued to slowly edge her face closer to him. Her long black hair, which was currently down, seemed like it could surround him like a vast forest. And she only stopped once her chin was nearly touching Saber\u2019s hand, which meant that Shirou could reach her massive red lips if he only stretched his arms a bit, and he didn\u2019t enjoy how close she was to him, or how Saber didn\u2019t tell her yet about his condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips slowly shifted into a grin, before Rin excitedly yelled \u201cIs that a Shirou doll?? Did you make this Saber? You knew just how to cheer me up!\u201d Saber silently gasped while Rin roughly snatched Shirou from her palm, gripping him tightly. Then she opened her palm, and started to poke and prod at Shirou with her right index finger, preventing him from making a sound. Then she said, while diligently playing with her Shirou \u2018doll\u2019, \u201cIt seems so life-like. It feels like I\u2019m actually poking a tiny Shirou!\u201d She began to laugh while Saber uncomfortably waited for a good moment to interrupted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept on poking at Shirou while laughing, but then she slowed down and said \u201cWait, Saber? Why is it moving about?\u201d Then she stopped messing with him, as she figured that something was wrong, and she allowed Saber to explain. She said \u201cActually Rin, that\u2019s actually Shirou. I found him like this in the morning, and we hoped that you could help.\u201d Rin looked back down at Shirou, who laughed while still feeling dazed, and her face slowly but surely reddened in embarrassment. She tossed him away towards Saber, while yelling \u201cYou idiot Shirou! Why didn\u2019t you tell me sooner??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter things calmed down a bit, and Saber and Shirou explained the whole story to Rin, she thought to herself as she processed everything. Eventually, Rin says \u201cWell, I have a few ideas, but I\u2019m not in the best condition to help out someone right now, especially with my servant effectively out of commission.\u201d She sighs while Shirou says, in a pleading tone \u201cPlease, Rin! I really need your help right now. I\u2019d do anything in return!\u201d And Rin quickly makes a sly grin, and says \u201cOh really, little Shirou? You\u2019d accept my help, under any condition?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou bluntly replied, \u201cYeah sure, just nothing weird I guess.\u201d Rin was silent for a second, before she glared down at the tiny boy, yelling \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean, you little jerk??\u201d Shirou jumped back a bit, and said \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Rin! I wasn\u2019t trying to be rude.\u201d And while Rin continued to glare down at him, Saber added \u201cShirou, you shouldn\u2019t be disrespectful towards Rin right now.\u201d But Rin quickly regained her composure, and she said \u201cI do have a good idea on what you could offer me Shirou. And if you accept my terms, then I\u2019ll do whatever I can to fix your problem, and take care of you until you\u2019re back to normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou nods and says \u201cThat\u2019s fine, Rin.\u201d So Rin explains, saying \u201cAs I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware now, I\u2019m down a servant. I cannot worry about you while I need to focus on my own survival, but I think we can help each other. You transfer Saber over to my command, and I\u2019ll help you.\u201d Shirou gasped, and said \u201cBut wouldn\u2019t that be bad for me as well??\u201d Rin just chuckled, and said \u201cPerhaps, but it\u2019s also true that you won\u2019t be able to provide enough mana to Saber while you\u2019re reduced in size. She probably won\u2019t be able to maintain her physical form while she remains under your leadership. And even though it\u2019d normally be pretty challenging for any master to have more than one servant at a time, Archer doesn\u2019t require nearly as much mana while he\u2019s tiny. So I\u2019ll give Saber back to you once I fix Archer. Is it a deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou thinks for a moment, but quickly says \u201cIt\u2019s fine with me. Saber, are you alright with this? I don\u2019t want to make this decision for you.\u201d Saber smiles and says \u201cBut Shirou, you\u2019re my master. It doesn\u2019t matter what I think of it.\u201d But Shirou yells, \u201cOf course it does Saber! You have feelings too, and you\u2019re my friend!\u201d Saber\u2019s eyes well-up slightly after that comment, and after she composes herself, she says \u201cOkay. I\u2019m fine with it as well, Rin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Rin grins and says \u201cPerfect!\u201d Then Rin makes the preparations to transfer Saber to become her servant, instead of Shirou\u2019s. And once it was finished, Rin asked \u201cAll done! How do you both feel?\u201d Shirou stretches and says \u201cI feel like I have a lot more energy. I didn\u2019t realize how tiring supporting a normal sized servant could be at my state.\u201d Saber nods and says \u201cI feel a bit better as well. Thank you, Rin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Rin says \u201cGood! Saber, why don\u2019t you take a nap for now? You must be exhausted, after running on such a small supply of mana.\u201d But Saber replies, saying \u201cNo, I\u2019m alright Rin. You don\u2019t need to worry\u2026\u201d But Saber loudly yawned in the middle of her sentence, and a small tear formed in her right eye, so she said \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right, Rin.\u201d So Rin smiles and says \u201cI know! Head into the room on the left; there\u2019s an empty bed you can rest in. I\u2019ll keep an eye on Shirou.\u201d<br>\r\nSaber says goodbye to Rin and Shirou, and then she takes her leather boots and goes into the bedroom, before closing the door behind her. Then Rin looks down at Shirou, who was still in her palm, and smirks before saying \u201cWell then Shirou, wanna head to the kitchen for some lunch?\u201d After a few moments of thought, Shirou eventually replies, saying:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Saber paused for a moment, before saying \u201cShirou, maybe we should slow down and figure this out ourselves, before bothering Rin? She\u2019ll be very busy worrying about the Holy Grail War, and I don\u2019t think we should stress her anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou first looked worried, but then he thought it through, and finally said \u201cYou\u2019re right Saber. I\u2019d feel terrible if I bothered Rin with this problem. Maybe we can solve this together.\u201d Saber smiles at her master, before picking him up and walking to the dining room, and then sets him down on the table so they can discuss this together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber starts, asking \u201cSo, is there anything you could think of that would get you to make this kind of command, even if it was in your sleep?\u201d Shirou scratches his head, and starts to say \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I guess I wanted to feel like I\u2019m not a burden to you, since I\u2019m inexperienced as a mage. Or maybe I wanted to make things easier for you.\u201d And Saber adds, \u201cLike how you always cook for me, or when you give me foot massages after we have tough battles?\u201d Shirou nods, and says \u201cYeah, so I guess subconsciously I\u2019m not as concerned about the Holy Grail War than I thought.\u201d Shirou laughs to himself, but then something sinks in for Saber, and her eyes grow wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly yells, \u201cWait a second! If you\u2019re tiny, then how will we eat??\u201d Shirou has a moment of blankness while he processes what Saber said, but then he starts to laugh again, which upsets Saber even more. She leans in to Shirou, until her mouth was almost touching the tiny master, and then she screams \u201cShirou!! Eating properly is a vital part of life, and I won\u2019t let you trivialize this issue!\u201d Saber\u2019s hot and steamy breath rushed past Shirou, like a huge typhoon, and he was flung back while droplets of spittle covered him. She continued to pant heavily, keeping Shirou surrounded by her warm breath, while he looked in shock at her incredibly impassioned and widened blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Saber blushes, covers her mouth, and bows her head while saying \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry Shirou! I shouldn\u2019t have yelled like that.\u201d Shirou just brushes himself off while getting up, and says \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Saber. And we\u2019ll be fine for food. We still have my card, and I can always teach you how to cook too, so we won\u2019t need to order food all the time.\u201d Saber\u2019s eyes shined like stars when he said that, and she could only mumble \u201cAwesome\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Shirou asks, \u201cSaber? How are you able to remain materialized like this? Aren\u2019t I providing less magical energy for you while I\u2019m at this size?\u201d Saber replies, saying \u201cOh! I actually feel like I have a lot more energy than usual. It might be another effect of the command you gave.\u201d Then, Shirou instructs Saber how to make their breakfast, and once they started eating, they chatted some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber started to say, in-between mouthfuls of food, \u201cI never realized how much fun making food was! It\u2019s almost as great as eating it!!\u201d And Shirou says, while eating his much smaller portion, \u201cI\u2019m glad you like to cook too! I\u2019ll teach you whatever you like, Saber!\u201d Saber grins, but then she says suddenly, \u201cI just thought of this, but I really appreciate how you always gave me those massages, Shirou.\u201d Shirou blushes, and says \u201cOh\u2026 don\u2019t worry about it Saber. It\u2019s the least I can do for you; after all you do to support me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they both finish eating, Saber picks Shirou up and brings him to the living room with her, and she sets him on her lap after she sits down. Then Saber says \u201cToday is our food shopping day, right Shirou?\u201d And Shirou replies, saying \u201cYou\u2019re right! I have a list on the table, so you can follow it when you go out Saber.\u201d Saber nods, and says \u201cOkay! But I should take you with me. I don\u2019t want anything to happen to you while I\u2019m gone, Shirou.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou agrees, and says \u201cYeah, I probably shouldn\u2019t be alone right now. I\u2019m even more vulnerable than I usually am.\u201d Saber touches her chin with her index finger, while thinking of how to transport Shirou, and she eventually says \u201cI\u2019ve got an idea!\u201d Shirou perks up, and asks \u201cWhat\u2019d you think of, Saber?\u201d Saber grins, and says \u201cI\u2019ll place you in one of my boots, Shirou!\u201d He slowly processes that suggestion, and he eventually says \u201cOh\u2026 wait, what?? Why your boot??\u201d But Saber\u2019s face gradually fell into a frown, and then she glared down at Shirou, and suddenly got up, causing him to fall onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Shirou could react, she firmly planted her right stocking-clad foot on top of him, so her toes covered his body. She wasn\u2019t crushing him, but she wasn\u2019t letting him move either, and he was even able to squeeze his head between her big and 2nd toes. Saber had strong smelling feet for sure, since she was so active, but they weren\u2019t unpleasant to Shirou. Once he was able to push his face past the sticky and thick stocking material, Shirou yelled \u201cSaber??\u201d But Saber put her hands on her hips, and said \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with going in my boot, Shirou? You must like my feet; why else would you constantly give me foot massages whenever we finished a tough day? You should be more grateful!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou was dumbfounded. Saber never acted or treated him in this manner, and he wouldn\u2019t have thought that him being smaller would change that. But he wondered if that dream command had more of an effect on her than she realized, which made Shirou want to be as agreeable with Saber as he could; at least until this craziness ended. Before he could give an answer, Saber\u2019s eyes welled up with tears, and she released her foothold on him, and gently picked him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber placed Shirou in her palm, knelt down, and started to say \u201cI\u2019m so sorry Shirou! I don\u2019t know what came over me!!\u201d Her face was very close to Shirou\u2019s tiny body, but he just warmly smiled at her. He closer to her face, and patted the tip of her nose gently, showing her that he wasn\u2019t upset by that outburst. Shirou says \u201cIt\u2019s okay Saber. That command must have a strong effect on the both of us. And if going in your boot would be the easiest way to carry me around, without any other mages or servants finding me; then I\u2019ll gladly accept it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber smiled again, and said \u201cThanks Shirou! And if you\u2019d rather just go in my pocket, then just let me know. I\u2019ll protect you either way.\u201d Shirou nodded, and added \u201cAlso Saber, I think the command seal made me more durable as well, so you won\u2019t need to worry about accidentally hurting me while I\u2019m small!\u201d After hearing that, Saber grins and says \u201cGreat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Shirou took a deep breath, and said \u201cOkay, Saber!\u201d</span></div></div>",

She was browsing through them for a way to make it easier for her to carry her spell jewel's but also other required items. As she was looking through them, Archer was looking in her room through the Key hole and stood up with a carefree expression on his face. He knocked on the door some as this surprised Rin causing her to drop some of the book's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"eeeeeep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rin, Lunch is being eaten right now. If you don't Eat soon, Saber will most likely Eat all the food that will be remaining on the Table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-R-R-Right! I'll be there in a moment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that was said, Archer left down the hall to the other's. Rin let out a small sigh and reaches down to pick up some of the fallen book's when she noticed that two of them were open in the middle and a page was over lapping one of the other book's page's. She was curious about it for a moment and begun to read it to herself when she came across a discovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! With this spell i can reduce anything i want down to a much smaller size! I'll be able to carry anything with me in just one pocket! Now then, let's see if it's strong enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Archer made it to the living room, Shiro walk's up to him after finishing lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Archer, Can you help me with something out back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to move one of the ladder's from the storage out back and bring it to the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Shiro and Archer soon left the living room and headed outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin placed a few of her jewel's down on the desk infront of her after picking up the two book's carefully. She places her hand's over them and begin's the chant of the spell. A small amount of wind is made as the spell is being read as Rin take's a few look's at the book's to keep the chant correct but unknown to her, one of the page's turn's to a different page as She look's back at it and continues to read it. Soon a large Blue light is made and shot's up and outwards as it cover's all of Fuyuki City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the light vanishes, Rin open's her eyes and look's around. She soon notice's that the Jewel's were at a much smaller size and smile's as she carefully pick's them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it! I shrunk them down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said as she placed them in her Skirt pocket and went out to the Living room but once she got there, she saw that only Ilya was there as she was watching a random program on TV. Rin looked around for a moment and then at Ilya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did everyone go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shiro and Archer went out to the Storage to get the ladder. Saber went outside for some fresh air. Taiga and Sakura were here a moment ago but i don't know where they went to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin sigh's some and put's her hand's on her hip's as she thinks about going to get Archer and Shiro.  However, unknown to her and Ilya, Sakura and Taiga were shrunk down to the size of a mere 6 inches tall and on the table looking up at the now towering Rin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Crazy! First that blue light come's out of nowhere and then we're shrunk down to 6 inches tall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please miss Fujiwara, calm down. We need to think this through carefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was right about that but what also crossed her mind was, who else was hit by it?</span></div></div>",

The four workers, each bizarre-looking cat-like creatures, were silent until the blonde creature, named Neco-Arc suddenly shouted aloud. \"This is boring!!!\" Another one of the Neco's, Neco-Arc Bubbles, vigorously nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such is the way of the world.\" Came the melancholic voice of Neco-Arc Destiny, \"One minute everything is going well then the next the love dies down into monotony.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final creature, Neko-Arc Chaos, casually sipped at a cup he was holding. \"As much as we may have complained about that pesky carnival, it did indeed bring business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that cute worker!\" Neco-Arc added, again nods were added by Bubbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\" Chaos muttered sadly, \"But alas...All good things must come to an-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>CRASH</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverhead the ceiling of the cafe shattered, protruding through the newly made hole was a barefoot that seemed to belong to a giant.

The giantess stood atop the city with most buildings barely reaching her knees in a revealing tiger-striped bikini and panty combo. \"This is Master Taiga Fujimura here with Student No. 1!\" She spoke straight ahead as if something was before her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a roof beside Taiga came a much harder to hear voice peppily adding \"Welcome!\" This girl wore a gym uniform herself, but nothing about her was as overtly sexual as her giant companion. Immediately the girl, Ilya, looked to the giantess and screamed. \"Oh my God Sensei you're giant!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right! The Taiga Dojo is back and bigger than ever!!\" Taiga let out a hearty laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this isn't Fate/Stay Night, and the Carnival's over too...\" Ilya casually mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is why you are still a Student Student No. 1!

The next instant-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>WHAM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess' fist smashed through the roof her student was on. Amidst the rubble the girl laid injured but otherwise totally fine. \"Owie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaiga proceeded without missing a beat, \"You might have noticed there's no animation or for that matter pictures to go along with this particular Taiga Dojo. That is because this time we're trying some different. But don't worry.

After having narrowly escaped one of his many imminent deaths Lancer finally found his respite in the Fuyuki City park. It was peaceful, serene, and most of all there was no chance of anything happening to him here- so he thought. But the ominous shadow told him his feelings were wrong. The Servant looked overhead and felt his jaw drop. Towering above him was a beautiful giantess. Her height was hard to guess but in the distance Lancer spotted her toes and realized he was likely smaller than them. That must've meant she was truly massive. But something about that size was just...alluring. The giantess had two D-Cup breasts that struggled to be held inside of a tiny tiger-striped bra; she was even excited enough that her erect nipples were very clear against the fabric. It seemed as if at any moment the two teasing mountains would burst from their prison to greet the world. Just past them Lancer saw the giant's face. It was a tender face that seemed to radiate energy and confidence at the same time. Her eyes were fierce but there was a strange warmth and energy to them. Her short brown hair gently blew into the wind and fluttered over her eyes. A couple strands of hair seem to go with the breeze and crashed onto the street, making loud smacking noises against the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis woman was an absolute Goddess Lancer realized. At that moment the Goddess seemed to notice Lancer as well. Her lips curled into a mischievous smile as her leg elevated itself. Attracted by the movement, Lancer's eyes traced down the well-toned figure of the giantess, down her sculpted stomach, passed her firm but notably large buttocks, and slowly along her creamy thighs right up to the giantess' knee. Beyond that the woman's calves continued to tease Lancer with their form. They were muscular but there was no denying their femininity either. Finally Lancer's eyes trailed past the ankle and to the woman's foot. It in its own right was a sight to behold, they looked sort of shapely but not in a bad way, each toe was the perfect length with no odd characteristics, her toenails weren't painted but the natural look seemed better anyway, and the last thing Lancer noticed was the debris of buildings clinging to her sole. They decorated her foot as if it were mere dirt and added a sense of power and dominance that was just too arousing. From there her leg moved until it was now resting overtop of Lancer. The mischievous smile of the giantess was now obscured by her bare sole, Lancer stared at it for a moment as each of her toes wiggled eagerly. As debris because to fall from between the giantess' toes it hit him at long last. She was going to step on him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe may have tried to run but it didn't matter. Taiga's grin turned deviant as her foot slowly lowered itself. Even with his Servant speed Lancer could not outrun the foot of this giantess. He was lost in its shadow until finally bare sole hit the ground and crushed everything beneath it. Taiga raised her foot back from the ground, noting the perfect footprint it left, and examined her foot. Right at the ball of her foot was a minuscule splatter of blood. She wiped it off with a finger. She stared at the blood for a moment, \"Oops.\" Her voice seductively uttered with a deep giggle. Her finger entered her mouth so she could suck it clean with a single eye batted shut to tease the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that answer your question?\" Taiga grinned to the empty space again. On the ground beside her foot was Student No. 1 blushing with drool running down her cheek. \"And we're just beginning!\" The giantess struck another pose with her hands at her hips, \"From now on you can just call me Goddess Taiga!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Ilya cheered, \"I can't wait to be a Goddess too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About that...\" Goddess Taiga's eyes grew uncharacteristically sad. She knelt down and gently plucked her small student and hovered her before her face. \"I am afraid you cannot become a Goddess Student No 1...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Why?!\" She looked like she was about to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid your body isn't ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You mean I'm not curvy enough?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but one day you will be. And when that day comes you'll be even bigger than I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Sensei!\" Ilya cried tears to hear those words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whelp. In you go.\" With utter disregard for the moment Taiga tossed the shrunken girl into her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaaaat?!\" The student screamed until she smacked against the soft surface of Taiga's breast. It gave a soft, bouncy recoil and gently tossed her into the heavenly valley between the two mountains, where her voice could no longer be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard the description.\" Taiga frowned. \"Sorry about the sudden mood change there but this chapter here is running out of space! We could've end with a nice heartwarming moment but I know that's not what you're here for! So let's get right to the action!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Without missing a beat Taiga took a step forward, trampling a car, and found a building roughly waist-high. \"This looks like a good place to start!\"  In a simple motion the giantess turned around so her panty-covered butt hovered just over the roof of the building. \"I'll start slow so you guys might have a chance to get away if you run!\" A giggle followed as Taiga gently pressed her buttocks against the edge of the roof. It started as little more than just a touch, but very quickly more and more pressure began to get put onto the building. It began as a few small creaks but very soon the building began to make some very troubling sounds. Taiga grinned as she playfully grinded her butt against the building one time to show what was to come. Down near her feet were the clear forms of tiny people running away from the giantess. \"Nope!\" A swift stomp wiped out most of the people she saw. With that she allowed more weight onto the building, it was still standing. Starting to get impatient Taiga finally let her butt rest firmly on the building, even supporting her immense weight only a single floor of the building actually crumbled away. She frowned \"Now we can't have that. Can we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpreading her legs apart, Taiga placed both of her thighs on opposite sides of the building. \"Bye bye~\" She waved to the structure beneath her just as her legs began to clench it. From both sides and the very top the building began to finally cave in. To anyone left inside the last thing they would see would either be Taiga's rear or her toned thighs, not bad sights to go out on. <i>Crunch</i> Taiga felt her legs touching, the building that was between them crumbled into a pile of rubble at her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fun! Now what should I do?\" Taiga wiped her legs off and walked back into the streets, just a few steps away she caught sight of numerous people and cars retreating away from her. \"Oh no you don't!\" She grinned, taking a slow first step. \"Fi...\" Another slow step followed, a car met its end with it, \"Fi...\" Then of course came another step, this one got a couple slow people, \"Fo...\" Finally came the last step, a firm stomp. \"Fum!\" Easily twenty people perished beneath her sole, but from where she stood all Taiga saw were a bunch of bugs. \"If I'd known how fun this was I would've become a Goddess years ago!\" She laughed, eyes locked on a building that reached her shins. Her foot was poised over it instantly, \"Take a good look at my foot bug people. It's the last thing you'll see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlayfully slow Taiga let her foot touch the roof of the building. Then she pointed a toe downwards and pushed it through to the other side. With that same toe the giantess dragged it along the roof, breaking apart the ceiling. Once a straight line was drawn she easily broke up the rest of the roof with her entire foot. There were a few people amidst the rubble staring up at Taiga in awe, the feeling of power just made her grin. \"Bye bye!\" Was all she said to them, the next second their blood decorated the ball of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, I guess I broke the building. At least there's a lot more where that came from.\" More people littered the streets to get away from Taiga, the giantess only continued smiling at them. \"Lemme get a close look at you guys before I crush you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a thundering boom Taiga let her body fall to the ground and got on all fours. Up close the people now resembled people, but that didn't matter. She stuck out her index finger, eyes glancing around all the frightened people. \"Hmm...How about....\" A young blonde man caught her attention, \"You!\" As if he knew, the man turned around just in time to see Taiga's finger squish him into paste. Taiga examined the blood on her finger briefly before sucking it off. \"Mmm...Tasty!\" Her hand swung back out again, this time scooping up several people instead of killing them. The brown-haired giant examined the people in her hand, licking her lips to clearly signal her intentions. Their screams were music to her ears. It was almost a shame when she tossed them all in without regard and swallowed them whole. They tasted astounding, but their screams were now gone. \"Ah well, there's always more.\" She shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill on all fours Taiga continued to crawl on the ground, easily catching up to all who tried to run away from her. \"Come on you have to do better than that guys! I'm not even trying here. Do you want me to crush you?\" Panic was her answer as the people hurried even faster now, it meant nothing though. Taiga just continued to crawl over them. In just two steps her torso hovered over hundreds of people. Her shadow might as well have been an eclipse. \"Bye bye~!\" She exclaimed, letting her whole body fall down and crush them all against her body. Some met their ends beneath her titanic breasts. Some were crushed by her well toned stomach. And even a few were low enough to get crushed by her crotch area. When she sat back up her torso was decorated with small splatters of blood everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm being really messy.\" The giantess noted. She stood back up and tried to wipe the blood off but it only smeared. \"Ah well.\" She shrugged, swiping her hand through a building beside her. Taiga began to casually walk through the city, demolishing the occasional building with a stomp or a flick of her wrist. \"It's been years since I've had this much fun! But I'm starting to run out of ideas of what to do...\" Just as she said that Taiga noticed a single person right in front of her. Whilst running a woman fell and turned to the towering giantess above her. Eyes still playful as ever Taiga positioned her big toe just over the woman, \"I got an idea now! If you kiss my toe I'll let you run away some more!\" In her desperate will to survive the woman wasted no time in throwing herself to appease the giantess. \"Not bad at all!\" Taiga moaned after a couple kisses, \"Being a Goddess has its perks. You can go now!\" Almost too happy to speak the woman turned and ran away again, only to be crushed by Taiga's next footstep. \"...Next time run faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaiga came up to a building roughly the same size as her, seeing it made her frown. She guessed her height was around a couple hundred feet, but seeing something bigger than her was just displeasing. \"I'll take care of it!\" She thought out load. In a second without warning Taiga's arms wrapped around the building, legs at either side, head leaned against it, and with all of her body she crushed the body from every possible angle. It crumpled in her arms like it was nothing, scattering its debris all over her. \"Wow that was messy.\" She muttered, wiping off the building's dust. When she went to wipe her chest though the noticed something, or rather, someone. Someone who was in the building managed to save themself by jumping into her cleavage. This little person was dangling by the thread of her bikini between each breast. He was clearly losing his grip but the giantess only smiled down at him. \"Let's see how long you can stay there! One...Two...\" And like that Taiga began counting how long this man could survive by hanging on for his dear life. Eventually though, he had to fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirteen...four- Oh you fell...\" Taiga looked down at the corpse that fell from her chest, \"I hoped you liked the view little man!\" She laughed as her foot twisted his body into dust. \"Hmm...Now what...?\"</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I think I'll keep playing with the little people!\" Taiga sang aloud for no particular reason. Taking exaggerated steps with her feet the giantess spotted just what she was looking for. Roughly a mile ahead was a huge mass of people, easily a couple hundred, all running in one huge group as far away as they possibly could. All of it was for naught though. Once Taiga locked eyes with them it was over, in less than a minute she covered the mile gap between them and had all of them corned at a three-way intersection. Naturally the people tried to leave through the other two ways not occupied by a giantess but that proved to be a bad idea. With a casual shove of her hands the giantess knocked over two buildings, blocking the roads with the destruction as well as crushing most who tried to escape. The couple hundred who remained were now cornered by Taiga who grinned down at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm tempted to just crush a bunch of you guys at once...\" Taiga's toes flexed eagerly, even making a loud pop that startled the group. \"...But if I keep crushing you at this rate there won't be any tinies left. So let's do something different.\" Surprisingly casual Taiga sat down on the road with her knees huddled up to her chin. \"Let me start by introducing myself. Everyone's been screaming so much I doubt you heard me. I'm Goddess Taiga!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reaction was for everyone to remain stunned, but now with the addition of being confused. The giantess they had clearly seen destroying their city and crushing people like bugs was now speaking to them so casually...heck even politely! Her body, especially her feet, with still littered with the debris and blood of the innocent. Just behind her was the clear figure of half the town destroyed and the other half ready to be destroyed. She didn't treat them like people before, so why was this \"Goddess\" treating them as such now? They wanted to forget it and run, but the two paths to the side were now blocked by a destroyed building and the remaining road had a giantess sitting in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scared? Surprised? I bet, you guys just saw what I was doing.\" Taiga pointed her thumb over her shoulder, \"All those guys are goners. But you guys! I have something special planned for you.\" The giantess paused to build suspense. \"I want you guys to be my little worshipers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outrageous statement broke the still silence of the people with a clear \"Huh?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaiga snickered, \"I keep calling myself a Goddess but I can't be a Goddess if no one worships me. So you guys can be the first to worship me. Aren't you all lucky?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone began murmuring. They didn't want to do it of course, but not doing it would obviously be a dumb idea. Unfortunately for them, their Goddess was impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...I get it. You need some persuading.\" Taiga's hand swooped down faster than anyone could see. Before people so much as had time to scream it came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaiga's palm slammed into the pavement, crushing everyone beneath it and her fingers. The giantess lifted her hand and shook off all the death like it was dirt. \"Now, who would like to bow to their new Goddess?\" Naturally everyone bowed. The Goddess smiled smugly, \"Good little bugs. But bowing isn't enough, I want you guys to do something for me...\" Everyone followed Taiga's eyes as they traced over her entire body. \"...While I was destroying everything I got really dirty, could you guys help me clean up?\" Everyone could tell what she was referring to, the smeared blood on her torso, the dirt-like debris all over her body...Taiga did look kind of dirty, especially her feet. It was simple, but one person did ask the key question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess Taiga giggled, \"Easy, I'll just need some volunteers.\" As it would happen \"volunteer\" meant Taiga picked you up and you just had to deal with it. With a simple swoop of her hand Taiga scooped up roughly a dozen people. \"You guys can get my sides.\" Another group was next, placed at her cleavage, \"You lucky little scamps can clean my chest.\" Another group was placed at her lower torso. As she kept assigning people Taiga slowly sat back until finally she was completely laying down and placed a couple on her face. Littered all through her body were people ready to clean her. On the side were people beside her arms with the same job. And those who remained were at her feet, grimacing at getting the hardest job. \"Get to work guys! When you're done just do whatever you can to make me feel good. Taiga smiled in content as her little worshipers got to work. Sure it was out of fear, but even that was enticing in its own way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough their new Goddess was relaxed the people diligently got to work to try and please her. Using whatever means they could people began to wipe away all the dirt, grime, and blood from Taiga's beautiful body. No one dared to say anything aloud out of fear the giantess would crush them. Everyone was simply working in silence, using shirts to wipe her skin or rolling around people-sized boulders off of the woman. Naturally some people's jobs were easier than others, those at Taiga's hands, arms, and stomach for instance, were finished relatively quickly and just settled for casually bowing and/or massaging her. Other places, like her feet, breasts, or waist were having it rougher. The various features of Taiga quickly proved tricky: people were constantly slipping around and falling on her breasts, whenever someone tried to clean between her toes they usually fell or tickled her. And if anyone fell near her waist towards her underwear they didn't come back. But their fear of being crushed was a powerful motivator, everyone continued to act in silence. For this brief period of time it was almost peaceful. The city was no longer being crushed. Some people were actually getting away. And some of the worshipers were even beginning to embrace the idea of worshiping Taiga as a Goddess, she was definitely beautiful enough for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver time more and more people began to finish. The smears and remains from Taiga's rampage slowly went away and her flawless skin was once flawless. The general consensus once people finished was to either bow, or more often than naught, massage. So by the end the giant brunette literally had over a hundred people giving her a full body massage. She didn't care if there were people being perverts but massaging her breasts or butt, it felt good. The only area that was still being worked on was her feet and those would likely never stay clean at her size. But enough time soon passed and she even began to feel massages from down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That feels fantastic...You guys are the best little worshipers ever...\" Taiga couldn't hold back moans of pleasure. She was in pure bliss. \"You guys deserve a reward. And I got just the thing...Just after five more minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter twenty minutes Taiga finally shooed the people off of her body and slowly re-positioned herself so that her chest was directly in front of the entire group. Her head loomed over them smiling. \"You guys ready for your reward?\" Everyone nodded, males eagerly eyeballing their Goddess' cleavage. Taiga looked up at the empty air, \"I hope you guys reading enjoy this part!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you guys worshiped me I got a lot of energy.\" Taiga began her odd explanation, \"I get energy from pretty much doing whatever. But worship gives me a lot more than most things. So because of that. You lucky guys get to see your Goddess get a lot, <b>LOT</b> bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Taiga had said barely registered to people. They understood it but what she said meant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like an earthquake was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! It's starting!\" Taiga looked excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasps were heard as it happened. Right before all of the people's eyes, Taiga was growing. At no slow pace either. It seemed like an instant had passed before her hips were smashing into buildings to make room for her. Likewise her feet dug into whatever was behind her. And her chest? It began to plow its way through all the people who just worshiped her. The only way to accurately describe it was to use a steam roller, people were just flattened beneath the two expanding mammaries. All the while Taiga let out sensual moans in tune with her growth. The world was nonexistent right now. All that existed was her expansion. Everything else was irrelevant. The people who once worshiped her. The buildings cleared for her body. The city itself was irrelevant. In fact, it was holding Taiga back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goddess couldn't hold herself any longer. She rose to her feet with constant moans of pleasure, her body expanding in spurts. Already nothing in the area even reached her knees but Taiga felt more growth already coming. Driven solely by the feeling of growing Goddess Taiga leapt into the air, where her growth exploded in one huge burst. In a single instant was was over. One couldn't say Taiga landed, she grew and her feet touched the ground before gravity had a chance to affect her. The euphoria of expanding began to dim as Taiga slowly opened her eyes, cheeks flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing...\" She moaned, voice heavy. Right beside her foot was something that caught her attention, the city she was in just minutes ago- or rather, what remained of it. It was now no taller than her toes An average city in Japan with buildings over two-hundred feet high no longer reached her toes. She was a new level of massive now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for everything guys. It was fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a single stomp Taiga's foot completely annihilated the city. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A sizable chunk of Japan's edge was now crushed. All that remained was a pile of rubble below the water in the rough outline of a foot. Taiga admired her handiwork. \"Wow, that's the whole town. Just in a single step.\" She was actually in awe at what she had done. When Taiga embraced her growth spurt she had no idea just how big she'd become, but here she was now, staring at the nearby Mt. Fuji. Even before when she was just a lesser giant she would've had to crane her head to look up at it; but now the measly little formation only reached her ankles. The mountain stood at just under two and a half miles high. Taiga quickly did the math and estimated her own height to be over a hundred miles!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Taiga's jaw dropped at the realization. Her mind reeled with all the little details of what that meant. Each of her feet were at least a dozen miles in size, the size of cities. Heck her palms were big enough to crush cities now. Even the biggest mountain on the island was nothing before her. And she knew that due to a perverted writer her chest now swelled up to DD's.  The giantess could easily make out the other cities all throughout Japan and even the structures out on the Asian continent. It was all so small Taiga couldn't help but smile at the possibilities. But that was just it, what were the possibilities? Her new size was nice and empowering and all. But she couldn't take the time toying with cities like she used to now. Quite frankly, maybe she grew too quickly. Her home country was now too small for her to do too much with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll have to find something more for a girl my size!\" Taiga quickly giggled. \"But first...\" Her eyes narrow mischievously, \"I should finish up here.\" A massive shadow glided over Japan, clearing right through the mountains to the nearest city. Taiga's big toe crushed the edge of Tokyo in an instant. \"Hmm...\" She thought for a moment, \"I should probably do something special for my homeland.\" The idea came right to mind, Taiga lowered her body with a grin. Half of it was submerged in the water but the upper half, specifically her enlarged chest, sat on the shore. \"Make way for the train!\" The giantess cheered, cupping each breast in a hand. What came next could only be described as a stream-roller. Taiga's breasts moved forward with her torso, slowly clearing the way with the ground beneath them. Trees, mountains, buildings, people, all of it was slowly crushed to dust beneath her massive bosom. For thousands their final moments would be the sky blotted out by a giantess, and then a monolithic pair of breasts slowly squishing everything in their wake. Tokyo was soon replaced with two circular craters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad. But I can do better!\" The next town Taiga didn't waste any time with. The sky turned into a pattern or yellow and black stripes with a curvature. A giant butt loomed over it, and the next second it crushed the city beneath a single cheek. \"Mmm...I love using my bottom.\" Taiga purred as her hips grinded against the ground. Just behind her (no pun intended) sat another city, she knew its name but ever since becoming a Goddess she couldn't care less. It too met a fate beneath her palm. \"I think that about does it!\" Goddess Taiga stood back up to wipe her rear. As she casually strolled through waist-high water she left behind an island completely ravaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer next goal was already on the horizon. One of the most famous cities in the world: Shanghai. The sun was beginning to set on the great city as a giant shadow moved in. Taiga admired the wondrous area, but...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With her new size, Taiga could have even more fun in her own 'Goddess' way now that she had left her mark (in more ways then one) in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as many good thing's happen to anyone, there will always be some bad thing's as well and for Taiga, it's something that she would never expect. But Her surprise will arrive in a few moment's as we do a small rewind to take a look at what was going on during the twenty minutes that she was in bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------10 minutes ago---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Taiga was being massaged by the masses of people, a certain Student No.1, Ilya, had been treading through Taiga's massive cleavage from when she first laid down to now. It wasn't easy for her but she had made it to the lower part of Taiga's breasts and was freed from her fleshy prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-F-Finally made it out of there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlya knew she couldn't rest yet as she moved to the left side of Taiga's body where alot of the people on that side weren't looking and slid down her to carefully making onto the ground while stumbling some to keep from falling flat on her face. As Ilya looked around, she noticed something Strange as a Cloaked Figure was leading the remaining citizen's in the correct direction's to get out of the city. This got Ilya curious as she went over to the figure and looked at them but couldn't tell who that person was or what they looked like. The figure looked at Ilya for a moment after getting the feeling that they were being watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you leading alot of people out of town for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When someone or something has this much power and attention, it's only a matter of time before they decide to expand their Horizon's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In short, when she's done having her time of bliss, she's gonna want to become even bigger and when that happen's, say bye-bye to the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"........WHAT!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlya was in pure shock with her mouth wide opened and her eyes wide from hearing what the figure had just said to her. She shook her head for a moment to get out of the shock and looked back at the figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-A-A-A-And what'll happen then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure. She'll either go to the next city and destroy it as well and then get bigger after that. Like washing your hair. Rinse and Repeat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlya sweatdrop's some at the last word's the figure said to describe what might happen but she got the point none the less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what do we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure hand's Ilya a folded up piece of paper as it must have had something written in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inside here is the instruction's of a spell that'll make any Female grow. I would suggest taking it to someone you know or a group and fill them in on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks! .....Wait, how did you know about there being people with magic in this city?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Figure points over at Taiga and Ilya sweatdrop's once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-That would be a good give away. eheh heh heh heh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If there's any place outside the city, best to gather there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlya nodded as she knew of a place and went to gather everyone. The place she knew of was her own home that was a good location for her and other's to meet up at. The figure smiled some under the hood and chuckled some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why have just one when more can share the fun? Plus it'll be interesting to see who show's up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlya had gotten everyone together and informed them of the plan she had to match or counter the 'Goddess' Taiga and they all looked at Each other while the guy's Stood against the side wall for the time being to see what the girl's would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------end flashback--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaiga's Fun was soon interrupted as the ground shook hard but this shaking wasn't from a earthquake. It was more of a pattern of sort's. Footstep's. Taiga gulped some and kept looking forward as a large Shadow, one that was much larger then her, appeared behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had the feeling she was being looked down at as the new person was much, much bigger then she was. She was afraid to turn to look but gulped and knew she had to see who outgrew her in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turned around, Taiga saw that it was none other then.............<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(the choices, instead of leaving a name of which girl, i'll let you all pick which girl it was from the series they are from. it's a carnival after all. so enjoy the choice's. : 3 )</span></div></div>",

Her feet were big enough to flatten entire mountain ranges beneath them in a single stomp. As big as Taiga had become, she was barely half the size of this new armored goddess. Not knowing what else to do, Taiga shooed her remaining worshippers away and got to her feet, standing up and smiling nervously at Saber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh... Hi there, Saber... So, um, how've you been doing lately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save the small talk. You know as well as I do why I'm here at this ridiculous size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaiga looked around herself nervously and examined the destroyed ruins of what was once a prospering city. Even she herself was surprised by how much damage she had caused while having her fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this mess? About that... You wouldn't happen to believe me if I told you that it was like this when I got here, would you? Hehehehe...\" Taiga said, rubbing the back of her head nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber didn't even respond. She simply sighed, reached behind her head, and untied the ribbon that held her hair in place. As Saber's luxurious golden hair cascaded down behind her back, she picked up Taiga and wrapped the ribbon around the length of her body, tying her in an inescapable cocoon. With that done, she placed the restrained Taiga just outside the city limits and looked down at what was left of the city itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I am a Goddess, you can't do this to me-...Eh?\" Taiga spent the last few minutes struggling against her ribbon prison shouting demands. Overhead Saber was looming over the rest of the city an her unimaginable size, no doubt trying to think of a way to help it. At least that's what was supposed to be happening. So why was the sky suddenly getting darker? And what was this...Ominous music? Foreshadowing?! What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't even have a budget for music! Don't mention music when there isn't any!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's to set the mood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't give a damn...Eh? Who was that?\" Taiga looked around, not seeing anyone the voice could've come from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice returned, seemingly from nowhere. \"It is I, the narrator.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a narrator? Since when?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since it became convenient for this chapter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I call BS!!! Dark skies, music, narrators? What the heck's going on?!\" Taiga looked up to the looming Saber to try and get answers, instead she earned a chill down her spine. Dark clouds began to circle around Saber's body, her eyes clearly troubled by something going on internally. In moments even her form, as massive as it was, was obscured beneath the dark aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As Saber's body finally adjusted to her new height and it's change of power a darkness began to overtake her. A familiar memory of evil has taken root in her heart once more to embrace this power, corrupting Saber and bringing forth a true monstrous deity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't just needlessly make up exposition to explain crap because the writer's too lazy! How does being big even begin to make Saber evil?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Even now as the good inside the Giant Saber does its best to hold out against the waves of temptation to misuse her power her will continues to fade away, leaving in it's place only evil. Prepare as the world gives birth to a new dark Goddess. Saber...Alter!\" In perfect timing with the narrator's cry the dark clouds dissipated, revealing the Goddess beneath, only now she was clearly different. All the color left her as her skin changed to a ghostly white matched only by her hair. The gallant blue dress covered in armor was no more. In it's place was a black lolita dress that led perfectly to her nylon-covered legs and finally a pair of massive boots whose toes alone rose higher than Taiga could see. The only sign this was ever the same girl as before was the fact her hair was still down due to a lack of a ribbon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaiga's jaw dropped in her ribbon prison, \"Now she's bigger than me <i>and</i> evil?! What kind of garbage is this?! And how can she even be that big? I was at least a 100 miles tall and now I'm as big as her toes. Isn't she too big for the planet?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lesser giantess was silenced by an apathetic glance from Saber's bright yellow eyes. \"Logic is unnecessary. I am the Goddess now. If I want to be this big and still fit on the planet then I will just fine.\" Her voice carelessly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A new enemy arises! A true colossa capable of dominating the entire universe! How shall our hero Goddess Taiga conquer her latest foe?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what? Why do I have to do this? And when did I become the hero?! When did this become a cheesy Godzilla spoof?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Answer me dammit!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't just leave when it gets convenient for you! How the heck am I supposed to beat Saber?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and try bug.\" Goddess Taiga looked up to see Saber's amused face looking down at her. \"Go ahead...\" She reached for Taiga, plucking her from the ground. With zero effort the larger giant balanced the cocooned woman in her palm. \"Defeat me...If you can even get out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just watch me! I got the narrator on my side!\" Taiga pushed against her prison with all her might. Slowly it began to give way, slowly she felt the ribbon open up. Minutes of her struggling began to pay off and finally...the ribbon snapped back into place tighter than before. \"How is that even possible?!\" The giantess fumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you done?\" Saber asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes M'am\" Taiga sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes <i>Goddess</i>.\" She corrected. Silently Saber began to lower her captive again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What are you going to do to me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As my captive naturally I'm taking you to your prison. Think of it...as your new home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" Taiga hopped to her feet and proceeded to hop on her tied-up legs until she peer over the edge of Saber's palm. There she saw it-beneath her was the opening of Saber's boot, conveniently removed when she wasn't looking.. \"Huh?! I'm not going in there! It probably smells and is all sweaty an-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have a choice.\" Saber cut off, dropping Taiga in. Moments later her foot began to re-enter. Once it was securely back in her footwear Saber allowed a smirk as she felt a small, trapped, form between her toes. She took a moment to let her toes grind the little person between them as she turned her attention back to the town. Now, it was time for her reign as Goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How shall Taiga defeat this apparently unbeatable foe? How shall she save the day and prove only she is the one true Giantess? Tune in next time to find out!\" The Narrator cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It all began as another dull day in the TYPE-MOON cafe. The four workers, each bizarre-looking cat-like creatures, were silent until the blonde creature, named Neco-Arc suddenly shouted aloud. \"This is boring!!!\" Another one of the Neco's, Neco-Arc Bubbles, vigorously nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such is the way of the world.\" Came the melancholic voice of Neco-Arc Destiny, \"One minute everything is going well then the next the love dies down into monotony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm sick of just sitting around doing nothing! This place needs more excitement, and I've got an idea that'll make even that chaotic carnival look boring!\" Neco-Arc said enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* And what exactly do you have in mind?\" Neco-Arc Chaos asked bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeco-Arc simply pulled a ball out of her pocket and threw it at the ground. The instant that the ball made impact, it let out a dazzling flash of light that blinded all who were present. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, the light died down and the four Neco's found themselves standing on what appeared to be a giant stage. However, they were no longer alone. Standing to one side of them was the entire female cast of Tsukihime, and to the other side was the female cast of Fate/Stay Night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on? What are we doing back here again?\" Arcueid asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please do explain. What is the meaning of this?\" Saber asked in her usual formal tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone, settle down and allow me to explain!\" Neco-Arc said, \"You have all been invited here to take part in a special competition, and the winner will receive power beyond their wildest dreams! Welcome one and all to the first annual Greatest Goddess Competition!\" Neco-Arc finished by pulling a rope that fell down next to her, which raised a curtain behind them to reveal a neon sign depicting the name of the competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? That certainly sounds interesting... Explain, cat creature! What exactly <i>is </i>this competition of yours?\" Caster asked, intrigued by the idea of ultimate power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what's so important that you had to drag us all here for it?\" Akiha followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, just settle down and allow me to explain! First of all, you will be divided into separate teams: Team Moon and Team Fate!\" Neco-Arc said as she pointed toward the girls of Tsukihime and Fate/Stay Night respectively. \"Secondly, this competition is going to be held in two parts. Part 1 is the selection round, where each side will select a single member to represent their team in the second part. Part 2 is the real deal, where the two team reps will face off against eachother in 5 different challenges. The winner will be granted unlimited power and will earn the title of The Greatest Goddess! Also, the other members of the winning team will each receive a consolation prize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this sounds like it'll be a whole lot of fun! Let's do it!\" Illya said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now there's someone with the proper enthusiasm! Alright then, I'm going to explain how the selection round is going to work. You will each be placed into a giant city, and you'll have to demolish it however you see fit. Once your city has been completely destroyed, you will be graded on your performance and the city will be restored for the next member's turn. Points will be awarded for three categories: creativity, enthusiasm, and sex appeal. Creativity for destroying buildings in unique and original ways, enthusiasm for how much you enjoy yourself, and sex appeal for how aroused you can make the members of our audience get. Whichever member of each team gets the highest score will be their team's representative in the second round.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, let me get this straight: you expect us to be able destroy an entire city?! I may be a powerful mage, but even I'm not <i>that </i>powerful!\" Rin said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and I'm just an ordinary woman! How could I possibly destroy even a single building, let alone an entire city!\" Taiga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe... I was hoping that one of you would ask that... Behold!\" Neco-Arc said as she pulled a small raygun from her pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiming it at Sakura, the catgirl pulled the trigger on the gun. Instantly a beam fired from the device and hit the shy girl square in the chest. Moments later, Sakura's body began to rapidly expand. Before she even knew what was happening to her, her sudden growth spurt came to an end. Sakura was now towering over everyone around her at an amazing 100 feet tall, and looking fairly nervous as she examined her new titanic body. Luckily for her, the ray also made her clothes grow with her, or else she probably would have fainted from embarrassment. All the other girls could only stare up at the now-massive Sakura in awe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot waiting another moment, Neco-Arc went trigger happy and fired the ray all over the place. Soon each of the other girls had been blasted with the ray as well, and all of them had been turned into towering 100 foot tall giantesses. Neco-Arc then threw another one of her flash balls at the ground. Once again the intense light blinded everyone around, including the group of towering titanesses themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n When their vision returned, the girls looked around to see that they were no longer on the giant stage that they were on before. Now they were standing in the middle of a large grassy field, with only two things in sight for miles. The first was a pair of massive cities, each with many buildings of various sizes ready to be demolished by the giantesses. The second thing, which was located far away from both of the cities, was an enormous pair of bleachers with a massive TV screen positioned in front of it. On those bleachers sat the all of the males from Tsukihime and Fate/Stay Night, who had been brought in to serve as the audience for the competition. They all stared in awe at the TV screen in front of them, which was displaying a close up view of the giant girls who were standing near the cities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girls, this is it! Let round 1 of the Greatest Goddess Competition... Commence!\" Neco-arc announced as she fired a flare gun into the air, signalling the beginning of the contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth teams of giantesses then walked toward their respective cities and prepared to tear them down. The competition had begun.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For the sake of our team you are not the best choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKohaku nervously smiled, \"Yeah...I have to say so too. I love you Akiha but I think the choice here is obvious.\" Everyone else nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me.\" And four different voices suggested they should go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat started a huge debate. In seconds the well-mannered group of Giantesses were quickly clawing at each others throats in a surprisingly cartoony way. Akiha had Ciel by her hair as Ciel was holding back Arcueid's arms as she went after Kohaku who was hanging on to Hisui's side. Surprisingly Hisui was the only one not engaged in physical violence, being the only one in control enough to not let herself go like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the bleachers Shiki Tohno sat with everyone else from Tsukihime laughing nervously, \"Okay guys...You might want to focus now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if his words could reach their ears it wouldn't have done any good, their argument showed no signs of slowing down. Ciel and Akiha were more than ready to claw at the other women, Arcueid was having too much fun, and the twins were too focused with one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Team Fate's representative has been chosen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?!\" Everyone stopped their bickering and turned to the neighboring town to see who was up. Tohsaka Rin stepped up confidently with her team none-too happy behind her. She strode into the city and began her rampage, opening with the simple idea of stomping a few lesser buildings as a warm-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't waste any time! We got to pick now!\" Ciel released Akiha and stepped back. \"Now, bickering aside we can't all be the best choice. Let's narrow this down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Akiha!\" Arcueid happily cheered as a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?!\" The Tohno woman was ready to fight again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArcueid looked at her as if she was missing something obvious, \"One of the categories is sex appeal. You're too flat-chested to win us points in that.\" Akiha's face turned a deep vermilion but she turned away, \"Fine! But whoever goes up better wins!\" Everyone pitied her for being unable to argue the statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also think Hisui shouldn't go! She'd lose us points in enthusiasm!\" Kohaku pointed accusingly at her sister. There was a faint twinge in the monotone maid's eyes but her face kept it's expression. \"I see...I suppose that is also true.\" Was she embarrassed? It was hard to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're down to me, Arcueid, and Kohaku...\" Ciel held her chin in thought. Back on Team Fate Tohsaka had taken off all her clothes except for her underwear and was currently sitting on a building while simultaneously crushing a building she picked up between her breasts as she fiddled with debris in her toes. That was going to be tough to beat. Ciel bit her lip, \"We have to hurry up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, I'm going to go.\" Arcueid said so as if it were natural. Before the other girls could argue like last time she started to explain. \"Out of all of us I'm the most developed so I'm top candidate for sexual appeal. And I'm also one of the most playful so I'm near the top for enthusiasm. And creativity...\" She stopped, only smiling mysteriously. \"Besides! I'm the main heroine!\" Kohaku and Ciel raised a figure to answer but she was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! But if we ever get a chance to switch I'm going up!\" Ciel huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Arcueid cheered as she stepped forward to destroy their city. Team Fate already had a huge head start so she couldn't afford to take time warming up like they did. She jumped right into it. With a powerful stomp the first of many buildings met its end beneath her foot.The giant vampire couldn't help but grin; this was going to be fun. On the bleachers everyone was still eyeing Tohsaka but that would soon change: Arcueid spotted a water tower. \"Ooh! I'm kind of thirsty!\" Her voice innocently echoed, running to the water tower. The whole thing only came about as high as her chest which was perfect. The giantess stopped just short of the tower and caressed it with her finger, examining for a way to get the water out. When she \"accidentally\" poked her nail through it, causing a huge wave of water to gush out all over her. \"Aah!\" She made an over-exaggerated scream, \"I'm all wet now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat statement alone was enough for everyone to divert their attention from Tohsaka and look to Arcueid. All of the water that was in the tower had spilled out onto her, soaking her completely from the chest down. Her wool shirt she always wore was slowly shrinking against her ample bosom, as well as sticking to her skin. Likewise her skirt was now sticking to her legs. \"I guess I'll just have to take it all off!\" Arcueid smirked as her shirt flew from her body, exposing her breasts for all to see. In an equally sensual motion her skirt came off. Then her socks and shoes. When all was said and done Arcueid stood amidst her clothes in a set of white, water-soaked, underwear with a lustful look on her face. All of the water still clung to her body, giving it this dazzling effect where she seemed to shine amidst the city. Her underwear stuck against her bare skin, just wet enough to be partially see through but not enough to actually see anything. Perfect for teasing the judges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes were on her now. Arcueid looked around before finger next prey: a thin tower half as wide as she was. It showed the perfect opportunity to earn some major points. \"Ooh! I always liked poles!\" She laughed, running up to it and embracing the structure. The very tip of it was about chin-level, and just thin enough Arcueid got an idea. Cheers could be heard from the bleachers as she placed the tip of the building in her mouth, gently pulling back and forth for no other reason than to put on a good show. After a minute of her game she gently bit and ripped the top of the building off, crunching it to dust between her molars and swallowing. \"Oops.\" She giggled. The rest of the building followed suit, with each of Arcueid's breasts finding themselves on opposite ends of it with her legs. In a display of pure sexual power the giantess smashed the top of the building between her breasts as her legs handled the bottom part. As the building fell into a massive pile of rubble she stomped it into further dust with a huge grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBriefly Arcueid allowed herself to look over to the neighboring city. For all her fun she was having Tohsaka was almost done, she'd have to hurry this up or else. Lucky for Arcuied there was a huge cluster of buildings all together that just screamed to be crushed. And it soon was. In a simple motion the vampiress jumped and turned her body around so that her butt was first. As she fell she crash landed ass-first on the first of the buildings, crushing them beneath her posterior. She wasn't done though. Leaning back, Arcueid rested her head against the buildings behind her. Because they were so close together all it needed was a little push and soon they fell like dominoes. All over most of the buildings left that hadn't been toppled already were now falling, but they remained intact. Something Arcueid sought to fix. The giantess giggled like a school girl as she ran around stomping on each building, crushing them between her breasts and even sitting on them. Soon all that remained was a single, long building no higher than Arcueid's ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw! Last one?\" She frowned, she needed to go out on a bang. And such a small building could only be good for- No scratch that. She had a good idea. Arcueid put on the single most sensual look she could, it was one of pure sexual dominance that accentuated her beauty amidst the destruction around her. Gently her fingers removed the building from the ground, or rather, about half of it that didn't crumble in her grasp. \"I think you guys will all like this a lot.\" She spoke to the rubble in her hand as if there were tiny people inside. All eyes were on her as she enunciated each syllable in a deep, seductive voice. \"Don't disappoint me now.\" Arcueid's free hand gently pulled back the elastic on her panties, there she deposited the building. Where it could pleasure her for a few minutes until it was crushed against her groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over to the bleachers full of males with nosebleeds, \"Maybe if you're lucky I'll do the same with you...\" The giantess winked, returning back to her team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was...impressive.\" Akiha stood in awe of the vampire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...It was good...but so was Tohsaka.\" Ciel looked nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did Tohsaka do it?\" Arcueid looked to her competitor, curious how she was as a giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it like you were having fun teasing and crushing everything. Tohsaka was slower, more mature about it. She kept this demeanor like she was relishing in dominating everything. You both pretty much handled it in opposite ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArcueid shrugged, unconcerned, \"Let's see who won!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The winner of the first round of the Greatest Competition is...!\"</span></div></div>",

Acueid!\" Neco Arc announced enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArcueid jumped for joy as she head this, and Tohsaka slumped over with a look of defeat on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? I told you that I was the best choice!\" Arcueid said, looking over to Ciel with a look on her face that screamed<i> 'I told you so'</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah... Don't rub it in...\" Ciel mumbled, hating to have to admit that Arcueid had been right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, is somebody jealous? I'm sorry, it's not my fault that I'm so awesome! Maybe some day, if you're lucky, even you can be as cool and sexy as me!\" Arcueid said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get overconfident, vampire! You only won us the first round, and if you lose the rest of the tournament for us, then I'm going to be really pissed!\" Ciel shouted, being frustrated by Arcueid's attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but Arcueid won't be participating in the next round.\" Neco Arc said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? But you said that we had to choose someone to represent our team through the <i>whole</i> contest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I changed my mind. Having only one giantess doing all the work would be boring. Not just for me, but for the readers too.\" Neco Arc answered, blatantly disregarding the fourth wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're just going to change the rules in the middle of the contest?!\" Tohsaka said, overhearing the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" Neco Arc said bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can she even do that? Is that legal?\" Kohaku asked Akiha in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even care anymore... This whole thing was ridiculous from the beginning, let's just roll with it...\" Akiha said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now? If Arcueid and I aren't going to be the team reps, then how is this going to work?\" Tohsaka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple. Before each contest, the teams will pick the candidates who they think best fit the competition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how will the ultimate winner be decided if it isn't the representative of the winning team?\" Hisui asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy. The winning team will have a competition among themselves, and the one who wins that is the ultimate winner.\" Neco Arc replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me. This seems like a much more fair system anyway. Now we all have a shot at winning!\" Ciel said, glaring at Arcueid who began to whistle innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will the next competition be?\" Len asked calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since when did you get here?!\" The entirety of team moon asked in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were here the whole time.\" Len said, pointing to Satsuki and Aoko who were standing behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah why do we get ignored just because we aren't main protagonists? We're still a part of the female cast! We have just as much right to be here as you do!\" Aoko said, puffing up her cheeks in a pouty expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, fine, whatever... Minor characters interruptions aside, what exactly <i>are</i> we going to be doing next?\" Ciel asked, sounding a bit frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you asked!

Teamwork will be vital for victory here, so pick whoever you think will be the best for the job.\" Neco Arc said before vanishing in a puff of smoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did she even do that?\" Satsuki asked, confused by the contest's announcer disappearing into thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She dragged us here from our own worlds and managed to turn us all into giantesses.

She then turned her attention to Arcueid and smiled. \"That was a good match we had, vampire. Maybe we can face off again some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm open for a rematch any time you are. But it'll have to wait until after we win this tournament.\" Arcueid said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get cocky just yet. You've only won the first round, and there are still four more to go. Team Fate isn't going to lose as easily as you think!\" Tohsaka replied with a similar smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I wouldn't have it any other way. Victory just isn't as sweet if it's too easy to achieve. You were pretty good out there, but you'll need to do much better if you want to defeat us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I guess that settles that. We'll both go out and give it our all, and whoever wins in the end, no hard feelings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. May the best team win.\" Arcueid said, nodding in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two adversaries then shook hands before parting ways, having gained a newfound respect for eachother after having faced off on the field of battle. Tohsaka then proceeded to walk back to where the rest of her team was assembled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that that's out of the way, I think that we should decide who we'll be using for this round. Like the cat said, we need two people with perfect teamwork. A pair that knows eachother's strengths and weaknesses, and how to back them up. I think that there's only one choice that really makes sense for a competition like this.\" Akiha said, looking toward her two maids with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want us to do this?! Sure we're twins, and we know eachother better than anyone else in the world, but wouldn't it make more sense to pick someone with more combat experience?\" Kohaku questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the only two of us who really have any experience fighting are Ciel and I, and do you really want to put <i>us</i> on a team together?\" Arcueid said, pointing at Ciel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, she's right... Those two would spend more time tearing <i>eachother </i>apart than fighting the other team... We really are the only choice...\" Hisui said reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's decided. Hisui and Kohaku, it's all up to you.\" Ciel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, we'll do our best!\" the two maids said in unison, a determined expression on both of their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver on Team Fate, things were going similarly. Not of the members were particularly well acquainted with eachother, and those who were on good terms with eachother were closer to rivals than true partners. In the end, they also found that teamwork only really existed in one place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just leave it to my maids! They're both homunculi specifically created to work together and serve as my bodyguards. They'll be more than capable of winning this match for us!\" Illya said confidently, waving a hand toward Leysritt and Sella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they aren't even major characters! How are a couple of sidecharacters like them going to win us anything?\" Taiga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're one to talk. Your role isn't that major yourself. Anyway, the shrimp seems pretty confident in their abilities, and it's not like we've got any better options. I say we give the maids a chance.\" Rider said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't be disappointed. In the name of our master, Illyasviel von Einzbern, we shall not lose.\" The two homunculi said in unison as they bowed to the rest of their team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter both teams had selected their representatives, the rubble of the two cities from the previous round disappeared. In its place, a single gigantic city sprung from the ground. The two pairs of maids walked toward their arena and prepared to face off. Round two of the Greatest Goddess Competition was about to get underway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore we proceed to describe the ensuing battle, who do you want to win?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two pairs of maids entered the city and took their positions on opposite sides, ready to fight it out with everything they had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the side of Team Fate, Leysritt and Sella were vastly different in terms of physical ability. Sella's body was relatively fragile, being designed with a far greater potential for magic than physical combat. Unfortunately for her, this match wouldn't allow her to use her magical skills to her advantage. However, what Sella lacked in physical skill, Leysritt more than made up for. She was created specifically for combat, and her power rivaled even that of Rider, the strongest female servant in terms of raw physical strength. It was clear to everyone watching that Leysritt was the one holding up the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the side of Team Moon, Hisui and Kohaku were a much more balanced pairing. Neither of them were weak like Sella, nor did they come close to matching the superhuman strength that Leysritt possessed. They were both simply average, and while defeating Sella alone wouldn't be too difficult, Leysritt would require them to work together like they never had before. It truly was like Neco Arc said, teamwork was the key to victory here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that note, Team Moon seemed to hold the advantage. While neither of them were particularly skilled at fighting, their teamwork was unrivaled. Meanwhile, Leysritt and Sella seemed to suffer in that respect due to their clashing personalities. While they had always worked together as Illya's bodyguards, it seemed that their entire relationship was purely built on that shared duty. Hisui and Kohaku had grown up together, shared their joys and their sorrows, they knew eachother inside and out. It was more than obvious which team had the better chemistry. The only question was, would teamwork alone enough to make up for their lack of combat training? Only time would tell...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a bell rang in the distance, signalling the beginning of the next match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisui and Kohaku both looked at eachother and nodded before running toward Sella. Leysritt was a much bigger threat, but taking her on first wouldn't be a smart idea. They could probably take her together, but if Sella interfered things could go badly very fast. Luckily for them, Sella was weak, and it probably wouldn't take too much effort to make her tap out. If they got rid of her, they could team up on Leysritt without worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all their strength, the twins both punched Sella square in the face, sending her reeling in pain. Not letting her regain her composure, Kohaku quickly tackled her and pinned her to the ground. With Kohaku sitting on Sella's chest and keeping her pinned helplessly, Hisui picked up a massive building and slammed it down on her legs. Sella cried out in pain as she felt the bones in her legs crack, and she immediately surrendered to the twins' teamwork. Having tapped out, an unknown force healed her broken bones and knocked her unconscious so that she wouldn't interfere with the rest of the match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKohaku and Hisui got up and high-fived eachother before turning their attention to Leysritt. Without an ally to help her, Leysritt would be fighting them two against one. Sure her strength was superior to any one human, but even she doubted that she could handle two opponents at once. Still, she wouldn't give in. She had given Illya her word that she would win this round, and she was determined to do just that. Holding her ground, she braced herself as Hisui and Kohaku charged toward her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first they made Leysritt think that they were going to tackle her to the ground, but at the last second they stopped right in front of her and each of them grabbed one of her arms. The twins laughed to eachother as they pulled Leysritt's arms apart and restrained her. They then shoved her to the ground, watching as countless buildings were flattened beneath her collapsing frame, before jumping up and sitting down on top of Leysritt's arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Hisui atop her right and Kohaku atop her left, Leysritt found herself unable to move her arms at all. Try as she might, not even she was strong enough to lift their entire body weigh with a single arm. From this position, Leysritt was essentially helpless. She could still move her legs, but she couldn't reach to kick the twins off her arms.  She struggled and squirmed but it was hopeless. With a playful giggle, Hisui lightly slapped Leysritt across the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you give up yet?\" She taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never!\" Leysritt said, refusing to give in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, have it your way. We can do this all day f you want.\" Kohaku said, slapping Leysritt slightly harder than her sister had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins took tuns slapping their captive in the face, using just a bit more force each time. They giggled devilishly the whole time, enjoying the feeling of dominating someone so completely. Leysritt was beginning to snap. At first their slaps had been light and playful, barely more than taps on her cheeks, but soon they began to hurt. They became more forceful with each blow, and now their palms were slamming into her face with incredible strength. Each slap stung fiercely, and it only kept getting worse with each passing moment. Leysritt struggled with every bit of her superhuman strength, but she couldn't free her arms from beneath the twins' rear ends. She was helpless, unable to escape the torment. Eventually even the homunculus designed specifically for combat had no choice but to admit defeat. She just couldn't take it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough! You win! Please, just stop!\" Leysritt cried, her cheeks glowing red from the numerous blows they had received. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, now was that so hard?\" Hisui said playfully, gently stroking her captive's swollen cheek with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins got up off of Leysritt's arms at once and hugged eachother in celebration of their victory. With a grunt of frustration, Leysritt got up and helped Sella get to her feet. The two then walked away and returned to join their team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did it, sis! We really did it! We won!\" Kohaku said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was there ever any doubt about it? When it comes to teamwork, nobody can beat us!\" Hisui said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisui and Kohaku then returned to stand with the rest of Team Moon. With a puff of smoke, the massive city that had been all but demolished by the maids' wrestling match disappeared into thin air. In its place, a massive golden statue of Neco Arc rose from the ground with the real Neco Arc standing on its head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the winner of round two is... Team Moon!\" Neco Arc announced as everyone else simply stood their in shock of her ridiculous entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you ever show up normally?!\" Ciel yelled at the catgirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, and where would be the fun in that?\" Neco arc asked. \"Anyway, now you guys both have one win each. Our next round could go either way! So, on to round 3!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what exactly is round 3?\" Hisui asked, still supporting her sister as they stood side by side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Round 3 will be...\"</span></div></div>",

She was the biggest threat to them, and if they could take her out first, then Sella would be helpless to stop them. Their target simply stood there and held her ground, the only movement from her was her white maid uniform fluttering in the breeze. However, as Hisui tackled Leysritt to the ground and began to struggle against her superior strength, Sella had pulled a small building from its foundation and thrown it at the back of Kohaku's head. The building hit her hard, distracting her long enough for Sella to grab her by the hair and pull her away from her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't allow you to interfere, child. We will win this battle Lady Illya.\" Sella said as she dragged Kohaku to the other side of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, come on! Let me go!\" Kohaku yelled while she struggled to break free of Sella's grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments she overpowered her adversary's fingers and freed her hair from her grip. Seeing how badly her sister was fairing against Leysritt alone, she immediately turned to rush to her aid. However, Sella wasn't done interfering. She quickly stepped into Kohaku's path, arms spread wide to block her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out of my way, you bitch! My sister needs me!\" Kohaku said, becoming very frustrated with Sella's continued interference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall not. If you wish to get past me, then you must do so by your own strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, don't make me laugh! You aren't strong enough to beat me and you know it!\" Kohaku said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not need to defeat you, child. I merely need to keep you occupied long enough for my comrade to finish her job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKohaku quickly jumped forward, realizing the truth in Sella's words. Hisui was no match for Leysritt on her own, and she probably wouldn't last much longer at this rate. If Kohaku didn't get to her aid fast, she would be forced to tap out. By herself kohaku would have no chance of winning the match. With all her strength she wrestled Sella to the ground and pinned her arms down in an attempt to force her to submit. Dozens of buildings were flattened beneath their bodies as the two giantesses wrestled against one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tap out, now!\" Kohaku said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never!\" Sella responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said tap out, bitch! I don't have time for this!\" Kohaku barked, growing increasingly impatient with her stubborn opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKohaku twisted Sella's arm behind her head, and after a bit of pressure she managed to get the girl to tap our. Unfortunately for her, she was too late. Just as Sella had submitted, so to had Hisui. Without her sister to aid her she was helpless at Leysritt's mercy. She had held out as long as she could, hoping that Kahoku would come to her aid, but she had endured more than she could handle. Now it was a one on one match between Kohaku and Leysritt, and the outcome was more than obvious to everyone watching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that she didn't have a chance against Leysritt in a head to head battle, Kohaku resorted to taking advantage of her environment. She reached down and pulled a building off of the ground like Sella had before, and quickly tossed it at Leysritt's head. However, she simply swatted the flying structure out of the air, causing it to crash into the ground behind her and cause major collateral damage. Panicking, Kohaku repeated this tactic several more times, but the results were always the same. Leysritt continued advancing toward her and there was nothing she could do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Leysritt reached Kohaku and grabbed hold of her. With astounding strength, she flung her opponent over her shoulder and sent her crashing into the city below. The collision knocked the wind out of her, and Kohaku simply laid there dazed while Leysritt approached her again. With all of her superhuman strength, Leysritt slammed the heel of her foot into Kohaku's chest, making her gasp in pain. The next thing she knew, Leysritt had lifted her up and trapped her in a headlock. Kohaku couldn't believe this woman's strength, it was absolutely astounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you submit?\" Leysritt asked emotionlessly as she squeezed her powerful arms around Kohaku's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes! I give! You win, now let me go already!\" Kohaku cried, tapping against Leysritt's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then.\"  Leysritt said as she released her grip on Kohaku and let her fall to the ground in exhaustion. She then walked over to Sella and helped her to her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two homunculi bowed politely to their defeated adversaries before walking away to return to their team. After catching her breath, Hisui walked over to Kohaku and helped her sister up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe... We really blew it, huh sis...\" Kohaku said as she stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but we did our best. I guess we'll just have to hope that the others can win the next few rounds for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisui and Kohaku then returned to stand with the rest of Team Moon. With a puff of smoke, the massive city that had been all but demolished by the maids' wrestling match disappeared into thin air. In its place, a massive golden statue of Neco Arc rose from the ground with the real Neco Arc standing on its head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the winner of round two is... Team Fate!\" Neco Arc announced as everyone else simply stood their in shock of her ridiculous entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you ever show up normally?!\" Ciel yelled at the catgirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, and where would be the fun in that?\" Neco arc asked. \"Anyway, now you guys both have one win each. Our next round could go either way! So, on to round 3!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what exactly is round 3?\" Hisui asked, still supporting her sister as they stood side by side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Round 3 will be...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Um...are you sure this is a good idea Natalia?\" The wide eyes of a child stared up at a beautiful woman in a revealing white top and jeans. Her eyes looked back at him with strictness, \"This is a part of your training. Unless you wish to back out I'm doing this.\" She reached up and gently played with a few silvery hairs. \"Whether or not you back out is not my concern though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiya Kiritsugu sat in the middle of an intricate magic circle inside of Natalia's workshop. It resembled the kind of place one would expect a mercenary to live which made sense. At a single motion from the woman he called his mentor the circle would activate. He was apprehensive knowing what was about to come, but if it was a part of his training then he had no choice. He'd already lost everything, all he had left was his dream and in order to achieve that he needed Natalia's training. He had to bite his lip but his eyes looked back to the woman with determination and a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia nodded in return, \"I'll remind you. Once I do this it isn't over until I say so. Should you fail to reach my standards or die along the way I'll never undo the spell. Even knowing that you wish to proceed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get on with it.\" Kiritsugu impatiently retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well...\" Wordlessly Natalia knelt down and laid her hand on the edge of the circle. Her lips opened to say something but it was too fast and in a language too foreign to make sense. Kiritsugu's eyes never left her the entire time. The chant was long, taking a full ten seconds before the circle basked the room in a white glow. Defiantly the boy stared into the blinding light,  not letting his eyes shut. He could feel the spell working on his body, everything around him was changing. As determined as he was moments ago, even he couldn't hold back the small gulp that came when the light died down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe already towering Natalia was now just inhumanely gigantic. Kiritsugu saw himself eye level with the tip of her boots. Craning his head back as far as he could he could only make out the fluttering edge of her shirt. She was too big and too close for him to even see anything else, if he wanted to actually look all the way up to his teacher's face he'd have to back up quite a bit. Not that it mattered anyway, beyond her knees Natalia's immense figure began to blur. She truly did shrink Kiritsugu down to the size of a bug like she told him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little change in her expression Natalia knelt her head over to see the speck before her feet. \"Now, you are facing a magus whom you have no hope to survive against. Survive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kiritsugu had time to fully realize the situation he was now in the ground around him darkened in shadow. What was the sky was now replaced with the leather sole of his teacher's boot. There was no need to think about what she was doing, Kiritsugu took off running as soon as the ground around him changed. Natalia was merciless, she stomped as quickly as a normal person would a bug. There was no slowing down for the sake of her student. It was only by inches that her foot missed Kiritsugu, but already it was back up and tracing the air over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother stomp came dangerously close, it was a quick, instinctive roll that saved Kiritsugu from death. But like before his teacher had her foot already in the air for the next one. \"You have to do better than that bug boy! I've only stomped twice and can go on for hours. Use your physical ability and wit to evade and if that isn't sufficient resort to magic. This is life or death. Your enemy will show you no quarrel!\" Natalia's foot began to lower again, this time more gradual but her foot was following her prey this time. Kiritsugu had no hope of escaping like he had been. There was only one option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child closed his eyes and thought the key phrase. His magical circuits stirred to life to activate his spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Time Alter...Double Accel</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world seemed to slow down to Emiya Kiritsugu. Only he retained normal movement. He ran as fast as his child legs could. Right over his head Natalia's boot was close enough he could touch it. In the corner of his eye Kiritsugu noticed the splattered remains of a bug. That would soon be him if he didn't hurry. His chest started to hurt but he kept running. He had his spell on for several seconds and its toll was already becoming apparent. But the end was right in sight. With a final dive the young man safely landed outside of the danger zone. His spell gave way right then and time reverted to normal. A puff of dust hit the child in the face from Natalia's stomp, but he avoided it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever there was no time to relax. His Master already had her foot back in the air and Kiritsugu continued running. He only had enough in him for one more Double Accel. And even if he cast it it had no chance of lasting as long as his first one. But it had to do, before Natalia got any closer the boy focused his magic and gave one final burst. His body felt as if it was going to explode, everything got hazy, but the boom came from behind Kiritsugu. His head turned back to see another narrowly avoided stomp, a fatal mistake. Natalia quickly bent over and plucked the child from the ground with ease. He was now dangled before her harsh eyes helplessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're in the enemies clutches and you're out of magic. In other words, you're dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiritsugu winced, expecting his teacher's fingers to tighten until he popped, but instead her eyes eased slightly. \"But that's to be expected on your first day. You did satisfactory for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you want a reward?\" Natalia's tone changed and her eyes had a strange look to them. Kiritsugu didn't understand but he caught sight of her free hand gently tugging at her chest. The kid blushed when he saw quite literally two mountains right beneath him. He was brought closer to Natalia's face, her breath began to gently blow against his body. \"I'm sure at this size I must look like some kind of deity. Even to you my body must look inviting. But not happening.\" Kiritsugu was pulled away and gently placed upon a table where a number of guns laid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia began to pace the room, \"I'm sure you feel proud to survive your first session but I'd like to point out some things. It probably looked to you like you were covering a lot of ground but you only covered about two feet. I didn't even have to change my position. And you ran out of Prana by the fifth stomp. Enemies won't have the mercy I have. If I just gave one more stomp you'd have been crushed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiritsugu gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still have a lot to learn.\" Natalia pulled a chair and sat down near the table. \"Magi are going to outclass you, and weapons aren't enough. You need to learn how to survive and outlast them. But we'll get there.\" There were a couple loud thumps that said she removed her boots. \"All things considered you're doing well for a kid. But training's done for the day, no point in doing something when you have no prana. So in the mean time make yourself useful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Kiritsugu jumped, \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia shrugged, but there was a clear mischief in her eyes \"There's a few hours left in the day so I think you should...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the giantess' words trailed off two loud booms crashed in front of Kiritsugu. Now looming over him were the two giant feet of his teacher. \"On top of stomping after you I've been pretty busy today so my feet are a touch sore. So would you give me a foot massage Kiritsugu?\" Natalia moved her head slightly to the side to see her pupil staring at her immense sole, the kid saw a small smirk on her face. \"Your body still needs training so we can look at this like a chance to build muscles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand what you're saying Natalia...But...\" His eyes traced along the tender sole of the woman, \"...Isn't it a little too big for me?\" Kiritsugu had no time to measure himself beforehand but now that things were slowed down he saw he was no bigger than one of his teacher's toes, her smallest toe at that. Right now her upright feet were over a dozen times his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia smiled playfully, \"Are you saying my feet are big? A lot of women would take that as an insult you know.\" Her feet lowered dangerously close to Kiritsugu, close enough he could reach up and touch the ball of her foot. \"I'm not sure how I feel about that...You may want to make this massage a great one otherwise I may just get mad.\" Her feet returned to being perfectly erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWordlessly the child approached his teacher's foot and began to gently push his hands into her feet. As much as Natalia was on the go they were oddly soft, even at his size a slight push gave way to creamy skin. Coating Natalia's feet was a thin layer of sweat, something she herself probably didn't even feel it was so faint. A faint air hung about that was kind of disgusting but that was nothing. After a second of two Kiritsugu pulled his hands back to look at them. They shined as if he coated them in a liquid, just a mere touch of Natalia's feet coated his hands in a mixture of her sweat and body oils. At this point most people would be disgusted, and Kiritsugu admittedly was, but he had to complete his training. He lost so much that his feelings were irrelevant anymore. His eyes looked cold and emotionless to hide any emotion he still had. With that expression the child fervently continued to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering his clear size handicap Kiritsugu's massage was going along rather well. Natalia's sole was soft enough his hands only needed a decent amount of strength behind them and being small enough to grab the wrinkles helped give him a means of moving along his teacher's feet. After a minute or so his hands were soaked in Natalia's fluids but he didn't care, it all quickly fell into a basic monotonous process. The small amount of foot odor that wafted in the air slowly began to be as breathable as air, the kid didn't even register it after a while. The fact he was shrunken and massaging a giant sweaty foot was still disgusting of course, but slowly he began to adapt. Then the problem arose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven his size Kiritsugu knew he'd have to climb her teacher's sole in order to massage all of it, he expected that kind of harshness from her. He easily did so despite a slight fatigue in his arms. But that left the issue of how to massage? His arms and feet were all used to hoister him up and keep him where he was, so what could he massage with without falling? The answer was kind of simple but kind of gross at the same time. Kiritsugu began to rub his entire body against Natalia's sole to massage. Beyond her foot the woman saw this and casually smiled as if she was amused by the affection to her foot. To Kiritsugu it was just a means to an end. After a few minutes even the minute embarrassment of rubbing his whole body against Natalia's foot lost its touch. He just continued tending to her word out foot muscles until he had to climb up. Once he hit the ball of her foot the curve was enough he could start using his hands again though it seemed his body was more effective. The whole process seemed more like a tedious job than anything else, time quickly lost all meaning. It felt like it'd only been minutes but Kiritsugu knew a glance at the clock would say something much different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally though he arrived at the looming toes of Natalia, five digits ranging from as tall as Kiritsugu to twice his size. Once more the fear one would normally have at this size didn't seem to grip the kid as he massaged each individual toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clean between the toes too while you're at it.\" Came the bored order of the giant woman, passing the time by glancing through a book now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't matter at this point, Kiritsugu had long since not cared what he was doing. His hands quickly went to work removing any small grime he found between each toe. With where he was he expected the smell to be stronger than ever, but it seemed that he was massaging for so long the smell had the chance to vanish. Probably lucky for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One foot done.\" The first words he said after beginning. With his job halfway done Kiritsugu climbed back down to begin work on the other one. His body was tired, more than he would have liked. His whole body felt like it was covered in oil, he felt dirty. The towering left foot that remained seemed like an incredibly daunting task now, but he went to work again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his hands began to work on the base of Natalia's foot he noted there was no sweat now. It must've dried up at some point. Although his hands still got coated in the oils. He just went back into his almost robotic process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiritsugu's body began to work the familiar gestures on its own, and for the first time since he began his mind began to wander. Since it was right in front of him he began to notice aspects of Natalia's feet. In the short time he'd known her he knew right away the woman was incredibly attractive, a trait that seemed to echo to her feet too. Even worn out her soles were smooth, silky even, and had no blemishes or odd spots. The smell in itself wasn't so much bad as it was...different than what Kiritsugu usually smelled. Looking back he was hesitant to even describe it as bad. The sweat and oils were natural for all people, but something about Natalia's seemed to almost decorate her feet in a complimentary way. Each of the toes Kiritsugu noted were essentially perfect. They were each well-defined, soft, the perfect length, even the pinky toe which usually looks like an ugly addition on people stood perfectly as if it belonged. Not to mention each toe was painted with a silvery-blue to match Natalia's hair. Her feet were just...perfect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that realization Kiritsugu thought about the whole body of his friend. Perhaps it was his young mind going lustfully but he was having trouble finding any way to describe Natalia aside from perfect. A big chest that was well defined proportional. A nice-sized rear that fit tightly against her pants. A beautiful face. Even her usual cold demeanor was in itself an oddly appealing thing, it gave the idea she was always in charge of what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile his thoughts focused on how beautiful his teacher was, Kiritsugu didn't realize he'd already approached the last five toes he had to work on. His body was beyond exhausted but just five more toes and he'd be done, for some reason that seemed to disappoint him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiritsugu...\" Natalia spoke once again, her eyes were fully focused on the kid she could spot between her toes. \"I want you to do something different here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Natalia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia's eyes were commanding, almost glaring even. \"For my toes I want you to lick them and between them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What?</i> That came right from nowhere, why did Natalia suddenly want her feet worshiped like that? No...perhaps a more important question would be why Kiritsugu was happy she asked. \"Yes mam.\" The child's rational mind screamed at him that something was amiss, but his body and heart didn't care. With no pause Kiritsugu approached each toe and gently cleaned them with his tongue, even between them. What he tasted wasn't disgusting, but actually heavenly. He didn't understand why, he just kept doing it. The bottoms of her toes, the toe nails, between them, the sides, all of it was cleaned in a matter of minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn.\" Natalia bit her lip once Kiritsugu finished. The child sat between her toes confused, \"Looks like we'll have a lot of work to do with your constitution.\" Once again she was answered with a dumbfounded look. Natalia sighed, \"I should have told you this, but you understand that some Magi are descended from things not necessarily human right? Well to keep it short I'm descended from a succubus. It comes with a lot of perks but one thing it does is it makes my body emit a constant pheromone. You noticed my body oils right?\" Kiritsugu nodded, dumbfounded by the sudden revelation. \"Well they're filled with pheromones. I thought you'd be able to handle it but it looks like you couldn't. Right now you're so attracted to me it's not even funny, I'm practically a Goddess in your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all made sense, Kiritsugu began to realize the sudden disgust of his task vanished rather quickly, and towards the end he was downright idolizing Natalia as perfect. He realized it, but it didn't change. \"What do we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalia sighed, \"There's only one thing we can do to get so much of it out of your system...\" She paused for a second...</span></div></div>",

I pull out my sword and he falls to the ground. He started to say something but coughed up blood instead he kept trying and trying until he muttered some phrase I still cannot decipher, something about betrayal and vanishing from the world. The bastard finally disappeared and with it his monster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, the King of Knights proves to be of some worth after all.\" Archer says with his ego taking up more room than the grail itself. He started blabbering about how he would have killed Caster sooner, however I was distracted by the fact how Excalibur felt unnaturally heavy. I shrugged it off as mere fatigue and returned to Irisviel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you have gotten new shoes, why the longer heel though?\" I asked noticing how she was roughly an inch taller than usual. \"What are you talking about Saber? These are the shoes I always wear!\" she lifted one eyebrow in confusion \"My mistake, sorry.\" I apologized and drove back to our headquarters, it seems Kiritsugu drove it because the seat was too far back. Irisviel tried to start small talk, but Caster's words echoed in my head on and on. I decided not to tell Kiritsugu of this since it had nothing to do with me as a servant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe finally got to the mansion to meet up with Archer and Rider's masters. Irisviel wanted to join them and seeing how she is my provisional master I could not refuse her order. I simply accompanied her due to my lack of trust of Archer, whom also was at the table. Now that Caster is dead the cease fire is void.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone sat down while I stood by Irisviel, a servant should always be there for their master. The meeting went on peacefully, however I could not get my ponytail to stay up, for the hair band continued to fall off. I couldn't bring attention to this trivial matter so I let my the band fall and my hair return to its original form.</span></div></div>",

Rider complied but kept looking at me as we walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rider, is something about me confusing you?\" I asked, he scanned me up and down and shrugged, \"Its nothing, I just thought you were taller, but hey! The size of a person is not what makes them fit for battle! My master is a pipsqueak yet he knows his stuff!\" Rider laughed as he picked up his master, in which he flails around and asked to be put down. I must have found this more amusing than I thought because I lost my footing and fell out of my shoe. Luckily nobody saw it so I was not too embarrassed. Rider and his master rode off as I returned to Irisviel, who seemed much taller than when I last saw her. Irisviel went to bed and I returned to Kiritsugu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, could I have some new shoes? These seemed to have stretched out\" I requested as I showed him how the shoe no longer fits, the heel of the shoe dangling off my foot as I raise it. \"Saber, those shoes do not stretch, I had them enchanted to be invincible. After all, you take a lot of wear and tear in battle, your clothes do not need the same treatment. This confused me, just yesterday the shoes fit fine, now I have to make a mental note not to walk out of them. Perhaps this is something to do with Caster?</span></div></div>",

The next day I re-materialized to perform my daily duties such as escorting Irisviel. \"Irisviel, could I please acquire some new clothes? Its not just the shoes, it seems my whole outfit has stretched out.\" She shrugged \"I don't know, just go in your knight form then.\" That is a good idea, after all my knights armor is part of me and not of this world, besides Kiritsugu has the manna to allow such a task. I go into my knight form but I do not summon my sword, if we are to be in public we cannot have such a weapon. The armor feels heavier than usual however it is nothing I cannot handle. I accomplish my tasks, and Irisviel was kind enough to purchase me a short black dress and black flats. This is not something that would have been worn in my time, however if it is acceptable in this time then that is what matters <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrisviel continued to shop for herself and found a small dress, she wanted to try it on so I waited by the changing room. Time went on and I started to hear Casters voice again. He was screaming something in a language I could not understand and every time he did I felt my dress shift downward, almost like it was being pulled. I tried to ignore Caster's voice only to realize a dress strap fell off, by the time I fixed it the other strap fell off. I went to knock on Irisviel's door to see if she was done and I stepped right out of my right shoe, I put it back on only to realize it was a size too big. It finally clicked what was happening to me: I was shrinking. \"Irisviel, Caster has done something to me and I need to get back to the mansion.\" I urgently pleaded as I knocked on the door, ignoring both straps of my dress having now fallen off and the heel of my foot stepping out of my shoes. Irisviel did not answer, I was running out of time. It seemed every time I knocked I would have to reach up in order to knock in the same spot. My dress finally started to fall but I grabbed it, the dress slowly became heavier and heavier with each passing second. I had no choice but to de-materialize, yet I was unable to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You thought so low of me Jean, so I will make you as low as I am!\" I heard Caster's voice echo in my head as I knocked as loudly as I could on Irisviel's door, met with the same lack of response. \"Irisviel I'm coming in!\" I was still tall enough to grab onto the door and with all my strength I barged in, when the door open I feel flat on my face from slipping out of both shoes, I tried to get up to my feet, only to have my underwear fall to the ground!

My only guess is the shrinking curse was contagious, yet how come she became smaller than me? I was about 4'2 in that moment, 10 inches shorter than my usual height, and that was over a process of about a day. Irisviel became 2 inches in the span of 3 minutes! <br>\r\nShe finally noticed someone was there and grabbed her panties to cover herself, only to realize it was me and calm down (after all, we're both girls).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Irisviel, how did this happen to you?\" I asked not realizing how the world was still growing around me. \"I knew Caster had a curse on you Saber, so I thought if it was transferred to someone else it would nullify since it was directed to you. Unfortunately, the process seemed to have doubled when transferred... Oh God! You are so small yourself! This is all my fault I am so sorr-\" Irisvel tried to finish her sentence but was caught off by her crying. I tried my best to comfort her, however it was become increasingly more difficult as I dwindled in size, soon I would become as small as her, if not smaller! I grabbed Irisviel's glove and gave it to her as a means of covering oneself, She quickly turned it into a dress, I was shocked at how good of a job she did with transforming such an item into a make shift dress that was rather pretty. Speaking of dresses, mine had become more akin to that of a modern day wedding dress on me. I found myself having to roll up the edges as to stop them from falling off of my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saber, could you please call Kiritsugu and let him know to pick us up while you are still of size?\" Irisvel managed to calm down and ask in her now quite voice.

If I would have known I could have exorcised the curse and saved you some height! Now Irisviel too?\" Kiritsugu sounded upset as this happened, \"By order of command seal I demand you to return at once!\" I felt my body start to teleport as I locked the changing room door to keep Irisvel safe.

Of course I was the next one to blush when I realized I was naked, surrounded by a giant tent I once called a dress. While I grabbed my dress and used it to cover myself, Kiritsugu grabbed a napkin off the table and handed it to me. It sufficed as a dress, yet it was still twice my size! I had to rip it in half so I would not trip on the ends, or worse make myself naked again. Summoning my armor didn't work, so this was the best I had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiritsugu put his hand on the ground so I could walk on it and be lifted up, it felt so strange my bare feet on a giant hand. He put me on the table and lit a cigar as he tried to comprehend what has happened. \"Saber, you said this was due to Caster's curse right?\" He asked as softly as he could, yet it still boomed in my ears. I nodded my head silently, only to make him angrier \"Great! Since its from another servant it still counts as part of the war! So much for the Church helping.\" He blew out some smoke and put his cigar back in his mouth. Then I remembered: Irisviel was still trapped in the store! \"Master, Irisviel is-\" \"Do not speak!\" He roared so loud I could feel the vibrations. He grabbed me by my left ankle and lifted me up to his face, I tightly held the napkin to make sure it does not fall off. \"My one chance at saving humanity, and you blew it, you fucking blew it. How were you able to be a King if you can't even be a servant?\" his insult turned my face from red with embarrassment to red with anger. I wanted to shout at him, yet I knew that would only end in badly for me. He stared at me for what felt like hours, saying nothing the whole time. Finally he sighed and yanked me into his front pocket. \"2 Inches tall or 2 yards tall, you are still my servant. I called for you and you answered. We have a pact and we must finish it to the end.\" My face went back to blushing as I heard this. How could he say that when I am in this state? My feet don't even reach the end of his pocket, they dangled as I held on to the edges! \"I will finish this, and I will win it for you Master. That is a knights promise.\" I managed to say, I'm not sure if he heard it or not, as he simply started walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, where are we going?\" I wasn't sure if I had the right to ask, yet I did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiritsugu softly said...</span></div></div>",

Can you back up a little bit? All your faces this close is kind of making me uncomfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three women, Touko, Azaka, and Shiki, all backed up respectively. The space brought some much needed relief. Mikiya was tense but he couldn't help but imagine how ridiculous the scene must look to an outsider. All four of them were inside of the Hall of Monastery, Touko's Supernatural Detective Agency, which looked like little more than a heavily disorganized office with papers scattered everywhere. There three beautiful girls, Touko, Azaka, and Shiki respectfully, were each staring intently at a desk that looked completely empty. As Mikiya looked back at each girl he could see the difference in their stares. Touko looked like her mind was running at full speed to process everything. Azaka looked oddly happy given the circumstances. And Shiki...well her expression was hard to read, but Mikiya had the feeling she was concerned. Of course what would they all be staring at? Well Mikiya of course. To an outsider he was nowhere to be seen, but if everyone was talking to a desk that would mean he was at the desk. And he was. Sitting as a shrunken speck on top of a wooden desk sat the young man, nervously looking back at three giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kokuto, can you explain to us how this happened?\" Touko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikiya sighed, \"I already told you guys. You sent Shiki out to clear out a group of ghosts behind some kidnappings, I happened to run into the scene just as one was about to hit her. I took the hit-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which was dumb by the way.\" Shiki rudely interrupted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikiya didn't react, \"-I  passed out, next thing I knew I was staring at the treads of Shiki's boots. If she didn't notice me I think I'd be done for right now.\" He smiled thankfully at the stoic giantess. She averted her gaze without changing expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouko sighed, pulling a cigarette from her breast pocket. \"That doesn't help me much. Size magic isn't something I'm familiar with, much less when it involves spirits so I'm not too sure how to handle this.\" She pulled out a lighter and began to light it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But at least you're safe with us now Mikiya! You've never looked cuter either!\" Azaka smiled down at her brother. \"Until we get you fixed you can be like the office pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks but no thanks Azaka. I'm sure Touko will have me fixed up in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anything else at least you're alive.\" Shiki nonchalantly added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to his giant friend Mikiya just laughed, \"True. I can't complain much about the view either. Seeing you like this is just...something else.\" His voice seemed to drag off and expose some deeper feelings, but no one reacted to them. Well, almost no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I look Nii-san?\" Azaka stepped between Mikiya and his oggling of Shiki. \"Huh?\" Her face went dangerously close to him, close enough he could make out his reflection in her pupils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...You look more adorable than ever Azaka.\" Came his nervous reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzaka backed off, clearly not fully satisfied with what she heard. Mikiya could only tilt his head and ponder what was upsetting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilent during all this talk, Touko had walked over to the office window with her cigarette. \"It's important you stay positive Kokutou, there is a good chance you'll be like this for a little while.\" Her surprisingly blunt statement silenced everyone and drew attention, \"At the moment your size is somewhere around half an inch high. We're going to have to be extra careful around her to compensate for that. But this is all under the assumption that your condition won't change anytime in the future. For all we know time might just bring you back to normal, or it could get worse...\" Her voice trailed off as she put out her cigarette in an ash tray. \"...I'm not one to usually make promises when dealing with the unknown but...\" The woman raised her head and smiled softly, \"But I'll promise you I'll give you my best assistance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too!\" Azaka immediately added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir confident words brought a smile to Mikiya's face. To the side stood Shiki absent mindedly staring out a window. He knew she felt the same as the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With that established...\" Touko continued, \"It's starting to get late and I think after this we would all like some rest. But first we need to work out who's going to watch over you. At your size you'll need a guardian of some sort. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guardian?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouko nodded, \"Someone to make sure you'll be okay. Take care of you, those sort of things. I'll have to take a pass for tonight because I need to get some tests ready for tomorrow so that'll leave either Azaka or Shiki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! Me!\" Happy as ever Azaka raised a hand like a child and volunteered herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiki of course, remained silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring both of them, Touko looked straight at Mikiya. \"Small or not you're still a person Kokutou so I'll let you pick who it is that'll watch over you.\" Both Azaka and Shiki didn't seem to like that idea but they remained silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikiya stared at the two choices he had. On one hand was his sister Azaka, friendly, sure to take care of him. But something about being alone with her at this size scared him...he wasn't sure why. On the other hand there was Shiki. She cared for him but her blunt nature among other things made it impossible to imagine how that would go. But despite that Mikiya remembered his feelings for the girl and the idea of her caring for him was appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I choose...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There wasn't any other option, even if he was a microbe Mikiya wouldn't let himself go a day with being around Shiki. Everyone in the room didn't look surprised by his answer, although Azaka did look upset. Only giving a nod Touko reached for a brown coat, \"Alright then. Let's all get back here tomorrow and tackle this problem then.\" Nonchalantly the woman reached her arms into her sleeves to signal everyone to go. Azaka left first, quickly walking out the door without grabbing anything. She seemed upset for some reason, but Mikiya couldn't understand what. Did she want to get picked? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" While thinking Mikiya didn't notice the two fingernails plucking him off the desk until they already grasped his shirt. Already in her trademark red-jacket, Shiki dangled him before her face. \"Ready Kokutou?\" As always her voice held no trace of emotion. For some reason Mikiya found that pleasant, that even in this situation she was the same. \"Yeah Shiki, but um...\" He made a troubled face. \"...Uh Where are you going to carry me? You can't just hold me like this the whole way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Shiki made a sound like she didn't think it mattered.\" Her free hand reached into a jacket pocket, \"There.\" It wasn't a question, rather more of a statement. Before the shrunken man could even reply he was already shoved into its dark confines with Shiki's hand. It was kind of rough but she at least had the forethought to keep a hold on Mikiya to make sure nothing bad happened to him. And hey, he kind of liked being held in her fingers. It was sort of like holding hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiki began to walk towards the door, one hand in a pocket with Mikiya and the other free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shiki...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" She turned to face Touko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be gentle with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" The woman gave a careless wave as she turned around and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk back to Shiki's place was nothing spectacular. Her hand assured Mikiya didn't bounce around or fall out and his size kind of ruled out talking, not that Shiki would've responded anyway. For the most part it was just a dull walk, at least for Shiki. Mikiya on the other hand...The initial comfort he had of being so close to Shiki quickly gave way to problems. The big one: body heat. Shiki's hand slowly warmed up in her pocket, not really a big deal but even a couple degrees to someone shrunken was enough that it soon felt like someone turned the heater on. Shiki's pocket was beginning to feel stuffy very fast and Mikiya couldn't do anything about it. He managed to keep himself happy by looking at the positives though, namely thinking about Shiki. Yeah his affection bordered on obsession but still, in the dark times it really did help out. Like now, Mikiya could spend his time thinking about how hot and stuffy it was during the little ten minute walk. Or he could focus on the finer things, like the softness of Shiki's hands and how it felt like silk was wrapped around him. How her warmth, while stifling, had this odd sort of comfortable quality to it. Maybe how the whole pocket had the scent that could only be described as Shiki. So many little things that drove Mikiya's love-driven mind to bliss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally though, Shiki did arrive home after a while. Mikiya winced as light suddenly filled his vision. Now in her apartment Shiki removed her jacket and hung it up on the rack, Mikiya still between her fingers. She brought the little man to her eyes, \"You still okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, though I wouldn't mind being somewhere else next time.\" Mikiya laughed, noting his sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Mikiya tried to think. Shiki only wore kimono's. Those had no pockets. Only her jacket had pockets. Aside from that, the only other place Shiki could put him would be...He blushed at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever...\" Shiki shrugged, kicking off her boots. With a couple casual steps she sat on her bed and deposited the shrunken Mikiya before her. After crossing her legs she continued to stare at him. \"...You're little.\" Was all that came out after a couple minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touko said about half an inch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's less than one of my toes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you better be careful.\" Mikiya smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Her eyes wandered, \"What now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Mikiya paused, \"I don't suppose you want to play a game or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then sleep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiki re-positioned herself again, this time laying flat on her stomach. \"Not a bad idea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Shiki...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too late, the giantess was out cold. It all happened so quickly Mikiya just about laughed, \"Man, I guess she was tired...\" He paused, <i>Shiki's...asleep</i>? He'd seen her asleep before, but for some reason Mikiya really found her peaceful expression enticing. Then the thought crossed the back of his mind. <i>She couldn't feel you if you did anything</i>. He turned red at that. Would he really? His friend was asleep so why would he even think of trying to abuse the situation like that? But that didn't change the fact Mikiya felt an urge to do it anyway, Shiki probably wouldn't care regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what am I thinking of doing?\" Mikiya asked himself aloud. A part of him wanted to act but he wasn't sure how. Soon enough his lusts were something able to be put into words. He wanted...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dust kicked up around Azaka\u2019s shoes as she explored the messy laboratory. Waning sunlight weakly filtered through filthy windows and illuminated cluttered shelves stacked with various tomes and alchemical implements. She had come to this abandoned workplace to investigate a string of recent disappearances, in which the victim had simply vanished without a trace; the only clues being the victim\u2019s discarded clothing had been strangely shrunk, the remnants barely small enough to fit a doll. Touko had brought Azaka to this dilapidated building in order to investigate. The magus had said she had a hunch about this place, but wouldn\u2019t elaborate. They had split up in order to cover as much ground before nightfall. Azaka was under strict orders not to touch anything suspicious, but that hasn\u2019t stopped her from poking several bizarre jars filled with mysterious glowing liquids. Touko herself had disappeared somewhere in the labyrinth of dusty bookshelves and claustrophobic rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMikiya will be so proud of me if I solve this mystery myself!\u201d Azaka thought, poking her nose around for clues. Twirling a test tube between her fingers, she began rifling through a file cabinet. One of her discoveries, however, made her recoil in shock. Stumbling backwards, the test tube slipped from her grasp and shattered on the floor. The liquid within began to smoke and bubble, and soon Azaka was enveloped in a noxious gas. Coughing, she fell to her knees and quickly lost consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally came to, Azaka noticed something seemed\u2026 off. The shards of glass from the broken test tube were the size of boulders, and the top of the filing cabinet seemed to scrape the sky. An embarrassing realization washed over her\u2026 she had also fallen victim to the shrinking alchemist! The floorboards under her shook as a booming sound drew her attention. Touko, alerted by the commotion, had entered the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising an eyebrow, the magus knew she heard something from this room, but there was no one to be found. To Azaka, however, the sorceress seemed to be a mile tall! Her high-heeled shoes clicked on the wooden floor as she approached the open filing cabinet. Too shocked to move, Azaka could only stare as her giant teacher strode towards her tiny form. Pounding footfalls reverberated through her body, until Touko\u2019s foot overhead blocked out the light. Squeezing her eyes shut for the inevitable, Azaka braced herself to be squashed. She thought of her brother\u2019s smiling face in her last breaths. Moments passed, and\u2026 nothing. Looking around, all she could see was the underside of Touko\u2019s shoe. Thankfully, she was small enough that by crouching down, she narrowly fit under the shoe\u2019s heel. Crawling out, Azaka gasped as she beheld the mass of flesh and leather before her. If she had any hope of leaving here in one piece, she had to get Touko\u2019s attention. But how? Her voice certainly wouldn\u2019t reach all the way up there, and her fire magic would make barely more than a spark at this size. She would have to climb up Touko, but without Shiki\u2019s athleticism it would quite a tribulation. Rounding the toe of the shoe, Azaka craned her neck to take in the monolithic woman before her. Touko\u2019s legs seemed to reach up to infinity like columns holding up the sky, and the cliffs of her breasts blocked out any view of her face. Thankfully, the magus was sufficiently enthralled by this latest cache of alchemical secrets that she was relatively still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, Azaka climbed onto the pointed toe of the shoe. Her reflection in the shiny leather revealed her messy hair and frightened countenance. Scrambling up the slick surface, she reached the top of Touko\u2019s foot. Placing a hand on the woman\u2019s soft skin, Azaka could feel the warmth of her teacher\u2019s flesh. It was comforting, but it was also a bit frightening that something that nearly crushed her to death could be so alive. Azaka continued her ascent until she was stopped by a waterfall of black fabric descending to Touko\u2019s ankle. The hem of the magus\u2019s pants stopped short just above the ankle, barely out of Azaka\u2019s reach. Even stretching her arms almost to the breaking point, it dangled just out of reach of her fingertips. Undeterred, she made a running jump, stretching her fingers out to grasp the edge of the dark material. Azaka knew that if she missed, she\u2019d reach an untimely end on the floor, with no hope of ever seeing her beloved brother again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes as she flew through the air and\u2026 success! She felt the fabric against her palms and quickly closed her fingers around it, leaving her dangling in mid-air against Touko\u2019s leg. Glancing up, Azaka took in the enormity of the task before her. It was going to be like climbing one of the pillars that supports the heavens. But at least one thing was still in her favor: Touko was still so engrossed in her research that she was standing stock still. Azaka climbed hand-over-hand, determined not to look down. Higher and higher she went, swaying side to side every time Touko shifted her weight from one foot to the other. It was a barely visible movement, yet to Azaka it felt like the whole world was being overturned. Several times she almost lost her grip and plummeted to her doom, but she always regained her grip at the last second. Her hands were burning from the effort, so it came as sweet relief when she finally arrived at Touko\u2019s hips. The material widened out into a swath of fabric linking both sides of the magus\u2019s waist. As she climbed, Azaka could feel a strange bulge under the material. The slightly squishy nature of the object told her that it must be a pack of the magus\u2019s ubiquitous cigarettes. Touko\u2019s dress shirt draped over the top of her pants, offering a bit of shade for the exhausted student clinging to her hip. Pushing herself past her limits, Azaka climbed closer to her teacher\u2019s crotch and scrambled up towards the woman\u2019s belt. Passing under the protection of the shirt, she hooked one arm over the belt buckle and pulled herself up onto the slender platform of the metal clasp. Wiping the sweat from her brow, Azaka permitted herself to recuperate for a few moments, resting her head against the warm skin of Touko\u2019s flat stomach. The shade provided by the overhanging shirt allowed the girl to close her eyes briefly, thinking over her situation. This alchemist\u2019s concoction was powerful enough to shrink someone in seconds. Shiki would have to be dispatched to deal with this dangerous criminal. But first, Azaka knew she had to get her teacher\u2019s attention before some stray rat gobbled her up. She couldn\u2019t bear the thought of never seeing her brother again, of her disappearing and he never knowing what happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her eyes, she looked up and took in the sight of Touko\u2019s breasts hovering in the air overhead. The large fleshy globes were barely contained within the black bra. Squeezed tightly together, they offered no safe route between them. Azaka would be forced to climb the outside of Touko\u2019s shirt to reach salvation. Sighing, Azaka ran a hand over Touko\u2019s stomach, feeling the warm skin beneath her fingers. She could almost reach the woman\u2019s navel. It looked like an inviting place to hide, but she knew she had to keep moving. Jumping off the belt buckle, she caught fistfuls of the white shirt and began to climb up towards the buttons in the center of the garment. Climbing between two buttons, she emerged onto the outer side of the shirt. Unfortunately, she knew she was still out of her teacher\u2019s sight, due to Azaka still being under the shelf of Touko\u2019s breasts. Using the buttons to help her ascent, Azaka realized another problem: her teacher\u2019s breasts were simply too large to climb from underneath. The slope was dangerously steep, and she wasn\u2019t going to make an unacceptable risk now, so close to rescue. Looking around, she noticed that Touko\u2019s arms were raised, as she investigated a clue on a shelf overhead, allowing Azaka to scamper over toward the magus\u2019s ribs and climb up that way, moving up the side of her left breast. Azaka blushed when her hands first came into contact with her teacher\u2019s breast, but this was a matter of survival. Conscious that Touko\u2019s arms could return to her sides and crush her at any moment, Azaka quickened her pace until she was finally at Touko\u2019s shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny apprentice plopped down in triumph, looking down at the massive woman she just scaled. Touko\u2019s feet, where she started her adventure, were miles away. It beggared belief that she climbed up the sheer cliff of Touko\u2019s leg, but the burning pain in Azaka\u2019s muscles stood testament to her accomplishment. She reached her plateau just in time, as Touko\u2019s arms returned to her sides, an ancient book held in her hands. As the curious magus began to turn the yellowed pages, Azaka, knowing she was so close to her destination, charged across Touko\u2019s collar, aiming toward her neck. Her teacher\u2019s long red hair was drawn up in her usual ponytail, denying Azaka an easy route to Touko\u2019s ear. The magus\u2019s eyes, deep in thought behind her glasses, were concentrated on the book, so her tiny student would have to make some kind of noise in order be noticed. Azaka was so deep in thought herself that she failed to notice Touko\u2019s hand reaching up toward her. The fingers brushed against her as Touko moved to adjust her glasses. The tiny girl was sent stumbling forward by the sudden impact, and she tripped on the woman\u2019s collarbone and tumbled down head over heels. Everything went topsy-turvy as Azaka tried to reach out for something, anything, to stop her descent. Finally, her fingers caught something smooth and warm in their grasp. Looking at her reflection in the orange gem, she realized she was clinging to the jewel attached to Touko\u2019s necklace. Below her, a canyon of cleavage threatened to swallow her up if her grip failed. Staring into the fleshy crevasse below, Azaka felt her fingers begin to slide down the charm\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Strength drained from her fingers as Azaka\u2019s grip on the pendant loosened. She looked down into the vast crevasse of cleavage that opened up beneath her dangling legs, mountainous breasts on either side of a valley that could easily swallow her up. Her fingers ached until they reached their breaking point, and Azaka\u2019s heart leapt into her throat as she went into free-fall. Her descent came to an abrupt stop as she was squeezed on both sides by warm flesh up to her chin. Completely surrounded by cleavage, she was unable to even move a finger. Now a mere passenger, she Azaka could only watch as Touko finished up her investigation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzaka could only see the bottom of her teacher\u2019s chin from her breast prison. Fortunately, the ride was pleasant, as Touko\u2019s skin was warm and comfortable as got into her car and began the drive back to her studio. The tiny student was stunned that Touko didn\u2019t even seem to notice that she was missing, much less that she was stuck between her boobs\u2026 but then again, the magus was a bit of an oddball. The myriad books, televisions, and random bits of junk strewn throughout the room told Azaka that they were back in Touko\u2019s studio. The magus threw her a bunch of confiscated books on her messy desk, intending to go through the evidence later. A glimmer of hope flashed in Azaka\u2019s eyes as Touko began to unbutton her shirt. She might finally be released from her booby purgatory, but she was also a bit embarrassed at watching her teacher get undressed. The shirt came off with a flurry, and the pressure surrounding Azaka was soon released as Touko spread her breasts apart with one hand, sending her tiny apprentice tumbling down into her other waiting hand. Cradled in Touko\u2019s palm, Azaka looked past her teacher\u2019s impressive bra-clad breasts and up at her grinning face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoying the view?\u201d Touko asked the shrunken girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, did you know I was there the whole time?!\u201d Azaka shouted, perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. I sensed your presence in that room, and when I didn\u2019t see you, it didn\u2019t take a genius to figure out what had happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you just rescue me?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was more fun to see how you\u2019d react. Consider it a part of your training. Still, I\u2019m surprised that you\u2019d climb my body like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzaka growled in frustration at this last statement. This woman, to play around with her life like that\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, I have to leave for a bit. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll figure out a way to get you back to normal,\u201d Touko continued. \u201cShiki, please keep an eye on her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzaka didn\u2019t notice anyone else in the room, but sure enough, as Touko walked over towards the couch, there she was, staring ahead and sitting in stock silence. Was she there the whole time? That girl could sure be cat-like. Shiki wordlessly extended a hand, looking icily upon the tiny girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! Take me with you! Don\u2019t leave me here with\u2026 her!\u201d Azaka stammered. To be shrunken and left with her love rival, this was the worst kind of torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now. Play nice, you two,\u201d Touko said, lowering her hand towards Shiki\u2019s. Seeing no other choice, Azaka stepped off her teacher\u2019s warm palm and into her rival\u2019s hand. The same hand that can expertly wield a knife was now embracing the shrunken girl. Touko quickly redressed and left the studio, leaving the two young women alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t think that just because I\u2019m like this that I\u2019ll let you have Mikiya!\u201d yelled Azaka, pointing an angry finger at Shiki\u2019s impassive face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re in much of a position to make demands, little mouse,\u201d said Shiki. An extended finger from her other hand knocked Azaka on her butt, as the probing finger began to trace its way up her smooth, pantyhose-clad legs. Fearful of being smothered, Azaka bat her fists at the intruding digit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll really burn you, I mean it! You\u2019ll pull back another stump!\u201d she hissed. They both froze as the squeak of an opening door. Figuring it was just Touko coming back, Azaka was terrified to hear Mikiya\u2019s voice instead. He must be coming back to check on the results of the investigation. Not wanting to be seen by him in her current state, she knew she had to hide somewhere. However, being on the extended plateau of Shiki\u2019s hand, she had little options. That is, unless she hides somewhere on Shiki herself. Azaka giggled to herself as she began to hatch a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzaka rolled under Shiki\u2019s finger before she could react and made her way across her palm to her wrist. Here, the sleeve of Shiki\u2019s standard-issue kimono met her slender wrist and offered the shrunken girl much more than mere hiding spot. No, this was her gateway to her rival\u2019s more sensitive areas, and Azaka was going to make Shiki look like an idiot in front Mikiya. Lifting up the thick material, Azaka ducked under the sleeve and crawled her way up Shiki\u2019s arm. She could feel the toned muscle rippling under her fingers as Shiki kept her arm still, confused at Azaka\u2019s actions and not wanting to truly hurt her. Azaka could only hear muffled conversations as she reached Shiki\u2019s elbow, and began to climb up to her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikiya asked Shiki about her unusually stiff posture, but she brushed him off in her typical fashion. Meanwhile, Azaka had made it to Shiki\u2019s neck and thought about lighting her hair on fire, but soon had a better idea. Right below her was the entrance to Shiki\u2019s cleavage, being held in place by simple sarashi. Simple, flammable sarashi. Azaka would force Shiki to disrobe in front of Mikiya, forever ruining her in his eyes! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Shiki\u2019s large breasts, Azaka felt a bit jealous. Even at normal size, they were much larger than her own pair. Making her way across the slope of her rival\u2019s boob, Azaka reached the sarashi, but her foot slipped and she found herself trapped by the tightly wrapped strands. She tried to extricate herself, but only ended up falling further. It was difficult to breathe, having a face full of warm breast flesh. Unlike the pleasant ride between Touko\u2019s breasts, Azaka was now smashed into her rival\u2019s boob and gasping for air. Her flailing hands tried to grab something, anything that would allow her to climb out of her sticky situation, until her fingers grasped something firm and rubbery. Confused, Azaka rubbed it, until it started to grow in her hands. Bile rose in her throat as Azaka realized that she was stimulating her rival\u2019s nipple. Shiki began to blush as her body responded to the unwanted sexual contact. Azaka began to sweat as Shiki\u2019s body temperate began to rise, making it a hellish prison inside the kimono. Again, Mikiya asked Shiki if she was alright and again she brushed him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was getting late, Mikiya told Shiki that he\u2019d come back tomorrow to help solve the case and bid her goodnight. Shiki\u2019s stiff nipple was now fully grown and smashing into Azaka\u2019s face, while was being held immobile by the sarashi behind her. She had never felt more embarrassed or pitiful in her whole life. She had tried to make Shiki look like a fool, but she herself was the one who could never face Mikiya again, certainly not after inadvertently molesting the girl he was in love with. Shiki was equally eager to rid herself of this irritation, and began disrobing as soon as Mikiya was out the door. Crudely tossing her kimono aside, she began to unwrap the sarashi. Azaka was thrust into daylight as each loosened strand allowed her to regain a little movement. As the last strand was peeled off, Azaka wrapped her arms around the erect nipple for dear life. If she let go, she\u2019d face a long drop to the floor below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou little pest. I\u2019m really going to smash you this time,\u201d Shiki said, her hand reaching up to pluck the tiny girl from her nipple. Azaka could only watch in horror as the murderous talons raced up towards her. Suddenly, the door opened once more, freezing the digits in mid-swoop. Touko strolled in and clucked her tongue upon seeing her bare-chested employee standing there with her tiny student clinging from her pink nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTsk, tsk. Didn\u2019t I tell you girls to play nice?\u201d Touko admonished them, before placing a hand underneath Shiki\u2019s breast, allowing the red-faced Azaka to drop to safety. \u201cDo you really like boobs that much? I mean, I know you\u2019re not gifted in that area, but still\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think! I was, I mean, that stupid girl-\u201cAzaka growled as Shiki wordlessly put her clothes back on. \u201cWell, anyway, did you find out anything to cure me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did, though it will take some time to research the proper spell; although, you\u2019re going to have to stay here for a bit. It\u2019s getting late, so you should get some sleep. You can sleep here, unless you want to go back with Shiki,\u201d Touko said with a chuckle. The studio was a weird place during the day, at night it must be downright terrifying with all the puppets and magical familiars roaming about the place. Shiki\u2019s frugal apartment offered much less dangers, but she wasn\u2019t about to put her life in her rival\u2019s hands again. She would have to make her choice now, as Shiki donned her jacket to leave.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI\u2019m not going with that weirdo!\u201d Azaka exclaimed, sticking her tongue out at Shiki. \u201cShe\u2019ll feed me to a cat or something!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTch. Fine with me. I\u2019m not a baby-sitter,\u201d Shiki said, walking out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that settles that,\u201d Touko said. \u201cNow, how about a bath?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No way, I\u2019ll drown for sure!\u201d Azaka protested. Being shrunken was getting old real quick. She just wanted to stay as far away from danger as possible until Touko could figure out how to change her back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll join you. After all, I\u2019m quite sweaty from traipsing around in that musty laboratory all day,\u201d Touko said, as she brought her tiny student into an ornate bathroom. Brass fixtures and ivory handles abounded in the gaudy space. Touko set Azaka down on the cool surface of a marble sink as she began to draw a bath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteam began to collect on the mirror as Azaka started fidgeting. She hasn\u2019t shared a bath with anyone since she and her brother were younger, an experience she remembers fondly. \u201cEr, well\u2026 you\u2019re going to put on a bathing suit, right?\u201d the tiny girl stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magus chuckled at this comment while taking off her glasses. \u201cOf course not. We\u2019re not children, you know. Perhaps\u2026 you\u2019re ashamed of something?\u201d Touko teased, tugging at Azaka\u2019s shirt. The tiny student batted the giant fingers away. \u201cStop it! I can undress myself!\u201d she shouted, undoing her skirt and letting fall to her feet. Touko started to unbutton her own shirt while Azaka began to loosen her necktie. The tiny girl stepped out of her skirt and turned away from her giant teacher, in order to give the older woman a bit of privacy while she undressed. However, as she doffed her vest, she noticed that she could still watch Touko\u2019s reflection in the mirror as the redhead unzipped her pants. Azaka closed her eyes in embarrassment as she lifted her shirt over her head, leaving her in only her underwear. Steam from the bath began to fog up the mirror, and the intense heat started to make her lightheaded. Reaching behind to unclasp her bra, she heard Touko turn off the bath\u2019s tap. The tiny girl immediately covered herself with her hands after she stepped out of her panties. Turning around, she was unsurprised to notice that Touko was standing proud in her birthday suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be so embarrassed,\u201d Touko said softly, gently pushing Azaka\u2019s arms away from her naughty bits with her finger. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t so hard, was it? We\u2019re both girls, there\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzaka looked down at her own petite breasts. Surrounded by booby-monsters like he was, there\u2019s no way Mikiya would ever look at her body the same way he looks at Shiki or Touko. She gazed up at her teacher\u2019s statuesque body, taller than even if the Tokyo Tower came to life. The redheaded mage turned heads even when dressed modestly; nude, she was a stunner. Touko\u2019s crotch was directly in front of her tiny student, which featured a patch of flaming-red pubic hair. Azaka\u2019s eyes continued up past Touko\u2019s flat stomach towards the jutting mounds of her breasts, which, now loosed from their bra, had a gravity-defying perkiness that only magic could achieve. Each peak was topped with a dusty-red nipple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, she was so busy staring in jaw-dropping awe of her teacher\u2019s breasts that she didn\u2019t even notice Touko\u2019s hand wrapping around her and lifting her off the sink. Skin made contact with skin as the mage\u2019s soft fingers gently caressed the tiny girl. Stepping into the tub, she made herself comfortable before placing Azaka on her stomach. Once the giant mage reclined in the tub, the massive teats loomed over the tiny girl like two mountains. Behind her, Touko\u2019s crimson pubic hair swayed gently in the current like an underwater bed of fiery seaweed. Azaka scooped up some water that had pooled in on Touko\u2019s stomach and began to clean herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s the temperature? Not too hot?\u201d Touko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Azaka answered, while bending down to wash her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good\u2026 because you\u2019re about to go for a swim!\u201d Touko said, while lowering herself further into the water. Azaka gasped as a tidal wave seemed to crash over Touko\u2019s stomach, heading right for her! Almost immediately, she was up to her neck in water. The only dry land was Touko\u2019s huge breasts, which now rose out of the water like two deserted tropical islands. Swimming for all she\u2019s worth, she headed for the breasts before she drowned. To make things harder for her tiny student, Touko began splashing around with her hands, making waves that tossed the tiny girl to and fro. Finally, Azaka\u2019s fingers touched the rubbery flesh of Touko\u2019s left boob. Scrabbling upward, she grabbed fistfuls of warm skin as the rising tide lapped at her heels. Finally, the terrain evened out as she collapsed, exhausted, onto the peak of the breast. The pink areola spread out underneath her in all directions while Touko\u2019s grinning face appeared out of the steam like a visiting goddess. As Azaka pulled in her limbs to pull herself up, she felt something poke her in the chest. She began to rise in the air again\u2026 but it wasn\u2019t the water this time. Instead, Touko\u2019s stimulated nipple was taking her for a ride. The tiny girl instinctively reached underneath her body to steady herself, but her arms and legs wrapped around the pink obelisk, engorging it further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAra ara\u2026 you really are a little pervert, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Touko chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzaka was starting to get really perturbed by all this constant teasing. Channeling her fire magic into her hand, she intended to burn the nipple to a crisp. But without her trademark glove, she could only make her fingertips hot, but she hoped it would torture Touko enough to leave her alone. However, her plan backfired once again. Azaka\u2019s tiny fingertips combined with the warming sensation of her magic to create an unbelievably pleasurable sensation for the giant woman. It was like her nipple was being massaged by millions of tiny, heated stones. Perhaps it was the steam making her lightheaded, or the fact that she hasn\u2019t been with anyone intimately in a long time, but her mind went blank with intense pleasure. Touko\u2019s left hand sank down under the water, groping between her legs, while her opposite hand began to massage her right breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh! Now who\u2019s the perverted one, you ecchi magus!\u201d Azaka said. The tiny girl\u2019s shrill voice was enough to clear Touko\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u2026 sorry. Say, why don\u2019t we call it a night?\u201d Touko said, cupping her tiny student in her hand and bending down to drain the tub. </span></div></div>",

The land was odd, undiscernable spots of grey and patches of green here and there. For the most part, it was flatlands, the only difference a few jutting rocks here and there that only rose as high as her ankles. Akiha Tohno flipped her long black hair over her shoulder, curious as to how she had ended up in such a strange spot. All she remembered was falling asleep last night, and now, she was sitting in the middle of absolutely nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Weird.\"She muttered to herself, standing up and stretching. Oddly enough, she was fully clothed, something she didn't remember doing last night. Had she fallen asleep while in her school uniform? Her white blouse and long red skirt did well to accentuate her figure, right down to her boots that went up to her shins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might as well figure out where I am...\"Akiha muttered to herself, taking the first step on the strange new land. The ground beneath was surprisingly soft and fragile, as when her boot left the ground after the step, a deep imprint a few inches down from her weight was created. It appeared she had stepped down onto one of the grey patches that popped up against the green and brown ground. A few minutes later, a small bug flew by her eye, and she followed it till it escaped her line of sight. She simply turned her head, raised her hand, and swatted, the small dot instantly smashing against her fingers. She shrugged and continued on, accidentally knocking over a few of those jutting rocks with her boots. Her steps had sent it flying, only to land a few feet away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo those below, all were amazed with a bitter mixture of awe and fear. A young woman towered above taller than the tallest mountain in the region, her form so high up many couldn't even see past the trudges of her boots. But if they were a distance's away from her, they could make out a blurry form of a school uniform that extended into the cloud layer. Now, at first, many panicked. The military rolled in, trying to reason with her with megaphones and loudspeakers, but they found that their small voices couldn't even possibly be heard by such a titanic woman. The next option was to simply wait for to move. And when she did, it was a catastrophe. The simplest motions of her standing up and walking destroyed countless. The motion of her moving body created winds that threatened to blow many away, putting even a hurricane gale to shame with its power. Her footsteps generated cataclysmic quakes that rocked the landscape, and the devastation was worst underneath the sole of her boots, leaving imprints thousands of feet deep where a proud city and countless lives had once stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJets were sent flying as high as they could to do battle with her, but her thick skin simply repelled missile strikes with ease. She even swatted at them as if they were nothing but pitifully small insects to her. The giantess even had the terrible power to uproot entire mountain ranges and send them flying miles away from the ancient spot they had sprouted from.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"How did this even happen?\" I slumped trying to piece together everything and failing miserably. The Holy Grail War...A war I can't even remember entering. It just began. My first opponent remains unknown but in a week we were to fight. But before that could even happen suddenly everything went to hell. My Servant and I entered the dungeon ready for another day's worth of training and exploration when a new enemy appeared. My partner seemed unable to recognize the enemy as a part of the system, but there was no way to run. So we fought. Next thing I knew I was like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud sigh came from before me, the red-clothed Servant stared at at me with frustrated eyes. \"First I get summoned by a weak Master with amnesia and now this. You're definitely not making this easy.\" She was sitting down regally in a chair, legs crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well pardon me for suddenly shrinking Saber.\" I spat out in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enemy, whatever it was, shrank me on the spot. Due to our connection Saber managed to find me in time to force a retreat. The enemy vanished in the light that shrank me so we managed to return to the school again. We had no choice but to run to the NPC who ran the War, Kotomine. His reaction was troubling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It would appear there is a glitch or perhaps even a virus in the system. We will attempt to fix the error but in the mean time the Holy Grail War is on an indefinite Hiatus.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I asked about me his silence was enough to make me worry. Though he was considerate enough to send me to the nurse. Me and Saber were in her office awaiting her. Neither of us expected much to come from this but there were no options. Every other Master in the school was an enemy who wouldn't think twice about crushing me like a bug. The NPC's were my only real option but they were limited by the SE.RA.PH. System. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is too annoying.\" Saber moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't say anything, my giant Servant's words were beginning to get on my nerves too. Normally I'd say something but I'm still tip-toeing. I know nothing about Saber. We met days ago and our relationship goes as far as barely co-operating. I don't want to fight the other Masters, and Saber has voiced her objections to that ideal very clearly. If it wasn't for me being her Master I suspect she might have crushed me herself just to avoid the annoyance. A quick glance to her feet assured me they were definitely big enough to kill me in a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after what seemed like an eternity the door opened and in came the Nurse NPC Sakura. I knew she was just intricate data but her appearance was actually sort of attractive. She looked like a girl about my age with a petite body and extraordinarily long hair. She knelt down to the table I sat on. \"Sorry I took so long. I was just checking everyone else to make sure this system error didn't extend to anywhere else. Um...wasn't that priority list a bit backwards? I didn't say anything in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything you can do Doctor?\" Saber leaned her face against her fist boredly. Sakura raised her eyes for a moment. Everything was silent but she finally answered with a sad shaking of her head. \"I don't think so. I have no idea what may have caused this. And I'm no expert on magical things if that's what this is about. I just fix physical wounds.\" She spoke regretfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anyone who can fix it if it's a magical issue?\" It would appear my Servant was speaking for me from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's possible that there's a couple people who might. I'll go get them.\" Sakura left as quickly as she came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How incompetent.\" Saber muttered a complaint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least she's trying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber's eyes seemed to signal that she didn't care. We were stuck waiting again.</span></div></div>",

I'm going crazy just sitting here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was starting to get irritated too, but moreso because Saber was acting like a child than anything else. \"Calm down. We'll be out of here before long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't be soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh grow up. You're a noble so you should act more like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber's eyes peaked with interest, \"Oh? What makes you think I'm a noble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response all I could really do was shrug, \"Your clothes for one thing. They're a bit too nice for a common person. And your attitude, you act like everyone is beneath you. Or at the very least that you're better than everyone else.\" Maybe it was a little bit too honest but hey, I was irritated at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny hearing that from a little bug person.\" Saber smirked at me, \"You should be honored I'm even still with you after all this right off the bat. I have no reason to stay with a weak Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no choice.\" I corrected. \"Otherwise you'd have left right away when you saw how weak I was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words echoed in the room. Immediately I felt like I said something I shouldn't have. For an instant I saw Saber's brow twitch. \"Perhaps that's how you might handle things but I prefer to remain loyal to those I align with. If you're not a suitable Master I just have to make you into one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did not like where this was going but my mouth just wouldn't stop. \"And how would you do that Saber?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned, \"For starters let's fix that attitude of yours, perhaps teach you a few things about hard work.\" Before I could ask what she was getting at I noticed her boots disappear into data. The next moment two bare soles were shoved in my face, \"You can start by making yourself useful.\" Her toes wiggled eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't tell me you're serious.\" I stared at her soles, easily at least three times my size and...well scary. Saber could step on me with ease and with our current relationship I halfway expected her to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can either get to work. Or I can<i> make</i> you. I had a number of servants who didn't respect me while I was alive. I know how to make you work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words hung in the air like daggers, I knew any more lip would not bode well for me. So with a sigh, my hands began to work on her foot. \"So you <i>were</i> a noble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No talking Servant.\" Saber retorted, glaring at me. \"Until you're more respectful I won't call you Master. You're my Servant and I'm your Master.\" Each word came out stern and angry, but I couldn't shake the feeling the red-clothed woman was enjoying the dominance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWordlessly I nodded and continued tending to her sole. For someone constantly on her feet fighting, Saber's feet were surprisingly soft and delicate. In fact the massage seemed redundant, there was nothing wrong with her feet! No smell, no sweat, no dirt, no tension. There was no possible way she was sore, was this just about humility? Or maybe she enjoyed being pampered. Both seemed right. Servants were mostly data so could their feet even get hurt like a person's? No matter, I just had to keep on massaging and hope for the best. So I would've hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harder.\" Came my Ser-Master's order. Sighing again my hands stopped their gentle meading and started pressing deeply into her foot. The warm expanse of her sole seemed to suck my hands into their folds until I pulled them back out to do it again. My arm strength quickly started fading at this, I couldn't hold it for long. But of course...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faster.\" Another order came. Once more I sighed and tried to increase my pace despite physical limitations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more sighing.\" I was honestly halfway tempted to sigh just to spite her. But I kept massaging, soon it got hard to reach any further up and I knew Saber wouldn't help me. So I did the natural thing, I started climbing. She seemed to approve of my work ethic now, or maybe she enjoyed seeing someone so small they had to climb just to massage her feet. I had no clue with this woman. \"Get in between the toes while you're at it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mam...\" I started to move between her big and second toe, where they instantly vice-gripped my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes what...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped for air. My skull felt like it was going to split in two just from this woman's toes. My face was right against her foot, all I could see, smell and taste was her toe cleavage. I spat out what she wanted just to stop the pain. \"Y-Yes Master!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe relaxed, \"Good little Servant.\" Her smirk got on my nerves but I turned my attention back to her toes. When I was done she naturally had something to say. \"It was alright, do better on the next one.\" And she brought her next foot forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got lucky though, halfway through her second foot the door opened. Sakura returned with two women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first I recognized right away: Rin Tohsaka. Infamous among the Masters as one of the top competitors. She seemed nice but she was also kind of mean and cocky. She acted respectfully but it was pretty clear she thought she was going to win and that she was better than most of the other Masters. In a way that honesty was kind of nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Second...I did not recognize: It was a voluptuous red-haired woman in an old, red admiral jacket, she had a scar across her face and hands down the biggest breasts I'd ever seen in my life. Just at a glance I could tell this woman was a Servant; was Tohsaka her Master?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura lead these two in and stared absently at Saber and I. \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Killing time.\" Saber replied nonchalantly. \"Who are these two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura turned to the two behind her, \"These are the two I was told to bring. They are fellow competitors in the Holy Grail War but they may be able to offer some assistance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTohsaka stepped forward, \"Name's Rin Tohsaka. You probably know me already but I'm one of the best Magi here. So when it comes to issues regarding magic I'm the one to call. I want to get this War back underway so I'll help as best I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Servant stepped forward, \"And I represent my Master. He chose to keep his identity a secret but he wants the same thing as Tohsaka here. He's an expert hacker and manipulator of data so his abilities may be able to help with your cyber self.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura nodded, \"I also wanted to bring in our Alteration expect Touko but she said she couldn't be bother quite yet. She wanted to remain a last resort. But I assure you these two are excellent choices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the encouragement was nice...But I knew Sakura was programmed to say anything to assure me. That kind of made it less nice. \"So what now?\" Saber now seemed to speak for me. Everyone turned to her in surprise, apparently as off-put as I was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well that's up to you.\" Sakura continued to face me even though her words were directed at my Servant. \"Miss Tohsaka would like to try a magical-based solution. Our other person would like to try data manipulation. We can't try both so you have to choose one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI really would've liked to make that choice. But Saber beat me to it by a longshot.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was that nightmare again. Ever since the Holy Grail War began it came, clearer and clearer each time. Death. There would just be death all around her. Her eyes would casually glance around the city as she stumbled about, and any soul who was near her was quickly devoured in a wave of darkness. It was no different from eating a meal, only the hunger never seemed to cease. People were fed to this darkness without accord but it never seemed to satisfy her. Sakura Matou clenched the sheets of her bed as the horrible dream progressed. She finally had her Senpai, Shirou to herself. She was actually spending time with her sister. As bad as the situation was with the crest worm within her, her dreams were actually coming true. So why, why were these terrible dreams haunting her?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind cried out that question but the dream progressed without any indication from her. She took a step forward then that was it, there was blood everywhere. But it wasn\u2019t the blood of someone else. Sakura\u2019s eyes trailed down as a numbing sensation filled her body. Jutting out of her torso was a sword. Here is where the dream would end, where she was about to die. But it wasn\u2019t ending; the pain she was feeling was very real. It was a pain that should wake someone up, but the dream wasn\u2019t ending. Sakura felt her dream body collapse on the ground in a pool of blood. Tears began to fill her eyes. They said that if you die in a dream you die in real life. The thought lingered in her mind with a saddened memory of her Senpai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? You\u2019re still alive? Impressive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Sakura thoughtlessly raised her eyes. Standing before her was a man clad entirely in gold with a smug grin. Something about him seemed familiar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo not worry girl. I will put an end to your misery before it taints this land any further.\u201d The man continued, \u201cHow pitiful though. All the suffering you\u2019ve gone through and the world just turns you into a monster. Do not worry though. I shall save you little monster.\u201d As his sentence closed a void of light appeared behind the man, coming out of it were dozens of swords and weapons. Sakura didn\u2019t have to think about it, dream or not those blades were going to kill her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe it\u2019s for the best. If I die Senpai will\u2026</i>Sakura closed her eyes only to see a mental image of Shirou. The thought of not being with him, the thought of no longer seeing his face, it filled the girl with an indescribable emotion. This feeling overpowered the pain in her body. Soon the girl found herself staring defiantly at the gold man, \u201cNo!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d The man was caught off guard and that was it. His eyes looked in horror at a tentacle of pure darkness that had already grasped his leg. It started to devour him. The man attempted to summon his blades to pierce Sakura but in less than a minute it was done. Normally it would be instantaneous but the man was strong enough to last almost a full sixty seconds. In the end it was irrelevant though. He was but another meal.  The man was devoured and Sakura felt the blade in her body vanish. The wound began to close of its own accord but the powering emotion remained. Sakura began to rise to her feet in the pool of her own blood. She began to recognize the feeling. It was her own selfish desires. The world, her sister, Shirou, they\u2019d all be better off without her. But she simply couldn\u2019t let herself pass away. Her life was too sad, she wanted a happy ending where she would be with Shirou. And nothing was going to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura looked down into the pool to a reflection of her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sakura!!?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura weakly opened her eyes to the sound of her Senpai\u2019s shout, \u201cWhat is it Sen-\u201c Right when her eyes opened everything changed. \u201c-PAI?!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was completely trashed\u2026No, it\u2019d be more accurate to call it crushed. The bed was broken right down the middle and laid on the floor. The desk was a bunch of pieces of wood. But none of that mattered. Because from Sakura\u2019s perspective the room was just puny! Her Senpai was at the doorway but her leg was partially through the doorway. The bed she went to just last night looked barely bigger than a baby\u2019s bed. It was painfully obvious what happened but Sakura couldn\u2019t quite grasp the words. \u201cI-I\u2019m-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGiant!\u201d Shirou finished with an exclamation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the reason may have been, Sakura was now a giant. The room couldn\u2019t even fit her anymore; the walls were broken to make way for her expanding legs. It wasn\u2019t a significant amount of damage but that did little to stop her dismay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn alerted female voice called from a distance, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d In seconds Tohsaka Rin burst into the scene only to join in the mouth agape awe. However she was the first to regain herself, \u201cSakura, do you think you can work your way into the courtyard?\u201d Meekly the girl nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, do that. Let\u2019s go Shirou.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy does Senpai have to go?!\u201d Sakura quickly objected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re naked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment the obvious finally came to light and the giantess screamed louder than ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, once Tohsaka lead Shirou away, Sakura carefully worked her way out into the open area of the Emiya courtyard. Her mind didn\u2019t stop. Why did this happen? She asked herself. Was it not enough that she was having horrific nightmares each night? Was it not enough that her Senpai lost an arm because of her?! Why did the world only continue to punish her?! Tears began to well up in the giantess\u2019 eyes. Any second now the tears would stream down. But even so she got out to the courtyard and seated herself as low as possible so no one would see. At the very least being huddled against the ground did a decent job of covering her sensual areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Senpai\u2026</i>Sakura fought back her tears to avoid further troubling her lover. The minutes seemed to continue to roll by with no change. Tohsaka and Shirou were still inside and for whatever reason they saw fit to leave Sakura out by herself. It\u2019s probably nee-san knowing her...She realized. Shirou would never leave her side, so the fact he wasn\u2019t out yet meant Tohsaka was stopping him for some reason. The idea of those two alone did stir well with the giantess. She knew Shirou fancied her. Who wouldn\u2019t? She\u2019s the perfect girl. She\u2019s\u2026not Sakura. The violet-haired girl lowered her eyes to the dirt. That\u2019s what she was in comparison to her sister: Dirt. But even so Shirou chose her over her sister. She had him, and she didn\u2019t want to even risk losing him. If only her sister wasn\u2019t in the picture, Sakura\u2019s eyes looked to her now giant hand. It wasn\u2019t unthinkable to think such a hand could crush her sister. <br>\r\nIt\u2019d be no different that swatting a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No! I won\u2019t ever do that!!</i> Sakura shook away all such thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight at that moment Sakura heard a door open, her eyes looked up to see her sister and Senpai, who was blindfolded. For a brief moment the giantess was surprised at her size; for all intents and purposes she was lying as low to the ground as she could. But even with her head down to the ground it was still about waist high to a normal person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNee-san? Why is Senpai blindfolded?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTohsaka looked at Shirou, \u201cBecause I don\u2019t think we have anything we can use to cover you so I instead decided to cover lover boy.\u201d Tohsaka\u2019s eyes then grew serious. \u201cSakura\u2026Do you mind if I do a few tests?\u201d Sakura nodded and the magus went to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it would happen the tests were little more than Tohsaka planting her palm on Sakura\u2019s body at key points, measuring her body and magical energy, simple things like that. Sakura complied as best she could. Shirou seemed to have been informed already as he didn\u2019t offer any arguments. After a few minutes of stumbling blind he seated himself beside what he thought was a wall but was in fact Sakura\u2019s leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Sakura! Whatever this is we\u2019ll fix it for you!\u201d He sounded confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Senpai\u2026\u201d Sakura smiled, unable to say anything else. She spotted the cloth on her lover\u2019s arm, the arm he got when he lost his old one. Guilt bit at her but she didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cSenpai\u2026I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m such a burden.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly Sakura! You aren\u2019t a burden. Remember who you\u2019re talking to. I love to help people!\u201d He grinned in the general direction he knew Sakura was at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSenpai\u2026\u201d Sakura could only continue to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn.\u201d Tohsaka interrupted their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNee-san, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026I have no idea.\u201d The magus sighed. \u201cI have no idea what the cause of this is Sakura. I measured your height up to about twenty-five feet and your magical energy has increased to match but other than that I have no idea. I can only assume this has something to do with the crest worm but if it does I don\u2019t know how we can handle it. There\u2019s only one person who does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZouken.\u201d Shirou finished. Sakura averted her gaze at the name. Her grandfather\u2026the man who made her suffer so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich is why I\u2019m going to go pay him a visit.\u201d Tohsaka stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?!\u201d Sakura and Shirou spoke in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTohsaka continued nonchalantly, \u201cIt\u2019s not for you. You being this big now is a clear risk of revealing magi to the world. It\u2019s my duty to confront Zouken about this.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And when we do we can get him to get rid of that crest worm Sakura.\u201d <br>\r\nObviously it wouldn\u2019t be that easy, but something about the way the young man said it almost made it seem like it would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you stupid or something? Look at you! Your arm still hasn\u2019t healed, and Sakura needs someone here with her an-\u201c Shirou didn\u2019t even react. Tohsaka sighed, \u201cI won\u2019t talk you out of this will I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Senpai for you.\u201d Sakura giggled, \u201cOnce he sets his mind to something there\u2019s no stopping him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou looked towards his giantess friend, \u201cSorry Sakura. I don\u2019t want to leave you alone but we need to find Zouken as soon as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay Senpai,\u201d She nodded kindly, \u201cBesides, I have Rider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is true\u2026\u201d Tohsaka mumbled to herself, \u201cPlus with your increased magical energy she\u2019s probably even stronger now. I suppose you should be fine on your own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt my size is anyone going to want to hurt me?\u201d The gentle giantess joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue\u2026\u201d Tohsaka walked over to Shirou and undid his blindfold. \u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019ve already spent half the day here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man nodded but not before heading towards Sakura\u2019s face. He gently knelt down beside her, \u201cI promise you Sakura, we\u2019ll save you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSenpai\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou gave her a small goodbye kiss before standing back up. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back soon!\u201d Without waste he turned and ran out the door with Tohsaka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura watched them leave with a forced smile. Once they were out of sight her eyes grew notably sadder. All this trouble was because of her, and now because of her pesky size she couldn\u2019t even do simple things like cook or clean anymore. She couldn\u2019t even\u2026be with Shirou anymore. Her face blushed as she remembered some of their\u2026intimate nights. The few pleasures she had in this situation were growing fewer. At this point all she had was the time she spent with her Senpai, but he was going to be gone all day\u2026with her sister. She shouldn\u2019t have been jealous about that but she was. But it went beyond that. There was a part of Sakura\u2026a part she never wanted to acknowledge, a part that just wished Tohsaka wasn\u2019t in the picture at all. Then she wouldn\u2019t have to worry. Shirou would be all hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess shook her head again at the thought, but like before her eyes trailed to her hand. It really would be like crushing a bug\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou and Tohsaka stopped at their destination: the Matou household. It loomed before them almost ominously, but it didn\u2019t seem as if the building actually had any evil intent to it. It was more as if the ominous air was just the natural feeling of the building. Tohsaka bit her lip at the feeling, \u201cI don\u2019t sense any magical energies here. The Matou may have a weakened magus bloodline but it\u2019s odd that there\u2019s no defenses at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it empty?\u201d Shirou queried. \u201cHe might know we\u2019re looking for him and have hidden.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d The girl admitted, \u201cBut we don\u2019t have any other leads.\u201d Gently, she took a step forward, then another, no change seemed to occur. The steps slowly grew more frequent until both her and Shirou were inside. \u201cI\u2019ll check upstairs, can you check the bottom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Shirou nodded. Tohsaka began to go to the upper floor as Shirou stayed and looked through the rooms of the ground floor. He found an exquisite dining hall, lavishly decorated and beautiful. But it seemed so\u2026token, it looked almost like it was there for show. The only feeling in this entire building was the ominous, disquieting feeling that puts one on edge. It almost felt as if the house was just a fa\u00e7ade for a different world entirely. Despite this clear feeling Shirou ventured further into the room. In the corner was a shadow that caught his eye. It almost seemed\u2026alive. But the young man quickly realized the feeling of something alive wasn\u2019t coming from the shadow\u2026not the shadow was blocking a doorway. And something was in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou came before I could invite you Emiya Shirou.\u201d A haggard, old voice called from the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZouken!\u201d Shirou clenched his teeth and, without thinking, ran into the darkness. Inside was a room lit a sickening green. It resembled a dungeon, with stone stairs leading down into a pit of darkness. Only it wasn\u2019t darkness\u2026it was something alive\u2026Shirou felt the desire to retch as he realized: insects. The ground was littered with thousands upon thousands of insects, and in the middle of them stood the wrinked mass that was Matou Zouken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weak-looking old man looked to Shirou with soulless eyes, \u201cI take it you are here about Sakura?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake the crest worm out of her! It\u2019s killing her, made her grow and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm?\u201d Zouken raised an eyebrow, \u201cGrow? I know nothing of such magic boy. Whatever it may be that caused that, it wasn\u2019t my crest worm. Besides, even if it was; I couldn\u2019t remove it if I wanted to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSakura has long-since outmatched me. She\u2019s been feeding each night, last night she feasted on a servant and I could no longer control her. I cannot remove the crest worm because the moment she would see me she would kill me. And I cannot control her anymore to avoid that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZouken\u2019s words were straightforward but somehow cryptic, \u201cFeast? Kill? What are you talking about Zouken?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man found Shirou amusing, his chuckles were echoing taunts in the chamber. \u201cYou know exactly what I mean boy.\u201d Shirou grimaced. \u201cThe shadow that has been terrorizing the city at night and devouring people. Sakura's bizarre condition. We have long-since left the realm of magics I can handle. There is only one person who is capable of doing this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSakura.\u201d Shirou finished. All the strength in his legs vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed. Sakura is the Shadow. You can choose to leave her be and she will surely devour more and more each night. Or you can choose to continue down this road you have started. Either way I cannot do anything.\u201d With his cryptic words echoing into the dark the bugs swarmed around Zouken and slowly, his body began to vanish into the swarm. In minutes there was no trace of his presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou retched. He abandoned everything for Sakura, but now his choice is quite clearly Sakura, or the world. He rose to his feet, already aware of his choice. He exited the room and found Tohsaka looking for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShirou! Are you okay? You look pale.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man nodded, \u201cYeah. That room just\u2026gave me a bad vibe. But Zouken wasn\u2019t in there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn.\u201d Tohsaka clicked her tongue, not aware of the deceit. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll just have to head back and try something else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Shirou nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two headed home together. A lot more time seemed to have passed than either of them thought as it was already growing dark. By the time they finally arrived home Shirou began to prepare dinner. Sakura seemed to have fallen asleep from boredom at some point being unable to do much else besides lay around. After dinner everyone very quickly settled in.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That nightmare came again. Could it be called the same nightmare though? Something about this time was different. Like always Sakura felt her dream self dragging her feet along the cold pavements of the roads. There was still the strong presence of death everywhere. But something was different. Once she finally realized what it suddenly seemed so obvious. It was her size. In her nightmare she was a giant too. In her vision she could make out cars near her ankles, with each step the ground seemed to give way slightly to her immense figure. Even to her ears she could hear the booms that were her footsteps; how was anyone sleeping through this? The answer was simple: they weren't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each and every step Sakura's gigantic form stirred people awake, and people, curious as they were, would step outside to investigate what seemed like a series of tremors. Sakura looked to the people in their homes coming out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Don't do it...</i>She tried to warn them but no sound came out of her mouth. It would've done no good anyway. The darkness devoured everyone before they could exclaim about the giantess. Something about their tiny pleas was very pleasant to hear, Sakura felt her lips begin to smile. Her feet continued to drag themselves along the roads to get the attention of more people. Her mind cried out against what she was doing, but there was no denying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was enjoying herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uwah!\" Sakura's eyes flew open, her mouth gasping for air. \"Thank goodness, it was just a dream.\" She sighed. However when she re-opened her eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura!!\" A couple shouts came from nearby; their voices were familiar but they never sounded more distant than they did now. The giantess saw two familiar figures enter the open area of the Emiya household. Sakura wasn't in there though, she couldn't be. Because Sakura Matou was standing in front of the entire house at over a hundred feet high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTohsaka and Shirou stared dumbfoundedly at the giantess. The sun was just beginning to rise and they all hoped it was some sort of illusion from the night. It had to have been thirty minutes of all of them staring at each other, hoping that the increasingly blue sky would reveal it all to be a trick. Of course it wasn't. Once the sun had fully risen and the sky fully blue did Tohsaka finally break the long silence. \"Oh my God...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the silence broken the air seemed to ease slightly. Sakura gently lowered herself onto the streets so her head hovered over the two tiny people. \"Senpai, what happened?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Don't worry Sakura! We can fix this, we can-\" Shirou turned to Tohsaka for something, anything. The magus could only click her tongue and run into the building. \"T-Tohsaka?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nii-san...\" Sakura mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next minute Tohsaka returned with a grim expression, \"It's just as I feared...\" Her voice was serious,, it was the tone she had whenever she put her feelings on hold to act. \"I just checked the TV to see something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-And?!\" Shirou impatiently asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Nothing. As in, no local  news at all. Local stations have been completely stopped.\" She paused as if uncertain to continue, \"...It looks like we can't keep playing nice Shirou.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Shirou and Sakura looked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just sent out a familiar to check for life out in the city, there's nothing. Nothing except footprints.\" Tohsaka glared at Sakura, \"<i>Giant</i> footprints.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying?!\" Shirou was as uncouth as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm saying exactly what we've all known in our hearts. The Shadow gained enough power to completely devoid this town of life, and the fact it's now a giant can only lead to one conclusion- Sakura, you are the Shadow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach word Tohsaka said came off cold and calculating, but they weren't a surprise. In his mind Shirou recalled Zouken's words. <i>You can choose to leave her be and she will surely devour more and more each night. Or you can choose to continue down this road you have started.</i> He had only waited a single night, but was all of Fuyuki really gone as a result?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying Nii-san? I didn't go anywhere, I was asleep! I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why are your feet dirty?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura gasped. There was no way Tohsaka could actually see her feet past the wall of the house, but she couldn't bring herself to check to disprove her. Because she knew, she knew she was right. \"They...They were just nightmares.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTohsaka took a step forward, \"I'm sorry Sakura, but as the head of the Tohsaka household and your sister it's my duty to kill you and save everyone from a madman like Zouken.\" The woman's arm began to glow, she was on the verge of casting magic. But Shirou and Sakura knew she wouldn't be able to do it. At her size Sakura wouldn't be wiped out so easily, especially if her magical energy has increased as Tohsaka said yesterday. But even so the magus was going to try, her hand was aimed at Sakura.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tohsaka!!\" Shirou ran to try and stop her but it was too late. A series of chants came from Tohsaka's lips and out came a blast of energy. Sakura screamed as it hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry...\" Tohsaka muttered under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tohsaka what did you-?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smoke began to clear around Sakura's face, revealing the bleeding wound on her neck. Almost in a trance, Sakura's hand touched her injured juggular and her eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I destroyed her juggular, soon she'll die before any more harm could be done.\" Tohsaka's words came out coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch.\" Shirou bit his lip, \"Sakura!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess looked to Shirou and smiled, \"I love you Senpai, even now when all I've done is be a burden I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Sakura, we'll get through this!!\" Shirou sounded desperate, behind him the magus was silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Senpai...\" Sakura smiled, but her mind remembered her dream yesterday. How in that dream she almost died and her mind turned to the young man before her. How if she died she'd never see him again, how even if he would be better off she couldn't die without him. How she couldn't die without him. He was <i>hers</i>. No one was going to take him from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" The two before Sakura exclaimed, Sakura herself knew why. The wound on her neck was now healing. If her dreams were indeed reality such things couldn't kill her anyway. For what felt like the first time in her life, Sakura smiled at the people before her. \"I'm not going anywhere Nii-san.\" Her voice changed in an instant, this wasn't the meek voice of the girl before. This was the confident voice of a woman who knew what she was capable of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura stood to her full height, easily towering over the neighborhood. Around her ankles stirred a darkness she recognized. With her smile, the darkness, and her height she must've looked like some sort of demon. But that didn't matter. She took a step forward, her foot easily crushing the wall that separated Shirou and Tohsaka from her. \"You've always been like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura!\" Tohsaka looked rightfully scared. Near her Shirou looked too stunned to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura turned and continued to follow the wall instead of going forward. \"Always acting cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always the perfect person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always trying to hurt me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always trying to take Senpai from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But now look at you.\" Sakura stopped after destroying everything besides the main building. Her feet were before Tohsaka now. \"You're just a bug to me. I'm greater than you could ever hope to become. I'm...\" The giantess paused to search for an appropriate word, only one came to mind. \"...I'm a Goddess.\" Finally came out. Sakura raised her sole, revealing the dirt and grime she got from the previous night. \"It would be so easy to just crush you...But I won't.\" Her foot returned to the ground. \"Because even if I hate you Nii-san, even if you make me miserable...I do love you.\" Sakura smiled down at the bug, \"So I will keep you alive. You can become a part of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTohsaka knew what she meant, around Sakura's feet the darkness that devoured people was dancing in anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider it an honor. I'll let you experience everything I've felt over the years.\" Without waste Sakura let the shadows eat Tohsaka into the void. It lasted seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura...\" Shirou finally managed to speak, sounding completely broken now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can feel her struggling Senpai.\" Sakura smiled, \"She's begging for me to let her back out, but we both know that won't be happening.\" The giantess began to pace again, her feet walking around Shirou regardless of what was in their path. \"But that begs the question of what to do with you Senpai. If I'm a Goddess then what are you? I still love you, but I'm definitely superior now. What should I do?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dim lights bathed the park in their harsh glow as Shiki walked down the darkened path. He had come here in the middle of the night to meet with Arcueid, but it seems he had arrived a bit early, as the white princess was nowhere to be found. She was always harping on him to show up on time for their little late-night rendezvous, so it was unusual that she wasn\u2019t greeting him with her usual crooked smile. Shiki just hoped she wasn\u2019t off causing trouble somewhere. After all, the whole purpose for this meet-up was so they can go hunt the vampire that has been ravishing the town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, he decided to sit down on a nearby bench to wait. Before he can even take another step, however, he was flung forward as if he was hit from behind by a truck. Sent sprawling, he gulped in air frantically. Strangely, besides being out of breath, he didn\u2019t feel any major injuries. But what could suddenly throw him through the air like that? A wave of fear washed through Shiki\u2019s body as he imagined being torn apart by a vampire before he could even grab his knife. As it is, without Arcueid by his side, he felt helpless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, no follow-up attack yet ravaged his prone body, but as he drew himself to his feet, he felt a tremor shake him to his very core. It was followed by another, and another, threatening to knock Shiki on his rear. Looking around for the massive creature that must be making these earthquakes, he notices that everything seems\u2026 different. Larger. The streetlamps stretch upwards to infinity, and the bench that he almost sat on is now taller than the highest tree. Being the size of a bug will certainly make him easy prey for even the weakest vampire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he reaches for his knife, an impossibly tall figure strides into view, blocking out the flickering streetlights. This person was wearing long black robes and high-laced boots, which Shiki couldn\u2019t help but think looked really cool. As he craned his neck upward, he saw that this person had short blue hair and blue eyes, just like Ciel-senpai at school, but lacking her trademark glasses. And, unlike his spunky upperclassman, this person had an icy countenance, looking more like a trained killer than a schoolgirl. She continued to walk towards Shiki until he was almost flattened under her boots, then abruptly stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese shrinking swords really work. I will have to thank the Church,\u201d the robed woman said, glancing at the razor-sharp blades between the fingers of her right hand. The blades disappeared in a cloud of sparks as she turned her stony gaze on Shiki. \u201cDo not be afraid, Tohno-kun. This is for your own good,\u201d she said, as she bent down and extended her hand toward Shiki. Paralyzed by fear, Shiki stood stock-still as the woman\u2019s fingers extended like talons, blocking out even the light of the full moon overhead. Enveloped by darkness, he squeezed his eyes shut as her hand closed around him tightly. Her skin was soft and warm, almost a pleasant feeling against the chilly night air. He squeezed his eyes as she stood up and lifted him to eye level. Shiki sat on his rear as he fingers uncurled, leaving him staring up into her expressionless blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCiel-senpai, is that you? Why are you doing this?\u201d Shiki asked, dumbfounded. \u201cI cannot allow you to go gallivanting around with that princess, Tohno-kun. It is far too dangerous for a mere human like you,\u201d she explained, her words as icy as her stare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve got it all wrong! Arc isn\u2019t a bad person! And anyway, how did I end up like this?\u201d Shiki protested. Without answering, the scary Ciel-like person turned her head towards the entrance to the park. \u201cThere\u2019s no time to explain. It seems the princess has arrived,\u201d she said, turning back towards Shiki. \u201cWe must leave immediately. Forgive me, Tohno-kun, but these garments have no pockets.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiki wondered what she was apologizing for, until her hand slowly approached her opening mouth. He tried to scramble up her fingers to get away from her gaping maw, but she tipped her hand until he was sliding down her palm. Ciel\u2019s tongue emerged to greet him, and Shiki tumbled face-first into the damp muscle. His fingers clawed for purchase on the wet tongue as Ciel drew it back into her mouth. The moonlit park disappeared as Shiki passed under her nose and into the steaming cavern. Gleaming white teeth surrounded him, even more frightening than any of the beasts that spawned from Chaos. The tongue writhed underneath him, denying him any chance of a steady foothold. He lay spread-eagle on the pink muscle, right before Ciel\u2019s lips clamped shut, sealing Shiki inside a sopping-wet, hellishly hot prison. He held onto the tongue for dear life like a bucking bronco as Ciel began running along rooftops on her way back to her apartment. Meanwhile, the saliva level was rising dangerously high inside her mouth. Shiki was forced to swallow gallons of the stuff as he desperately tried to choke down some air in his dank hell. Even her saliva tasted like curry! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiki was on the verge of passing out when an influx of light and cool air washed over him. Sticking two fingers inside of her mouth, Ciel roughly plucked Shiki off her tongue and placed him on the nightstand next to her bed. Now utterly drenched in her stinking saliva, Shiki was simply glad his glasses were indestructible. As he wiped them off, he took a look around Ciel\u2019s apartment. The small dwelling was sparsely furnished, but it looked comfortable enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI shrank you because it\u2019s easier to protect you like this. You can stay here until I defeat the vampire, Tohno-kun. There\u2019s no need for you to get involved in this battle,\u201d Ciel said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I can fight at this size, anyway. But won\u2019t Arc come looking for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve placed a barrier on this building that will conceal your presence from the princess. She can search the whole world if she wants, she\u2019ll never find you here\u201d she says dismissively. \u201cI\u2019ll tell your sister that you\u2019ll be away for a while as well, so don\u2019t worry about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, I can\u2019t even go to school like this, either,\u201d Shiki pouts, angrily kicking an alarm clock. \u201cI hope Arihiko will survive without me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye on him, Tohno-kun,\u201d Ciel said with a mischievous smile. It seemed like some of her normal personality was starting to show through. Shiki blushed as his stomach growled. It was now the wee hours of the morning, and many hours since he ate Kohaku\u2019s delicious dinner. But he was also plastered with rank, curry-stained saliva and could really use a bath.</span></div></div>",

This introduction very spoilerish so if you have not read Tsukihime and care about spoilers I'd stop here.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis house was a prison. In a bed inside the Tohno Household that was all a young man could think. Upon returning to his original home Shiki never thought he'd be thinking like that, but he was. His house was a prison. Or perhaps that was too grand, his room or even his bed could have been the prison. After all, he couldn't move. Physically there was no reason to it, but for all intents and purposes Shiki's body was paralyzed. The cause: his own sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't even an hour ago Shiki confronted Akiha. He'd found out she'd been sucking blood from people at night and demanded answers. What he got was something unexpected. Now with vermilion red-hair, the woman explained how she killed the original blood-sucking killer, and now she was the one sucking blood. For whatever reason Shiki had a connection to the original killer, they shared a life force so neither could truly flourish while the other lived. And now that Akiha had killed that person, she seemed to take his place. She and Shiki shared a life force, so she sucked blood each night in order to keep them both strong. Akiha revealed all of this without a care in the world. A part of Shiki wanted to kill her as she confessed, but he didn't do it. He listened, and then Akiha made the one request he couldn't fulfill. She wanted him to love her. Not as a sister, but as a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't really a matter of incest, Shiki knew he was adopted, but even so he saw Akiha only as a sister. Though that wasn't the main reason. The truth was...there was another,  one of the maids of the Tohno house, Kohaku. Shiki loved her. And when he told Akiha that...she did this to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause they were connected, all it would take is a thought of Akiha and Shiki would die. Akiha displayed this power by taking away Shiki's ability to move. But despite that he still held loyal to Kohaku. Akiha seemed confident he would change his mind though. She called the maid to take him to his room as if it were the most trivial of matters. So here he was, trapped and unable to move at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn it...</i>Shiki thought to himself. Even the simple ability to talk seemed to escape him right now. His body felt like someone else's, something beyond his control. He was Akiha's puppet, and he knew it. That wasn't what frustrated him though. What frustrated him was the fact he couldn't help Akiha. Whatever was causing this...change...it wasn't her. She didn't seem to realize it but something was controlling her. Even if her personality remained dominant its influences were obvious. Whatever that something was, Shiki wanted to do something about it. Though he wondered how. When he couldn't even walk without Akiha willing it so?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sleep</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Huh?</i> All of a sudden the young man felt exhausted. His eyes grew heavy, he struggled to hold them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sleep Nii-san. When you wake up...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiki couldn't hear anymore. He was asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the last week with each night being plagued by dreams of murder and blood-sucking, Shiki'd forgotten what a regular, dreamless sleep felt like. It was a reprieve he'd really needed. A chance for his mind to relax even if for a moment. Though like all pleasant things, it went by far too fast. Before he knew it Shiki's eyes were already fluttering awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Man that was a good nap...\" He scratched his head...Wait...scratched his head?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah?!\" The young man looked at his hand. He was moving it! His body could move! Hands, legs, arms, everything seemed to be in working order. The relief of mobility again brought a smile to Shiki's face. A smile that instantly vanished when he realized something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was somewhere new...Or rather...some place familiar, but nothing he could recognize. The furniture still resembled that of the Tohno Household, but it seemed so much...<i>bigger</i>. And that was the key word. When Shiki looked at everything he realized he did recognize this room, it was only huge! Or to be more specific, Shiki was small. Yes, with that realization the chairs now looked like chairs. The shelves resembled shelves. Even the big plain Shiki had woken up on was now very clearly a white table. Though knowing what had happened didn't diminish the shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...shrank?!\" Shiki muttered in disbelief. \"How?! Why?!\" His mind racked the possibilities although the answer was as obvious as ever. He shrinks hours after finding out his sister had total control over him. Who else could it be?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Click</i> The room's door opened as a figure stepped in. Even though Shiki had seen the person plenty of times, seeing them as a towering giantess brought a look of awe upon his face. He shouldn't have been as surprised as he was, given that he was in their room. But even so, he'd woken up shrunken and now was staring at...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The title explains it pretty well but in case you still don't get it this here is a Size Changing Interactive built around the various works of Type-Moon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nList of works include: Fate/Stay Night, Tsukihime, Kara no Kyoukai, Fate/Zero, Melty Blood, Fate/Extra, Carnival Phantasm and more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anything else let us go over the basic rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Only female giants<br>\r\n- Both Growth and Shrinking is just fine<br>\r\n- Please keep characters in character (Unless it's Carnival Phantasm then go nuts.)<br>\r\n- No one sentence chapters if possible<br>\r\n- Please nothing extremely anal, toilet, anything with unbirth, or things along those lines. Just my preference.<br>\r\n- Unless you still don't get it this is only for things created by Type-Moon. Nothing outside of that!<br>\r\n-And lastly please keep it competently written!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I want to make a special mention for Carnival Phantasm. CP is mainly parody so it has something of its own set of rules. Characters can be OOC, things do not necessarily have to make 100% sense and you can just have fun with it. Also instead of the standard \"Pick Growth or Shrink then pick Character\" thing. CP will have scenarios. The number of scenarios is not set so there can be as many as people are willing to make. You just set the stage with the first chapter and that's how it is. If you want something different pick a different scenario. I'm doing it like this because it'll be easy to absolutely bury it with choices otherwise. And of course it being parody, comedy is welcomed there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso if you pick something like the game Fate/Extra where you have a protagonist you name/create yourself...just go ahead and make it an OC. There's no point in restricting you there. Also, if someone aside from the Protagonist shrinks I'd like to keep the Protagonist female so there'd be another possible GTS to use. But everywhere else use only the characters provided!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd lastly, I know it might seem odd to have so many different media, especially considering there are certain series like Fate/Stay Night that have a bunch of different versions. But they do have differences and if anything else they can be used for different storylines if for some reason you don't like one. It might be redundant to have an interactive where you can write a different story for the manga, visual novel, anime, and animated movie but just have fun with it. That's what all this is about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the rules and extra stuff are out of the way. Please enjoy ^^</td>",
