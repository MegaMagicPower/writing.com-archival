But that never stopped Piper Black from doing pretty much whatever she wanted before, and it certainly didn't look to be stopping her anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper is a native Daven's Porter with a big mouth and a penchant for getting into trouble. She has shoulder length black hair, olive-colored skin, and stands a bit taller than most of the boys in her graduating class at 5'10\". She's quite busty, her breadth of breasts fed by her love of pizza and a natural inclination against running. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lives with her mother, Harper, and her shitty older sister Parker in a little crackerbox about half an hour from the ocean. It's not a luxurious life, but it could have always been worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, she used to be fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she's about to begin her next adventure in Daven's Port, and this one might be her <i>biggest</i> one yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does this adventure start?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Black house is never a peaceful one. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe thought of three equally outspoken, sometimes overbearing women stuck in such close quarters with one another would be enough to make weaker folks cringe. Add in one recent divorce, a parting gift pregnancy, live paycheck to paycheck for a few months with a dash of butting heads with Mom, sprinkle in a pinch of sister who doesn't do shit, bake for eighteen years, and you've got Piper Black's whole life in a nutshell. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThey'd never been well off. And honestly, they'd never really gotten along. Piper's immediate family of three was loud enough for most people's reunions. There was always a lot to fight about, and that was <i>before</i> the pregnancy. Once Dad left and Parker started butting heads with Mom all the time, things only got worse.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nBut for few hours, just little cracks, there <i>were</i> moments of respite. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nPiper just laid there, in her room. The lights were still off, and the soft blue light of the morning was trickling in through her blinds. She was still caught somewhere between truly sleeping and just cat napping. Those few, precious minutes before the house came to life were a rare occasion. It was the only time when there wasn't a TV blaring or a speaker-rattling the floorboards. When Mom and Parker weren't at each other's throats. When the whole house was quiet. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nIt was nice. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nPiper laid there in her bed. Her long black hair was strewn about her pillows. Her brown eyes hung heavily, the taste of sleep still fresh on her tongue. The only sound in her room was the fan going, whirring, humming as the blades went round and around.  Piper had been staring at the fan for a while now, trying to use it to go back to sleep. It hadn't worked yet, but she could feel her eyelids drooping a bit more and more with every passing moment.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<i>Better get some sleep now,</i> she told herself as she shut her eyes, <i>you know you won't get any once everyone's up...</i> <br>\r\n <br>\r\nSo she snuggled up, extra tight, beneath the covers. It was summer, but she still had on her thick blanket. Maybe that was part of the problem? Why she hadn't been sleeping well lately. Too hot? Maybe it was time to break out that old thinner one. Ugh, but that one was so scratchy... <br>\r\n <br>\r\nMaybe she could just start sleeping naked? <br>\r\n <br>\r\nParker did it, most of the time. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nCould sleeping naked really make that much more of a difference? Wouldn't her body itch? Like, rubbing against the sheet and all that. Her nips pressing up against the pillow? (You <i>know</i> she was a hugger, and she liked to sleep on her stomach!) But still, it had to beat waking up all sweaty... <br>\r\n <br>\r\nMaybe that was her answer? If she just took off her clothes, she could get a couple more minutes of sleep. Just a couple more.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nPiper inched her fingers down to the hem of her t-shirt, and slowly tugged it off. Her breasts splayed out gratefully, itching with freedom as she scratched them jovially. <i>God</i> that felt great. But since when was that shirt too tight? <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<i>They can't <u>possibly</u> be getting even bigger, can they?</i> Piper rolled her eyes as she cupped and jiggled and jostled her olive colored mammaries, <i>That's the last thing I need right now. New bras.</i> <br>\r\n <br>\r\nLaying there, her hands on her chest, Piper slowly began to drift off. Her thoughts became hazy, and the sound of the fan began to lull her back towards Nod. Her chest rose and fell, slowly but surely becoming slow and sure. Her mouth opened oh-so-slightly, and a small-half snore escaped her. Her brown eyes inched, inched, <i>inched</i> closed until finally, the whole room was black. She felt her eyes roll into the back of her head as she began to drift off. Slowly, slowly she fell and fell until\u2014 <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"> WAH WAH WAH WAH... </div> <br>\r\n <br>\r\nHer alarm went off. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<i>\"Dammit Piper!\"</i> she heard her sister cuss through the cheap thin walls, \"I was almost asleep!\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"God I'm <i>getting</i> it!\" Piper hollered back, \"Don't get your petri dish panties in a wad, Parker, it's a biohazard!\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nYup, welcome to life in the Black house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Piper I swear to GOD if you don't shut that thing off I'm going to <u>sit on you</u> and let your eyeballs pop out of your skull!\"</i> she heard her mom roar from all the way down the hall, <i>\"Turn. It. Off!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's just the <i>beginning</i> of a day in the life of Piper Black...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You know, getting dressed in the morning with a room as messy as Piper\u2019s wasn\u2019t exactly easy to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was kinda... all over the place. Some in part due to Piper\u2019s \u201ceclectic\u201d style of decorating, and the other parts a mixture of her own unwillingness and seeming inability to clean her room anything farther than half-way. It was a defect on the Black family gene if anyone else\u2019s room was any indication, rest assured. But they managed to get by just fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper threw on one of her band t-shirts. 21 Pilots might be a little overplayed, but damn if they couldn\u2019t make a good t-shirt. The logo looked great spread across her chest--she\u2019d bought it about a size too big to make sure that the girls had enough room to breathe; just big enough to give her chest some room, but not so big as to make her look dumpy. Standing at the mirror above her desk, Piper combed her long black hair and pulling them into two twin ponytails, going for something between \u201cquirky\u201d \u201cflirty\u201d and \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like actually doing my hair today\u201d before jumping into a pair of skinny jeans that (while she would never admit it) seemed a lot more skinny as of late than she cared to remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Ma, I\u2019m headed out!\u201d Piper called back into the little hobbit hole, \u201cIf you need me, text me okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dNoo, why would your heavily pregnant mother need you for anything?\u201d</i> she could practically hear her beached mother roll her eyes as she hollered from the master bedroom, <i>\u201dAt <u>least</u> make sure you stop by D\u2019s on your way home! Your sister ate all the donuts!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKay, love you!\u201d Piper called out without looking back, letting the screen door slam as she hurried down the rickety wooden porch towards the sweet salty smell of freedom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaven\u2019s Port, rather the area of Daven\u2019s Port that surrounded her depressingly impoverished neighborhood, had always been Piper\u2019s favorite escape from her troubled home life. Even before the falling out between her folks, she had always been a professional street rat. Back when she was still in high school (read: literally a month ago), she would skip classes to cause all kinds of trouble with various other truants. Smashing bottles in alleyways, hooking up with dudes who she <i>thought</i> were her age, hooking up with other dudes who definitely <i>weren\u2019t</i> her age, a little loitering... you know, a regular adolescence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong the places she wasn\u2019t still banned for her behavior during her young, impressionable days, Piper was welcomed almost everywhere else. She had a vast repertoire amongst the locals. Shopkeepers, street vendors, even some cops knew Piper. Whatever the trade off, it was a lot better than home most days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was why she was so very eager to show Dakota Johnson, a newbie to the good old DP, all the ins and outs of the city that she so very much loved to call home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, and Zack was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause, you know, it\u2019s Zack. And he tended to go most places where two pretty girls went and it wasn\u2019t a school night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t <i>tell</i> me that they don\u2019t have donuts in Texas, Dee.\u201d Piper guffawed, \u201cOr do they have them, but you have to pronounce them with an accent or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota Johnson was a twiggy little thing who had just moved in a few streets over. On the \u201cgood\u201d side of their neighborhood. Typical nuclear family--Breadwinner Dad, Stay-At-Home Mom, Annoying Little Brother, and one Why-Did-We-Move-Here? Daughter. Her life was about as Basic as they came; it could have easily been the next premise of one of those godawful teen dramas (on ABC, of course). Which was where Piper had been making an effort to step in and try to make her life a bit more interesting than staying at home listening to... country music. Or whatever someone did when they missed Texas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah, it\u2019s just... you know...\u201d Dakota held up her Homer Simpson Special, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a donut this... <i>big</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota was a pretty small girl. Narrow in the waist, narrow in the chest, big in the butt. She had long brown hair liked to wear tank tops and short shorts. The real girl next door archetype. But the girl was right--donuts like the Homer Simpson Special didn\u2019t <i>exist</i> anywhere else. Only in Daven\u2019s Port, circa D\u2019s Donuts! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And, Piper supposed, the FOX Network, for licensing purposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, they aren\u2019t <i>all</i> Ten Gallon Hat sized?\u201d Zack offered from Dakota\u2019s end of the table, \u201cI thought everything was <i>bigger</i> in Texas?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota groaned, and Piper punched him in the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was younger than either of them. He was only a junior in high school (an aspiring senior after the Summer, he was quick to remind her!) and was something of an old friend of Piper\u2019s. Back when Zack\u2019s folks made the split (well before Piper\u2019s) Piper had been quick to come to his aide and keep him from becoming one of the insedit troublemakers that wandered around the streets because their parents didn\u2019t love them. Now that Piper was a child of divorce, he had been just as quick to ensure the same. He was always there for her, and as much as his mom hated her, there was always a place for her to crash if she needed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, that didn\u2019t mean he was funny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was a shorter guy with sandy blonde hair that hung down to his eyebrows. As he\u2019d been told most of his life, he was very punchable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost times, Piper agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up, Zack.\u201d Piper groaned, \u201cYou\u2019ll scare away our new tourist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey\u2019d been hanging out with Dakota for the better part of two weeks now. Showing her the ropes, easing her out of that monument to normality they called a two-story house. Maybe mooching off her folks a little. But this was the first time they\u2019d ever gotten her to go out to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is what you guys do for fun?\u201d Dakota giggled, \u201cEat donuts and beat up Zack?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMostly.\u201d Piper said with a smile, punching Zack again from across the table, \u201cBut sometimes we go to the beach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes she kicks me.\u201d Zack grumbled before Piper kicked him swiftly underneath the table, \u201cGODDAMMIT.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, it had been pretty fun! Piper never really pegged Dakota as someone she would have thought she could get along with. With her long brown hair and her penchant for preppy, basic thoughts. But she and Dakota had become fast friends, ever since Dakota let her hide out in her backyard while she hid from some less-than-scrupulous Russian gentlemen. Despite what her mother thought about her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so...\u201d Dakota led, taking a bite out of her donut, \u201cWhich of the two things left to do in Daven\u2019s Port are we gonna do today? Since, you know, we\u2019ve kinda already <i>got</i> donuts...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually...\u201d Piper said with a smile...</span></div></div>",

The Rio was first opened like, 80 years agao, when movies were like, new.\" Piper explained. \"But a few years ago, this cool chick bugged the city to restore it, and they let her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Plus, it's a great place to hang out in the summer when you don't have an AC.\" Zack added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait, what?\" Dakota asked, the idea that anyone couldn't afford an AC was alien to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Just come on!\" Piper said, grabbing Dakota's wrist and dragging her out of the donut shop, and off to the movies. They all piled into Zack's cheap, used van he had acquired from a gentleman of questionable means. It took them a few tries to get the engine to turn over, but it finally did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The first thing that caught Dakota's attention about the Rio was the sing. The sign was in about ten thousand little lightbulbs, red and green and blue spelling out the words \"Rio\". Dakota imagined it was much more impressive when the lights were actually on, and it was dark out, and not under the sweltering Carolina sun. Still...\"This is...really neat.\" Dakota said, gazing up at it as they entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's even neater once you meet the staff.\" Piper boasted, pointing at a bored looking employee at the concession stand/ticket booth as she continued to drag Dakota along for to meet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was tall, she must have been nearly 6 foot, and definitely was over 6 feet if you counted the poofy black hair that must have been kept up by a can of hair spray every morning. 'Someone should tell this woman the 80s ended' Dakota thought wryly to herself. She also had, *ahem*, generously endowments, aided along by a thick frame, and olive skin and strikingly handsome features. Dakota looked at the ticket taker, then back at Piper, then back at the ticket taker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Are you two related?\" Dakota asked, \"Is that why you're so excited for me to meet the staff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hahaha, your new friend is funny, Piper.\" The manager said, in a nasally Brooklyn accent. It was hard to tell if she was being sarcastic or overly enthusiastic. \"What's her name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This is Dakota, she just moved here from Texas. And NO Dakota, we're not related. Why would you even think that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dakota looked back and forth between the two taller women's chests before saying \"...no reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"My name's Sam, Sam Palermo.\" She offered Dakota a handshake. She shook hands like a dude. She tilted her head at Piper. \"You're all here for the 'Saturday Special'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What's the 'Saturday Special?'\" Dakota asked. Piper had been waiting to share this surprise with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"For twenty bucks, Sam here will let you watch movies in theater three all day. Eat all the popcorn and soda you can stomach as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's PERFECT for beating the heat on days like today.\" Zack said, sounding like this place was an oasis in a desert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dakota was starting to see the appeal of this place. \"All day? I dunno, what movies are out this week?\" Dakota asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, Saturday Special at the Rio are managers pick. We just play whatever I feel like playing all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And what's that?\" Dakota asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Eh...I dunno, you guys like Rifftrax?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"...What's Rifftracks?\" Dakota asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Only the best thing ever.\" Zack explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Have you ever seen Mystery Science theater?\" Piper asked Dakota. Dakota just shook her head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're culturally deprived. They're these guys on the internet. They make bad movies into good ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You can play something like that in a movie theater?\" Dakota said, her mind expanding. I mean, she knew literally they could. But 'stuff from the internet' and 'movie theater' never went together in her mind until now. It was like apple and cheddar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Girl, I'm like a DJ up in here on Saturdays. We can play WHATEVAH the hell I want, and I DO take requests. Let me get you three some popcorn.\" Sam said, taking out three large tubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After several hours of Rifftrax, Steve McQueen Movies, as well as some very brief showings of Godzilla vs. Bambi, and Mickey Mouse goes to Vietnam, the trio felt like they had consumed enough movies, and popcorn, to last them a lifetime, or at least until next week. So they got themselves moving finally, waved to Sam on the way out, and hauled their bloated, sluggish bodies out to the van. By now, the afternoon sun was starting to sink below the horizon, tinging everything slightly orange. As they stepped out, Sam turned on the lights, and Dakota got to see the sign of the Rio lit up and pulsating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But when they got to the van, no matter how many times Zack cranked the ignition, the van only gave them a buzzing sound like angry bees. Zack dropped his head down on the steering wheel, defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I told you to get this shit fixed.\" Piper complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"With what money?\" Zack pointed out. \"Besides, I don't think it's broken, I think we just need someone to give us a jump. The battery has been acting up lately. Let's just call someone for help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh...speaking of battery troubles...my cell phone died while we were in there all day.\" Dakota said, holding up her iPhone, which only gave a red battery symbol before turning off. Piper checked hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Shit...Mine too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And mine has no service, because I couldn't pay the bill this month.\" Zack added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"...I guess we could go inside an ask for help.\" Piper said, shrugging and heading back into the theater. Zack and Dakota followed, it wasn't like they had anything better to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>Heeeeey</i>, Piper. You're back already. This is why you're my favorite customer.\" Sam teased, seeing her back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ugh...Zack's shitty ass van broke down in your parking lot. Can we use your phone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We think the battery is just dead. We just need a jump.\" Zack quickly added. She was scared Sam would call a tow truck, and he'd lose his Van, <i>and</i> have to pay for a tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's not the battery Zack. Your van is a peice of shit.\" Piper said. Sam eyed the two of them up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"...Tell you what. I'll do you one better. Hold on a minute.\" Sam held up a finger in front of Piper's staff, and then turned towards the other woman working at the stand, helping someone at the far end with some nachos. Sam <i>yelled</i> like, uncomfortably loud at her. \"Hey, Tiffany! I'm clocking out early. See you tommorah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"...Are you <i>sure</i> you're not related?\" Dakota asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If you keep making jokes like you're Zack, I will punch you like you're Zack.\" Piper shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They didn't know what Sam had planned, but she marched right outside, up to Zack's van, opened up the hood, and without hesitation started shoving her hand deep into the bowels of the ancient, grease smeared engine. After about only 10 minutes, Sam had her diagnosis ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's not just the battery, it's the alternator. That's why the battery keeps on dying. And christ, when was the last time you changed the frikken' oil on this thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nineteen...seventy three?\" Zack said, optimistically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm gonna hook you up with a new alternator and battery tonight, but the oil change you gotta do yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's really generous of you.\" Dakota pointed out. \"But there's no way there's a mechanic with the parts we need open on this hour on a Saturday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sure there is.\" Sam said, pointing her thumb at herself. \"You're looking at her right here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sam led them downstairs into the surprisingly vast basement of the Rio. \"Back when films were put on...you know, Film, the Rio had to actually store cases and cases of celluloid reels down here. That's what caused it to go out of business, those things go up like gasoline, and there was a fire. Only now, I can store like a thousand movies on a harddrive, so I got all this space to use.\" She explained, guiding them threw row after row of stacked car batteries and autoparts, still in their boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That explains the space. That still doesn't explain <i>why</i>, the basement of your movie theater is full of car batteries.\" Zack pointed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh well...half the money for the restoration was put up by the city and fundraising, and the other half by my family so...I gotta store batteries and such for them with the spare space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And they're not going to be mad that you just let us have some for free?\" Dakota asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh...we can't sell any of these. They're erm...used.\" Sam explained, awkwardly. \"Look, you guys do me a favor and not tell anybody about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dakota looked nervous, but this wasn't nearly the shadiest operation Piper had ever been around. \"You got it Sam. Anybody talks, they'll have to answer to me.\" Piper teased. Half-Teased. She was kind of teasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks Pipes, you're a real Peach...So...where you guys off to after this?\"</span></div></div>",

With her hands on her flaring hips, Sam looked her best customer and old friend up and down like she had just suggested they all go out to Chuck E. Cheese. It made Piper wince a bit; she didn't like feeling like a stupid kid. At least, not with Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she asked defensively, \"No good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-uh.\" Sam shook her head, her curly mane shifting, \"You expect me to clock out and blow off my girls for a night out on the beach? You're gonna have to do better than that, Pipey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a beat in the air as everyone just sort've shifted awkwardly on their feet. Piper looked down while Zack scratched the back of her head and Dakota avoided eye contact. When she put it that way, it was sort've hard to argue with Sam. Getting paid for a night of work did sound an awful lot better than the parties that they went to, at least most of the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...there'll be beer?\" Zack suggested, almost as an afterthought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we're talkin'.\" A smile spread across the older woman's cheeks, \"You didn't tell me it was gonna be <i>that</i> kinda party!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with their answer, Sam led the three teens out of the Rio's basement. She locked up behind her, leaving instructions with the remaining girls behind the various counters...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe this party wouldn't suck after all, now that Sam got to come!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'd just like to point out that nobody <i>actually</i> told me that there would be beer here.\" Dakota said meekly as she exited Zack's  clanky rustbucket, \"I-I've never drank before, guys...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who invited the virgin?\" Sam rolled her eyes from the front seat as she unbuckled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come <i>on</i> Dee, it'll be fun!\" Piper encouraged her mousier friend with a rousing pat on the shoulder, \"You're from Texas, right? They drink all the time down there, don't they? You can probably drink, like a ten gallon's hat in beer! Just don't worry about it\u2014you've got <i>me</i> here, <i>Zack</i>, <i>Sam</i>\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just met Sam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you've probably already seen what a <i>super cool</i> chick she is!\" Piper pat her friend's back again, \"Just trust me, lay back, relax, and... try not to let anyone know how much of a square you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what Zack does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four descended on the sandy shores of Daven's Port. The Summer nights were hot and humid. The wet, heavy wind blowing up to the shore brought out the curls in Piper's hair as she lead her squad towards the tide. An amber glow colored the night like rust, Around a campfire, hastil constructed with driftwood and some seashells, a couple of native Porters awaited their arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's Piper!\" cried out Matt, the athletic surfer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About damn time!\" said Jay, the older hipster<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were getting worried!\" sweet, chubby Madi added<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, this was the squad for the night. All in all, pretty good turnout! Usually these things were like, three, four people tops. But with Dakota included and Sam tagging along, plus Madi finally managing to get some free time, that meant that it wouldn't be a <i>complete</i> sausage-fest, and things didn't have to get weird when Piper had too much to drink!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what was in that cooler...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, got you a cold one!\" Jay tossed Piper a lukewarm Coors, giving Sam the up and down, \"Who's your hot friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack Tyler, at your service.\" the younger boy smiled, Madi giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had to pull up another chair (Zack had to walk <i>all the way</i> back to his van for it) but eventually things began to liven up and the night began to grow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually...</span></div></div>",

Matt had to watch his girlish figure, Zack was too drunk to keep his head up, Madi was too interested in Zack, and Jay was too laid back to be going at it after the first half a dozen beers. As for Sam and Dakota, Sam realized her teasing of Dakota had come on a little strong, and had decided to make up for it by taking the girl under her wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sam loved beer, and many beers had accumulated around her generous middle, but Sam wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t one to get fucked up, especially now that she had a real job to do, and staying up all night sounded less fun. So she decided she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be the one to show Dakota the ropes, how to pace yourself, how to prevent a hangover, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get fucked up around boys without a friend who you can get to watch you, that kind of thing. It was kind of sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sweet was boring to Piper though. While everyone else was settling into a relaxing evening on the beach, feeling a mellow vibe, Piper was feeling restless. For fucks sake, Jay had even taken out his guitar and started playing low-intensity hipster songs, and no one told him to put it away. She had to do something about this. She had to take some steps to liven things up. She started by grabbing a beer, twisting the cap off, and chugging the whole thing in one go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cMatt!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She said, a little louder then she intended. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to talk to you. Alone. Over in the dunes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Matt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face lit up. He had been waiting for something like this all evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009c<b><i>OoooOOOooooh</i></b>, Piper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Drunk!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zack called out his voice badly slurred. Everyone knew what that meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cShut up Zack, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m fine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Piper insisted. Realizing everyone was staring at her, she decided to move this along. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome on Matt, what are you waiting for?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She asked. With a roll of her eyes she headed out away from the group and into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Matt pranced up, delighted, sober and athletic, practically skipping his way to the dunes, turning around to make a fist pumping gesture at Zack and Jay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAw gawd, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not asking you to fuck me, jeez.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Piper said once they were out of the way. Not that Piper hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t thought about it. With a slender, surf-built physique, dark features, an easy cocky smile, and long, silky hair down to his waist, Matt was always an eye grabber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen why all the secrecy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Matt asked, his long face suddenly giving Piper sad puppydog eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis party sucks.

God, he was incorrigible. But that was what Piper was counting on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, I can get laid anytime. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure Dakota\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever been kissed. So like, try to make her feel special, huh?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cDakota is the one with the Butt right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cCan I hit on the one with the boobs too?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSam?

And I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really send out to schools outside of Texas, and I was forced to make this decision on short notice so...I just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what I should be doing. I guess I should start putting out applications so I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a big hole in my resume.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dakota Johnson, 18 years old, drunk at a beach party, talking to someone about her resume. Her reputation as a dork well deserved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, if you want, I got no problem hooking you up with a job. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a sweet girl, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re Piper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friend. And like...you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re responsible enough that we had to talk you into drinking tonight. So don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry about it, you want a job, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yours. You just take care of yourself, and have fun for now OK? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll turn out right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sam might have carefully cultivated a retro-rock party girl exterior, but she was one of the biggest softies in Daven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Port. Even when she was Piper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s age she never felt comfortable with the casual hookup, live like there was no tomorrow scene. She always just preferred the moments of real human connection. Besides, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like she came with any hopes of hooking up tonight. So she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d settle for helping Dakota out tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cHeeey, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re Dakota, right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Matt suddenly loomed into their view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cUm...yeah.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dakota said, surprised by the sudden attention. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re Matt, right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said, taking it slow. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m Zack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dakota looked over at their mutual acquaintance. He was surrounded by empty beer cans wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sure if Zack was conscious or not. Dakota looked back at Matt and bit her lip. Even in the darkness, she could make out the outline of his abdominal muscles. She was never any good at talking to guys. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo...what did Piper want to talk you about?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Inside her head, Dakota berated herself. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Perfect, bring up another, more attractive, girl, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s guaranteed to keep his interest.\u00e2\u0080\u0099<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell actually, Piper told me I should work up the courage to talk to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said, playing falsely modest. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI noticed you earlier, but you were kind of intimidating...\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At this point, Sam had enough, and went over to Piper, who was really the only person at this party she knew. Piper was sitting with her knees tucked close to her chest, watching Dakota and Matt flirt. Sam took a seat next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cCan you believe that guys routine?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She said, gesturing over Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSshhh, keep it down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Piper whispered, snatching at Sam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand so Dakota wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see they were talking about them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDakota\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new in town, and she feels like a total dork after everyone found out she hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t drank before so...I...kind of asked Matt to start hitting on her. You know, to make sure she has a nice night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sam looked over at Matt skeptically, but then saw Dakota blushing and giggling excitedly, and then Matt leaned forward for a kiss and...wow, those two were really going at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s...kind of sweet Piper.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sam admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAw, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just trying to show her what Daven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Port has to offer, you know?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI guess we do have beach hunks, huh.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009c...yeah.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Piper said wistfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sam looked around. Dakota and Matt were now going at it like...well, high-school students. The way Madi was fondling Zack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hair, Sam figured she had \u00e2\u0080\u0098made her selection\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and...someone should probably keep an eye on her to make sure she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything while Zack was passed out. And that just left Piper, Sam, and Jay, who was quickly realizing no one was listening to him play anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOK, girl talk Piper.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sam leaned in. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only a matter of time before Jay comes over here and tries to hook up with at least one of us so...I guess make your decision now if you want that. Because I'm not having any of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span></div></div>",

He grabbed some extra cans as he went knowing both he and Piper would work quite the sweat.  They moved away from the party and behind a nearby sand dune and soon were locked together in a lust filled embrace on the sand.  Jay popped the button on pipers jeans and with two fingers began to stroke her through her underwear causing her to moan. Piper did the same with his surf shorts grabbing his member she began to stroke it causing it to harden.  \"Ready to please your queen?\" she whispered seductively.  \"Ready my queen. ooh!\" he moaned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled off Jay and allowed her self the pleasure of seeing Jays cock rise out of his blue shorts as if from the sea itself.  Many inches long and good thickness with large head and veins twisting up its shaft was a marvel to behold every time Piper saw it felt like she did the first time.  With one movement Piper had removed the shorts and grey cotton underwear which  failed to imprisoned it.  Next she reached down with one hand and with her finger tips and began to massage the head causing its owner to moan and writhe a little in pleasure and lust.Piper grinned<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wiggled out of her jeans revealing her caramel colored legs with plush thighs topped by her impressive ass in its stretched black lace panties.  Jay couldn\u2019t help but admire even through the haze of lust clouding eyes and mind Piper's ass was the best.  \"Now then\" said Piper sternly breaking Jay's concentration.<br>\r\nShe stood up using her foot to pleasure Jay causing him to moan and submit to his queen.  \"Who is queen in Daven port?\" She asked almost angrily  Jay replied \"you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good\" she said the seductive tone returning to her voice she stood and made show of running her hand through her black hair before she turned around to show of her fat ass as she removed her under wear.  Piper tossed the lace panties and began ascended her throne.<br>\r\nShe mounted Jay's face she reached down and grabbed began stroke the his long shaft whilst using her soft yet powerful thighs she squeezed and commanded \"eat.\"  Jay did as he was told and soon waves of pleasure began to overtake both queen and subject.  Deciding through her moans and squeals that her subject needed pleasuring she looked his monster cock.  She bent down and began to use her mouth and tongue to tease and pleasure licking the head and taking it all down the black fur at its base.  Piper had enough experience not to choke as she did so and as her subject writhed in pleasure underneath her she squeezed his balls and leaning back she watched as Jay erupted. Daven ports queen squealed in delight as Jay's load hit the sand and soon screamed in an earth shattering orgasm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper removed herself from Jays face grabbed two beers and tossed one to jay as he gasped for air she broke the seal and chugged to ease her parched throat and chucked the empty can.  Jay Barely had time to half down his drink before piper had un zipped his hoodie and was using her nails to rip open his t-shirt revealing his tanned muscled torso with its sun bleached hair.  Piper began to plant kisses down six pack and happy trail.  When she reached his dick she plated kisses along his shaft like she was blessing it.  She grabbed Jays ankles and pushed his legs up into her favourite position the amazon.<br>\r\nNow she mounted him again his ankles resting on her big hips she removed her 21 pilots t-shirt and bra allowing her girls to be free the sea breeze causing her nipples to harden.  Piper began to thrust with her powerful hips she has in control she was queen and Jay her loyal servant.  Once she got a rhythm going she leant forward so she feel her tubby caramel belly against Jays perfect abs as he squeezed her ass causing her to gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour they were both spent Piper stood up her legs shaking her tits sore but she was in a state of post orgasmic bliss she ran her hands through Jay's sun bleached hair and kissed him as his eye began to uncross.  They both began to retrieve their clothes and dust off making themselves look presentable.  A loud gurgle broke the silence.  \"Sorry\" said Jay I think that was me. A second louder gurgle sounded \"That was me\" replied Piper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food?\" Jay suggested<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should rejoin the others\" replied Piper<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She grabbed her by the lapels of her leather jacket and forced her down into the sand, then she used her firm grip to pull Sam up and into her as she kissed her hard on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009c<i>Ooooooooooh</i>, Piper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Drunk!\u00e2\u0080\u009d One of the guys called out from somewhere in the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sam resisted, but only for a moment, then she was attacking Piper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body with equal passion, her hands  finding their way under Piper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shirt, her fingers exploring the gentle curves and crevices of Piper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arcing back, as the Armenian girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hips thrust against her. Eventually, her hands made their way down to Piper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thick rump, and squeezed it as hard as she could, her strong hands digging deep dimples in Piper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s buttflesh, while Piper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand reaches up to stroke Sam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cheeks and pull her face closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Meanwhile, Matt turned his attention away from Dakota as he strained and stretched his neck to try and get a better look at two of the bustiest girls in Daven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Port mashing their chests together widly. Dakota scoffed and rolled her eyes. Of course Piper was stealing the show from her, again. And just when she met a nice guy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople are staring.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sam whispered.

The fire was dying down and nobody wanted to rebuild it. Dakota and Matt had run off to get some privacy. Jay had fallen asleep, and Zack was completely passed out. Madi clung to him for warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shivering, Sam finally pulled away from the embrace to take her jacket off, and give it to Piper. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere, warm up.

It actually caught her by surprise. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a kiss of passion, of drunken fooling around, it was kind of...sweet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Together the two rounded up all their companions into the van, and started giving everyone a ride home, except for Jay, who only lived a few blocks away.They sat in the front seat while they brought everyone else home. They decided to drop off Madi first because well\u00e2\u0080\u00a6<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you SURE you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t what Zack staying at my place?

That shut her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Actually taking care of Zack was a bit more difficult. It took Matt and Sam working together to haul Zack up to the front of his house. They dropped him like a rock there on his porch and rang the doorbell a few times, figuring they could let his sisters deal with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Next to go was Dakota, who was practically his next door neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t <i>have</i> to go back to your place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Matt teased her, nipping at her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do, my parents would kill me!

They dropped him off at the bustling (by Daven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Port\u00e2\u0080\u0099s standards) apartment complex, where he lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And then it was just Piper and Sam in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Relaxing finally, Piper snuggled up against Sam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulder.

Considering she was part of the same social circle, they were totally cutting her out of the conversation. They didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even say \u00e2\u0080\u0098hi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to her! So she just angrily stuffed all four donuts into little bits of wax paper, and set them on plates, and went about filling up their calorie bomb beverages, while those argued, and she fumed at them silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSam said that I should pace myself, especially since it was my first time drinking.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cPfft, who cares what Sam thinks?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dakota was a little shocked.

She tilted the cup back at Madi. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still some room in here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoes it really matter, Piper?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Madi sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI paid for a large, I expect a large.

She always was a little nervous having Piper around Zack...and she knew maybe her <i>sleight</i> weight issue was responsible for Zack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lack of enthusiasm for a relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry about that Piper. Hey, to make it up for you, I brought you some of the uglies from in back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She said, with a the widest smile she could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cUglies?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Piper asked, prying open the lid to peer inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know, donuts that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite have the right shape?\u00e2\u0080\u009d There were donuts that were lumps with no hole, ones split in half, one with extra bits of dough glomped on\u00e2\u0080\u00a6<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh fuck yeah.

I could see the sun coming up from my apartment.\u201d Sam might be too tired to function, but she was never too tired to complain to a good audience. She took a deep, powerful swig of coffee to enliven her. \u201cAnd unlike you guys, well except for you obviously, Madi, I gotta get up in the morning and go to my job. Open up the theater before everyone decides to take the day off. You know how that is, Madi.\u201d Sam said, touching her arm gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUh, yeah sure.\u201d Madi said, not knowing how it is, at all. \u201cAnyway, that\u2019ll be $2.63.\u201d She said, eager to catch Sam who looked ready to dash off. While Madi was talking, which Sam found far less interesting than her own talking, she eyed Piper sitting in the corner, eating donuts. While she signed the little receipt she gave Sam to sign, Madi continued to try at small talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, I uh....I thought you wanted me to serve you bacon egg and cheese on a donut...I guess I could make that.\" Madi pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, don't ever do that honey, you'd have to roll me outta here.\" Sam told her, handing back the receipt<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Madi gave a her nervous <i>'that's my fetish'</i> chuckle and smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sam gave her the same nervous laugh and smile back, only more nasally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Both of them were confused by what this exchange meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, goodbye.\" Sam said suddenly, running off with her coffee.

All there was to D\u2019s was one woman, a constant rotation of kitchen appliances, and a hand-picked group of trusted employees to work the counter and fry up the good stuff so she could get some sleep every once in a while. Madi happened to be one of those people\u2014albeit one still a bit on the fresh side. The piercing gaze of Daven\u2019s Port\u2019s own Colonel of Confection was enough to make Madi wish she\u2019d never brought the idea up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least not this early. Before the store opened. And before Mrs. Dunphy\u2019s coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-It\u2019s super simple, really.\u201d Madi smiled skittishly as she avoided making direct eye-contact with her boss, \u201cW-We just, um\u2026 use the ingredients that we already have in the store\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honesty, it had been that Sam woman\u2019s idea in the first place. Madi had just sort\u2019ve appropriated it. Which might not have been nice, but once she\u2019d tried it out for herself, Madi realized that it was a pretty solid addition to the breakfast menu! She\u2019d made sure to get it just right, too\u2014taste-testing it on her unrequited crush Zack whenever he swung by the restaurant\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd maybe just a little herself, too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper had been a big help! Always coming in with her perfect body and her freakishly giant chest. She thought she was so cool\u2026 well, <i>she\u2019d</i> helped invent a whole new kind of breakfast sandwich! Piper didn\u2019t even <i>have</i> a job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat boys saw in her, Madi might never know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it\u2019s, um\u2026 a two-donut special.\u201d Madi plucked two from the legally-distinct Hot-&amp;-Ready (ampersand, no n!) line that had cooled to an adequate temperature, \u201cI guess if you want, they could really be <i>any</i> donuts. Not just the glazed kind\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadi slid the eggs and bacon off of the griddle, and placed them on top of the bottom donut. It still glistened with sugar and glaze as grease dribbled down the sides. Then she peeled and put two slices of American cheddar from their packaging and onto the still-bubbling concoction. Finally, she crowned her creation with another glazed donut. She placed it on the grill\u2014cooking the sides of both donuts ever so slightly, as well as allowing them to press more tightly together\u2014and slid her sandwich onto a plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s um\u2026 a Bacon Egg and Cheese Donut Sandwich.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo exactly what it says on the label, then.\u201d D pursed her lips to the side slightly as she held it in both hands, \u201cMadi\u2026 I like you an\u2019 all, hun, but you can\u2019t just\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-Try it!\u201d Madi said more assertively, \u201cTrust me, it\u2019s\u2026 I think it\u2019s really good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst her better judgement, D took a big bite of what Madi had made her. She chewed slowly, lamenting what this amount of carbs and sugar and fat and greasy and literally all of the stuff she was supposed to stay away from at her age could do to her body with just one bite. She could practically <i>feel</i> her arteries clogging just by holding it in her mouth! But as Madi\u2019s creation danced along her tongue, and D\u2019s eyes got as big around as the donuts she sold, there was a distinct change in the kitchen that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the rest is, as they say, history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Breakwich (Two donuts, two eggs, two pieces of bacon, two cheese) had become an instant sensation across Daven\u2019s Port!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInsanely marketable and heavily customizable ingredients as far as the types of donuts and what you wanted inside the sandwich, the addition of this sandwich meant that D\u2019s donuts was met with more aplomb than had been felt in years! Though the heyday of the restaurant had never truly died down, being one of the best donut shops in town on top of being a local hotspot, Madi\u2019s innovation had completely revolutionized the menu!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh sure, you could still order regular old donuts. Or just a regular old breakfast plate. But three out of the four menuboards overhead were dedicated to showcasing the newest trend\u2014and it had become a very, <i>very</i> popular breakfast choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGimme the double-time.\u201d Piper was practically salivating as she watched the food dance on the menu above Madi\u2019s head, \u201cAnd a Mocha Frappuccino\u2014biggest one ya got!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course~\u201d Madi said in a sticky sweet tone of voice, \u201cAnything for my <i>favorite customer~</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeez Piper, you think you got enough food?\u201d Dakota asked after placing her own (comparatively) modest order, \u201cThat\u2019s like four donuts, four eggs, four pieces of bacon\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd four times the good, Dee.\u201d Piper interjected, \u201cTrust me\u2014I\u2019ll let you have a bite (<i>a bite</i>) of mine and you\u2019ll see what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m good, P.\u201d Dakota touched her stomach woefully, \u201cMatt\u2019s been taking me out a lot lately\u2026 I think I\u2019m starting to put on weight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore for me then!\u201d Piper licked her chops like a stray with a bone, \u201cDoes that mean you don\u2019t want your hasbrown? Because it comes with a hashbrown.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since the introduction of D\u2019s newest Delight, Piper had hardly eaten breakfast anywhere else! Why would she bother, when nothing at home could compare to the greasy goodness that was her newfound favorite food group? Madi was always so cool and let her use her employee discount too\u2014it paid to have friends in the food service industry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Madi, what\u2019s the holdup on that Frappe?\u201d Piper barked, \u201cI\u2019m falling asleep, here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing up, coming up.\u201d Madi answered hastily as she poured the calorific mixture into the cup, \u201cSandwich will be out soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMrph.\u201d Piper made a face, \u201cHey, was this made with whole milk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Madi blinked, \u201cNo? Do you want me to make it again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper put the cup down with a noticeable volume to it\u2014frustrated at having to delay her gratification even further than the span of time that had encompassed her first waking up to this very moment, a total of an hour and ten minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Mad\u2014\u201d Piper walked off with Dakota, \u201cYou\u2019re rad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA steady stream of air flew from Madi\u2019s nostrils as they flared in frustration. The busiest morning in Daven\u2019s Port, and Piper had to choose <i>now</i> to be a bitch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGonna have to roll her outta here.\u201d Madi bitched under her breath<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhole milk.\u201d She grumbled bitterly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Mad, you\u2019re rad.\u201d She mocked, flipping the sandwich on the griddle<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like forever, but was in fact only just a few more moments, Piper\u2019s breakfast of champions was ready. Dakota\u2019s too\u2014but Piper had already snagged the hashbrowns out of her bag. And stolen some of her coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm\u2014I could eat these things until I explode.\u201d Piper smacked her lips lovingly as she chewed an enormous bite<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep it up, and you just might\u2014\u201d Dakota cocked a judgmental eyebrow at Piper\u2019s waist, \u201cThose jeans are looking pretty tight, P.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s how all the cool kids are wearing them.\u201d Piper stuck her tongue out, \u201cNow come on\u2014I gotta get some cream cheese for this bitch.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sure she was in all the time, and sure, she ate like a pig. But when it came to the Breakwich, Piper\u2019s addiction was strictly second class. Because it was 5:55 AM, Madi was about to open, and someone was already outside, checking her watch impatiently to be let in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Madi knew she should make her wait, it would set a bad precedent if she opened five minutes early, because then she\u2019d be waiting out there at 5:50. Still, she felt a little bad making Sam wait out there, and it wasn\u2019t like she was doing anything, so she\u2019d let her in early, just this once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThanks Madi, yer a lifesaver. I\u2019ll just have the usual.\u201d Piper was a glutton who arrived for disgusting binges based on when she could mooch off of her mother, her best friend, or Madi herself, with droughts in between. Sam however was here like clockwork, always getting a Breakwich with cream cheese, no american cheese, no egg, Hashbrowns and a coffee 1 sugar, lots of cream every morning. Then sometimes, she\u2019d also arrive late at night, catching her before closing. Sam had never settled down to the tempo of easy southern living, and now, she had the commuter breakfast she always lived by before coming to Daven\u2019s Port.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Looking at Sam was like looking at Piper\u2019s future. They shared the same heavy hourglass shape, with Sam\u2019s belly sticking out a little further, while Pipers spread a little wider, But otherwise it was much the same. They even had similar skin tones. But when Piper put on ten pounds, Sam put on 15, and when Piper put on 20 pounds, Sam put on 30.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Maybe. Madi wasn\u2019t sure. It wasn\u2019t like she had weighed them (unfortunately, Madi would have had fun with that). And Sam\u2019s height definitely threw these guesses off, but Sam was definitely *fatter*. It helped that she had a head start over Piper in this department. Sam had wild curves that were exaggerated by a diet rich in pasta and meatball subs, but she\u2019d never looked *heavy* before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her neck was swaddled in an extra chin. Her arm fat had started filling up around her elbow, and while she always had a belly, now she had a big gut that stuck out in front of her, with no rolls or blemishes except for a belly cleft at the bottom. You could see the outline of her navel, even though she was dressed in sweats, clearly nothing else fit, and even that failed to cover the bottom of her paunch, and--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMadi.\u201d Sam snapped her fingers in her face. \u201cMy face is up here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHuh? I was just\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cStaring. I know, I\u2019m huge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat! No, I mean. It\u2019s not that bad!\u201d Madi scrambled for cover. What was wrong with her? She\u2019d never looked at another woman like that before. Was she so starved for cute chubby boys that she was that desperate?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t say it was bad, I just said I was huge.\u201d Sam said defiantly from behind a sip of coffee. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s your fault. I warned you about these things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cW-warned me?\u201d Madi tried to remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to roll me out of here, remember?\u201d Sam half-grumbled, snatching her sandwich bag and heading to her car. Madi was as red as a tomato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sam tossed the bag in her passenger seat. One of the perks of being up so early was that no one was around to see it if you fondled your gut while you ate breakfast in the car. Wow, that exchange with Madi was so hot. She\u2019d let that girl make her donuts and stare at her all day. There was one other reason Sam was ahead of Piper. Aside from lifestyle, and disposable income, Sam was totally getting off on this. She moaned with delight as she bit into the decadent sandwich, and felt the weight of her gut, knowing that this meal was going to be converted to even more weight soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She\u2019d stop when she got to 300 pounds. Probably. That seemed like a reasonable amount.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Especially since that was what the teenaged trio tended to do on any given day anyway. It was Summer in Daven's Port, and that meant that the city was more alive than ever. There were plenty of things to do and plenty of sights to see. New people coming in for the beach, shops and stands unveiling their newest tourist traps, and most importantly\u2014<i>food out the wazoo</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll across town, but especially in the pier and surrounding areas, local food vendors always went all out when Summer time came 'round. Ice cream trucks slashed their prices, cotton candy stands offered extra curly wigs for no extra charge, and grills could be heard sizzling all around. The salty air of the sea carried the smell of burgers, hot dogs, and even the sweet tangy scent of the Barbecue Hut. Everyone from Bongo's Burger Shack to House of Wings was crazy about peddling out free samples to wrangle in customers, and Piper was just the sort of girl to know how and where all the best spots in town were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god... so full...\" Zack groaned as he leaned against the warm brick of an old building downtown, \"I think I'm gonna spew...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more...\" Dakota cradled her full belly with one hand, the rim of her mouth sticky with cotton candy, \"No more free samples...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe afternoon sun hung low against the horizon as Piper led her feeble-kneed friends up the road and into downtown. Piper had led them on a crusade against common sense, and had insisted on hitting every stop in Daven's Port there was to hit. Starting with the sliders from the burger shack, then onto the big blue \"ocean-side extravagance\" cotton candy cones, then trying a free sample of every flavor at Carly's Creamery, and on and on and on. Around the time they'd stuffed down a few boneless bites, (in flavors ranging from honey-mustard to New York Mild) from House of Wings, Dakota and Zack were looking a little green around the gills. Their eating escapades had only been broken up by mild interference of kitschy tourist shops, but even Zack didn't mind going into Porter's Apparel so long as it meant he didn't have to eat another <i>something</i> for the next fifteen minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, guys.\" Piper trudged forward, hardly worse for wear, \"It's only a little further!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhereas Zack and Dakota had found it harder and harder to move with every approaching stand, shop, or stall, Piper seemed unencumbered by the bloated food-baby she was carrying around. The distended pooch of her gut looked uncomfortably full\u2014for all that Zack and Dakota had eaten, Piper had easily led the charge. She was a little sweaty after having spent all day out in the sun, her long black hair starting to frizz, but that was about it. The fact that she <i>wasn't</i> doubled over in gastronomic agony was what worried her friends; she was just going to make them eat more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper's insistence on taking advantage of <i>every</i> free food giveaway on the east side of town meant {i]every stop had to be made. They'd strategically made their way up and down the pier, through the beach, and into the city. She had promised that this would be the last one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteak n Shake was giving away free small milkshakes for another hour! Their all-day promotion was about to end, and Piper was going to be damned if she didn't get to wash her mighty meal down with a cool, refreshing strawberry milkshake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been saying that for <i>hours</i>.\" Zack moaned, \"I'm friggin' beat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been like fifteen minutes.\" Dakota cut her eyes in frustration at Zack, \"But I'm with Zack... can't we just go home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No way!\" Piper piped, despite the fact that even <i>she</i> was struggling with the slight incline of the street, \"I swear it's like... five more minutes, okay? Then we can be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota and Zack rolled their eyes and kicked off of their respective stopping spots, making mental notes to never let Piper decide what they would be doing for the day ever again. They had literally been eating all day; starting with D's and ending with Steak n Shake. How many thousands of calories had Piper made them ingest for her own amusement?! At least with all this walking there was no worries about burning them all off.... hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Piper was happy to lead them! Up the street, to the right, and then Steak n Shake was the first place on the right. Right next to that place that used to be the fancy Italian restaurant... what was it called? Papa's! It's right next to Papa's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm... come to think of it, was Papa's giving out free samples? She might have to check that out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she continued onward, leading her reluctant friends behind her, something caught Piper's eye. Something that, thankfully for Zack and Dakota, wasn't food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Zack asked, following Piper's line of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an old shop, standalone from the rest of the buildings. It had its own little lot and a cute little canopy over the glass door. On first glance it looked to be closed. However, Piper could clearly make out a faint light inside. Maybe they just used dim bulbs? The sign on the door said open...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abida's Eclectics, huh?\" Piper mused out loud...</span></div></div>",

He felt a little silly drawing to his trim middle, distended it was by the all day stuffing, so instead he flexed a bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper just rolled her eyes at him, and attempted to wedge herself into the booth at Steak N Shake. She found it a surprisingly tight squeeze in her 'delicate' condition, as her now exposed, olive belly bit into the lip of the table. \"Fine.\" Piper huffed. She opened the lid to her Styrofoam cup, and gave up on the straw, tossing back the rest of her milkshake in one gulp. \"You don't have to drink it, but how can you turn down free stuff? Go up and claim yours at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what, just throw it out? That seems wrong.\" Dakota said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You're getting fat again.\" Parker said bluntly, poking Piper in her exposed belly pooch. She was right, she was getting fat, again. While everyone else in Daven's Port thought of Piper as a busty, shapely hourglass of a girl, Parker could never forget or let go of Piper's childhood. It was rough on all of them. Harper had to work full time to take care of them, and that left little time for cooking. Harper not infrequently resorted to picking up a Hot-N-Ready pizza from Little Ceasar's for $5 dollars and that would be dinner for the three of them. It didn't worry her that she'd split it between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were other problems too. Harper used fatty, sugary foods to cheer the girls up whenever needed. When they couldn't pay the electric bill and the AC shut off one summer, Harper brought home a cheap tub of ice cream. And because food insecurity loomed, she always encouraged the girls to clean their plates. It also didn't help that, even when times were good, Harper had a terrible ignorance of nutrition. Coke was cheaper than water, and better in her mind, so they drank it like water in the Black house. Even when little Piper got a little exercise playing a little Pee-Wee basketball (it was almost free, and no equipment to bring), Harper thought it was a good idea to feed Piper soda and chocolate bars before hand to give her plenty of energy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Harper wasn't the only one to blame. Parker grew up in this environment and never grew beyond pudgy, maybe it was her disposition, or maybe it was because she grew up with a little more stability before things fell completely apart, and knew better than Piper. And while Harper herself put on a few pounds after having the girls, it never got truly bad. But Piper was born into this, and took to it with gusto. She was matching Harper's meal sizes when she was in kindergarten. She loved to eat, and Harper saw nothing wrong with letting her, so she ate, and ate, and ate and...after a particularly fattening summer spent inside before the 6th grade, Piper weighed 250 pounds and was one of the fattest girls in her school. When her teacher called to inform Harper that Piper was too big to fit in the school's desk, it was like a bolt of lightning out of the blue to the overworked mother. She realized Piper didn't have a 'healthy' appetite. She was, in fact, totally unhealthy, so much so that she had trouble participating in gym class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper blamed herself, but did the right thing: She got some books from the library, learned a thing or two about nutrition her parents never taught her, made an effort to cook meals at home more, and go for walks with the girls, even if she was totally exhausted. Making friends with Zack helped get her more a lot more active. A growth spurt along with puberty helped shift the rest of the weight, and by High School, Piper had gone from being the fattest tubster in class, to an hourglass shaped early bloomer that introduced countless boys to the concept of boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a little weird to think that even this much taller, and even with her weight slipping, Piper still didn't weigh as much as she did when she was a kid. But here she was, sinking into the family couch, with her shirt riding up over her stomach, trying to watch TV and eat an ice cream sandwich as Parker poked her belly and started to bring out the old names. \"Is Porky Piper coming back?\" She sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitch fuck off, and grow out of middle school. It's pathetic.\" Piper growled, eating half the sandwich in one angry bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because we're not in middle school, doesn't mean you can go and get fat, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do whatever I want, Parker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're going to be fat again, can you at least do the truffle shuffle for me again?\" Parker snickered. By now, Parker's antics had gotten Harper's attention. The poofy haired matriarch came over and suddenly yanked on Parker's ear. \"Ow, ow, ow, ow! Mom, what the shit!?\" She squealed in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to act like you're in gradeschool, I'm going to treat you like you're in grade school. Leave your sister alone.\" Harper said in a clear, firm tone. She had brought another ice cream sandwich with her and handed it off to Piper. Without even thinking about it, she had grabbed one out of the freezer to console her daughter after that treatment. While Piper started on the next one, Harper rested a comforting hand on her shoulder. \"Piper is an adult now, and she can eat whatever she wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker just rolled her eyes and turned back to the phone, while Piper smiled smuggly at her.</span></div></div>",

OK, she definitely wasn't getting any thinner. Maybe it was time to actually check out the damage.  She gave her stomach a contemplative jiggle, and decided to quit being a bitch and hop on the scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slid it out from it's nook behind the toilet. <i>'Damn,'</i> she though<i>t 'this thing has seen better days.'</i> It had acquired through years of neglect, a coating of rust and grime.

She remembered how back in middle school, she used to get on this every Friday night, like clockwork. At first her mom had to make her, but then she delighted in the numbers going down nearly every week. When it first started, she didn't imagine how much she <i>could</i> lose.  When her mom started their diet, she thought maybe she'd dent her weight by 10 or 15 pounds. Piper honestly had no idea how much she <i>should</i> weigh at the time. Eventually, she got down to 115 pounds at her lowest less than half of what she weighed. She literally shed an extra tween off herself, made of pure blubber. 115 was the low point right before puberty really got going and she received a new set of weights on her chest, and grew a few inches, but she never complained about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at the scale with trepidation, biting at her lips. She was gonna do this. She had no clothes on, so there was no cheating! Last time she saw a doctor, he'd told her she weighed 145 pounds, and she hand't changed too much in the years since then. Well, except in these last few weeks...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped on the scale, and closed her eyes as  it spun. She knew it would jump in a lot of weird directions and play with her emotions so she just closed her eyes, took a deep breath and counted to ten. She opened them and looked down. 195 pounds. At first she thought, or hoped, it was still spinning and waited a second for it to change, but it stayed there, unerringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit, 195. She'd gained like, 50 pounds in like 2 months. Was that possible? She knew it wasn't possible to lose weight that fast, that's for damn sure. She side-eyed herself in the mirror and slapped her gut. If she started now, maybe she could lose this by the end of the year, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Fuck though...I really don't want to go on a diet again.' </i>She thought. She imagined what would happen if she didn't though, and puffed out her cheeks in the mirror, arced her back and puffed out her stomach as much as she could for a few seconds. Then she let it going with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange. While she should be upset, and most of her was terrified by this development, a small part of her was comforted by it. She was super self-conscious of her belly all the time now, and how it stuck out farther each and every day, but a piece of her...kind of missed it? It was like having an old friend back. Her belly had always been with her, made her feel better whenever she had some food to fill it with. There was a familiar weight to it that she hadn't realized she missed a little, like wearing her favorite pair of heavy boots. She stuck it out again, giving it an experimental rub. Her figure reminded her of her mothers, and for a moment she had a silly daydream that she was pregnant, and her belly would keep growing like this for 7 more months. It made her wonder how much her belly could fill up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly one way to find out. As she got dressed, a strange form of elation took over Piper, and suddenly, she couldn't give a fuck about her weight. She spent the whole evening seeing how much she could actually fit into her belly. She went out and spent her last dollar on snack and food, and retreated into the comfort of her own room. The results of her epic binge: And order of General Tso's chicken and rice, a jar of Pringles, a two liter of soda, a dozen donuts from D's, a jar of pickles she stole from the fridge, including the juice (she'd seen her mom do it and wanted to try), and six beers she stole from Parker. So when she staggered back into the bathroom at 2 AM, naked, she was a little drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut oh, how her belly looked in the mirror. Piper got a real thrill out of that. It was kind of incredible seeing a real, dramatic effect on her body in such a short period of time. It was probably a trick of her mind, but she thought she looked actually fatter. She rubbed her gut. She could use it, she felt a little sick. Her hand reached to her navel and she stuck a finger inside it. It felt good. She stuck her stomach out again, and her hand drifted lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight was fun. Piper couldn't think of a better way to end a great night like this then by going back to her room, masturbating, and falling asleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as Piper liked to think of herself as the odd duck out of the family, some things were just genetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of women in Piper's family were predisposed to be at least a little heavy. Most of them, granted, carried it in their chests. But some of them were a fair bit bigger than big the farther you went down the trunk of the Black family tree! And that meant that all of Piper's family, immediate and not, had at least <i>some</i> predisposition to gaining some weight. And in a house where livelihood was almost a foreign concept, that meant that there was plenty of laziness to go around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, it had affected Piper the most. She had put on more than fifty pounds in just two short months, having snacked her way back into a  muffin-top oozing over her jeans and a cute little double chin that bounced when she spoke. Her breasts were bigger than ever, and her kiester was getting bigger and rounder with every snack pack she stuffed between her lips. But she wasn't the only Black getting fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker, her sister, went out constantly. She could drink a fish under the table, binged on bar food regularly, and spent more time sleeping off hangovers than she did being a functioning member of society. It wasn't inconceivable that her metabolism would bottom out at about her age, either. Parker wasn't exactly the most active girl either, considering she spent her time at home on the couch, drinking Gatorade and snacking in front of the TV... was it too hard to imagine that Piper's bad eating habits might rub off on her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there's also her Mom. Being pregnant, with not much else to do, and already battling some crazy cravings, Harper could probably pick up a couple of Piper's pounds. Sort've like a reverse sympathy weight thing? Pregnancy was a mysterious thing. She had already gotten so big just by being pregnant with her next daughter. Maybe having her second oldest (and most responsible of her two!) going a little slack in the will and big in the belly would affect her similarly? Hey, you never know...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Harper laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's awful! But it's true!\" She leaned her head back in the chair and closed her eyes to relax. \"After all, I am eating for two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Right, eating for two.\" Piper said, eyeing her mother while she scarfed down another ice cream sandwich. Piper wasn't one to judge, especially in her current...bodily disposition, but by the looks of things Harper was eating for three or four or more. Pregnant bellies weren't supposed to jiggle. Pregnancy didn't give you an extra chin. And pregnancy certainly didn't give you a giant butt that overhung the sides of your chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Not that you needed to be pregnant for that kind of thing. Piper came down heavily into her own chair, causing it to creak and groan. Her own weight had continued to skyrocket, as the fat girl trapped inside Piper's sexy body came back with a vengeance. She knew she was teetering dangerously close to her all time high of 250, and she really hoped that it would stop soon. Not that she was doing anything to change her habits, mind you, just...she hoped it stopped somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At least now her weight was going to all the right places. Sure, her stomach hung over her lap, and her thighs rubbed together all the time, and her face was fuller, but good god, her boobs! Her boobs were the thing of legend. When she last got herself measured for a bra, they were a Q cup. A Q cup! Piper didn't even know they went that high!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And when her confidence was riding high, she knew she had a braggable butt. An instagram worthy butt even! She had a butt shelf you could balance a coke can on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But when her confidence wasn't so good, like now...she had a huge fat butt that dragged behind her, and couldn't even fit in chairs anymore. And it NEVER stopped jiggling. It was really, really distracting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"...You want to order a Pizza?\" Piper asked her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Absolutely.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When was the last time <i>you</i> went thirty minutes without eating.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cLike...two or three months ago, I guess?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And so, on and on it went, month after month. Piper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weight didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so much steadily climb as exploded outward. She was packing on 25 pounds or more a month, every month. The weight piled on so quickly that she had trouble keeping herself clothed, and had given up completely on keeping herself supplied with bras. What was the point spending 50 dollars or more on a bra that would fit for maybe a week?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After 6 months of this, it was clear; the fat girl hiding inside Piper Black hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just gotten out. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099d taken over, and she loved it. Her second chin was back, and was bringing a new friend along as a third began to blossom beneath it. Her shoulders were meaty, and her arms started forming a crease from all the building up fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Piper was kind of surprised just how much weight had gone to her chest. Last time she was this fat, she hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even hit puberty yet, so she kind of expected to be the same oversized potato shape she was when she was 12. It was different, but she kind of liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sometimes she would oggle herself in the mirror. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099d lift them up, hold them for the few seconds until her arms began to give way under the sheer weight of them, and let them fall and make a meaty slap against her stomach. Or she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d lean forward against the sink, and see just how much of the mirror frame was taken up by her immense cleavage. She knew not everyone liked her body, but she was always a little proud of her chest, a girl like Piper didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have too many things she could say were hers, things she could be proud of. And Piper was still proud of her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Proud of her chest, but comforted by the return of her stomach. It felt nice and comfortable around her middle. She felt solid, weighty...more important at this size. An even greater relief was the return of her appetite. Even at her thinnest, Piper was never a \u00e2\u0080\u0098light eater\u00e2\u0080\u0099, but now? She really <i>could</i> eat to her hearts content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A year ago, even if she set out to overindulge, it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take <i>too</i> long before her stomach started complaining, and she regretted her actions. Maybe a single pizza from Nitolli\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, or four cheeseburgers. Now she could down two or three pizzas, or a dozen big cheeseburgers, in one sitting, and ask for dessert. It was nice to be able to eat the amount that her brain really dreamed of eating, and she even liked the way that would make her friends\u00e2\u0080\u0099 eyes pop, as she reassured them that yes, she really wanted more, and that no, she probably wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t explode. At least not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Yes, Piper certainly had no regrets about her decision. Life in the fat lane was definitely, definitely for her, and there was no power on heaven or earth that could convince her otherwise. In fact things were almost perfect like this. <i>Almost</i> Perfect. She had one niggling problem to still work out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The idea that Piper hadn\u2019t had enough to eat was ludicrous. It shouldn\u2019t have been possible that, after a dozen donuts two bags of Big Burger and two pizzas from Nitolis Piper still had room for more. But yet here she was in the kitchen, in the dead of night, for what had to have counted as her fifth meal for the day, wishing that she had just a little bit more to snack on. Just to put her over the edge of \u201cfull.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her soft hands fell onto her central fleshy mass, Piper felt her inner organs struggle to churn through and process yet another big endeavor. That must have been a couple thousand calories in one sitting, and Piper had powered through like a champ; just like she had at breakfast, lunch, second lunch, and dinner. Her fat flesh gave to her suggestive kneading, flexing and swelling as she played with her big bronze-colored belly. It was so tight\u2014everything she\u2019d eaten had left it strung as taut as a harp string, but Piper was still itching for <i>more</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way I can still be hungry.\u201d Piper thought wryly to herself as she looked down, past her overripened melons, at her gurgling gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so <i>heavy</i>. So round. Piper had caught herself playing with it when she wasn\u2019t paying attention. She\u2019d lift up her belly fat with both hands and squeeze the lip of her tummy with open, outstretched fingers. That, or she\u2019d rest both hands on either side of her fluffy flanks and shake it from side to side. All that jelly jiggling from one direction to the other was so comforting\u2026 almost sensual in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do <i>you</i> think?\u201d Piper grabbed her gut by the sides and cut her eyes lovingly, \u201cDo we want cereal or ice cream?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not both?\u201d Piper\u2019s tummy answered in a much deeper voice as Piper puppeteered its response, \u201cIce cream <i>and</i> cereal!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like the way you think.\u201d Piper gave her belly an appreciative squeeze, \u201cYou\u2019re not <i>just</i> fun to love on\u2014you\u2019re pretty smart sometimes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith hungry eyes and smacking lips, Piper pressed her cumbersome gut against the fridge as she opened the freezer. Plunging one meaty arm inside, she returned to her seat victorious\u2014an entire carton of unopened chocolate ice cream and a half-eaten box of Lucky Charms were hers for the taking. Plunging straight into the carton, Piper got to work. Alternating spoonfuls of ice cream with spoonfuls of sugary cereal, she continued her binge for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a bad influence.\u201d Piper rolled her head back, dead weight in her chair as her engorged stomach surged far out in front of her, \u201cWhy do I let you talk me into such feats of gastronomy, tummy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ran a hand up and down the swollen circumference of her stomach, Piper\u2019s paunch roared in digestive difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you too.\u201d Piper said sleepily, \u201cJust gonna\u2026 close my eyes here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before the poor bloated babe was passed out, right there in the kitchen! She\u2019d sleep all night, contented and purring like a well-fed kitten. It wasn\u2019t until Hunter woke their mom up for her early-morning feeding that Piper would be woken up by her mother, who wasn\u2019t exactly happy with the mess that Piper had made... or the fact that she\u2019d eaten far more than her fair share of food, once again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, I\u2019ve had it\u2014\u201d Harper huffed early that morning, \u201cPiper, I hate to do this, but...\u201d</span></div></div>",

Her stomach was telling her it was time to stress eat. And these days, Piper and her belly were operating on the same wavelength. She reached up to snag the last box of cereal from the cupboard, causing her shirt to ride up so much that her tits nearly fell out. She tore open the lid and started shoveling fat fistfuls of the sugary cereal into her mouth. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like I have any savings or anything.

She was shaking. A lifetime of poverty had primed Piper to expect financial catastrophe around every corner. Harper stood up, much quicker and easier then the girl half her age, and wrapped her up in a hug. At least, as much of Piper as she could reach these days. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean that Piper.

After all, she hadn\u2019t really talked to Yanira or her big lovable boyfriend since her Mom had gotten pregnant. That had taken precedence over just about everything, making sure her Mom and baby Hunter were taken care of. Then there was all the eating she\u2019d been doing, putting up with Parker\u2026 it was hard to maintain lasting friendships when you didn\u2019t have ample time to keep up with all their wild parties!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, Hurley and Yanira were two of Piper\u2019s oldest friends\u2014they were a bit older than her, but they were the coolest. They would buy her beer, invite her to the sickest house parties\u2026 Yanira made the <i>best</i> tamales that Piper had ever tasted, and she made enough of them to fill up a big ol\u2019 house like Hurley. They always told her that if she ever needed a place to crash that she was always welcome! It may have been a bit early to call her mom\u2019s bluff, but Piper wasn\u2019t taking any chances\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Nira!\u201d Piper said into the phone, pushing the bag of Cool Ranch doritos to the side, \u201cNot much, how\u2019s you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou broke up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is that even\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no, you two were\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah I\u2019ll come over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beauty of it all was that Piper didn\u2019t have to ask if she could come over. That was going to be the hard part. Transitioning from \u201chey can I come over to hang out\u201d to \u201chey, hope you had fun because I literally don\u2019t want to leave.\u201d Piper liked to play the aloof mysterious girl for all that it was worth, but it would be hard when she was stress-eating whatever was in front of her, and pounding back beers like there were blank checks at the bottom of the cans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSqueezing herself into something halfway decent, Piper forced herself to go outside and board the bus. Nothing fit her anymore, not even the stuff she just got a few weeks ago. She looked like a punk-rock sardine, squished into an old Green Day t-shirt that had no hopes of holding up. A solid inch of olive-colored flab pushed out from underneath the hem, hanging free as it stretched the fabric of poor Billy Jo\u2019s arm until it looked as wide as one of Piper\u2019s. Her braless breasts were outlined clearly as they rested heavily on top of her gut. Her fat thighs and booming rear meant that her bus ride over was a lot more uncomfortable than she remembered\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling up at the Dauphin Towers, Piper pushed one pudgy finger into the doorbell and let it ring\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey P.\u201d was all that the whimpering Latina could manage to say, \u201cCome on in. I started lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYanira and Hurley\u2026 well, now just Yanira\u2026 lived in one of the worst apartment complexes in town. Hurley made good money, that was for sure. But between keeping him fed and their frequent party-throwing, they spent it as fast as they made it. Yanira apparently had a job somewhere, though Piper had never bothered to ask where. It somehow didn\u2019t seem as amusing as Hurley\u2019s job filling up vending machines for Yeng.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod this was awkward. Hurley and Yanira had been together since Piper was a kid\u2014they were her OTP! The best example of a couple that the young impressionable Piper Black could have! She was so sad to know that they weren\u2019t a thing anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve been eating well.\u201d Yanira said with a little laugh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Oh, yeah.\u201d Piper pat her gut\u2014a mixture of pride and embarrassment rushing through her\u2014\u201cGotta keep my bikini bod up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh.\u201d Yanira snort laughed, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I can\u2019t blame you.

Piper got up to follow her and watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYanira was a whiz in the kitchen, micromanaging and multitasking like a pro, and pretty soon tamales were starting to pile up. Piper watched excitedly as the pile grew,<br>\r\nAnd grew,<br>\r\nAnd grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hey Yanira... uh, don'tchu think this a bit much for just the two of us?

No! It's fine! Make as many as you want! We don't have to eat them all at once, right?\" Piper recovered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Yanira responded. Piper watched a second pile form and wondered just how much Hurley could put away, she knew he was a fatass but God damn this was a lot of food. Even with her expanded appetite she guessed she could eat off this for a few days. \"And done!\" Yanira said with a smile, \"Hu- Piper! Dig in! Tonight, we feast!\" Yanira said a little shakily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls dig in, putting away tamale after tamale at first, but started to slow down after a bit. They got through the first pile and both lay on the couch, near comatose, bellies bulging and gurgling from the volume of food they consumed. Yanira shifted and sat up, unbuttoned her jeans and sighed in relief, Piper was wearing leggings and just pushed the waistband under her belly. The girls looked at each other and shared a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know I could eat so much at once!\" Yanira said cheerily, rubbing her round stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you could either!\" Piper responded and the two laughed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Piper,\" Yanira became bit somber, \"I've missed cooking like this since Hurley left, and I'm really glad you encouraged me to do it, I had forgotten how much fun it was, and that I didn't need Hurley to have fun doing it.\" Yanira looked down at her belly, then over to the other tamales, \"even if it will all go straight to my culo.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Yan!\" Piper smiled at her, who knew eating could make you such a good friend? \"Hey, uh, do you mind if I crash here tonight? I really don't feel like moving after all that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing!\" Yanira responded, she looked over at Piper and saw how she say where Hurley used to, how she didn't even half way fill his impression on the cushions, \"And you can come over whenever to grab a bite to eat!\" Piper smiled at her, then looked over at the left over tamales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to figure out what to do with those.\"</span></div></div>",

They\u2019d helped shape her into the uber alternative, sometimes-into-heavy metal kinda girl that she was today! The fact that they weren\u2019t together was, to Piper, like saying that the color blue didn\u2019t exist anymore, or that air now came in liquid form. It had been hard, but\u2026 once she\u2019d heard the whole story, it became easier for her to accept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the longest time she\u2019d thought of them as couple goals\u2014but the ugly truth of it was that they were human just like everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appeared that, now, she was going to have to get used to them being just Hurley and Yanira, rather than\u2026 Hurley <i>and</i> Yanira. If that made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that the two of them were on speaking terms anyway. As Piper understood it, Hurley had fucked up something fierce and Yanira wanted nothing to do with him. Kicked his big ol\u2019 butt out the very same day she\u2019d found out about his bar babe on the side. Which was shocking because, even if Piper had (admittedly) idealized Hurley as a really stand-up kind of guy (she\u2019d had something of a crush on him when she was younger, for sure!) it just didn\u2019t seem practical for a man who weighed almost five hundred pounds to cheat on a hot piece of caramel-colored culo like Yanira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what <i>I</i> said.\u201d Yanira\u2019s accent got thicker as she became swept up in telling the tale once more, \u201cAfter everything I do for him\u2014cook for him, clean up after him, <i>wash his clothes</i> like I\u2019m just some\u2026 oof. Pipey, honey, you spilled.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper\u2019s face fattened before Yanira\u2019s eyes as she struggled to look down. The meat of her chins bunched unflatteringly as she tried to spot where she\u2019d spilled. Sure enough, a long red trail of ChiChi\u2019s dribbled down, down, <i>down</i> the momentous slope of her heavy right breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck.\u201d She grunted, dabbing at it with her hand, \u201cThat\u2019s gonna stain\u2014I <i>just</i> got this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it babe, I\u2019ll wash it for you.\u201d Yanira said dismissively as she lowered another helping of hand-rolled burritos in front of her dinner guest, \u201cAfter all, what are <i>roommates</i> for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>God</i> yes, thank you.\u201d Piper groaned, leaning back into the couch with no small amount of relief, \u201cI hate doing laundry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since Harper had given her daughter the eviction notice\u2014her daughter who, might she add, had been increasingly supportive and helped babysit <i>plenty</i> of times while Parker went out and partied!\u2014Piper had been finding more and more reasons not to be at home. If we were being honest, the exercise was probably good for her. Hoofing it around Daven\u2019s Port with Zack and Dakota was a lot more slower paced now that she\u2019d gone and doubled in size since last year, but it beat staying at home and feeling like she wasn\u2019t wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for most nights, Piper had been crashing with Yanira. Moving in with her had been the next logical step! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked for both of them in the best possible way\u2014Piper didn\u2019t have to put up with her mom, and Yanira didn\u2019t have to wonder about what she was doing most of the time. Yanira had a spare bedroom (it <i>used</i> to be Hurley's game room) and Piper needed a place to sleep! Instead of staying in and cooking for Hurley\u2026 she could stay in and cook for Piper!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t the change that <i>she</i> would have wanted, but\u2026 it helped fill the void that Hurley had left in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but surely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, take off your shirt.\u201d Yanira smiled as she wiggle-waddled away from the table, \u201cNo\u2026 here, hun, let me help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper\u2019s arms were far too fat, the muscles beneath her bingowings far too atrophied for her to hold them above her head for long. Added into her pathetic stamina, the sheer size of her chest, and the fact that she was wriggling around on a full stomach, and it was no wonder that Piper couldn\u2019t even undress herself. She was lazy, sleepy, and fat\u2014and the fact that she didn\u2019t have to get off of this couch for another night was music to her ears right about now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go.\u201d Yanira grunted as she folded Piper\u2019s flag-length tank top in her arms, \u201cFeel better?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper grunted thickly, running a hand along her (now exposed) gut as it domed between her legs. She shimmied the crotch of her leggings down, down, down until the bottom-most roll of belly blubber was completely on display. Giving her tanned tonnage a little scratch, Piper burped contentedly. She looked the very picture of comfort\u2014her belly rolled out, her chubby socked feet kicked up, and nestled in her favorite spot on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMuch.\u201d She burped, grabbing a burrito from the arm\u2019s reach that Yanira had placed them in, \u201cHey Nira\u2026 you sure you don\u2019t mind me hanging out here all the time? I feel kinda bad clogging up your evenings like a gas station toilet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye, you stop that.\u201d Yanira swat Piper\u2019s pillowy upperarm, \u201cYou\u2019re like family\u2014always welcome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever\u2014I mean, if you say so\u2026\u201d Piper\u2019s voice rumbled in her chins as she hunkered down, topless and muffin-topping over her legs from the belly-down<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYanira pet Piper\u2019s head approvingly as she sunk into her burrito bender. Her big butt bobbing behind her, the Hispanic homemaker made her way to the kitchen and opened the fridge. Piper\u2019s tank-top folded over one thick arm, Yanira stuck one into the Bud Light box that had she\u2019d bought. It was so silly, for her to keep buying this. Now that\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Pipey\u2014you want a beer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Piper blinked, \u201cI mean\u2026 sure, okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYanira brought two to split and hunkered down next to her guest and one of her oldest friends. It felt so strange, having so much room on the couch. With Hurley, she\u2019d have to keep her legs closed so tight she felt like she\u2019d pop out of her jeans! Lord help her if that hog would man-spread\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you go, babe.\u201d Yanira smiled as Piper wrapped her lips around the bottleneck, \u201cAnything else I can get you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean\u2026 maybe a shirt?\u201d Piper frowned, shrugging her impossibly heavy shoulders, \u201cMy taters are just fucking hanging out here, y\u2019know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, right\u2026\u201d Yanira clicked her tongue as she rolled to a standing position, \u201cI think I have something that might fit you, actually\u2026 wait here.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She\u2019d never have thought to actually <i>do</i> it, but with how things were at home these days\u2026 she didn\u2019t have much of a choice. She might have been a little sore about it. But at least she had a place to go, and had an awesome roommate like Yanira!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go Pipey\u2014lunchtime~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper glanced away from her phone, letting it slide down her side and onto the couch as Yanira lowered a veritable spread of authentic Mexican cuisine in front of her on one of those TV trays she\u2019d always thought were super trashy. It was so convenient not to live in a house where, of all the things, eating <i>at the table</i> wasn\u2019t one of the last vestiges of civilization.

She\u2019d have plenty to dress her black beans and homemade nachos with, but she wasn\u2019t going to wait another moment for a bite of Yanira\u2019s tamales. She opened her mouth wide and bit deep into the first of what was about three piled in a neat little pile on her plate, cheese and filling dribbling down her chin and plopping on her olive brown canopy of cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye, <i>cerdita</i>, you could have waited.\u201d Yanira said with a playful swat of her roommate\u2019s arm, one that wiggled and wobbled around a bit in her ample upper-arm chub before finally settling back into place, \u201cThere\u2019s plenty more, so don\u2019t think you have to choke it down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not choking anything down\u2014I\u2019m <i>appreciating</i> every bite.\u201d Piper took an exaggeratedly slow, tiny bite of her tamale and rubbed circles into her soft stomach as it bulged out from underneath her shirt, \u201cMmmm? See?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever, smartass.\u201d Yanira rolled her eyes as she plopped a dollop of sour cr\u00e8me on Piper\u2019s plate, next to her beans, \u201cDo you want me to get you something to drink?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes please.\u201d Piper ran her half-eaten tamale through the creamy white goo, \u201cCoke if we have it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow \u2018bout a beer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re contributing to the delinquency\u2014*HURP*\u2014of a minor and I like it.\u201d Piper rolled her head back eagerly as she watched Yanira waddle back into the kitchen, \u201cIt\u2019s God\u2019s work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s two.\u201d Yanira finally said, taking a longneck for herself as she nestled down in the space next to her roommate, \u201cNow go slow\u2014I know you\u2019re a lightweight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper chuckled thickly at that.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Piper kept staring at the empty Dee's Donuts box for a few seconds before a bulb lightened up in her head and a big smile appeared on her face: she could work at d's donuts, that meant she had a job and a constant access at food, two birds with a stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper didn't lose time, she changed clothes, realizing the new ones have gotten tight again, and went to d's donuts. She needed a job but, more importantly, she was also craving for donuts. <br>\r\nWith relief, Piper found a girl with long black hair and a round belly: she was Madi Pines, who Piper had known for years. However, while Piper had always been friendly with Madi, the latter didn't reciprocate much, mostly because she was jealous that Zack could have a crush on Piper, but the olive-skinned beauty was oblivious to this. Only recently Madi had actually gotten friendly with Piper after seeing her getting fatter and fatter, even fatter than the already chunky Madi, which meant that Zack couldn't have found Piper attractive anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Piper, \" greeted Madi with a smile, \"do you want the usual 24 donuts box?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper was winded after that long \"run\" and leaned to a wall to rest and catch her breath. \"Yes...\" she puffed. \"And... I need your help\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\" replied Madi suspicious before handing her a colorful box. \"What do you need?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to work here\" said, much to Madi's surprise. \"Can you help me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadi scratched the back of her head. \"I don't know, I can try to talk with the boss but...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, I'm in desperate need of a job\" insisted Piper making puppy eyes which, along with her round cheeks, it made her look like an overgrown hamster. The similarities only became more evident after she shoved two donuts in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'll go call the boss\" replied Madi disappearing in a door behind the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding a job was much easier than expected. Madi's boss was open with hiring a new employee and didn't even bother to see Piper, they probably thought it was a job anyone could afford. The only hard part was to find a uniform that fit Piper, in the end she could only wear the largest one and even that left more cleavage exposed than what it was supposed to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper was enthusiastic to hear that her daughter has found a job in such a short time and opted to celebrate preparing her a little feast (\"just this time\" she pointed out) using what was left from Piper's last assault to the fridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom is so proud of you\" said with a sugary voice while spilling bacon in Piper's plate. \"If I had known all you needed was me to raise the voice to convince you to get a job, I would've done it much earlier\" added while pinching her daughter's flabby cheek. \"Too bad someone else doesn't have the same resolution and is still unemployed\" said with an inquisitory look at her other daughter, which at the moment was laying on the couch. Parker simply shrugged it off and kept watching the tv. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper informed her friends too, Dakota and Zack, but they weren't as enthusiastic as her mother, probably because they guessed what it meant for Piper having a job in which she was constantly surrounded by donuts... And they were right... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here! Two chocolate cream and two jelly donut\" huffed Piper giving a box to a customer. Then she turned around, grabbed a large donut wrapped in a napkin and handed to the next customer in line. <br>\r\n\"Here's your Homer Simpson special\" said with a drop of saliva flowing on her lips. She cleaned her mouth with her flabby forearm and waved the customer. \"Enjoy your meal\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the last customer, at least for a while, hoped Piper. The work wasn't exausting, but handling all these donuts without taking a single bite required a lot of willpower which needed to be satiated, in more ways than one. She sat on a chair, which creaked under her weight, and lifted her uniform to let her caramel colored belly free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem doing fine for having begun just last week\" said Madi, who had just finished serving the customers as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper nodded, making her chins quiver. <br>\r\nMadi leaned toward Piper and handed her a box of six donuts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got your favorites!\" said the smaller of the two with a cat-smile. \"Be quick, in case new customers arrive\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper thanked her colleague and gobbled down the donuts in a minute. With one hand she shoved them in her mouth, while with the other she massaged her belly. The tastes of the cream and the sprinkles brought her in ecstasy. These donuts were soo good, why didn't she applied for the job first? <br>\r\nThanks to her job, she had free access to all the donuts she wanted, as long as she was always ready to serve the clients, and Madi was nice enough to pass her all the donuts she wanted, so the fat girl spent most of her breaks on that chair, whose legs were becoming more and more twisted, and asking her colleague to pass her the donuts she wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I have another box? Possibly with some vanilla cream ones, please\" asked Piper in her husky voice, and Madi handed a box of twelve donuts in Piper's pudgy hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" said with a mouth already full and cream dripping from her lips. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Piper, I don't think this job is the right thing for you\" blurted Dakota, leaning on the booth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you come here to eat some donuts or just to act like you're my mom?\" replied Piper with a roll of her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you begin your work here because you wanted a job or to eat some donuts?\" said sour Dakota by raising a brow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper caught the irony in her friend's reply. \"Pick a donut or leave. What I eat it's not your business\" hissed with her husky voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota gave up. \"Gimme one with chocolate cream\" said with a sigh of defeat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper picked up two donuts, gave one to Dakota and ate the other one. That treats brought the hefty girl in a good mood again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Piper told her the news of the new job, Dakota was alarmed. Her friend had already tripled her weight in less than a year because of her gluttony but now that Piper was working at d's donuts, she immediately feared the possible results. And her fears were right, after a month since she begin her job, Piper had only gotten bigger. Her uniform didn't fit anymore, to the point they had to order a custom made one, when she was taking orders, her belly was always pressed against the counter and that's not talking about her breasts, each of which was almost as large as her head and prevented the girl to see her toes, with only the belly being visible behind them. Dakota could see that her friend was also having more troubles walking around because of her cumbersome weight: her muscles couldn't keep her standing for much time anymore and she constantly bumped things whenever she moved.<br>\r\nPiper was nothing short of huge and, if she didn't cut back, she would've passed the 400 pounds mark in a few weeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince there were no more customers, Piper sat on a couple of chairs. She began using two chairs after breaking one the week before, and realized it was actually much more comfortable for her buttcheeks, which have become too wide to stay on a single chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madi,\" panted Piper, \"some donuts, please. One big boxe with two hazelnut flavored, three with sprinkles, a couple with vanilla cream, four jelly donuts, three chocolate cream and choose you for the rest\" asked while Madi prepared her 24 donuts box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Madi had put on her fair share of pounds but was still more than a hundred pound lighter than the Piper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piper, there are some new customers!\" Yelled Madi while going near the serving booth, with a donut still in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper gulped in a hurry the few remaining donuts. \"Dammit, not even five minutes of break!\" esclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a bit for the obese girl to heave her body from the chairs and get to the booth, where four people were already waiting in line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to dee's donuts, how can I serve you?\" asked between breathes, her lips stained with cream and jelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back home, the first thing Piper did was waddle to the kitchen and raid the fridge. Her belly pressed against the cold surface, but she had gotten used to it. <br>\r\nDespite eating donuts for most of the time at work, Piper ate just as much at home, she had to balance all the sweets she ate, after all. But thus time Piper brought home some money (excluding the ones she spent in even more food) so it didn't bother Harper. The birth of her last daughter, hunter, probably helped in mellowing Harper down as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, fatass\" greeted Harper coming in the kitchen and poking Piper's exposed back flesh. Her sister replied with a grunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another hard day of work today?\" asked with sneer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At leasht I hafe a job\" replied Piper with a full mouth before going to the living room. Parker's comment left her a sour taste in her mouth and ruined her appetite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the couch, she found Harper with Hunter sleeping in her arms. Piper gently fondled her little sister's forehead with her pudgy finger. Then she squeezed in the armchair and turned on the tv, keeping a volume at minimum. Too bad ten minutes later her stomach rumbled and woke up Hunter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper gave Piper a nasty look while she tried to comfort baby Hunter. Her super sized daughter's cheeks became red  for the embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I need some appetizer\" commented Piper to herself while grabbing part of her gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper strived to wear her new uniform. It was large enough two women could've worn it at the same time, but a small slice of olive-skinned fat still leaked under it while the neck could barely cover half of her cleavage. That didn't bother the obese girl, who had gotten used with wearing unfitting clothes, especially because flinging ones that fitted her huge frame was becoming almost impossible without relying on online orders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piper, you ready?\" called Madi. \"Customers are here! I can't handle all of them\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"coming\" huffed Piper behind the backdoor before grabbing a donut for the stock. She needed energy to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day was a very busy one. It was Saturday and there were much more customers than usual. Until Piper was face to face with a Texan girl with brown hair: Dakota. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper puffed and anticipated her: \"I have work to do so, unless you want some don...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take a six donuts box, put whatever kind you prefer\" said quickly Dakota, then she leaned closer to her friend. \"And I'm asking if you's want to meet with me at Brent Brother's for dinner, after work\" and winked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper was surprised, but the idea of spending some time with Dakota was tempting, especially if it involved pizza, and she was particularly hungry after a day with so few donuts breaks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm finish my job in two hours, see you there\" said while handing the box to Dakota. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette smiled. \"Cool! See you later then, don't be late\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper came late, she stopped to take a milkshake (a last snack before dinner) and her waddle had become much slower. Dakota was waiting for her in front of the entrance and recognized Piper's large frame from afar. The texan girl wasn't bothered by her friend's delay as much as her state after all that walk: all sweaty and panting, she appeared to be on the verge of collapsing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi! Shall we take a table? I'm tired of standing up\" said Piper, confirming Dakota's worries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading through the menu brought Piper's energy back, her eyes gazed through the list of pizzas available and in the end opted with two pizzas with extra cheese and butter and one with sausages and chips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota decided to not bring immediately the elephant in the room and asked: \"So, how's work doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty great!\" replied Piper with enthusiasm. \"The pay is good, all I have to do is ask order and give donuts, and I get to eat donuts whenever I want and for free\" said while patting her belly, which rippled like a sea of fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you like your job!\" said Dakota, who didn't have the slightest doubts about it. \"Mine is going good as well, I've just recently received a salary raise\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you get paid more?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota nooded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I wish I receive one too\" exclaimed Piper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two chatted for a while. Piper seemed the same as usual, only 300+ pounds heavier and a bit more dedicated toward food. When their pizzas arrived, Dakota decided it was time to tackle that topic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, about your job, do you think it's good for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper raised her eyes, surprised. \"What do you mean? Of course it does, it prevents me from being kicked out of house and gives me more food\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, exactly, I'm not sure more food is good for you\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper frowned and shoved a slice of pizza in her mouth. \"Why wouldn't? Eating makes me happy\" said with decisize tone, hoping to close the arguments just as it began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Dakota didn't want to close it. \"I see that you're happy, but you're eating a lot of it and... It's making you quite... Fat\" said the last word with an apologetic tone, however, she then began to speak louder, as if that word opened a flood. \"And I don't mean just 'a few pounds', Pip, you're huge!\" and pressed a finger in Piper's belly, part of which was laying on the table. \"You're even using two chairs, for crying out loud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm fat, so what?\" blurted Piper, grabbing an handful of her fat. \"It's not a problem to me, I kind of like it sometimes. The only thing I don't like about it is when the others call me 'fatso' or other slurs, otherwise, it's OK to me to get some pudge if it means eating what I want\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota was speechless, her mouth open but without any word coming out of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, if you don't mind, \" said grabbing the menu with her fat hands, \"I'm getting another pizza\".</span></div></div>",

But I just gave you one with 24 donuts couple of minutes ago!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know\" said Piper who was sitting at her usual corner behind the booth. Around her laid empty donuts boxes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadi rolled her eyes. \"Fiiine\" said annoyed and placed two other boxes with 24 donuts on Piper's belly, hoping it would keep Piper busy for enough time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madi, can I have the Homer Simpson special? And phernaps another box?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you eat five boxes this morning?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper squished her belly. \"I know, but I'm still hungry\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadi threw a donut almost as large as a tire and a large box of donuts, both landed on Piper's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmh, it's break time\" said Piper after noticing there was no more customers, and for her break time was synonymous with \"eating all the donuts she wanted\". As she turned around, which required more time with her expanding girth, Madi moved her two chairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what are you doing? It's too far!\" whined Piper, until she realized Madi put them next to a stock of donuts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadi crossed her arms. \"This way you can eat whatever you want without my help\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper stopped to hear at \"eat whatever you want\" before she stretched her ham-sized arm to catch the donuts. She wasn't very picky, as long as she could reach it without getting up, it was fine. Cream, chocolate, hazelnut, jelly, jam, with sprinkles, it was all delicious. It was heaven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil she got fired. <br>\r\nWhile employees had free access to all the donuts they wanted, that rule was decided with the logical idea that noone would it more than a dozen donuts per day, but Piper's appetite didn't follow that logic and she ate a dozen donuts in a couple of minutes. At first, it didn't seem that bad but, as her appetite increased, it reached a point where more donuts ended up in Piper's stomach than in the Customers' ones. It didn't help that Piper was becoming expensive in other ways too, such as her uniforms, which had to be custom ordered and didn't last more than two weeks before she outgrew them, or the furniture, which was having more troubles with Piper's increasing weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was only natural that she got fired.<br>\r\nPiper tried to plead her boss, convince Madi to help her get the job back, but the boss was unshakable while Madi was perfectly fine without Piper demanding for food every break. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Piper went back home, defeated. Though not before ordering a couple of double burgers, she needed something to console her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she entered home, Harper recognized Piper's footsteps, along with the bumps against the furniture whenever she moved around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piper! You're home early!\" exclaimed her mother from the bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper didn't reply, she preferred to avoid her mother, knowing what her reaction would be once she learned the truth. She lumbered into the kitchen and grabbed a carton of chocolate ice cream, proceeding to empty it, quickly followed by another one, usually Piper stopped at one carton per day but she needed something to fill the void left by the donuts she couldn't eat, besides, she feared her mother might forbid her to eat this, or the Black family household would've quickly ran out of food anyway. Piper even wanted a third carton, but there was no more ice cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will do\" said grabbing some biscuits from the sideboards. After an hour, Piper had eaten almost everything that was in the kitchen. Empty packages and crumbs laid all around her, while she sat as close to the table as her stuffed belly allowed her. With the fear of her mother cutting down her meals and snacks if not, God forbid, putting her on a diet, Piper ate anything she could find, as if it was her last meal. <br>\r\nShe massaged her belly, so full the shirt could cover only a third of it, and could swear to have heard the seam of her pants splitting up. Her hands went up, reaching her boobs. Sure, she might have become quite fat, but she also had an enviable rack, thought Piper. <br>\r\nDespite eating almost all of the food in the house, Piper was sure her stomach still had some free space, and looked for what was left, finding a few bags of chips. <br>\r\n\"Better than nothing\" said Piper. \"I guess for you is fine, isn't it?\" asked to her belly, giving it a squeeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time she opted to go in the living room, even if she had to walk more, she could've rested on the couch, which was much more comfortable than two chairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, however, Harper bursted in the living room, where she found her massive daughter squashing the couch and munching the last handful of chips left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something wrong?\" asked Harper loudly. Her arms crossed and a vein on her forehead ready to pop. Not hearing Piper's answer to her question of why did she come home earlier was suspicious enough, but then she heard munching sound for almost two hours while she was breastfeeding Hunter, which further raised the suspects. When found the kitchen in a terrible state, with barely any scraps of food left, Harper understood everything. Now all she needed was for Piper to confirm her suspects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper knew her time was come, she was prepared for it, so she slowly turned her eyes and said: \"I lost my job\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You what?\" asked Harper, her face bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got fired, no more job\" replied Piper  nonchalantly, while shoving the last chips in her mouth. Crumbs rolled on her triple chin to end in her massive cleavage. She waited for her mother's rage burst, which took a few seconds to come, probably because she had to contain some of her rage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB ANYMORE?!\" yelled Harper. Her voice was heard in all of the Black's house and probably in some neighboring houses as well. Harper kept yelling for a good ten minutes, while Piper simply endured it, it's not that she could have left the living room. Even Parker left the bedroom to hear more closer what Harper was screaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, her rage was pretty justified, Piper's appetite was already unsustainable before working at d's donuts but in a few months it became absurd, there was no way Harper could have afforded to feed Piper, at least enough to satisfy her. And that's not counting how Piper gained around 100 pounds to her already impressive weight, which meant she was becoming too large to move around in the small Black household and too heavy for the furniture. Her bed was already squashed to the side where she slept. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that something had to be done, otherwise Piper would've eaten everyone out of home... </span></div></div>",

Harper had to work harder to get enough money to live while Parker had to take care of both her sisters, with the case of the older one, she had to make sure Piper didn't leave the rest of the family without something to eat, and had to endure her obese sister's whines of how hungry she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy hearing her gripes, one could've thought Piper was starving, instead she was eating enough for an entire family and was just as large as ever! Heck, Parker could've sworn she was still gaining weight, just last day Piper's bed gave up and collapsed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, Harper came back home. Parker was entertaining baby Hunter by shaking the keys in front of her, while Piper was in the kitchen eating some biscuits. Her belly heaved in two by the table surface, her fat pouring out of the sides of the two chairs she was using. It was not unusual to see Piper eat, not more unusual than hearing Harper yelling at her daughter in the hopes she changed her attitude, but it seemed that Piper's fat bounced off every single word that came out from Harper's mouth. <br>\r\nHowever, some words reached Parker's ears, and that day a single line went up to her brain, giving her an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, don't you see how much of a butterball you are becoming?\" yelled Harper's voice in the kitchen. \"I wouldn't be surprised if you'd end up on the Guinness World record\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker widened her eyes and jumped from a laying position on the couch to a sitting one. The young woman scratched her ching while her brain developed an idea crazy enough to work: In less than a couple years, Piper went from average sized to incredibly obese and didn't appear to be losing weight anytime soon, she might continue eating until she really gets in the Guinness World Record! So, Parker though she could be nice enough to take care of her dear little (figuratively) sister and help her become the fattest living person, she would be simply making the inevitable happen sooner. And she remembered how much money and attention those morbidly obese people who appear on the talk shows receive, let alone the fattest woman of the planet. It was decided, then. It might've been expensive, but they would get back all the money spent and then some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grin, Parker went to the kitchen. After being scolded, Piper was still sitting on the same chairs, only without food around her. She was playing with her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sis\" called Parker with sugary voice. \"Can you follow me, please?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper looked at her sister with mistrust. \"Why? Do you want to trick me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker made a dramatically offended face. \"Absolutely not! I was just curious about your weight\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat answer made Piper even more suspicion. \"I don't know and even if I do, I'm not telling you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker expected that reply, so she pulled out a bag of chips from behind her back. \"And in exchange of this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBribing her sister was much easier than expected. Just a bag of chips was enough to convince her to step on the bathroom scale, the harder part was helping Piper moving to the bathroom. Her hips grazed the doorframe while her waddle had become incredibly slow and needed a lot of pushes to move faster. Parker was surprised by how huge her sister was, especially when crammed in the small bathroom. <br>\r\nThen Parker had to read the number of the scale, there was no way Piper could see past her belly, which hung down on her thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"436 pounds\" said Parker with a whistle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\", huffed Piper, \"You're happy, now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, thanks sis!\" replied handing her the promised bag of chips. \"Btw, I'm ordering pizza, do you want some?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Piper wasn't suspicious at all. \"If you insists\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect! Let's go watch some tv while you tell me what kinds of pizza you'd like\" said Parker with a grin, giving a small squeeze to her sister's hip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe operation has begun... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The doorbell rang at the black's household. Waiting for it to open, there was a girl with her hair cut in a sidehawk, carrying what appeared to be a pile of more than an half dozen of pizza boxes. She was Irene Maxwell, simply known as \"Max\", Parker's classmate during high school who had recently found a job as delivery girl at Brent's Brothers Pizza, thanks to her second-rate but trusty scooter. Because of this, Parker decided to have her friend with her mission to turn Piper into the fattest woman alive. Parker simply asked for a discount for the pizzas, but Max even offered to give them free pizzas (at her expenses, of course). <br>\r\nMax was actually very eager to take part in Parker's plan after hearing about it, she had always found fat girls hot, and the bigger the better, so when Parker told her that Piper weighted over 400 pounds and wanted her much much fatter, just the idea excited the punk alot. Recently, however, Max had become even more eager to help because of a particular side effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Max. You're getting here faster every time\" said Parker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After more than thirty times, I guess I know the road like the palm of my hand\" replied Max gazing at Parker from behind the tower of pizzas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter deciding to fatten up her own sister, Parker had gained her fair share of pounds. A bronze muffin top formed over her pants, while a large potbelly bulged over, uncovered by the fancy t-shirt. Even her face had gotten softer, but the most noticeable change was in her chest. Large beasts had always been a trademark of the black family, and it appeared that most of the fat tended to be stored there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to pass me the pizza boxes or not?\" asked Parker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax blushed as she got back to reality. Damnit, she got lost admiring her friend's new curves. Was it her fault if Parker was getting this hot? Actually, kind of yes, while Parker started to gain on her own, Max indulged her by bringing more food and spending more time at home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I was thinking I could bring them inside. It's been a while since I've stayed here, right?\" replied Max. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker laughed. \"Only three days. Please, come. Piper is in the living room\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis! I've brought pizzas?\" exclaimed Parker as she entered in the living room, followed by Max. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I'm hungry\" huffed Piper in her husky voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax almost dropped the pizza boxes by the surprise. Even is she had been seeing Piper every few days, the sheer size of that girl always surprised her. Almost a quarter ton, Piper was the biggest girl Max had ever met. She took nearly all the space of the couch, her tree trunks legs spread wide open to leave space to her belly, while her breasts rested on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax was seeing Piper very often, but every time she seemed even more enormous than before. Since Parker's plan begun, Piper left the house only to go at an all-you-can-eat with her \"dear sister\", while she spent nearly all the remaining time on that couch, which had probably the shape of her ass imprinted on with all the time it passed. Piper herself didn't seem to mind at all, actually, she was happy whenever her sister brought her something to eat. Max wasn't sure if Piper caught on Parker's plan, but either way, she didn't mind being that fat and getting even fatter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax wasn't even sure if Parker had noticed her own new padding, which was even more evident in a sitting position, with her chubby belly folding a bit. The only thing that was sure was that Max loved it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want some more pizza?\" asked Max while handing a box to Piper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer was obvious and the tubby girl immediately grabbed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want another one too, Parker? I've brought a few extras...\" asked to the slimmer sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker nooded. \"Well, if you're offering it, how can I decline?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the pizzas! I've also brought some more with extra cheese and pepperoni, just how you like 'em\" said Max with a wink after Parker opened the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Max, you shouldn't have\" said Parker. She was holding baby Hunter in her chubby arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'm paying for them!\" replied Max while entering at home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker was wearing a new set of clothes. Last week she had to go shopping because nothing fit her anymore. Max accompanied her and offered a lunch at Burger Mix (naturally they also brought some takeaway for Piper). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new jacket had the blazer down to her belly, it was already too tight for Parker's chest, while those stretchy pants were holding nicely her wide hips and legs, but Max was sure she'd have discovered their limits very soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper was on the couch as usual, taking even more space. She had definitely reached and probably passed the quarter ton mark and getting up had become a struggle for her, especially if there wasn't anyone to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she smelled the recognizable smell of pizzas, Piper waved a fat-chocked arm. \"Hi Max\" said with her husky voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Piper, are you ready for a round of pizzas? I brought more than usual\" said Max with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper patted her hands on her belly, shaking the mass of bronze flesh. \"I'm always ready\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This time I've brought a special surprise\" said Max slowly opening her backpack only to tease the other two girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Black sisters were wrapped by curiosity as they waited for Max to show her surprise: it was a couple of boxes from D's donuts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little dessert\" proclaimed Max. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper happily clapped her pudgy hands. \"Wow! It's been a while since I've eaten some donuts\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the box was of reach, Piper grabbed it and proceeded to devour donut after donut, she'd spent a few months working at D's donuts and in that time she had mastered the art of eating them, as well as the art of eating in general. Piper was balooning faster than ever and the free space of the couch was getting smaller and smaller, while the piece of furniture sank lower and lower as Piper got larger and heavier, her belly slowly advancing toward the floor, almost like it was attempting to touch it. Piper could barely move around, she was the size of those enormously gat people that goes in talk shows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for your help, Max. Without your help, I don't know if I could've made Piper so fat in such a short time\" whispered Parker in her friend's ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a pleasure to help you\" replied Max. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every pound that Piper gained, her sister matched her pound for pound and possibly even more. Parker was already over 200 pounds, she was full blown fat, but still didn't even seem to notice it and ate donuts without care, stealing precious calories for her sister. Maybe, as long as she was the slimmer one, Parker didn't care if she was fat. Either way, Max was loving it, and made sure both the black sisters were well fed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the weeks rolled on and Parker continued her devious plot to get her sister into the record books, Max found herself voluntarily roped in to help out with more then just the deliveries. She'd come along with the girls on their increasingly rare forays to big all-you-can-eat restaurants, help to keep Piper and her living area tidy and clean, and oftentimes even helping the massive Black sibling eat when she started to slow down or get tired from a long gorge session, or occasionally when Parker wanted to make sure her sister was REALLY stuffed. And just like Parker, hanging around such an immensely fat girl and her eating habits made it easier for Max to justify eating a little extra at dinner time, and that little extra kept getting bigger and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Max!\" Parker huffed, holding the door open wide for the pizza girl. \"Go ahead and set those on the counter. Ooh, did you get donuts again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it!\" Max grinned, getting an eyeful of the creamy bronze belly pouring over the waistband of Parker's sweatpants. The elder sister was close to the big three-zero-zero, an idea that made Max tremble with excitement even if it meant the Black sibling was getting lazier as a result, hence why Max was carrying all these pizzas in herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maaaax!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup, Pipes,\" Max smiled, drinking in Piper's utter immensity. \"Pizza, donuts, or burgers to start? Got all three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donuts!\" Piper said thickly. She flung out chubby arms overflowing her hands at the wrist to get the box of donuts Max handed out. The utterly obese Black sibling leaned back and started to tuck in, the couch underneath her making a 'snap' sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not gonna hold her much longer,\" Max whispered to Parker as she waddled up, pizza in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It hasn't, that old couch collapsed its legs a week ago,\" Parker replied in a conspiratorial tone. \"I think she's so fat that the arms are starting to crack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" Max said, barely restraining a shudder. On a second look, the couch had indeed lost its legs at some point, leaving Piper's thunderously huge legs sprawled out with her bronze gut pouring over and onto the ground. She was so massive that you couldn't even tell the couch was on its last legs, figuratively speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's the plan on your end going?\" Max asked quietly, though it was unlikely that Piper would overhear with a face full of donut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pull up a chair and I'll tell you,\" Parker replied. \"Unless you gotta work...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my lunch break,\" Max said, pulling up a chair to the dinner table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a lunch break?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No but they don't know that,\" Max grinned. \"Its dead right now anyway, no one orders in the middle of the afternoon around here. Besides you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough. Go ahead and grab a slice or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind if I do!\" Max smiled, sitting heavily in the chair and pulling a pizza box in front of her. And heavily was the right word for it, as thanks to the constant presence of food around her Max had found it much easier to indulge more then usual. It didn't take long for the chubby chaser to get a taste of her own medicine, and boy did it taste good. Feeling her thighs spread across the dining room chair, she undid her belt buckle and let her pot belly flop out onto her lap with a content sigh. Max was so used to plumping up girls that she never thought about how it would feel to plump up herself, and it provided a very carnal sort of thrill to her. It was a good thing she knew how to get cheap clothing as well as cheap food, because Max intended to keep going with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker overflowed a chair across from Max as the two tucked into the pizzas, too enamored with the taste and sensation to speak at first. All three girls were silent outside of passionate chewing and an occasional guttural belch. Eventually Parker was reminded about a conversation when her button snapping off her jeans shocked her out of her trance-like eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah!\" Parker mumbled through a mouthful of pizza. \"The plan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about it?\" Max asked, mowing down pizza while rubbing her taut stomach with the other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I managed to get a big-ass industrial scale in here,\" Parker revealed, dropping her voice. \"She's officially doubled her weight since we started this project, eight hundred or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daaaamn,\" Max said, feeling her face flush at the very idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not at the record yet, but she's still speeding ahead,\" Parker grinned. \"Oh, and people are catching on too. The news came out a while back to do a puff piece on her and now...</span></div></div>",

Piper wasn't even old enough to drink and here she was at a whopping 800 pounds, literally crushing couches beneath her. The idea was certainly appealing to Max. She'd watch that. It wouldn't have been the first time she dialed the old rotary phone to watching some impossibly fat people be interviewed and, sometimes, judged on Daytime TV for how huge they were. Surely folks without Max's peculiar taste in women who could literally crush her would tune in, if nothing else, out of curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax let out a quiet little moan at that. Literally having to roll Piper out on stage like some kind of cartoon character after too much to eat. Parker\u2014no, Parker a hundred pounds heavier\u2014getting her into place and petting her sister's stomach while their mom\u2014oh <i>fuuuuck</i> Ms. Black was hot\u2014got them both something from the conveniently placed buffet table on-stage that could only exist in Max's immediate gratification. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuuuck...\" Max panted breathily as she bit into her slice of pizza, feeling herself getting hot and bothered at the silly image she'd painted in her mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right?\" Parker said proudly, folding the remaining slice up and pushing it into her mouth wholesale, \"Some lady's gonna come out at the end of the Summer since there's <i>no way</i> we're gonna get Pipey here on a plane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker's cheek swelled with half-chewed pizza crust as she reached over with both hands and sloshed her little sister's stomach from side to side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Isn't that right, wideload?</i>\" Parker asked playfully as her belly brushed up against Piper's avalanche of a waistline, \"No way we're gonna get you anywhere with this, huh?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper let out a high-pitched petulant whine as Parker let go of her belly. It still wobbled in place at the sudden and unwelcome invasion of her personal space. She'd clearly cursed underneath all the pizza, but she was far more interested in stuffing her puddling cheeks full of food more than she was with properly defending herself. Once she swallowed, she took a moment to rise to the occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut the fuck up, Parker!\" Piper said, though with no more gravity than any other insult they'd lobbed at one another over the course of their lives, \"Go get me some more pizza. All my boxes are empty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, only 'cause I'm out too.\" Parker grunted as she struggled to a standing position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned in, giving their mind-boggled delivery girl a good view of her expanse of olive-brown breast flesh, and said in a hushed voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta keep her well-fed until the interview.\" Parker winked, \"Thanks for your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Parker's thunderingly large ass bounce up and down in her sweats was enough to drive Max fucking insane. So sitting alone with the largest person that she'd ever met in her life, listening to her pant hotly as she sucked down breadsticks and butter dipping sauce, Max was put into overdrive. It was all she could do to keep from relieving herself right then and there. Luckily her own stash of pizza helped prolong her lusty glances without immediate satisfaction. God that belly play had been so hot...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, I lost my button.\" Parker said upon reentry, leaning over to pat her stomach down, as if it had merely been hiding under a stray roll of pudge and hadn't popped off sometime over the course of their lunch, \"Oh well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker shimmied the lower part of her stomach out from underneath the waistband of her pants, letting it hang loose and free as it swung from side to side in her trek back into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pizza?\" Parker offered her favorite delivery girl<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... gonna use the bathroom first.\" Max answered, beet-red and sweating, \"I... you... eat mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Max hurried (<i>hurried</i>) off to find the bathroom, Parker lowered her ripened rear-end onto the seat next to her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More for me.\" she said smugly, the sound of her seat's protests drowned out by the chorus of communal grazing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of that Summer, Parker's plan to plump up poor Piper hadn't slowed nor stalled. If anything, it had only picked up the pace. With the added incentive of knowing that her humongously fat sister would have to be TV ready, Parker had made sure to cater to Piper's every waking whim. Extra orders of pizza meant plenty of time with Max, who was more than happy to help heft that heifer into hugeness now that she'd been shown what her involvement's fruits bore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax had downloaded the app for this stupid broadcast just for this. How hot was it going to be knowing that she <i>knew</i> those fatasses on TV? That she'd been loaded Piper up without enough calories to feed an army, or that she'd been watching Parker pork out in her quest to have the biggest little sister on Earth? It was a visceral, exhibitionist thrill that she was experiencing. One that could only be savored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat? She knew how to savor things. Just because she'd made sure to charge her vibrator doesn't mean she wouldn't milk this for all it was worth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying on her belly, splaying out underneath her while her chubby feet kicked in the air, Meaty Max could hardly contain her excitement as the show started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts subject?</span></div></div>",

The fattest family of Daven's port: the Black family!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax squeed with enthusiasm at the announcement, impatient to see the family members, of course, she might as well be the only viewer to actually know how big they are, but it's rare to see all three of them together (especially because no room of the Black household can contain the three Black, not counting Hunter, without being cramped).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one to come in was Harper. <br>\r\nMax quickly turned on the vibrator as the Black matriarch waddled on stage, her flab quivering at every step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite learning about Parker's plan much later, and not getting involved until a few months ago, Harper was influenced by the abundance of food around her, as her quick growth could attest. <br>\r\nHarper's bluse was clearly a few sizes too small, almost ripping around her gigantic chest. Max wasn't sure if it was Harper who simply hadn't changed clothes or those of the talk show who wanted to highlight Harper's fat and hot body. Max couldn't care less, as long as she could see the Milf's olive skin bursting everywhere and the vibrator did its job in the redhead's pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This woman is, as of recent weight in, 287 pounds. Pretty big, isn't it?\" said the host, a drop of sweat rolling from the top of his bald head. \"Would you believe me if I'd tell you her daughters are even fatter?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do\" moaned Max, grabbing instinctively a slice of pizza. Thinking about Piper and Parker made her think of the pizza gorges she had done with them multiple times every week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the oldest daughter, Parker Black!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper waddled on stage much slower than her mom and collapsed on the couch, exhausted by that short walk. The piece of furniture creaked under the combined weight of the two women, but holded it.<br>\r\nParker had always been lazy so it was no wonder that, once she was being surrounded by food to fatten up her own sister, she would've turned into a butterball as well. After a year, Parker had become almost as big as her sister was when Parker decided to make her reach a world-record size. In fact, Parker was wearing some of Piper's old clothes. <br>\r\nThe most prominent feature in Parker was her belly, even more than her family's trademark breasts. Left uncovered by the tank top, it rested on her lap like a large, multi-layered pudding, with her round boobs above it like a pair of large, caramel cherries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She weigh 472 pounds! Impressive, isn't she?\" said the host with a fake astonished face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper puffed while shaking a fat arm to greet the viewers, and Max greeted back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Parker, if I had known you would've gotten so hot\" muttered before opening her second pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now, ladies and gentlemen, I announce you the middle child of the black family. The one that has gathered our interest and has become a legend in her hometown: Piper Black!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of heavy footsteps, there was the sound of squeaky wheels, and not long after, a queen-sizes wheeled bed moved in, pushed by some workers, and carrying Piper in all of her glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven compared to her fat mom and obese sister, Piper was massive, weighting more than the other two combined!<br>\r\nPiper's head was ridiculously tiny compared to the rest of her body: her barrel-sized legs had to be spread out to let the avalanche of that that was her belly, which almost reached the edge of the bed. Max remembered how Piper's belly touched the floor when she was on the now crushed sofa. The girl was wearing a muumuu which could have covered a cow, but her round watermelon-sized beasts were still visible beneath it. Meanwhile, Piper's arms rested on her side, almost kept horizontally by the fat that chocked them. <br>\r\nMax wondered how could they had lifted the titanic girl and where did they load her to transport her in the studio. Maybe inside a truck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud \"Oooh\" came from the audience in studio. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This girl over here, weigh 891 pounds\" said the host pointing at the pile of fat that occupied a third of the space on the stage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy cow!\" screamed Max. Even she didn't expect Piper to weigh that much, just shy from the big 9-0-0 and a little more than a hundred pounds away from the half-ton milestone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty impressive, isn't it? But would you bet that, only a couple of years ago, Piper looked like this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large screen showed a photo of a still slender Piper. Her hips used to be as wide as her arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax was feeling more excited than ever. She remembered how slim Piper was and how she had begun to indulge a bit too much. Piling pound upon pound until she was a near-900 pounds butterball.<br>\r\nThe redhead felt her pants getting wet and almost lost her senses from the pleasure, but got up and removed her pants and panties, remaining below the waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't lost much, the host had just begun making questions to his three guests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you afford all this food you're talking about? If your previous answer it's true, every day you eat as much as an entire family does in a week\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Parker alone eats every day as much as a family in a week\" commented Max between the munchies of her second pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We prefer to buy cheap products. We are not choosy when it comes to food\" answered Harper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax noticed only in that moment that there was Hunter as well, sitting on her mother's lap and resting on her soft bellt. Hunter was as chubby as your average one-year brat, but was still proportionally slimmer than even Harper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we've got some friends who have helped us\" added Parker, smiling at the camera. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax grinned back. \"And one of those friends is me\" said shoving in her mouth the last two slices of pizza. She leaned toward the third one while the host was making his next question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piper, I ask this specifically to you: do you have any intention of losing weight?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper shook her head, her multiple chins quivered like jelly. \"I'm not giving up food\" said in her deep voice. \"Speaking of, is there something to munch? I'm getting quite hungry\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe host gulped. \"Well, it was planned for later, but if you insist so much...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chart with greasy sandwiches was carried in. It was filled with brim, enough to give lunch to an entire school class. As Parker fed her sister, Piper's arm were too short for her to reach anything that didn't rest on her belly, the host keep making questions about their situation, their history and their future plans, but Max didn't care much about it and enjoyed the moments in which the camera focused on Piper stuffing her face. The redhead hoped to find this episode online, she'd watch it every night before going to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Piper's feast was almost over, her belly having become much rounder, Parker announced that her sister would become the fattest girl on earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is... interesting\" was the only thing the host could say. Then he looked on his papers and cleared his throat. \"Speaking of this 'becoming the fattest woman' goal, we have another guest for you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax massaged her stuffed belly while she watched a door opening. The guest was..</span></div></div>",

Twelve bucks an hour was just <i>barely</i> worth the boredom she had to endure under this mopey umbrella, while the sun beat down on the rest of the pier, all the kids skipped along, and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piper?\"  Her head stuck firmly in the clouds, Piper snuck out from the sky for half a second to look at whoever was talking to her- And gasped when she saw Dakota.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hey Tex, I just... Um... I saw the umbrella, and I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota laughed.  \"I'm just more surprised to see you up before 11 AM!  And actually out and about, nonetheless!\"  She giggled in that cute way that Texans know how to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper dared a glance at her phone and saw it was only 10:46!  Holy SHIT.  She had only been there for an hour and fourty-six minutes?  AND she had another five hours to go!  \"Dakota, you gotta hang out here, I'm bored as-\" Piper started, but Dakota had already held up a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Piper, but I'm here on a mission.  I gotta get what I need to get and then... Well, get back home.  There was a cooler way of saying that, but I don't know what it is.  Text me later!\"  And with that, Dakota was gone. Piper sighed.  She couldn't even get her FRIEND to look at these dumb Yeng pamphlets.  How was she supposed to get random strangers to look at them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few hours passed about as uneventfully as they could possibly pass.  Piper had a handful of papers (for \"taking notes\") which meant she started making some rough doodles of the various folks who wandered past her umbrella protected table.  So far, the candidates included:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Lady with two kids.  Her ass was disproportionately large compared to the rest of her frame...  Piper drew her as a gigantic ass with a head that had sunglasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Dude that was drinking out of a flask at 12:16 AM.  He was drawn as a flask with a beard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Two teenagers who stopped to take pics of Piper (apparently looking lame as hell, based on their giggles).  Drawn as two giggly stick bimbos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper was about to lose her mind when some innocuous pasty white girl walked up to the booth, a sky-blue bike in tow.  \"Hey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hey?\"  Piper responded.  She gave the girl a quick up and down-  Blonde haired, average height, dressed like... Well, anyone else on the pier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" The girl repeated.  \"I'm with Yeng, by the way.  They said that I had to stop by here with this.  Trust me, the Uber wouldn't have been worth it if they weren't covering it!\"  The blonde girl plopped a weirdly shaped tinfoil object in front of her.  \"So, what are you up to over here?\" Piper could only stare at the tinfoil blob in front of her- Mostly because the smells emanating from it felt like they were killing her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right... Well I'm gonna take off.  Bye!\"  Piper didn't respond.  \"Um- They said you gotta launch the Yeng app, then type in...\"  The woman looked at her phone.  \"Fifteen-Twenty-Two!  Okay, bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper stared at her as she began to remount her bike. \"Hey, thanks.\" She managed to mutter, and the girl shot her a salute before pedaling off away from the pier. Grabbing her phone from her purse, Piper began to pull up the App store before she noticed a blatant black and white icon indicating an abrupt letter \"Y\" on her home-screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as her phone was basically stone-age, this was odd.  The cracked touchscreen seemed semi-typical, but the outdated app icons made it clear that she hadn't been able to \"upgrade\" to the new version in several years- and yet, here she was with a brand-spanking new app.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of her wanted to be pissed- this seemed like a blatant disregard of personal space!  At the same time, Piper <i>had</i> filled out a lot of paperwork that she didn't really pay attention to- It was pretty likely she gave away her phone number to Yeng, and it was equally likely that they had just pushed their app onto her phone.... Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, she punched the icon on her busted-up screen, and when it prompted her for a code, she began to type it up- until a paper bag was thrust in her viewpoint, on top of her phone.  Prepared to be pissed, Piper shot her head up, only to see the same girl from before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, they gave me some burgers.  I forgot them I came by before.  They're labeled correctly- There's even some vegan ones in there!  Just check the letters on the wrapper, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper blanched at her, ready to ask more questions- but the girl was gone just as quickly as before.  She hopped on her bike and rode away. Piper pulled a burger out of the bag out of boredom, after watching her ride away...</span></div></div>",

Or at least, not as often as they used to. Dakota met a boy at one of their Under the Pier parties and had been stuck up his ass for the better part of ever since, and ever since Zack got a job at that ritzy hotel he never had time to do anything. Seriously, how hard or \"exhausting\" (or whatever he called it) was it to hit some keys on a keyboard and give people their room keys? That was a bunch of bull, and Piper could (and often did) call him out on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>However</i>, that didn't stop Piper from enjoying <i>her</i> Summer break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper didn't <i>need</i> friends to have a good time. She was perfectly capable of spending her mornings, noons and nights alone. Or at least, as alone as you could get in a house with two other people. Especially people as loud as her mom and sister were. Piper had a TV in her room and an old Gamecube with, like, three functioning disks. There were Yoohoos in the fridge and snacks in the pantry. And on nights where Parker stayed out late or in the mornings when her hangovers were intense enough that she sequestered herself in her room, Piper had the whole couch to herself! Piper was plenty happy to plop down on the couch, unwrap an ice cream sandwich, and <i>enjoy</i> herself for once in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if, as her friends responsibilities continued to outweigh their friendship with her, it just so happened to be every night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Piper's starter belly blossomed into a generous little pot that hung over the waistband of her jeans. Two little lovehandles pooched over the sides, her waist marred with angry red marks where the fabric suffocated her encroaching flab. Her rump was plump with the hours of sitting, grazing, and casual gaming that had filled her Summer, and her breasts had filled with the calories of every ice cream sandwich, burger, and hotdog that she'd sucked down. Piper was officially out of her old size, and had slipped into something a bit bigger. She did her best to keep the same style, but there was no disguising that Piper Black was getting fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, among other things, she wasn't being bombarded with jeers from <i>every</i> corner about her rising weight. As much as she didn't like to think about it, Piper could be rather sensitive when it came to her waistline; it was nice to know that someone was in her corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you don't <i>have</i> to go out if you don't want to.\" Piper's mother had told her as she struggled to pull up her jeans, \"I mean, it's nice having at least <i>one</i> of my kids around to talk to. Plus, you know, I <i>am</i> making those mozzarella sticks you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I know...\" Piper puffed, her chubby face red as she finally buttoned her pants, \"I'm just so <i>bored</i>. All I do is lay around the house and eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all your sister does too.\" Harper joked, taking the cheesy sticks out of the oven and placing them on the counter to cool<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but she like <i>goes out</i> and <i>parties</i>.\" Piper self-consciously touched her growing middle, as if to stop it from jiggling like it had been when she was dressing herself, \"I'm just gonna go hang out at the pier or something. Maybe see if Dakota or Zack want to hang out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Harper said, picking up a piping hot mozzarella stick, \"But these'll be done in, like, ten minutes. You wanna at least wait until then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper's face grew flush as she sunk into herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know they're your faaaavorite.\" Harper dangled the hot fried cheese stick in front of her daughter's face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne tray of cheese sticks later, Piper found herself out at the pier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hadn't changed much, despite her abstaining absence. The stalls were still there, most of the shops. Even a couple of the people, Piper recognized. Tourists didn't always leave after a week. Or maybe it was a return trip? Nobody would ever know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the one thing that <i>had</i> changed was Piper. She was officially thirty pounds heavier since the last time she set foot on the damp wood and breathed in the salty air. As much as she liked to tell herself that it wasn't noticeable, she couldn't deny the pronounced jiggling when she walked, and not just in her titties. She kept tugging at the hem of her shirt, trying to make sure that none of her olive-colored chub was exposed. The walk had left her so tired... God, she was out of shape!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd tired....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd hungry...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she should just go home? It wasn't like anyone wanted to hang out anyway. Dakota was with what's-his-name and Zack had been put on second shift. The most interaction she was going to be getting with those two were infrequent texting and the odd social media messages. Above all things, Piper <i>definitely</i> didn't want to be the weird girl hanging out by herself at the pier...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"ICE CREAM, HALF PRICE HERE!\"</i> a vendor hollered, <i>\"BROKEN COOLING UNIT HERE, FOLKS\u2014GET IT NOW BEFORE IT MELTS!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, maybe she could go after she got some ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small crowd of people surfaced in wake of the caller's announcement. All ice cream was half off and it was a pretty warm afternoon, even for the Summer. Piper was one of about ten folks that had come over in order to take advantage of it\u2014Piper had managed to score a Neapolitan triple for half price. Three bucks for three scoops was about the best thing that had happened to her all day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, she knew she shouldn't. But this Summer had just been such a bummer. She makes a new friend, she gets dumped for a boy. Zack gets a job, dumps her for money. Then she'd put on a little weight, her sister had been such a bitch... ugh. Just ugh. Food always made her feel better\u2014guess that was why she was such a fat kid in the first place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piper?\" a voice called out as she exited the crowd, \"Hey, is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper stopped licking and took a look around. She knew that voice from somewhere\u2014it sounded so familiar!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, I'm behind you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper whipped around, careful not to topple her tower of dairy, only to be met with an old face! One that she thought she'd never see again...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Summer Keegan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper had to stop her jaw from falling onto her little tower of ice cream clutched in her chubby hand. She settled for leaving her eyes wide in shock as she recognized her long-forgotten bestie from the hard days of childhood obesity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer beamed at the recognition flashing across Piper's countenance. \"Oh my gosh, it <i>is </i>you! How long has it been?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long indeed, Piper wondered silently, the memories coming back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrade school had been hell. If it wasn't due to the many times she got stuck on the fat-unhappy desks and became the joke of the week, or teased for always eating more than any other kid in class (and at all times), it was definitely because of class bitch Kara Cutter. There's always a Kara Cutter in every fat kid's life. The meanie who tells everyone laughing at others is cool, the self-righteous jerk who insists she's \"helping\" by taking away your meal and won't give it back unless \"you sweat for it\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, the two resident fat kids from class stuck together. It all started with them being forcibly saddled together, as though their weights made them a different class of species altogether. No one wanted Piper or Summer sitting close to them, so they became the odd ones out, those two fat girls sitting alone together at that table at the end of the room during snack time. But see, life does occasionally look out for the underdogs. Their cruel classmates pinned them together as a mean joke, but in each other, Piper and Summer found kindred spirits, overweight kids made to suffer for the insensitivity of their peers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey became inseparable, a matching Yin-Yang pairing if there ever was one. Where Piper was olive skinned with raven hair, Summer was pale with ginger locks. Piper was more down to earth in attitude, whereas Summer could be rather jovial and eccentric, which she had said was part of a facade she made to deal with all the bullying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresently, Piper smiled warmly in nostalgia at all the good times they'd had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneaking snacks to each other in class, and thus giving their teacher grief every time she caught them in the act. Or that time they were playing at the swing set, taking turns pushing each other on the swing, laughing joyously...which ended in one of them breaking the swing. Or the many slumber parties they had, their respective dotting mothers doing no favors in curbing their appetites with all the sweet snacks they provided for the girls to feast on as they binge watched Disney films.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr that one particular, special memory when they were older in middle school. When the curiosity for why older boys and girls hold hands or lock lips had gotten the best of them. Since they couldn't get boys to notice them, and they didn't have that many friends, they decided to resolve their curiosity themselves, as best friends who always stuck through everything. This would be no exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, they became each other's first kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went about as well as expected for a pair of thirteen-year olds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"EEEWWWWW!\" they had cried as they pulled apart, tongues out as they spat at the grass and asked each other, furiously, why did all those high school boys and girls do that in the first place. Or every mom and dad, for that matter!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey settled to forget about it, and just go get some ice cream, mostly to wash away the terrible taste of sandpaper saliva in their mouths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point after that, they just...drifted apart. Summer's family moved elsewhere, they tried to keep in touch, but eventually all manner of communication just stopped. There's only so much to talk about via FaceTime or Skype without forcing conversation and thus making it awkward. And as the years went by, Piper just had a lot on her mind. She shed the weight, she became fully aware of how poorly she and her family's living conditions really were, she fought tooth and nail to graduate from high school, she'd made new friends, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, here she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hellooooo? Pipes?\" Summer giggled awkwardly. \"Are you zoning out on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah,\" Piper cleared her throat, a sheepish smile on her face. \"Sorry. Got lost in memory lane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh,\" Summer said, smiling softly. \"Yeah. Me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooooo,\" Summer began. \"You gonna give me a hug, or just stand there like a busted pipe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ha-ha,\" Piper snorted, grinning as she made her way over to her childhood friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd registered for the first time that Summer looked...<i>different</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she looks older, yeah. They're not kids anymore. But as Piper took in all of her friend for the first time since turning around to lock faces, it came to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Piper's surprise didn't stop her from practically running up to her old school friend and embracing her, feeling the familiar sensation from years past of their large bellies squishing together. It almost made her want to tear up, she felt so happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, Piper, I missed you SO much,\" Summer said over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really missed you too!\" Piper said, choking back tears. \"Like...uh, you look great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was in retrospect a silly thing to say considering their weights, but Piper was still hung up on that. Summer being a fatso like her wasn't that much of a shock, but the shape was certainly noticeable. Back before puberty hit the two of them like a bus full of hormones, they were both pretty much round, all belly fat and a healthy layer elsewhere. Now Piper's weight collected in her impressive bosom and upper body, and in keeping with their Yin-Yang pairing, Summer was a sturdy pear. Her belly was a respectable lump that pooched out of her light summer blouse, but below the waist she really started to bloom. Her hips and rear flared out below her waist, crammed into a tight pair of short shorts that opened onto impressively thick legs that ended with a comfy pair of flip-flops. Not that any of that really mattered to Piper; after being neglected by Dakota and Zach most of the summer, she was just happy to find a familiar face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, so do you!\" Summer replied cheerfully. \"I uh, guess we stayed pretty healthy huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah I guess so.\" Both girls laughed guiltily, hyper-aware of how their bellies bounced with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you even doing out here?\" Piper asked in amazement. \"I thought you moved to Hesper years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I moved back, I got accepted to Daven's Port U and decided to move out early, get settled in and enjoy the break in my old hometown,\" Summer explained. \"I was worried it was going to be lonely, but here we are, haha! How's your sister doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls quickly got lost in conversation, catching up with one another, regaling stories from their youth, and just whatever else came to mind as they wandered down the pier. They laughed, had fun, even cried a few times. Piper was over the moon, and if she didn't know any better, Summer felt exactly the same way about the chance reunion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey it's getting pretty late,\" Summer suddenly said through a mouthful of french fries, one of several purchased that day. \"Wow, I didn't even notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper finished off a large soda and turned to look in the direction of the setting sun. \"Shit, you're right, I gotta get home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah me too, the RA is gonna freak if I'm late again,\" Summer said, rolling her eyes. \"You still got my old number right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Piper said cheerfully. \"Talk to you again tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer gave Piper a mighty squeeze, again blasting her friend with that nostalgic feeling of flab squishing together. As she broke it off and waved goodbye, something caught in the back of Piper's throat and she felt the need to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Summer...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer Keegan turned around curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...it's really great to see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer smiled warmly. \"Great to see you too, Pipes.\" As they finally departed, Piper ran to get a napkin from a nearby food stall to wipe up her tears, prompting a curious look from the hot dog vendor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More then alright,\" Piper said, happiness overflowing inside of her. \"This...this feels like the best summer I've ever had. Oh while I'm here, do you think I can get one for the road? Extra mustard and relish, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the days of summer rolled on, and the two old friends Piper and Summer quickly became best of friends again. With no Zach and Dakota around, the two spent whole days together, going to all the eateries and stores that Summer missed when she moved but mostly just hanging out and enjoying the summer as best friends do. The people who remembered Summer were always happy to see her back as well, but it seemed the people most happy to see her back, outside of Piper, were Harper and Parker Black. Back in their school days, Summer spent a lot of time at the Black household because of family issues back home, and in time they grew to see Piper's chubby buddy as part of the family. And much like Piper's friendship, that familial relationship came back in full force. They couldn't exactly go on trips and bring her along as they did in the old days given how tight money was, but they made her feel welcome all the same, inviting her to dinner or lunch whenever Harper or Parker was around to make something and letting her sleep over with Piper just like old times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't exactly the same, but for Piper close enough was perfect for her. Keegan and Black were back, and as far as Piper was concerned, things couldn't get any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they could get complicated...</span></div></div>",

No!\" Piper said dismissively, \"I just... I don't know. Don't you think that place looks... cool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a poignant silence between the three of them that suggested that her friends did not agree with her, particularly after having been dragged all across town by a hungry, hungry Piper.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I mean, if you think so.\" Dakota finally said, \"And, you know.. <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">if it means we don't have to eat anymore...</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Zack caught on surprisingly quickly \"I mean, we can totally take a break for a little while, right? It's not like Steak n Shake <i>closes</i> any time soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Piper noticed what they were up to, she didn't show it. The pretty punk took a few anxious steps forward, and then decidedly less so, as she guided Zack and Dakota across a surprisingly empty street...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door chime dinged overhead as the three teenagers made their way inside. The stench of dust and musty old everything was even stronger inside than it was out. The lighting was rather dim, and if buzzed a lot more than she guessed it probably should. It went back surprisingly far, offering plenty of floor space for what looked like useless junk, and opened up to a doorway at the very far back that was draped in one of those bead dividers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly lived up to its name though; Abida's Eclectics was anything if organized. There were shelves upon shelves upon shelves, trinkets and bobbles lined the walls as armoires and dressers and old fat-back TV's and bookcases cluttered the floors. There were old books, a glass case of jewelry, and a not-surprisingly-large collection of those creepy porcelain angels that every insedit old lady seemed to have handy. All of it dusty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, customers?\" came a cheery tone, \"Wait riiight there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind the beads, a powerful shape emerged from the deeper levels of the store. One draped in fluorescent colors, providing more than an eyeful of oranges, reds, purples and yellows as it made its way through the beads. A large woman finally emerged, with dark\u2014not tanned, but dark\u2014skin from behind the divider, appearing belly-first as she parted the vaguely eastern pattern. She was dressed in a bright orange dress, wrapped in draped in various scarves with a tightly-tied technicolor head wrap. Beneath that, she had thick black hair that fell into ringlets, which fell onto her meaty shoulders and neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Abida, and these are my Eclectics.\" the woman said with a healthy dose of exposition, \"What brings the three of you into my little shop, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We mostly wanted to take a break from eating.\" Zack said, before Dakota raised her arm and gave him a swift punch in the shoulder, \"OW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh... I really don't know...\" Piper blinked, \"I just... I just got the feeling that I should come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe round woman smiled warmly at the entranced teenager and stepped behind the counter. She propped herself up on her elbows, her belly cutting thickly into the edge of the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And should we not all follow our feelings?\" the roly-poly shopkeep said, still smiling, \"You are quite young to be so intuitive. My shop contains many treasures. I believe that, perhaps, you will find something you like. Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardly.\" Zack coughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, guys?\" Piper turned back to her friends, \"Think we can put our free food extravaganza on hold a little\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES.\" Dakota and Zack answered in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Piper turned back into the dusty cavernous expanse of Abida's Eclectics. It went back surprisingly far; like a tooth. There were so many cool pieces on the shelves and on the floor... the only question was... where to start?</span></div></div>",

She saw many strange and bizarre things, a pair of shoes with springs on the bottom, a jar of dead moths, and even a Nickelback Album signed \u201cto my biggest fan\u201d that was the weirdest item she saw. Then, in the back, Piper saw something truly eye catching. It was titled Zamboni the Seer, it was made of old musty wood  and contained an aging puppet. Its paint was already chipping away, any color on the eyes, it was gone. Piper inspected the machine, she could see the puppet had a crystal ball with cracks between its hands. She looked down to notice a rough rusty metal slot that had some painted writing saying \u201conly 25 cents\u201d. Piper was fascinated by this contraption, she looked to see if the shopkeeper was near.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeat, isn\u2019t it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper jumped, the shopkeeper had been behind her this whole time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes it is\u201d Piper said hesitantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know this thing is pretty accurate, maybe it\u2019s better not to know how things will turn out.

The machine suddenly burst to life. The old hands of the fortune teller moved slowly in a lifelike motion. After a moment, the machine spat out a card into a rusted metal slot below.

There were shelves upon shelves, covered in cobwebs and reaching far into the yawning dimness that was the back of the store. Towards the other side, opposite our teenaged trio, only the flickering red EXIT sign lit the way\u2014the rest was only vaguely lit by the natural summer sunlight of the setting Daven's Port skyline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw geeze it's getting late...\" Zack burped, pulling his phone out of his pocket, \"Hey P, you uh, you wanna go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, uh...\" Dakota took one look into the graying abyss that was the rear and offered a nervous laugh, \"Those milkshakes aren't gonna slurp themselves down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was no use. Trying to signal to Piper in a worn-down old treasure trove like this may as well have been impossible. She was a connoisseur of all things abandoned on the beach, forgotten and worn down by time. She was the only family on the block\u2014maybe the whole city\u2014with a VCR. Her passion for Polaroids transcended all trendiness, and her well-worn Victrola was her preferred way of playing even the tinniest of pop vinyls. She <i>loved</i> old junk! It came with being one of the poorest people in the neighborhood. Sometimes you never knew what you'd find in a pawn shop, an antique shop... or apparently, an Eclectics shop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw come on, guys!\" Piper whined, taking a few steps forward, away from the light, \"There's all kinds of cool stuff here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo illustrate her point, Piper started rummaging through Abida's dusty junk. Handprints reversed years of accumulated gray as Piper swept off the grime, Zack and Dakota warily making their way towards the darkness of the inside of the shop. Piper pulled out an old camera, an old cast-iron tea-kettle... you'd think that Abida would have had this organized! But finally, what caught her eye, was a big cardboard box. About the size of one of Bubby Black's old hat boxes. It was faded and brittle\u2014it looked like it might just fall apart if Piper picked it up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curious counterculturist swept a hand across one side of the box, a film of dead gray yielding to her touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The What-If? Machine...\" Piper read aloud, \"Fun for the whole family, ages 8 to 80...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an old board game! An <i>old</i> board game, by the looks of it. It was about six inches tall and two feet long by one foot wide. The box, once thoroughly wiped down, had a yellow and red color scheme (albeit somewhat faded) and illustrations of a family gathered around a small television screen. Hmm. Piper wasn't much into board games. She hadn't so much as touched the thrift-store copy of Monopoly that had gone neglected in the top of the Black Family communal closet down the hall. So why was it, then, that she was so drawn to this one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not seriously gonna buy that thing, are you?\" Zack ribbed her, \"I mean not when there's... Home Alone on VHS Christ alive this place is a junkheap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be nice.\" Dakota gave Zack a quiet shove, \"The owner's like, right there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sure enough, there was Abida. She was bobbing out from behind the counter, her impressive bosom and heaving gut bouncing with every excited step. She held her chubby hands high above her chest and huffed and puffed eagerly as she made her way over to Piper, who was still crouched down holding her find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, I remember this!\" Abida said in her broad accent, \"The What-If? Machine! Everyone had one when I was a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Piper asked, one black brow cocked inquisitively, \"I've never heard of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an older game.\" Abida said with a slight cough, probably hoping to dissuade anyone from inquiring further, \"There was some sort of licensing issues with the big name toy brands. I had thought that all of these fell by the wayside\u2014imagine my surprise to find this here, in my shop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe if you actually <i>cleaned</i>\u2014OW!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper held the box in her hands. It certainly felt old. The cardboard around the game was brittle, and the paint was flaking off. But there was definitely something heavy inside! A quick inspection told her that, yes, all of the pieces were in place and the monitor was undamaged. How it worked, exactly, Piper couldn't say. But it looked to be in great condition. Maybe she could sell it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much do you want for it?\" Piper asked, surprising almost everyone in the room, \"The game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah? I could never part with such a treasure...\" Abida gave a longing look at the What If? Machine, her sausagey digits rap-tap-tapping on the edge of the box, \"...for anything less than ten dollars.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Sold.</i>\" Piper said with a smile, her hands plunging into her tight pockets and reemerging with a crumbled $10 bill, \"Best ten bucks I ever spent!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sun set and the three teens left, Dakota and Zack couldn't have been more happy to get out of that old shop and back into the natural sunlight, no matter how fleeting it may have been. Piper seemed to have more or less forgotten about the free milkshakes from Steak n Shake\u2014apparently she was a bit more full now that all her free samples had had time to settle. As the orange-colored sky flickered into reds, to purples, to black, the three teens came into view of the Black Family household...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The screen door clanged as it shut behind her, Piper offering a goodbye wave as her friends walked down and out of her driveway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye guys, had fun!\" she yelled through the mesh screening into the Summer air, \"Let's meet up again Tuesday, okay? I still wanna try those milkshakes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the door was shut. Piper turned tail back into the kitchen. The fluorescent lighting flickered over the stove as the smell of pizza filled the whole house. From the front door, Piper could see her older sister vegging out on the couch. At least she'd moved since this morning\u2014her hangover couldn't have been that bad. On the coffee table, in front of her feet, were two open boxes of meat lover's supreme from Pagliacci Pizza. Her sister leaned against the arm of the sofa, a greasy triangle in hand, as her eyes slowly shifted to see Piper standing in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to miss family night, you turd.\" Parker snorted, \"Mom's pissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh shit. Family night! How could Piper have forgotten? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been her stupid idea in the first place, to have a night where they all got together and did shit so that they could start getting along better before the baby arrived. Piper had pushed <i>so</i> hard for everyone to agree to one night a week where everyone put aside their stupid bullshit and came together. Even Parker had agreed, albeit under direct threat of eviction, to set aside hanging out with her idiot club friends for a night in with the family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of all people, <i>Piper</i> had been the one to miss it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit, really?\" Piper placed the game down on the kitchen table, \"Please tell me you're fucking with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I am.\" Parker sneered, \"She thinks this whole family night thing is stupid too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I <i>am</i> pissed that you forgot to go by D's.\" came the sudden inclusion of her mother's voice from somewhere deeper into the living room, \"Your sister and I ordered pizza\u2014I am <i>so</i> pissed at you for wrecking my diet, Piper! I'M GONNA BE A WHALE BY THE TIME THIS BABY COMES!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in the living room were the remaining members of the Black family. Parker, Piper's older sister, sat on the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was something of an older version of her sister. There was a strong family resemblance in all the Black women, beginning with a prominent but attractive nose and set of eyebrows. Parker kept her hair short and straightened, but shared a similar taste with her younger sister. Parker liked t-shirts and cigarette jeans on days she stayed in, only trading up for fancier getups when she went out to the club. Which was often. Like the rest of the women (and some of the men!) in her family, Parker was very well-endowed; although a bit more pallid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the right, on the other end of the couch, Piper's mom had parked herself in a very similar situation as her eldest daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her youth, Harper had looked very much like her daughters. And while the natural sort of curves that came with motherhood and being in her thirties had done well to set her apart by her wide hips and slightly softer figure, that resemblance had stayed true. She didn't look her age (\"We Black girls are blessed with longevity!\") although her fashion hinted at it sometimes. Her frizzy black 'do was eighties big, and she had a bent for early ninties wear. The swell of her pregnant stomach, nearly five months along, housed Piper's littlest sister, to be named Hunter. She, too, looked to have been enjoying herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo boxes of pizza lay empty on the table before Piper's family, the remainder of the third being slowly enjoyed by the shirked relatives without a hint of remorse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Mom...\" Piper offered weakly, \"I just got held up hanging out with Zack and Dee...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, don't worry about it. I'm just happy you're hanging out with people who don't have criminal records.\" Harper puffed, \"Just get this pizza away from me. I'm craving grease and I'd like to <i>not</i> clog an artery before the night's over.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, the sight and smell of anymore food was beginning to wear on Piper as it was. Eating all day, even at free sample sizes, hadn't exactly been the smartest decision that Piper had ever had. She was getting green around the gills just looking at it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, whatcha got in there?\" Parker suddenly asked, looking into the kitchen and on the table at Piper's recent acquisition<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That?\" Piper turned readily away from the cheesy triangle, \"Oh, I uh, checked out that shop in downtown. It's an old boardgame. Thought I'd... I don't know, sell it on eBay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas that even a thing? Was there a market for old boardgames on the internet? Surely one that was discontinued a while back (at least far enough back for Abida to remember it) would have some pull. Either it was a collector's item or it was better off in the dust where Piper had found it. But as she said it out loud, somehow Piper felt... wrong? Like she shouldn't want to sell it? Did that makes sense? It certainly didn't to her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. Who's gonna wanna buy some dusty old board game?\" Parker snorted, finishing off her crust, \"I'll bet it doesn't even work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither do you, but we keep you around.\" Piper raised her eyebrows at her sister, \"I mean, does it matter if it works? People will buy anything on the internet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" her mother interjected, \"I worked pretty hard to get my seller score up to 5 stars... how do you <i>know</i> it works?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because... because I just do, okay?!\" Piper sputtered, \"Jesus, I didn't know that Family Night meant the Spanish Inquisition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some coaxing, but eventually Piper's mom rocked herself out of her seated position on the couch and toddled her way over to the kitchen table. She looked at it much the same as Piper had about an hour beforehand. She put both her hands on either side of the box, dusted it, wiped away some grime that Piper had missed, and looked absolutely fascinated. Like she was seeing a friend for the first time in a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember these!\" she finally said, putting the box back down on the table, \"I saw a commercial for it <i>one</i> time when I was a kid. I asked your Bubby for it, but we never had the money. They were yanked off the shelves for some reason, and there were never any more ever made!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was with an almost childlike glee that Harper opened the box. She slipped the top off and placed everything out on the table. The monitor, the battery pack (THOSE would have to be replaced...), the microphone, warranty card, and finally the instruction booklet all wound up on the kitchen table. Piper's pregnant mom rushed over to the junk drawer, further into the kitchen, and returned with two D batteries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you do?\" Parker asked, still seated from the couch, \"How do we work this antique, O Ancient One?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't <i>know</i>, smartass.\" Piper's mom bit back, \"I just told you I never had one. None of my friends did either. Shit, I didn't think anyone in this <i>town</i> ever got one. But here we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper stood back as she watched her mom fiddle with the back of the monitor. She unscrewed the piece at the bottom and popped the batteries into the back end. With the flip of a switch, it came to life! A soft blue glow filled the room on one side as Harper looked on excitedly at their newest acquisition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Harper squealed, \"I can't believe it still works!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should... uh...\" Piper grabbed the instruction booklet and pawed through it, \"We should ask it a question!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Parker asked exasperatedly, pausing their Redbox rental for the umpteenth time, \"Piper, that's fucking stupid. It's not a magic eight ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean... it's kinda like that.\" Harper conceded, \"I remember that the commercial said you could ask it anything\u2014<i>as long as</i> it was a What-If question\u2014and it would tell you what would happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOoh. Now that sounded promising. Asking a machine anything, as long as it was a What If? That... there was no way that this was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way that this is real.\" Piper laughed, \"You're fucking with us, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, <i>I don't know because I never had one of these when I was a kid.</i>.\" Harper put her hands on her wide hips, \"Criminy, Piper, learn to listen\u2014I'm going off what I remember from a commercial when I was six.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause as all three women, even Parker, stared at the humming blue screen in their kitchen. If their mom was right, this could be the best thing that ever happened to them. Something like this had to go for <i>thousands</i> on eBay. A nostalgic toy collector would pay out the ass for something like this. But if Harper was right about it being able to tell the future...or rather, the alternate present... it might be worth at least a spin or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean, we have to make sure it works...\" Piper shrugged, pulling up a chair, \"You know, so we can sell it for more money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" Harper nodded, chair legs scraping against the linoleum, \"And you <i>do</i> owe me a family night...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes turned to Parker...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh <i>fine</i>.\" Parker paused the TV again, \"But only because Mom threatened to kick me out, and I really don't feel like pushing any more buttons tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three women were seated around the ancient piece of technology like an old-fashioned seance. The screen stared them in the face, casting its blue light against them. The microphone was on the table, an equal distance between all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho's turn was it?</span></div></div>",

It was hard to see any specifics due to the poor video quality but it was clear that this Parker was a bit heaver than the original, ten or fifteen pounds at the most. Also, the Parker on screen appeared to be standing in front of a group of students in a class room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it looks like your giving a speech.\" Piper noted. \"Turn the volume up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker reached behind the television and raised the volume. The audio quality was as poor as the video quality, but the family was able to make out what video Parker was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an honor to stand before you today.\" Video Parker said to the class, speaking with a level of confidence and charisma that the real Parker had never shown. \"I would never have made it here without the tireless work of my staff, the support of my professors, and of course the faith of the student body. And I promise that I will validate that faith by being the best Student Council President I can be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVideo Parker's speech was meet with a round of applause from the audience.

Stupid thing probably just has two or three canned responses for basic questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you stop being a downer for, like, five minutes.\" Piper sighed. \"Can we just have some fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick!

What if I moved out of Daven's Port.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family braced for another wave of noise and light, but the blow never came. Instead the machine gently whirred for a moment before another image popped on screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it just needed to some time to warm up.\" Parker hypothesized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family again crowded around the small screen to see what Video Piper was doing, but frankly she wasn't doing much. Video Piper appeared to be eating at a fast food restaurant. But it wasn't what she was doing that was important, it was how she <i>looked</i> that caught the families attention. The Piper on screen was enormous. She easily weighed over 300 lbs and was probably close to 400 lbs to be honest. Every aspect of her body was a cartoonishly inflated version of the Original Pipers lithe frame. Her ass was enormous, her thighs were triple the size of Original Pipers, her belly alone had to weight fifty pounds, and her breasts were the size of pumpkins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, look at her arms.\" Harper pointed out. \"They barely fit in her shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget her arms, look at her thighs!\" Parker replied. \"Each one is the size of my waist! And she clearly outgrew those leggings twenty pounds ago, surprised they don't just explode off her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget her ass.\" Harper added. \"Jesus, she must need three chairs just to sit down. I don't know how she fit threw the door\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least she has an ass.\" Parker joked, receiving a quick strike to the ribs from Piper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least I still got my tits.\" Piper sighed in dismay. \"Even if they do weigh thirty pounds each.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christ, those things are enormous. I weep for her spine.\" Harper replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family continued to comment on the zaftig form of Video Piper, but they all quieted immediately when someone walked over to Video Piper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Piper!\" A much fatter bottom heavy girl shouted from across the diner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Sasha, I'm doing well.\" Video Piper replied, after taking an enormous bite out of her burger. \"Finally feel at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say girl, looks like you've really adapted the Hesper lifestyle!\" Sasha laughed, smacking Video Pipers belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm a real local now!\" Video Piper giggled. Shortly thereafter the video cut off, and the screen turned to black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family sat in silence of a while, everyone struggling to understand what they had just seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm never leaving Daven's Port.\" Piper mumbled, shell shocked from the video.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Piper!\" Parker groaned. \"You don't think this thing can actually predict the future do you? This was probably just another canned video, although a weird one I'll admit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Harper interjected. \"I don't know if it can tell the future or not but I know it's my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No mom, we need to see if this thing can tell the future!\" Piper replied.</span></div></div>",

And since it's my turn anyway\u2026 What if I won the jackpot tomorrow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine whirred again, a lot longer this time, then the screen lightened again and the three Black women saw\u2026 themselves. They were sitting on the couch, their eyes glued onto the TV while it was announcing winning numbers and just as the vision cleared, Video Parker sceptically scoffed: \u201cSay whatever you like, I still don't believe in miraculous medium machines.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShush! Not now!\u201d Video Harper held a ticket in her hand, checking each and every one of the numbers the announcer called out. \u201cWait, wait\u2026 and now 42!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201c42,\u201d the TV obeyed her command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! Yesss! I'm rich! I'm finally filthy rich! I'm a millionaire!\u201d Video Harper threw her hands up while Piper and Parker danced a little jig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that was interesting,\u201d Parker sighed wistfully as the screen faded to black again, \u201cbut didn't help us much. We still don't know the first winning two numbers. In fact, we don't even know whether it's real or not...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure it's real, you party pooper! Didn't you see it there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, on the screen of a cheap ancient toy. Do you really believe everything you see on TV, Mom?\u201d she scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two bickering women didn't even notice Piper disappear upstairs. She had an idea to test but needed her all-but-forgotten school notebook for it. Now she jogged down with it in hand and while her family was still arguing over the validity of what they had just seen, she leaned to the microphone. \u201cWhat if I bet on the winning numbers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreen cleared again, showing Piper come to the counter in a rather shabby convenience shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that place! It's that 7-Eleven on the next corner!\u201d exulted Parker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShush and listen,\u201d Harper knew this no longer worked, she could no longer rein in her older daughter. Luckily Parker realised her mistake and stopped speaking on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust in time. \u201cHi, I came to place a jackpot bet.\u201d Video Piper held up her school notebook and quickly rushed out a sequence of numbers, so fast the clerk could barely manage to put them in, once he even had to ask again to clarify.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? What? Did you get it? Anyone?\u201d Harper glanced around, confused. \u201cI swear I had a pen here somewhere\u2026 Was it 37? Or 47?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense, Mom. She said 57, just like the TV announcer before. Why don't you pay attention\u2026 Hey! Where're you goin'?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Piper was already gone. Clutching her notebook close to stop her breasts wobbling too much, she ran all the way to the local 7-Eleven. She burst inside, stopping only at the empty counter to catch her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shop was utterly devoid of customers so the clerk was dozing in a corner. Now her steps woke him up. \u201cYeth?\u201d he asked groggily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, I came to place a jackpot bet,\u201d Piper tried to mimic the words her on-screen counterpart had used, \u201cit is 4-8-15-25-37-42,\u201d she said breathlessly, reading the numbers from her notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, not so fast. Did you say 37 or 47?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c37.\u201d She paid him ten dollars (her last), the clerk handed her a slip of paper and thanked her, going to sleep again. She left the shop\u2026 and right into an arm that snatched her aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat're you doin', Pipes?!\u201d Her older sister did not look happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExperimenting,\u201d shrugged Piper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut- But- You can't just go and place the bet yourself! We're in this together, all three of us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d Piper was just about telling Parker that it was <i>her</i> game and why was she so concerned all of a sudden when according to her opinion it could never work. But she swallowed it all when she saw a small crowd (several suspicious characters drawn from God knows where) gathering around to see what the commotion was about. \u201cSo good of you to remind me. If we don't win, you owe me 3 dollars 33 cents. Come on, let's go home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! Owe you?! But...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe're in this together, remember?\u201d and she lowered her voice. \u201cTomorrow we'll see if it works. Just imagine what we could do if it does!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what debts we could run up if it doesn't,\u201d Parker replied sourly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Harper adjusted a knob on the side and the picture grew clearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't this the donut place?\" Parker asked. \"Wonder what-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older Black sibling was cut off when a familiar figure strode in from the side towards a cash register, dressed in a sharp suit as she assisted the customers, a pair of city cops. The family could just make out the tag with the words \"Owner\" embossed upon it pinned to her jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" the real Harper said, impressed. \"I should find more suits....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your total will be $20.32, William,\" the video Harper Black said in a cordial, friendly tone, handing the closer policeman his receipt. \"Stay safe out there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you kindly, Miss Black,\" the cop, named William, responded politely, tipping his cap as they made their exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even like donuts that much,\" the cop's partner grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only people who say that haven't tried a Black Berry Bakery donut before,\" William joked, handing over a tasty looking one as they went out of frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, that name is cute,\" Piper said sweetly. \"I could totally see you naming a store something like that, mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's goofy sounding enough,\" Parker said dismissively, looking like she was trying to bore through the machine with her gaze alone as she tried to figure out how it worked. Almost perfectly on cue, a second familiar figure exited from the kitchen, carrying a whole tray of muffins. With her hair tied up under her chef's hat, the Blacks almost didn't recognize Parker at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom, we're running out of brown sugar,\" Video Parker informed her mother. \"Can you send someone to grab some extra from the store, I want to get out the new sugar cookie recipe and start on the cinnamon twists before the lunch rush hits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll send Dee out when the crowd clears,\" Video Harper said, already ringing up the next customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second, I'M the baker in this scenario??\" the real Parker shouted in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Head baker, according to the tag,\" Harper said, squinting at the small screen. \"I always thought you had the knack for it, you loved to help out with making dinner when you were little. We even got you a little hat and rolling pin when you were five, so you could bake....oh what was it you called them? Super Duper Strawberry Yum Yum Pies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moooom!\" Parker groaned as her little sister broke into a fit of giggles at this recounting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you have to admit it's kinda cute,\" Piper insisted. \"I wonder if I'm in here somewhere, maybe assistant chef or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn timing that was so perfect that it couldn't have been a coincidence, there was a jingling bell that indicated the door was opened in front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two dozen of your finest donuts, please!\" Video Piper called out as she strode into frame, looking largely the same. \"For me and my gal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper's entire family looked up briefly from the scene to stare at her with rapt interest as Piper's face flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you must be Dakota!\" Video Parker said sweetly, setting down her tray and wiping her brow. \"So nice to meet you, Piper's said so many nice things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, shucks, you're makin' me blush,\" the Video Dakota Johnson said from offscreen, sounding considerably more Texan then Piper heard her sounding this morning. The real Piper wondered why she was so slow to appear before a rather large behind suddenly came into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat pageboy haircut was instantly recognizable, which was good because they wouldn't be able to tell it was her otherwise...this Dakota Johnson was capital F A T fat! The Black family gazed in stunned silence at the sight of Video Dakota's obesity; even from the back they could see the belly hanging over her thunderous thighs, which visibly tested the limits of her sweatpants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good lord, she's Texas sized!\" Harper said, placing her hand over her mouth in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That ass is too big for the booths!\" Parker exclaimed, trying hard not to break into laughter. \"What a cow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's my friend you're talking about!\" Piper snapped back. \"Or my...'gal', I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this your first time here, Dakota?\" Video Harper continued as the Video Dakota placed a meaty hand on the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, not yet,\" Video Dakota stuttered, probably trying not to drool by the sound of her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll throw in a sampler just for you then...a little bit of everything to hook in new customers!\" Video Parker said, meandering her way into the back room. \"Mom, could you give me a hand with the mixer? It's been on the fritz since last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing dear, just let me ring this up,\" Video Harper said, punching in Piper's donut order and the sampler. \"I'll be right back, don't you two get into trouble now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, I told you they'd like you!\" Video Piper told her girlfriend as her mom went into the back. \"They even got you the sampler, just like I said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but Piper,\" Dakota said in a surprisingly sultry tone, turning to face Piper and showing off her thick double chin and apple-sized cheeks. \"All those deserts are going to be so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota gave a little wobble, causing her overhanging gut and butt to bounce and sway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...fattening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm s-sure you'll burn it off,\" Video Piper said, turning almost as red as the real Piper was right now upon learning what this version's kink was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you though?\" Dakota continued. \"You're not worried that I could get...bigger? Rounder?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You? N-nah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I could get a third chin, that I could burst out of these sweatpants if I eat long enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear Piper,\" Dakota smiled seductively. \"You are making me so...damned...fat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVideo Piper's hands immediately shot out towards her girlfriend's gut, but before she could go further Video Parker returned from the rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here ya go, two dozen and a sampler!\" the elder Video Black sibling said happily, handing the whole collection to an aroused looking Video Piper. \"Enjoy your food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I think I will,\" Video Dakota said, still smiling as her girlfriend rounded on her. \"I'm quite...hungry today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the side show could continue, the screen mercifully faded into nothingness once again. There was a moment of silence, then Parker Black cleared her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...is there something you want to tell us about, sis?\" Parker said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut the fuck up,\" Piper grumbled, wanting nothing more then to sink into the ground right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, calm down you two, it's just an alternate universe image!\" Harper said indignantly. \"Have a little fun with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but I get the next question, and it's not going to involve any food!\" Piper snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet Dakota would ask about food,\" Parker said snarkily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay here's a question, what if I socked you in the nose right this second?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PIPER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay, sorry mom,\" Piper said, getting back into her chair. \"Questions...right....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't think you're innocent in this,\" Harper scolded her eldest daughter. \"Stop antagonizing your sister, you didn't like it when she teased you about your scene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay mom,\" Parker sighed. \"Piper, can you do your question already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your pants on, I'm thinking...\" Piper mused. \"Okay, what if...\"</span></div></div>",

It cut again to a text card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cParker Black, 20 years old, 654 pounds.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Panning shot of the same Black household they lived in. A blurb on the bottom of the screen says \u00e2\u0080\u009cDavensport, NC\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The camera now turns to Piper sleeping in a bed, a mountain underneath the blankets. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pulled off and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mostly naked. At first they pan over her elephantine legs. The fat around her thighs and knees is so intense that one of her feet dangles in the air while she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sleeping, held aloft by the fat on fat contact of her atrophied legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They get some good close ups of her belly, especially as it jiggles and sways while she struggles just to sit up and start her day. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a deep, multitiered affair, and the camera manages to catch the sweat glistening on her side rolls. Once she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up the camera pans out and reveals all of her. A censor bar scrambles her nipple into a series of beige and tan pixels. They only have to censor one because they spread so wide across her girth, that only one can appear at a time. Sitting up like this, you can see how bottom heavy she is, that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been hiding even more vast stores of adipose from the viewer. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a shapeless thing, flattening out under the force of gravity and molding itself to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Parker provided voice over: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy first thought in the morning is, I should eat.

Even Piper had enough on seeing that. But for Parker it was a little too much, she tried to stand, but she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get too far, before she DID puke, all over the floor. She felt dizzy, she felt faint, like some kind of wave of shock was coming over her. Harper was on it in an instant, even in her precarious condition. She helped Parker back into her seat, and rubbed her back. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere, there Parker. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a game. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing to worry about.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Okay, so having a pregnant mother didn\u2019t exactly make life easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially since, thanks to a certain asshole father, she was unemployed at the time of pregnancy because he was the paltry breadwinner of the house and no one wants to hire a woman who was about to literally shoot out another, smaller, noisier woman in less than a trimester. Piper\u2019s Mom had been having an especially hard divorce, so money was tight, but she was also having an especially difficult pregnancy. Which was where Piper stepped in to help take care of things where she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019re <i>you</i> going?\u201d her sister, Parker, grumbled from the couch, \u201cHanging out with your little boyfriend again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No. Ew.\u201d Piper rolled her eyes as she handled the doorknob, \u201cI\u2019m gonna go out and do some crap for Mom. Zack\u2019s not my... ew!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper and Parker had been at each other\u2019s throats since the day Piper had been born. Parker had been the kind of older sister to try to return Piper to the stork just a week after she\u2019d been born. And then try to take her to the UPS store on her big wheel when that didn\u2019t work. And then, when all else failed, try to flush her sister down the toilet like a dead goldfish. Parker was about four years older than Piper, and took every opportunity to remind her of it by going out and drinking, partying, blowing whatever money came her way and earning the rest of it without scruples. Like Piper she was stacked, with tan olive skin and thick black hair cut short above her shoulders. Unlike Piper, she was seriously hung over, and dressed in her jammies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so your girlfriend.\u201d Parker said with her eyes shut as she laid on the couch, \u201cThe one from Arizona.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDakota, Texas, and no.\u201d Piper rolled her eyes as she opened the door, \u201cBye Parker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeuces.\u201d Parker spat back as the door shut behind her little sister...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe streets of Daven\u2019s Port had always been a more welcome home to Piper than her actual home had ever been. The people knew her name, they didn\u2019t complain when she got stuff wrong, and nobody (well, nobody she\u2019d ever encountered) was hung over on a regular basis. The shop owners on the pier knew her, the street merchants gave her free hot dogs sometimes; life out here was usually a lot better than life in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of her issues came from Parker, unsurprisingly. She had always been a pain in the ass, but it was like ever since Dad left she had gone out of her way to be as <i>un-</i>helpful as possible. Which, with her constant partying and binge drinking, turned out to be very unhelpful. For God\u2019s sake, their mom was <i>pregnant</i> and she didn\u2019t even want to get a job to help keep food on the table...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, no time to dwell on all that now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper\u2019s Mom had been getting cravings out her wazoo ever since she entered her third trimester. Maple syrup on everything, off-brand chocolate from the gas station and <i>only</i> the gas station, midnight ice cream binges that nobody woke her up for... it was starting to get a little hard to keep up with!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially since, once again, it all fell on <i>Piper</i> to make sure that she got what she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t drive, so it wasn\u2019t like she could go pick up the week\u2019s worth of groceries it would take to feed everyone. But she could at least go out and get a few things to make life a little easier. Everything in Daven\u2019s Port was just a long walk or a bus ride away. And thankfully, her mom\u2019s cravings were just diverse enough that she could still get out and stretch her legs, see some friendly faces while she shopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, c\u2019est Piper!\u201d came the jovial, foreign tone of the best baker in town, \u201cCome in, come in! I have just put, eh, chocolate croissants in ze oven!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasil Moreau was just one of the many folks in Daven\u2019s Port who had succumbed to Piper\u2019s charm. He was a plump french immigrant (legal, she figured) with two kids. He owned La Bonne Boulangerie, which seemed to cater exclusively to chocoholics and her mother. She had started coming in during her sophomore year and by now, after she\u2019d just graduated a month ago, the Moreaus were like old family friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018Ow iz your mama, huh?\u201d Basil asked with a smile behind his tweedily french moustache, \u201cStill, uh... <i>eh</i>?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held out his hands in front of his belly to pantomime a larger, supposedly pregnant belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, she\u2019s still pretty eh. Kinda the reason I\u2019m here.\u201d Piper said with a smile as she whipped out her phone and started reading off her mom\u2019s list, \u201cI need, uh... a chocolate cake and... an order of sugar cookies and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice it to say, Piper walked out of that place with half the damn bakery in tow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly her mother could crave such an inordinate amount of sugar during her pregnancy. She said she always had a craving for <i>something</i> when she was pregnant with her and her sister. With her it had been ice (which is why she was so cool! ba-dum-dum-tiss!) and with Parker it had been dirt. Her mom often joked that, because of all the sweets she\u2019d been eating, this child was going to turn out a lot sweeter than her other ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause Piper was <i>not</i> doing all this running around, giving up being the baby of the family, and hooking her mom up with enough sweets to induce a diabetic coma to raise another Parker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the doorbell chimed behind her, Piper waving a goodbye to the jovial baker inside, her phone started to vibrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a text from her mom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hey Piper while youre out would you mind...?</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Piper couldn't help but roll her eyes as she read her mom's message. She's already been out burglaring bakeries all morning, so why <i>wouldn't</i> she want to run right out and get fast food too? It's not like she was an octopus\u2014where was she supposed to put all this stuff on the way home?  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nBut Piper had learned over the course of her life, and especially since her Mom's hormones had started going into overdrive, that there were some battles that could be fought, and others that it was just best to let them be. A hungry, cravings-fueled pregnant woman was not an opponent Piper was in the mood to face right about now. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Mom.\" She said aloud as she typed out her response, \"Nevermind the fact that I've got exactly one free hand and you totally <i>won't</i> pay me back...\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div> <br>\r\n <br>\r\nGrowing up, Piper and her family never did much eating out. Because, you know, that costs money. Even when her Dad was around, and when there was actually income coming in, eating out was reserved for special occasions. Birthdays, good grades, and general bribery were usually the only reasons that Piper would walk through the glass double doors of places like Big Burger. Granted that had changed lately, on days that Mom didn't feel like cooking particularly, but the smell of grease and fast food still wasn't something that Piper had gotten used to. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nBig Burger was this chain that reached all across the nation (supposedly\u2014Piper never got far past the Port). It had this retro 50's thing going on. Chrome walls and tables, red everything else. The employees wore white uniforms with dopey little paper hats. There was a long silver counter where you placed your order on one side and got it on the other. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nPiper had guessed it was pretty popular, judging by the fact that it was a Tuesday afternoon and the whole place was jumpin'. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nSummer time in Daven's Port meant that all the stupid teenagers (herself included) were out of school and had officially moved into \"free-range\" territory. Mindless, wandering drones capable only of satisfying their baser urges like cramming fries into their face and complaining about people they didn't like or shows they'd seen on TV.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<i>Not taking care of a pregnant mother...</i> Piper mentally added with a roll of her eyes. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnyway, suffice it to say, the wait to place her order was a long one. And the box of baked goods held by the handle seemed to get heavier with every customer in front of her... <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Hey there, welcome to Big Burger!\" Said a perky little redhead in one of those stupid hats, \"Would you like to try our Memphis BBQ Big Burger today? It's a dollar off!\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"No thanks. I mean, I <i>would</i> except, you know, the order's not for <i>me</i> and... well, you get it.\" Piper prattled as she whipped out her phone with her free hand, tapping it awake and squinting at her Mom's very specific instructions, \"Lemme get a, uh... Big Double Cheeseburger, extra onions no pickles... a Big Fish Sandwich, extra mayonnaise, some fries...\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nPiper could have sworn that the line got longer by the time she was finished. That poor little twat behind the counter couldn't keep up with her order if her life depended on it! So she had to keep going back, repeating herself, correcting her mistakes... Why was it so damn hard to listen to what she was saying and push a damn button?  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nOkay, fine, a <i>series</i> of damn buttons. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nUgh... how was it that her mom the pregnant one and <i>she</i> was the one who was so grouchy all the time? <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAt least it didn't take long for her order to be ready. The sweaty teens working in the kitchen plopped a fresh, greasy bag of fast food right in front of her and called out her order number. Juggling her phone and her mom's bakery bundle, Piper did her best to grab the bag with her remaining few fingers. She managed, somehow, and started walking towards the door... <br>\r\n <br>\r\nBVVT BVVVT! <br>\r\n <br>\r\nPiper felt her phone vibrate in her hands and barely contained what would have been a very audible groan of displeasure. It was probably her mom asking her what was taking so long. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nOh look, surprise surprise, it was! Now Piper not only had to carry everything out all the way home before the grease managed to eat through the bag, she <i>also</i> had to henpeck her pointer finger on the keyboard so her mom didn't\u2014WOOF! <br>\r\n <br>\r\nPiper suddenly collided into something\u2014both her parcels fell right to the ground, along with her phone!  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Ah shit, sorry about that...\" Piper shot down to the ground, \"I-I'm in kind've a hurry y'know? Really sorry...\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nPiper looked up, only to find that she'd bumped into... </span></div></div>",

Back to whatever gutter you crawled out of?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nStanding above her, eclipsing the tacky fluorescent lighting that reflected off of every-fucking-thing ever so slightly, was the girl who had been the bane of Piper's existence for the better part of her adolescent life. The girl who had picked on her for being poor, for her sister being a slut, for the music she liked, and for how she dressed literally from the day they were enrolled in the same high school\u2014Kara Cutter. She was the one piece of baggage that Piper had honestly thought she had left behind on the graduation stage. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnd now here she was, staring her in the face like she was right back in high school. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nGoddammit. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Oh, it's just you.\" Piper dropped the niceties, narrowing her brown eyes to olive slits at the sight of her most heinous enemy, \"I'm sorry, I thought I bumped into a person. Instead of, you know, a trash can.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You're calling <i>me</i> trash?\" Kara scoffed from behind her cheap, $3 sunglasses from Claire's, \"That's rich.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nKara was everything that Piper hated about high school, all summed up into one person. She was one of those girls who was completely obsessed with where everyone was and what they were doing, constantly on her phone and talking incessantly about this person or that person. She lived on the better side of town, and came from a pretty well-off family, but she still dressed like a beach rat. Halter tops, cutoffs, flip flops. With her cheap-looking platinum blonde dye job and those aforementioned sunglasses\u2014<i>UGH</i>. Piper friggin <i>hated</i> her! <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Look, unless you haven't noticed, this is a place of business. Not highschool.\" Piper waved a hand out for all bitches to see, \"Don't want any trouble. Just tryin' to get my mom some food here\u2014you and I have no beef.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yeah, only 'cause you can't afford it.\" Kara's sneer intensified, \"In the sense that you know I can kick your ass and, you know, you're poor and literally can't afford it.\"  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nPiper felt her chest puff out. The fire in her belly started roaring. She'd been taking shit from Kara for four years, and she'd never once just decked her one. It would have solved her problems in freshman year, and it would solve her problems now. All it would take was one good sunglasses-shattering punch, and Kara Cutter would be out of her life for the better... <br>\r\n <br>\r\nBVVT! BVVT! <br>\r\n <br>\r\nIF only her phone hadn't made her hesitate. Her mom would kill her if she got into another fight. On public property. Where she could be arrested. Or at the very least, be reprimanded by the police for so long that her food got cold and/or stale. Piper had to be the good daughter. To take care of her mom. Even if it meant <i>not</i> dealing with bitches like Kara Cutter who <i>seriously</i> needed to be dealt with. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"408!\" The kid from behind the counter called out. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nIn Piper's moment of hesitation, she saw Kara's eyes flick over to the counter. The receipt in her hands had 408 in big black lettering, held so that Piper could just make it out. A small smile spread across her face when she realized that Kara's short shorts were looking a little tight. There was a slight curvature to her usually very flat stomach. Piper looked her up and down for show, which caused Kara to brace herself for impact. Poor little confrontational Kara must have been shocked when all Piper had to say was: <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Enjoy your food, Kara.\" with a little snort as she walked out the door <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, I <i>will</i>!\" Kara called out, loud enough to attract some attention, \"You...you fucking transient!\" </span></div></div>",

Piper quickly followed the source of the shouting and found her pregnant mother still red in the face from shouting, slumped in a chair by the kitchen table, next to an empty jar of pickles an empty carton of ice cream. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOoooh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d She moaned. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a lifesaver Piper.

I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what I did so right with you, but I hope I do it again with this one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She said, moving her hand gently over her engorged and gravid tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Piper smiled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWas it lots of Pizza?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Harper said excited enough to put down her food for a second. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou wanted donuts. Donuts, donuts, donuts, non-stop. I almost was sick of them after nine months.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlmost?\u00e2\u0080\u009d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really get sick of Donuts, Piper...speaking of...\u00e2\u0080\u009d She trailed off meaningfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are you thinking, Mom?\u00e2\u0080\u009d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cNext time you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re out could you pick me up a dozen donuts from D\u00e2\u0080\u0099s? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m thinking liiiike, three Boston cremes, no, four, two jelly donuts, two strawberry icing and sprinkles two chocolate cream, 4 vanilla creams...\u00e2\u0080\u009d Harper enthused, counting on her fingers and then looking around at the food she got for something sweet. She found the rugelachs she got from the bakery, but it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite fill the niche. \u00e2\u0080\u009c...oooh and some glazed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cMom that's already 14 donuts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Piper pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cShit.

But sure enough, there standing above her, was an old face that thought she would have never seen again! It had been so long, but there was no mistaking Cierra Collins\u2014like, the <i>one</i> person who made living in her neighborhood bearable. At least, until she moved on up to Midtown. After she graduated, Piper had to go through a whole year of high school without her! With everything that had been going on, she had almost completely forgotten about her!  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Cierra!\" Piper leapt off of the floor with a squeal as she wrapped her arms around her long lost friend, \"I haven't seen you in forever!\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well, I've been here.\" the older girl said as she wrapped her soft brown arms around Piper's shoulders and gave her a good squeeze, \"Where have <i>you</i> been? You, like, dropped off the face of the earth!\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nPiper hadn't much time for social interaction with everything that had been going on in her life. What with the divorce and the pregnancy and dealing with it all in her own patented \"fuck you stay out of my business\" way. It had been a hard year! In her defense though, Cierra was already a year older than Piper. She had graduated a few months before Piper's dad left. It had just been so hard to make time to see each other, but now... it was just so good to see her! <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Easy girl, I <i>am</i> on the clock you know.\" Cierra said with a final squeeze before separating herself from Piper, \"Can't let my manager think I just come up and molest all our customers.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nCierra was in the exact opposite position as Piper right about now. Her single mother with two kids lucked out and married some computer guy, and it wasn't long until they moved to the better side of town once they could afford it. Why she was working <i>here</i> when her family had more money to play around with than Piper could shake a fist at was another question, but one for a later time.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"So you work here, huh?\" Piper raised an eyebrow, \"Well I guess that explains the uniform. And the stupid hat.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You don't like the hat?\" Cierra frowned as she took it off her head, \"I think it's cute!\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"No, Cee, it's not.\" Piper shook her head, \"Not cute.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Like a little sailor?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"No.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nIt was nice to know that, out of all the changes she'd been facing the past few months, Cierra had managed to stay more or less the same since Piper had last seen her. She had a new hairdo, and she'd filled out a little, but Cierra was still very much the same little street rat that she used to skip classes and loiter with. Cierra's wide hips strained the fabric on her white pants, and Piper could see her breasts spilling over the cups of her bra through her button-up. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Woah there, what's with the door stopper?\" Cierra said as she noticed Piper's order, sitting on the floor, \"You hungry, Piper?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What? No.\" Piper laughed, \"Just cravings.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"<i>What?</i>\" Cierra's brown eyes shot open, \"You're <i>pregnant?</i>\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"No no no no, Mom.\" Piper corrected herself, \"<i>Mom's</i> pregnant. I'm just the delivery girl.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Cierra's expression flipped, \"Well in that case... <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A guy in a hurry bustled passed Piper, yacking away on his cell phone. He turned briefly to acknowledge her, and the spilled cake stuck to the floor, and shrugged as he headed out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, fuck you TOO asshole!\" Piper yelled after him, loud enough the employees to jump, before realizing a fight wasn't going to happen, and sipping back into their routine. It made Piper feel better for a moment. But only for a moment. After that the depression and gnawing anxiety of poverty sunk in. She numbly watched as an employee brought a push broom and started cleaning up the sad remains of the cake and the scattered cookies across the floor. God, was there anything sadder than a spilled cake?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no money to get another one. There was, honestly, no money for that one, but she had tapped into their remaining reserves anyway. And that money would be gone forever. Because thee was no money coming in, just a dwindling supply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Piper was tired of it. As she left Big Burger she came to a decision. She was going to have to turn their financial situation around, above all, she was going to turn HER financial situation around, no matter what it took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Piper set to work with trembling fingers. Parker was out on the town, hopefully she'd be gone until dawn. But her mother was in the other room, behind paper thin walls. She had explained the situation, and Harper understood, but she could tell it was a blow to her. Sometimes Piper wondered how much the food cravings were the result of pregnancy, and how much of them were her way of dealing with the stress of finances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Piper reminded herself, she was fixing that. If her mother barged in, she would explain that, and understand, she hoped. Maybe she even would be grateful! Maybe. It was a household full of liberated women, kind of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper took a picture of her learners permit, and uploaded it to her computer. The birthdate clearly indicated that she was 18 years old\u2026for the last 4 days. The birthday party had been rather subdued this year. Still, it counted. This would all be legal and above board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext she took a picture of herself. The kind of selfie she usually avoided. She tugged at the neckline of a halter top she had stolen from Parker giving the camera a lens full of olive cleavage. Some clever cropping hid her hand, and the fact that her shirt couldn't possibly hang like that, and even the fact that there was a limit to her cleavage. It just plunged off the bottom of the frame, making it seem like she had boobs as big as you could imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA profile name, and a few minutes to for them to verify her ID and she was ready. This was happening. Piper Black, Cam Girl. She had thought about this a while, even before her father left. It's not like they could ever turn down the money, and when you're stacked like Piper, you don't make it through puberty without a few men 'suggesting' a few ways to make easy money. But now, pushed over by this latest desperation, Piper couldn't imagine not taking the easy money. \"Let's do this.\" she said, before turning on the cam, and opening a room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then\u2026nothing. There was no one there. For twenty long, agonizing minutes. And during that time the butterflies in her stomach died and turned sour. The first one popped in then immediately logged off. That hurt her confidence even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut eventually someone came in and started chatting with her. He wasn't spending money, so Piper just chatted with him a little while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my first time, lol. I have no idea what I'm doing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, that's fine gurl. You got all the necessary qualification there, lol. What cup size are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K cup.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Piper got her first tip. It was only the equivelant of fifty cents in tokens, but it boosted her confidence a little that this wasn't a huge mistake. One person became a couple, she did a few private shows with them getting topless, but for the most part, she just hung out in a chatroom for the night, talking to strangers. Not thrilling, but not bad either. And by the end of the night, she had made fifty dollars. She did some quick math in her head, and realized she made like 15 dollars an hour. That was better than a real job!</span></div></div>",

She was this lanky little thing fresh from somewhere the fuck ever in Texas, still all mopey from the move. Piper had met her when she was hiding out from the Kretcho twins in what just so happened to be Dakota\u2019s back yard. They\u2019d been pretty tight ever since. Hanging out at D\u2019s, getting her integrated to the Port, showing her around. Piper had probably known her for less than three months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was why, admittedly, this felt really weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t say that.\u201d Piper winced as she cleaned up her room a little--moreso out of anxiety than out of any real sense of cleanliness--\u201dThat\u2019s literally like the worst thing you could say right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I mean it\u2019s <i>True</i>...\u201d Dakota shrugged slightly, \u201cI-I mean, no judgement or anything girl it\u2019s just... you know, not how I imagined spending my Friday night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had taken some doing, but Piper had managed to get her friend to come this far into the game. It had taken some bribery (a whole round of donuts <i>and</i> a malt at D\u2019s. Dakota\u2019s allegiance did not come cheap!) but Dakota had come around. Once Piper explained the situation, what she was doing and why she was doing it, and threw in a bullshit line about it being \u201cempowering\u201d for her to have men to py her to do stuff with her own body, Dakota just sort\u2019ve fell into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least, that\u2019s what Piper had thought that afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDee, listen, I...\u201d Piper bit at her bottom lip, \u201cI need this, okay? My Mom needs this. My sister needs this... hell, even Parker needs this.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPiper, you don\u2019t <i>have</i> to be a cam girl...\u201d Dakota shifted in her stance, \u201cI-I mean, you could get a job... I hear that Abida\u2019s looking for someone to dust her shop. A-And there\u2019s always Big Burger--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDee, I don\u2019t know what you were told growing up in your precious little nuclear family bubbe, but those jobs <i>don\u2019t pay well.</i>\u201d Piper frowned spectacularly, \u201cYou think I <i>want</i> to do this? My Mom needs money, my sister\u2019s incapable of holding down her drinks, let alone a job, and we\u2019ve got another mouth to feed on the way! I need...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper paused, taking deep breaths. Her full bottom lip quivered ever so slightly. Her brown eyes were misty, and her tone uncertain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota took a step forward in consolation, but wisely retreated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just need to help Mom stay on her feet til the baby comes, okay?\u201d Piper said solidly, more resolutely, \u201cThen we\u2019ll... work something else out. Okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Okay...\u201d Dakota said with a frown, plopping down on Piper\u2019s old squeaky mattress, \u201cI just... you know, wish there was something I could do to help...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Piper grabbed her video camera. It was one of the newer models, purchased from one of the aforementioned Kretcho twins for, like, sixty bucks last Summer. Was it hot? Probably. But that didn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t have a high quality camera, perfect for taking sexy pictures and recording risque videos of herself with. With that and Parker\u2019s old webcam hooked up to her laptop, Piper had set herself up a nice little studio to get things rolling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can.\u201d Piper said, tossing Dakota her camera, \u201cJust hold the camera.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota looked at the device with some hesitation. She turned it in her hands, rolling it to either side as if she were looking for something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust... hold the camera?\u201d Dakota repeated uneasily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust hold the camera.\u201d Piper said with an affirmative nod, \u201cAnd try not to make too many noises.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A combination of photosets with Dakota, webcam sessions, and a few guest sets on other sites with names like \"bignaturals.net\" got her an established web presence. Her Instagram had several thousand followers, she got more subscribers every month, and  for the first time, in a long while, Piper had free spending money thanks to her new gig, and she was enjoying. Dakota would get her share of the income, and they'd hit the pier, stop wherever they wanted, eat out for dinner more often, maybe catch a movie and order snacks at the exorbitant prices the concession stands demanded. After all, for the first time in her life, Piper could afford it, and she was proud of that fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all this easy spending and easy living was catching up to her. She hadn't notice yet, but her bra's were definitely tighter, and her belly was starting to...well, she had a little belly, now, where before it had all been tight and firm. Not enough for her to notice, and not enough to get her fans up in arms (especially since there was a delay in content for her website. The photosets and videos going up this week were shot 6 weeks ago.) but enough that she had a little bronze pooch going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she put on her headset turned on her webcam that evening, she was wearing a belly tee that let a hint of underboob show and a pair of hotpants with thin suspenders. She'd gotten the outfit that day and thought it looked great, sexy in an adorable way. She'd even done her hair in braided pigtails to match the style she was going for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the cam show went live, it filled up quickly. Her viewers has steadily grown, though had plateaued recently. Within a few minutes it became clear that though the crowd wasn't larger tonight, there was a lot of 'new faces'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, guys,\" Piper said, flirty and playing with her suspenders. \"Ooh, I see some new names today.

The usual ones came in first, paying the minimum pledge for a request. Can she take her top off? Can she jump up and down? One guy was creative enough to ask her to mash her breasts with her suspenders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, about 15 minutes in, she got a big fat $20 tip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Luvembig:</b> \"Can you play with your belly?\"<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a new one,\" she laughed. She started rubbing it with both hands, like if she was playing with her breasts. \"This isn't a shoe on head thing, is it?\" she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>420_xxx_420:</b> \"no. it's hot. you got a lovely tummy.\" <br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCame the first response. The chat then immediately broke out into a flame war, with roughly half of the viewers, many of them older viewers who had been following her since her earliest shows asking her to stop and go back to boobs, but the new comers cheering her on. Before she could even intervene to start quelling it down or kicking people, she got another $5 tip <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>420_xxx_420:</b> \"Keep showing belly.\" <br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nThe fans might be split, but they pay certainly wasn't. And Piper was doing modeling for one reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, boys, if you want something, put your money where your mouth is,\" she said, continuing to work on her belly. She figured just rubbing was probably getting boring, so she changed things up by pinching it and pushing against either side of it to make it stick out more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother $2.00 tip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>420_xxx_420:</b> \"Puff it out for us.\"<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did so, sucking in as much air as she could to make it look as big as possible until she finally had to let it out in a big whoosh, giggling. She still didn't know how serious this was, but it was fun as hell, and they were paying either way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got some approval from the newcomers. Then another big fat tip came in. $30 dollars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Biged232:</b> \"order a pizza\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was crazy, in the last 10 minutes, Piper had earned nearly $60 dollars! That was more than she earned in an hour most of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't wait to tell Dakota all about this. Maybe she was getting an idea of what the crowd wanted, or maybe the requests had tapped into some subconscious part of her, but she picked up the phone and, still posing and playing with her belly for the camera, ordered an extra large with everything on it. After, she made a kissy face at the camera and asked, \"Is that how you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>I <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> (. ) ( .):</b> \"<img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">\"<br>\r\n<b>Biged232:</b> \"Beatiful\"<br>\r\n<b>420_xxx_420:</b> \"8=======D\"<br>\r\n<b>MainMan69:</b> \"Fucking fetishists.

Piper  wasn't familiar with this one, but she was having fun. And at least they were being nice about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to show off and take requests until the doorbell rang. \"Ooh, it's here. Don't go away.\" She waggled her butt at them before running off to get the door. When she came back, she opened the box to show it off and took a long sniff. \"Mm, smells good. I'm half tempted to eat this on camera.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Big&amp;Bigger:</b> \"Do it!\"<br>\r\n<b>420_xxx_420:</b> \"Yes\"<br>\r\n<b>Luvembig:</b> \"That's what it's for.\"<br>\r\n<b>Biged232:</b> \"sorry.

I was hungry anyway.\" She leaned back in her chair with her legs spread apart and the pizza open between them, then found the biggest slice (it took both hand to hold) and raised it to her mouth. \"Mm, sho gud,\" she moaned, speaking through a mouthful. \"God, I love pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>I <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> (. ) ( .):</b> \"Hot\"<br>\r\n<b>SSBBWLover: </b>\"You should eat it more often then ;)\"<br>\r\n<b>LadiesMan123:</b> \"Fuck this, I'm out.\"<br>\r\n<b>LadiesMan123 has left the chat<br>\r\n</b><b>YoungFapper:</b> \"Later fatass.

The results were...a little intriguing, and a lot of shocking. She knew lots of guys liked a little something to grab on to. She even had one or two boyfriends who told her she'd look better that way. But these girls were HUGE. She couldn't believe anyone got off of this stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"></div>At first. She kept digging. She found out yes, her experience in the chat was not unique. These girls got paid well. Some of them made six figures! Some of them didn't even model and they got all kinds of donations! They just threw up the occasional image on social media like Instagram or...FeedMe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"></div>FeedMe was an entire social media platform dedicated to the sexual thrill of men and women getting fatter. Piper couldn't believe such a thing existed, but she was rapidly acclimating to this strange world. She was learning all the lingo. She was even starting to 'get' the fetish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"></div>She'd had lots of weird requests before, and they basically broke into two categories. Those she didn't get, and those she did get but wasn't necessarily into. The requests for her in clown makeup? Those she didn't get, and she hoped to god she never would. The requests for her begging her fans to impregnate her? Those she got. It was kind of awesome to throw caution to the wind, and fully accept the consequences of sex. She wouldn't actually do it, but there was something more 'real' about it then the phone simulacrum of sexual offers she usually purveyed these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"></div>And now? Getting fat was moving from Category A to Category B. Her tits were looking huge these days, and wasn't that what everyone was here for anyway? Her butt was looking fuller too. The only thing she couldn't get into was her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"></div>Her belly...she rubbed it ruefully as she thought about it and stared at the profile creation screen at FeedMe. She had selected a carefully cropped photo of her cleavage that left that detail out...as well as her face. She didn't want to be seen here...at least not yet. Her thoughts turned back to her tummy. It wasn't getting any smaller. This would probably make it worse. <i>'Oh fuck'</i> she realized. <i>'If I don't do this, I'm going to have to start a diet.' </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"></div>Her 'fans' had already started complaining, calling her a pig, or a cow, or a lazy fatass and yelling at her to lose some weight. Some fucking fans. At least these pervs showed her some appreciation! They treated her like a fucking goddess, they kept her and her family fed, so why <i>shouldn't</i> she go where the money is. She defiantly clicked 'complete' on her profile, and boldly plunged into the world of fat fetishism.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As a general rule, Piper liked to keep an open mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKink-shaming wasn't cool, and she knew that. It was just... she was having a lot of trouble really getting <i>into</i> this whole Fat Fetish thing. Maybe it was just because she didn't have that switch flipped in her brain when she was born? It was hard to see the appeal in what some of these guys (or girls... were there watching her?) liked so much about her putting on weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that being said, these guys paid out the nose for things that Piper would have just wound up doing off the camera anyway. Things like untucking from her sweatpants or taking off her bra, eating a whole pizza in one sitting. Things that she definitely <i>liked</i> to do and <i>knew</i> how to do, suddenly became top-tier sex appeal for a bunch of horny dudes (or ladies!) on the internet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she was ever going to make a living off of this, she needed help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sifting through hundreds of just plain creepy profiles, it became clear that there was only one person who would be able to help her figure this out for herself. And not molest-and-or-murder her during. Another girl on the site that went by MellyJellyBelly, real name Melanie Carlyle. According to the badges on her profile she'd been on FeedMe for at least three years now. Sitting across from her at Big Burger, Piper believed that she'd been into this fetish for that long - if not longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelieve it or not, it was <i>Mel</i> who did the double take when they met up. The size of Piper's chest was enough to boggle the mind, even to a girl who probably outweighed her three times over! She was a big creamsicle colored puddle in the booth, and she had the audacity to shout out <i>oh dang</i> at the sight of someone with giant breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"QueenOfCups?\" Mel asked, pointing a thick finger Piper's way, \"That <i>has</i> to be you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper smiled and raised her arms out for a hug, only to realize that Mel hadn't managed to stand up yet. It was a hard habit to break when you knew just about everyone in town. She'd been talking with Mel for two weeks now, and already felt like they knew one another pretty well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would have thought that she would have <i>warned</i> Piper about how big she was. The cameras somehow made her look smaller, more manageable within the confines of her laptop monitor. But to see her smothering the poor Big Burger booth like that, her stomach rolling and folding over the table as it spread out between her thighs, there was no denying that Mel was <i>huge</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gimme a sec...\" Mel grunted, panting as she stood to full height, \"<i>Phew</i>thesethingsaresmallhere...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them embraced, Mel pulling Piper close into her stomach. Piper could barely wrap her arms around Mel's upper torso, deploying its own spare tire of fat to help contribute to her overall blobby physique. Her stomach might as well have been an airbag, keeping the two of them from colliding - Piper <i>fell</i> into the hug more than she walked into it, swaddled by her superior stuffer's suffocating amounts of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are <i>busty</i>, Cups.\" Mel laughed, still catching her breath, \"Jeez... I thought I'd walk in here wanting to call you Queenie, but with those things... <i>Jesus Christ</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't <i>hate</i> Queenie...\" Piper contemplated, \"But Cups is way better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no small amount of pride, she adjusted her signature breasts. Sure, she was here to learn how to play this whole \"chubby chaser/fa/whatever\" thing from the master, but it always felt nice when another girl complimented her tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You uh... wanna get something to eat?\" Piper asked, \"My treat, since you drove all the way out here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, you <i>do</i> need help.\" Mel said with a chin-rippling laugh and a stroke of her stomach, \"I'd eat you broke before I got <i>close</i> to full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper grimaced. She supposed that she was right - Mel didn't get that body by eating whole pizzas in one sitting. She must have gotten that fat after <i>years</i> of stuffing herself for fans just like Piper's...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be a <i>lot</i> of work, wasn't it?</span></div></div>",

If someone like Dakota, or god forbid Zack, was holding the camera, that wouldn't just make modeling painfully awkward, that could mess up an entire friendship, and Piper wasn't going to do that. She was going to use someone desperate for cash like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Piper knew all kinds of people from hanging around the streets of Daven's Port. A few weeks ago she met Max, one of the alternative scenish bums that Piper naturally gravitated towards. The girl was denting cans for a discount at the ShopMart when they met. That certainly established that she needed the money as much as Piper (Piper had soon started copying that trick herself).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax had also awkwardly, very awkwardly, tried to make a pass at Piper. It happened to Piper a lot. It's why she got into this line of work. But it meant she had Max's phone number, and she didn't think Max would object to seeing her naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Piper worked up her courage, and made the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, is this Max?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Who's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Piper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026Piper Black?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piper with the huge tits?\" Piper tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey girl, I remember you! I was just joking. What makes you call your good friend Max?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would you like to make some easy money?\" Piper said, knowing just how to lure her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, your voice just gets sweeter and sweeter. What's the plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper rolled her eyes. She was beginning to have her doubts. Max was sounding a little TOO enthusiastic about this. \"I'm looking to get into modeling, and I need someone to hold the camera. Maybe do some web design<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of modeling, friendo?\" Max asks, with a bit of pressure in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Topless modeling.\" Piper admitted, feeling a little uncomfortable talking about it, especially to someone so\u2026obviously enthusiastic. That part of the job was still new to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you shoulda said that in the first place! Yup, I'm pretty much an expert on that,\" her voice took on a gruff matter-of-factness as she tries to assure Piper of her expertise. \"I can help you out, girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you have a camera?\" Piper asked, skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Course I do, girly,\" Max said, a bit too easily and optimistically. She probably meant her phone. Piper's bullshit alarm was going off, but she was also eager to see how far she could push this. \"And do you have lighting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, I got lights,\" Max said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And like, the screens to reflect them and shit?\" And this point, Piper was starting to laugh a little at Max. The situation had become comical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...?\" Max's imagination tried to run wild but just stumbled, giving her a blank when she tried to think what those could even be. It was slowly dawning on Max that watching a lot of pornography didn't exactly make her an expert on making it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. When can I come by for some pictures?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomorrow!\" Max immediately responded, and then smacked herself in the forehead loud enough that Piper could hear it on the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Text me the details, I'll see you there.\" Piper said distractedly. She hung up before she could get more of Max's cloying used car salesman routine and honestly expecting that to be the last she heard from her. Maybe the Kretcho twins would be more help?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unfortunately, it wouldn't get much better from there. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nMuch to Piper's chagrin, nobody could hang out with her today. Despite the fact that she and her friends had made <i>very detailed</i> plans to at least see each other, Dakota had other things to do (probably be homesick and sigh openly about how much she missed Texas for some reason) and Zack had gotten himself in trouble due to an unspecified incident with a certain under the pier party and underaged drinking that had landed him on the radio. That meant, unless Piper was willing to go face Zack's mom or brave Dakota's ennui, Piper had set that alarm for nothing. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nIt hadn't all been for naught though. At least she got to lay around in her jammies a little bit more. It wasn't like she could just go back to sleep after getting yelled at by everyone in the whole friggin house about how loud her alarm clock was, but she could at least spend a little time at home with her family. Even if that wasn't her <i>ideal</i> way of spending her Monday morning Piper supposed, begrudgingly that it would have to do. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe living room of the Black House was where most \"family bonding\" took place. Read that as \"watching TV and trying not to fight.\" There wasn't so much as a thing on television that Piper and her family couldn't argue about. But at least her Mom had laid down for a pregnancy nap. That only left her and her sister, Parker. Two lazy bums, one cozy couch. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nPiper was dressed in one of her old t-shirts and some sweats. Hillary Heart's logo looked awfully distorted stretched across her chest, but it was something of a collector's item. It was so comfy and warm, even though it hugged her tits so tight you couldn't make out the logo. Her sweats were all faded and gray\u2014Piper had spent many a night on this couch, wearing those things thin and breaking them in. Plus, staying in was an excuse not to do her hair. That always took super-friggin' long... <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Hey squirt, pass the remote.\" Her sister grumbled from the other side of the couch, \"Fuggin' hate Dr. Phil...\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe unforseen side-effect of having nothing to do before noon was that she was stuck with the <i>other</i> member of the house who constantly had no plans in the am, and that was her no-good sister Parker. Who could literally spend hours glued to the couch and not give a second thought about helping out around their shared living space or even offer to go do a grocery run. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nBut, you know, she was still fun. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhen it came down to it. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nSometimes. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe was at least good for a Steve Wilkos marathon. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe truth was that Parker and Piper had never really gotten along. Unless they were doing something illicit, then they got along <i>great</i>. But for the moments whe Piper felt like actually being a responsible human being (namely and particularly after her mother announced her pregnancy) the two constantly found themselves at odds. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Piper grunted as she leaned forward, tossing the remote to her ne'erdowell sister, \"Feel free.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nParker looked a lot like Piper did. Olive skin, stacked chest with thick dark hair and natural good looks. They both took after their mother, but Parker, in particular, was the good looking one of the family.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Great. Can't miss my shows...\" Parker grumbles, clearly still hung over after her latest adventure, \"Fuggin aaaaa... almost missed Steve...\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In turn, Piper punched her sister in the arm, \u201cWhy did you shut it, you bum.\u201d Parker quickly open palm slapped her sister on the right breast. Piper yelped and dodged back, rubbing her nipple for protection, \u201cYou cheap little bit-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother\u2019s voice shot down the stairwell again, \u201cPIPER!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get you,\u201d Piper snarled baring her teeth. Parker blew a raspberry in response. \u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201d As Piper ascended the stairwell the smell of lavender perfume stung her nose. Funny, she hasn\u2019t smelled that perfume since her mom had a job. Piper entered the doorway into her mother\u2019s room whom finished smooth out her outfit. Business casual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do I look?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d replied Piper garnering a curious look on her brow, \u201cWhat\u2019s the get up for?\u201d Never a week would go by without Harper Black putting on an overconfident smile on her face, \u201cI got hired as a secretary at an accounting firm downtown Daven\u2019s Port.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper couldn\u2019t deny that her mother tended to dress loosely around the house and neighborhood by wearing cheap-ragged shirts stretched over her impressive bust, barely covering her midriff, and shorts that hugged her hips and buttocks. Her hair usually a beautiful mess of black curly strewn about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting from the top, Harper\u2019s hair is as clean and as curly as ever. Curly deep black hair usually cascading down her back is neatly tied into an equally curly bun atop her dome. Her face is lightly touched with makeup. Nothing too extravagant, but some touches to made her face look slimmer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrying the baby had fluctuated Harper\u2019s appetite as of reason. She put on twenty pounds since the announcement, pushing her figure even fuller than it already is. With strange high calorie cravings coming and going as did her mood swings. Probably one of the reasons her father left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the effects of pregnancy, Harper\u2019s bust is accented in her outfit extremely well. Her grey v-neck showing off plenty of olive toned breast flesh. Going lower, Harper\u2019s waist is complimented graciously by the outfit, noted by at three months pregnant the baby bump is barely visible.<br>\r\nDown on her lower half, Piper spotted a flaw. She could tell that the skirt was much too tight. From the quaint little movements, her mother made from grabbing little things she needed for the day, she knew Harper would be tugging at that skirt constantly to keep it from riding up on her hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking in all of this, Piper felt like a bum in comparison. Dressed in a too tight t-shirt, worn out sweat pants, and her long black hair in a rat\u2019s nest. But, she was a comfortable bum. Her mother is showing rare decency, however in a tight outfit like this in a business environment\u2026\u201dAre these dudes going to be keeping their hands to themselves?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper scoffed, \u201cDear, you know I can full on handle myself.\u201d The last thing Piper wanting to happen to her mother is become eye candy for a bunch of balding forty-year-old suits. Suddenly, the secretary position made sense. Hopefully, Harper would steer clear of any suggestive work she might be submitted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPiper, I\u2019m not going to be around the house often or very much while I\u2019m working this job.\u201d Harper petted her daughter\u2019s head. Piper bit her lip, she nearly made the remark that Harper would be spending more time at someone else\u2019s house after work. \u201cAnd since I\u2019m going to not be around the house I need you and your sister to start pulling your weight around here rather than pulling each other\u2019s hair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper stomped her foot on the ground, \u201cC\u2019mon, Mom.\u201d Harper turned quickly after the two exited her room, \u201cNo \u201cC\u2019mon\u201d\u2019s at my house,\u201d Harper\u2019s bottomless brown eyes peered down at her offspring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah. Keep it at work.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper huffed, crossing her arms over her bosom, \u201cYes, Mom.\u201d Piper swiped a loose strand of hair from her eyes. Harper smiled, \u201cGood. So\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her hands traveled up onto her hips and she puffed out her chest just a little bit, \"<i>And</i> I'll let you live. <i>Maybe</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them laughed. Piper and her mom had always gotten along like this. It seemed everyone in her family did. It seemed just as natural for Piper to give her mother a hard time as it did for her to breathe air, or to punch Zack in the arm every time he made a stupid joke. This was just how things were done in this household\u2014bitch, bitch, do it, then bitch some more. It wasn't exactly a direct process, but it got the job done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Piper smiled and wrapped her arms around her mom, \"Knock 'em dead, killer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you.\" Harper hugged her youngest (soon to be middle) child tightly and gave her a kiss on the forehead, \"Good luck with your sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, good luck with those nasty old pervs checking you out all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piper!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" the punk proclaimed, \"You cannot be serious, thinking that they didn't just hire you because you're hot. Seriously, Ma!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Black house was a small one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was on the South side of town and, little history lesson here, was one of many cookie-cutter houses that used to house the factory workers in the old warehouses back in the 19-whatevers. From the outside, it was a run-down, rinky dink little love shack that looked to have seen better days. And on the inside, it was more or less the same. Questionable income aside, Harper hadn't exactly stressed a need to keep things looking spectacular, especially not lately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the areas where this was most evident was, of course, the attic\u2014why bother cleaning when you could just shove some stuff upstairs, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper and Parker hadn't been up there since they were little girls. They <i>used</i> to keep the Christmas Tree up here, before it caught fire that one time. So since Piper was about ten, she hadn't so much as set foot upstairs. And why would she? It wasn't like there was anything up there of hers. Or Parker's for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, her mom had a lot of junk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why</i> was this her responsibility again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ugh!</i> Mom's got so much <i>shit</i> up here!\" Parker griped, \"<i>Why</i> is this our responsibility again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Parker.\" Piper rolled her eyes, \"Just... get up here. And don' touch that pink stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvoiding the insulation, Piper and Parker Black deftly crawled up into the attic of their more-than-humble abode. It wasn't exactly spacious up there, and <i>boy</i> was it hot. Piper could already feel thick beads of sweat forming above her prominent black brow, and she felt moist somehow. This damn Summer heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you start over there...\" Piper grunted as she worked her way to a hunched standing position, \"And I'll start over here. It shouldn't take us more than a few hours to get everything\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my <i>gawwwd</i>...\" Parker was acting like a child, as if doing this <i>one</i> thing was going to kill her, \"This is gonna take <i>forever</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suck it up, butt munch.\" Piper punched her sister in the arm, causing a wince and recoil from the older Black sister, \"Mom asked us to do, like <i>one</i> thing. If we don't bitch and we don't whine, it shouldn't take us more than a few hours to get everything sorted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a heavy pause as Parker dragged herself to the other side of the attic and started pouring through boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows?\" Piper said aloud, mostly to herself, \"We might even find something cool...\"</span></div></div>",

Parker was too exhausted to even open her mouth and whine about being exhausted at this point, and Piper was fighting the urge to take out her frustration on all of her Mom's chintzy garbage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Least we got...one more thing...\" Piper wheezed as she stumbled towards the back of the attic, drenched in so much sweat that her shirt and hair were plastered to her skin. Parker moaned in agony, pounding her head against a sturdy support beam in frustration. \"H-hey...chin up sis...nearly done...then pizza...\" Parker fumbled about as she turned the heavy box around, trying to see if it had been labeled at all. She craned her neck to get a better look at the other side and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>HISSSSSSS</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAGH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper flung herself back in shock whacking her head on another support beam. Stars popped in front of her eyes as the angry possum hiding behind the box scurried away, slipping out the broken roof window and out of sight. Piper tried to get to her feet, but something creaked overhead and seconds later a big heavy object dropped from the roof, landing squarely on her lady parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurrk!\" Piper choked, clutching at her nethers as she gently flopped onto her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy fuck, Piper,\" the older sister said as she stumbled over the rafters. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper looked up at her sister, glaring through tears of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, stupid question,\" Parker admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, and with Parker's assist, the punk teenager was lying on the sofa recuperating from the assault on her ladynads, her legs twisted around her to protect herself from unwanted blows. In the other room, the attic door was slammed shut and Parker reappeared, offering Piper one of the two cans of Pepsi she had on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for keeping it interesting, I guess,\" Parker commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you,\" Piper mumbled, snatching one of the cans and opening it up with a pressurized hiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, at least we'll still get pizza!\" Parker said brightly. Her attitude had improved tremendously, possibly because she felt protective after seeing her curled up in pain for the past few minutes. Piper grunted, the feeling starting to come back to her at the refreshing taste of an ice cold drink. \"Right,\" Parker went on. \"So everything's labeled and sorted, except for, like that one last box that I couldn't open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last box?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, the one that tried to sterilize you?\" Parker leaned down to pick up an ornate, carved wooden box and set it on the coffee table. \"Like, I wonder where mom got it, I can't seem to open it.\" Piper reached out to run a hand over it, feeling how warped and ragged the surface was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure this belongs to mom?\" Piper asked. \"It looks really fucking old...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, she like has a lot of antiques though, doesn't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper lifted up her hand, coated in dust and old wood shavings. \"If this was an antique it wouldn't be peeling this badly.\" Turning it over in her hands, she gave it a shake, not hearing anything jostling around. Finding a rusted iron lock built into the side, Piper dug around in her pockets and pulled out a paper clip she was fiddling around with earlier, straightening it and sticking it into the lock on the side of the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piper that's not gonna-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker's mouth dropped open a little bit as the lid of the box lifted slightly, the locks popping open with a cheery metal ping. \"Since when could you pick locks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis, is that really a question you want an answer to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...no, no it isn't,\" Parker admitted. \"Seriously though, what's in this thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper carefully opened the old box, its hinges rusting over and decrepit and inside the felt-lined interior was...</span></div></div>",

It opened up from the top a good two inches down, decrepit and rusted metal squealing at being disturbed from their slumber as Piper slowly lifted the heavy lid back to reveal the box's contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sweet its a liquor box!\" Parker said suddenly and excitedly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Parker what the fuck is a liquor box?\" Piper leaned back and gave her sister a decent 'you're the biggest idiot I know' face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like some rich people used to keep their alcohol in personalized little boxes and shit way back when.\" she sounded all too certain about her hypothesis as she extended one hand over Piper's shoulder and towards one of the vials, \"C'mon, lemme see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper allowed her sister to take one of the vials from its crevice carved into the wood and felt. Parker took one of the middle ones, leaving two vials to the left and one to the right of the centered notches. Brandy-brown liquid sloshed in Parker's vial as she lifted it up in front of the light. Her pretty features squinting, she examined the small glass bottle with a surprising amount of intrigue and depth. Meanwhile, three other liquids of a similar shade and coloration sat undisturbed, still in the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like a whiskey.\" Parker pursed her lips a bit in concentration, \"This some kind of... shot glass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not really a glass if you can't put it down.\" Piper commented as she continued to examine the confines of the box, \"And shouldn't there be... I don't know, more of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check underneath the felt. It's probably a false bottom, rest of the liquor's in there.\" Parker said in a quick, almost prescriptive manner as she uncorked the vial and took a whiff\u2014immediately regretting her decision, \"<i>Fuck</i>, I think it's gone bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... know an awful lot about liquor boxes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>have</i> hobbies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper did as she was told and, sure enough, the part of the box that held the vials lifted right out. Underneath, the felt continued and insulated a rather large, spherical glass with a long thin bottleneck. It was big enough to touch the box's felt sides, and it had been there for so long that Piper struggled a bit to get it out. The decanter had a good weight to it, even held by the neck. But, curiously enough, instead of a crystal topper, it too had been corked. The same amber liquid sloshed inside the larger bottle as it did inside what Parker had (with surprising collegiate insight) declared to be a shot glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" Piper put the bottle down gently on the couch and reached back into the box, \"Some kind of... paper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Distillery notes, probably.\" Parker braved another sniff, \"People used to make their own alcohol, probably wanted to make more of it down the line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper unfolded the piece of parchment\u2014it felt like Bible paper, thin and delicate. The age of the document didn't help anything at all. Even unfolding it, Piper ripped it a little bit at the sides. Otherwise, it was in pretty good shape. The illustrations held up well enough, at least. But whether it was the age or just bad penmanship, she couldn't make heads or tails of whatever it actually said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was I right?\" Parker asked, clearly enjoying being good at this one thing, \"Come on, was I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't tell.\" Piper said with some strain, \"The handwriting is microscopic... and very angry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gimme that.\" Parker snatched the parchment away from Piper, crinkling it horribly and ultimately coming to the same conclusion, \"Fuck you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... liquor?\" Piper asked, gesturing to the disemboweled contents of their treasure chest, \"That's what I got my junk cratered in for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean... it's not a total loss.\" Parker held the uncorked glass up as if in a toast, \"There are worse things that we could have found up there. Like racy pics of Bubby Judy. Remember that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh fuck don't remind me.\" Piper shivered at the long-repressed memory, \"Okay, could be worse, so much worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper looked at the remaining three vials on the couch. Parker had been surprisingly good at convincing her that this was just a liquor box. Which, was, apparently a thing. The big bottle was the decanter, the little bottles were shot glasses, but why had they come pre-poured? And somehow the idea of old twentieth-century people lugging around a box that clocked in at a vagina-bustingly heavy weight just to keep their liquor and their <i>pre-poured shot glasses</i> safe didn't seem to jive well. So many questions about\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Tapdancing Christ Parker, what are you doing?!\" Piper shouted, stopping her sister mid-pour, \"You can't drink that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I almost dropped that, and I would have been so pissed.\" Parker pointed dangerously towards her little sister, \"<i>Why</i> can't I drink this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's old!\" Piper answered in bewilderment, \"I-It's gross a-and it's not yours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That has literally never stopped me from doing anything.\" Parker said with a flat face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, Parker\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, I'm kidding! <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Mostly</font>.\" Parker raised her glass again, \"Come on, we deserve it! We busted our asses cleaning out Mom's attic. We deserve a little bit more than pizza, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck Parker, I don't know.\" Piper grimaced at the glass vials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this gave her the creeps for some reason. As convincing as Parker's Liquor Box theory was, the idea of drinking strange liquids out of glasses that she didn't know rubbed Piper the wrong way. Everything checked out right, but something just made Piper's hair stand on end...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I won't even tell Mom.\" Parker said in her rare, halfway-decent Big Sister voice, \"We've got a new baby on the way, and we won't get to do this sisterly bonding thing a lot once we're up to our eyebrows in dirty diapers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker raised her glass again, just a little higher<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our little secret.\" Parker said with a smile that honestly made Piper believe she wasn't just doing this for the chance to daydrink, \"Promise.\" </span></div></div>",

The younger sister raised it to the same height as her older sister, clinking the glasses together and downing the booze at the same time. Parker slammed her glass down first, shortly followed by Piper. The two stared at one another, the corners of their mouths curling before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BLEEEEEARGH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe box went 2-0 against Piper, claiming her big sister as a consolation prize as the two collapsed onto their hands and knees, dry heaving from that rather revolting beverage. Even Parker, a seasoned veteran of dealing with lousy and nauseating beverages, was reduced to a quivering wreck by the contents of the 'liquor'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....<i>huuurk</i>....god...\" Piper moaned. \"It's like....liquid dumpster...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...full of wet dogs...\" Parker moaned in response, face half-smooshed against the ratty carpet. \"Fuck....I'm gonna hurl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazingly, the two managed to keep their lunch down despite rolling around on the carpet in agony for a good ten minutes until Piper managed to fight through it and escape to the fridge, returning with an extra soda for each to wash down...whatever the hell they just drank. Piper felt like she did when she came down from the attic after a grueling couple of hours working, and the soda might not have helped this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I'm gonna taste that in my nightmares...\" Parker said, sipping at her beverage. \"I think it's still curdling my insides.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper nodded in agreement, running her hand over her poor tummy. It did feel like the old alcohol was sitting well down there. \"I don't even think I'm getting a buzz...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, so that's not just me...ech...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a car door slamming shut suddenly rang through the air, followed by the distinctive crunch of gravel underfoot. The Black sisters exchanged a look, then glanced down at the booze box, a booze box they probably weren't supposed to be helping themselves to. Calling on years of experience covering up their activities before Mom got home, the girls sprang into action; Parker quickly refilled the two vials they emptied as Piper gathered up the papers and debris to return to the box, snapping it shut when Parker was finished. The door handle rattled as Piper dashed to her bedroom, chucked the box under a pile of dirty clothes, then leapt the back of the couch to land in a casual position as Harper Black shoved the door open with her hip, carrying a pair of pizza boxes with a soda in a plastic bag hooked onto her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girls!\" Harper announced brightly at the sight of the two sisters relaxing together on the couch. \"How did the attic cleaning go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfectly fine,\" Piper said, coolly sipping on her drink as her heart pounded in her chest. \"Everything's where it's supposed to be now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper raised an eyebrow. \"What an oddly specific way of phrasing that, Piper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, mom, we need to talk,\" Parker interrupted, rescuing Piper as she took out one of the photo albums that the girls found upstairs. \"Or should I say...\" she continued, opening to a specific page like a police officer presenting damning evidence. \"Miss Cheer Captain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" Piper shouted, unable to stop a grin from crossing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, you found those old things,\" Harper said, blushing but in a good-natured way. \"I should have known better then to let you two sneaks into all of my things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm picturing you in the skirt and pom-poms!\" Piper said, bursting into laughter. \"Holy shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I bet she dated the hunky football captain who became a superstar quarterback too!\" Parker joked with an elbow to Piper's shoulder, but was distracted by her mother looking at the ceiling with a guilty smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't...you fucking didn't...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daniel Fisher, Portland Privateers,\" Harper said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jaws of the Black sisters hit the floor. \"OH. MY. GOD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe box of bad booze lay forgotten in Piper's room as the Black family settled down for the evening, enjoying the pizza as a reward for a job well done and listening to the crazy tales of Harper's high school days, the backstory to old knick-knacks and toys found in the attic. Relief from the Black sisters at getting away with their abortive attempt at boozing and a great first day at work for their Mother made for a very positive and wholesome evening, with many laughs shared and more then a few tears as well. For the first time since Piper's dear old dad bolted, there was a feeling that things might turn out okay after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh, it's late,\" Harper suddenly interrupted her own story to reveal. \"I have to be up early as hell for the OB/GYN.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TMI, mom,\" Parker sniped, sipping on what was left of her soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, she doesn't have anything you don't have, what's TMI about it?\" Piper retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno,\" Parker said, stifling a lawn. \"Just...feeling really tired all of a sudden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...me too actually...\" Piper yawned, feeling her eyelids getting heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be tired after all your hard work today!\" Harper said proudly. \"Enjoy the feeling, soon you'll have trouble falling asleep no matter how hard you work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mooom...\" Piper groaned as her mother leaned in and gave her a peck on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and get some sleep, dear,\" Harper continued, trotting over to Parker to give her a peck as well, who was so tired she forgot to wince. \"You have the basement to clean out tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kidding,\" Harper giggled. \"Goodnight girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sisters groaned. \"Night, mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of collecting themselves, the Parker sisters managed to climb to their feet and trapse towards their bedrooms. Parker grunted something that could have been a goodnight as she turned into her bedroom, and Piper responded with a grunt of her own, stumbling into her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...tired...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTugging off her shredded jeans, something fluttered out of her pocket and landed in the corner where it wouldn't be spotted until morning. Shoving it into her pocket to evade her mother, Piper hadn't even noticed that the innocuous sheet stuck to one of the impossible to decipher parchments, with a message written in the same tiny writing but far clearer and somewhat legible even at this age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>My Dearest Abigail,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you for your recent letter. I am pleased to hear that Uncle Martin's business ventures have finally borne fruit. The man may be stubborn, but I cannot fault him for his spirit. I hope you and your father continue to thrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy efforts to combat the white plague continue, naturally. My attempts to combat the wasting away of flesh with my formula are so far unsuccessful; the restorative effect does not seem to combat the vile disease, merely alleviateing the symptoms for a period of time. Still, it seems the local Duchess and her court took an interests in the effects when the patient does not suffer from consumption, and their funding has been enough to keep me solvent. With good fortune, I will perhaps be able to come overseas for a visit soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, I'm sending you a sampling of the tincture for my colleague Dr. Tyler. I would send it myself, but the old fool never seems to have a consistent address. I would greatly appreciate it if you would leave this with him at your convenience, as his knowledge of biology might bear fruit. With any luck, when we next meet each other, the white plague will finally be vanquished and I can return home a hero. Until that time, I hope life treats you well, and that soon our family can be united once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarmest Regards,<br>\r\nMortimer Black</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper, naturally, was far too tired to even notice this as she collapsed back-first on her unmade bed, falling asleep the instant her head touched the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach curdled angrily as the tincture went to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper would sleep like a baby all through the night until she was suddenly woken up by-</span></div></div>",

All throughout the night, she had been having the strangest dreams. Getting trapped on a dessert island where everything was edible, and having to eat her way to safety. Mainlining a Vegas act with talking slices of pizza, and then scarfing her way down the chorus line. Bouncing through the stars on edible clouds made of fluffternutter as she slowly cleared the skies over the Eastern seaboard. A lot of grease on her stomach usually gave Piper weird dreams, but admittedly she didn't usually wake up <i>hungrier</i> than she did when she went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially after eating all that Pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuuuck...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper moaned as she slowly came to life, shaking the sleep from her shoulders and rising with some effort. Her back was sore and her muscles ached. Must have been from doing all that hard work yesterday. Her mom was right; she and Parker really wore themselves out cleaning out the attic. Her entire body felt heavy, and when she finally <i>got</i> to her feet, she felt like one of those baby horses taking their first step. Her legs felt like jell-o. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, her whole body felt strange. Like something was <i>wrong</i> somehow. It was hard to put her finger on, but there was definitely a <i>difference</i> this morning. Looking in the full-body mirror tucked away in he corner of her messy room, Piper could see no evidence of anything like that. She was the same old Piper black\u2014big tits, bedhead, and all. Although, standing at a certain angle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Fuuuuuck</i>...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper frowned at the small pooch on what she could have sworn to have been flat stomach. She'd <i>put in</i> her fat years as a kid. Now would be a really shitty time for her to have to start watching every piece of pizza that passed her lips. She was probably just bloated. Water weight, period, whatever, she told herself as she made slight adjustments to her posture in effort to hide the slight bulge of tum. It was <i>way</i> too early in the morning to start thinking up excuses as to why she had a little extra padding around her middle. Something smelled <i>way</i> too good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was <i>way</i> too hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgoing the habitual first-dibs bathroom hogging, Piper was further enticed to come into the kitchen by smell of sizzling bacon and cooked eggs hanging heavily in the house. Her naked feet touched linoleum as she took her first few steps inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma?\" Piper asked sleepily, \"Whatcha cookin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nine 'o' clock, Pitstain, Ma's at work.\" Parker said in a bored, occupied tone of voice as she stood in front of the not-often-used Black Family oven, \"Makin' breakfast, you want some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, cool.\" Piper scooched a chair out from underneath the dinner table, \"Wait, did you say nine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nine.\" Parker reiterated flatly, nibbling on a piece of bacon<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one after eight, before ten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last week you threatened to strangle me for waking you up at ten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker piled two plates high with bacon and eggs and placed them on the serving dish that their mother had gotten four or five years ago at a yard sale. They'd almost never had a use for it until now, and it was just the right size for Parker's prodigious breakfast. Piper had honestly expected for Parker's one activity to have gotten her through the rest of the month, milking her part of cleaning the attic for all it was worth <i>not</i> to do anything. But here she was, making breakfast for the two of them! Despite her relative inability to do much of anything, she was surprisingly capable when it came to breakfast food\u2014and only breakfast food. \"Hangover food\" was what she called it. And aside from the fact that she cooked her eggs runny, Piper had little reason to complain about it. Especially not this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't sleep.\" Parker said in a sort of not-all-there-yet way, piling her own plate high with food before relinquishing the breakfast spread to her little sister, \"I had the weirdest dream about eating a giant marshmallow, and I was afraid that I was gonna wake up and my pillow would be gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same, actually.\" Piper commented as she readied her own cache of breakfast food, \"Thanks for the Breakfast Bar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sweat, I wasn't gonna eat it all anyway.\" the older Black said, hunkering over her food and taking hearty bites, \"Jff... mmm... Just figured I'd be nice for once. Woke up feeling like my stomach had a hangover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that how you say you're hungry?\" Piper reached across the table for the box of Pop-Tarts that had been sitting there since she got them from the cabinet two or three days ago, \"Because that doesn't sound like you're hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up twerp, I made you breakfast, I can say what I want.\" Parker grumbled, \"Now hand me one of those...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had the food hit the plate that it started going into Piper. She was starving like she hadn't been in years. Just how much of an appetite had she worked up after yesterday's attic cleaning exercise? The silverware clinked against the table, muffled by the paper plates, as Piper stabbed at bite after bite from her spread. She took open-mouthed chomps out of her toast, and ate entire mouthfuls of fluffy yellow eggs. Just how much had Parker been intending to eat if she'd made <i>all</i> of this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd why did Piper have the weirdest craving for\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I made you breakfast, get me the milk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper bawked at her and her sister being on the same page for once. Piper hated milk. Everyone in the Black family hated milk. That was a cereal-only investment. But, after cramming a few more bites into her mouth, Piper obeyed and retrieved the gallon of whole milk from the fridge. And the biscuits she'd had left over from her trip to Dakota's\u2014her mom made the best biscuits...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coffee.\" Parker commanded again, gruffly, \"On the counter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to drinking it\u2014\" Piper unholstered her finger guns and smiled absurdly, \"\u2014Parker <i>Black</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear to God I will fucking kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome things never changed. Despite the overall <i>strangeness</i> of this morning, at least Parker still wasn't a morning person. That would be weird. Waking up hungry was one thing, bloated was another, but for Parker to be a functioning human being without a cup of coffee or a little Hair of the Dog would have been Defcon 5 level weird. Once Piper handed the mug over, Parker poured enough milk into her coffee that it turned from a dark brown to a light khaki color. Then she ripped open five of the sugars they'd pocketed from the coffee shop last time they were there and dumped them into the mix. Piper had never been a big fan of coffee, but it looked <i>good</i>. Everything looked good. It was like Piper had a craving for just about everything she could see...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You done with that?\" Piper smacked her lips, her mouth feeling dry<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Yeah, go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper took the jug, unscrewed the cap, and tilted her head back. She took a few good gulps, feeling satisfied as her body got what it was craving. Taking a deeper breath, she leaned back again for longer as the cold milk washed down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Gross</i>\u2014who drinks milk like that?\" Parker scowled, \"Better, who drinks just straight milk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, I had a weird...\" Piper struggled to find the word, \"Craving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, <i>mom</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting back down, it felt almost entirely too fast before the rest of breakfast was over and done with. Piper managed to tuck away more for breakfast than she probably would have eaten before dinner on any other day. Working up an appetite was one thing, but Piper would admit to having pigged out a little. Her full stomach swelled a bit at the volume of her breakfast, taut and tight despite its convex shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Guess I know where I got that gut from...\"</i> Piper thought inwardly as she pushed herself away from the dinner table, <i>\"Better cut back if I don't want to have to fight Ma for maternity pants...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the coming weeks, some of the strangeness would not go unnoticed. Piper and Parker, really their whole family, had always had healthy appetites\u2014evidenced by their shared trait of large chests. However, that first morning was just a precursor to something else entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the character limitations in the Choices below, what could potentially happen in the coming weeks will be listed below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Piper and Parker's appetites not only continue to grow out of hand, but so do their figures! In a relatively short amount of time, the Black sisters begin to balloon, finding themselves unable (or unwilling) to cease cleaning out every cubbard, pantry, and fridge they can get their hands on, while also unable to stop (or even stall!) their mysterious and worrying weight gain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Piper manages to keep herself mostly contained, but at a cost. She <i>needs</i> food, and it's all she can think about. She's losing weight, at a slowed pace. But it isn't easy to keep herself in control when Parker is eating everything in sight, and finding every pound and thensome that Piper loses!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) The mysterious vial may have been envisioned as a cure for tuberculosis, but it's side-effects include much more than an uncontrollable appetite and weight gain. Things are about to get weird.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Piper Black was no pushover. She may not have had a bod that turned every head, but she was damned proud of how hard she worked to slim down since the days of Pudgey Piper and she would have cleaned out fifty attics before giving her trim figure up. Pushing her hunger to the back of her mind, Piper knuckled down and got to work, trimming down her belly fat and never once relenting on her schedule, jogging past countless sugary temptations and performing intense cardio to take her mind off of the calorie bomb \"workout shakes\" at the gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking herself in the bathroom mirror that morning, Piper examined her shrinking stomach, still looking for her abs behind that ever present layer of pudge. She could get away with hiding it underneath a dark colored shirt again, but it still persisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you keep going girl!\" Piper told her reflection, barely restraining a whimper as she aimed finger-guns at herself in the mirror. \"Staying trim and healthy! Light breakfast, then we meet Dakota for the morning jog!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper felt pumped up and ready to go. Then she caught a whiff of breakfast and her confident look soured, her eyes resolving to a thousand-yard stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so hungry it wasn't even funny. And what's more, it didn't make sense. Sure you got hungry on diets, but Piper had done diets before. This was utter agony; she ate every light meal ravenously and yet it still felt like her stomach was eating away at her insides. It was so painful that Piper was afraid that one day she'd wake up and see a skeleton in the mirror. Like a literal skeleton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so...hungry....NO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper stamped her foot, her lower lip quivering. \"Damn it Piper, you're better then this! You can do this! You can lose this belly fat, or I'll kick your flabby ass!\" She aimed a kick at the bathroom counter and stubbed her big toe hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwearing like a sailor, Piper hobbled into the kitchen to acquire what nourishment she could. Grabbing a banana out of the bowl sitting next to the stove, the younger Black sibling whimpered, her fingers trembling as though tempting her to grab just one more. It was fruit, you know? That's healthy. It's okay if you have two. Or more. Or the whole bowl. Maybe chase it up with those pop tarts you like, then a couple donuts, then---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaagh!\" Piper shouted, peeling her banana and shoving it into her mouth like an animal. \"Fuck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Pitstain, mom's napping!\" Parker shouted from the living room. \"Stuff it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, you do plenty of stuffing on your own!\" Piper retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck -mmmmf- you!\" Parker's swear was interrupted by her chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker stomped towards the front door, right past her big sister occupying the sofa in the living room. And big sister was accurate; Piper's drive to diet wasn't something that her sister shared, and ever since the attic cleaning she had compounded on that inactivity, tending to stay home and playing video games instead of going out clubbing to get what little exercise she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result, Parker was starting to balloon. She was already far wider then before, dressed in stretchy shorts and a t-shirt that was a little too big for her a week ago and fit snugly today, riding up to expose an inch or two of pudgy round stomach. Her fluffy thighs forced her to take up a little more of the couch then before, and judging by how her boobs looked larger and sagged to the sides slightly, she had skipped wearing a bra today. Or perhaps just couldn't find one to fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously Pipes, mom's cranky today,\" Parker warned her, stuffing a danish taken from a big box lying next to her into her mouth, double chin wobbling as she spoke. \"She came down and shouted at me when I dropped the frying pan earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,' Piper said bluntly, tugging on her light jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Piper?\" Parker craned her neck to look past the TV at her sister directly. \"You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am!\" Piper said. \"Why wouldn't I be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno...you look like you're about to fall over.\" Parker picked up another danish, popping it daintily into her lips. It was blueberry lemon. Piper loved blueberry lemon. The younger sister betrayed a little whimper but quickly rebounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm FINE, Parker! Seriously, stop freaking out.\" Piper kicked open the door roughly and backed out. \"I'll be back after my jog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you s-\" Parker began, but Piper slammed the door before she finished and took off at a jog. Every footstep jostled the tiny deposit of food in her stomach, reminder her how empty it actually felt. It almost started to hurt a little. It was agonizing, but it would be worth it. Classic Piper would be back in no time at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few agonizing blocks later, Piper rendezvoused with Dakota at the corner, the cute little Texan already in her light jacket and jogging shorts and looking quite perky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya Pipes!\" she said brightly. \"Ready to get going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you know it!\" Piper said, shakily giving her a thumbs up. Dakota paused, giving her a sideways look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure? You kind of look terrible today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lousy breakfast,\" Piper admitted a little too quickly. \"Not to worry though, I have a nice healthy lunch planned out. Mmm!\" Piper's stomach roared and she whimpered again. Damn it, stop thinking about food!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then,\" Dakota said warily. \"Let's get rolling then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they were off, bobbing through the streets of Daven's Port at jogging speed. Dakota kept a spirited pace, invigorated by the fall breeze and the fresh atmosphere of this brand new city. And Piper, stumbling along behind her, was in utter agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking into a cold sweat that had nothing to do with her physical activity, every scent from every food joint she passed felt like a knife in her poor, poor stomach. It cried out for nourishment, for sustenance, for just a morsel of energy. She needed it, more then she ever needed anything in her life. Her ragged painful gasps of breath echoed with her footsteps until Piper stumbled to a stop, her eyes bloodshot and every inch of her trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pipes?\" Dakota called some distance away. \"You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can do this, Piper told herself. You can fight this. She straightened herself out, took a breath of fresh air...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and breathed in the scent of Dee's Donuts. Her favorite donut store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper stood like a statue, her eye twitching as Dakota ran up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piper?\" Dakota repeated, waving a hand in front of her face. \"Is something wr-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH I CAN'T FUCKING TAKE IT ANYMORE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper's shriek launched Dakota backwards, landing roughly on the bus bench as Piper bolted into the donut store. She didn't care that every eye was on her, or how crazy or deranged she looked. None of that mattered. The only thing that mattered was the insatiable hunger inside of her. She needed to fill her stomach, and she needed to fill it NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDee herself was behind the counter when Piper stormed inside. \"Uh, Piper? How can I-\" she began, then yelped as Piper physically leapt over the counter, grabbing Dee by the collar and staring into her soul. Dee capitulated under such a terrifying, manic look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-piper? Wh-what do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper licked her lips, a manic, deranged look in her eyes, and </span></div></div>",

The older woman took a cautionary step back and silently urged Piper to the correct side of the counter. Shambling back into the eatery proper, Piper moseyed towards a booth. But as the aroma of donuts began to overwhelm her sense of shame and the little voice in her head that told her to wait, she found herself at odds once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClutching at her stomach, hunched over and a rumbling groan roaring from deep within her, Piper shut her eyes tight as the ringing in her ears returned. The donut shop started to fade around her, her vision narrowing into a red-rimmed tunnel as she felt her heartbeat behind her eardrums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piper?\" the owner asked with a touch of her shoulder, \"Honey, are you o\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm <i>fine</i>.\" Piper snapped, \"Just hurry up with those donuts, will you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to pay first, hun.\" Dee sounded more concerned than offended at Piper's tone, \"Cash or card?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper reached into her bra and pulled out a clammy fifty dollar bill that was supposed to last her all week. She handed it over to the older woman and got back a nice crisp pair of ones and a couple of coins. She crumpled them up in one hand and shoved them in the pockets of her jogging shorts. Stumbling back over to the booth, she collapsed into her seat and sat with her head hung low in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was <i>wrong</i> with her today? Everything she'd felt ever since she'd cleaned out the attic was finally coming to a head. She was irritable, grumpy, and more over, she was <i>hungry</i>. Dieting had never been this hard before. All she wanted to do was lose a little belly for God's sake! It wasn't like she was Porky Piper, somehow managing to shed almost a hundred and fifty pounds through puberty and running around the Port. How fair was it that now, when it was fifteen pounds tops, it should be so hard?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would give anything for something to eat. Anything to make her stomach stop aching. She'd gone and blew all fifty of her bucks on some stupid amount of donuts and for what? There was no way she was going to eat all of these\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you are hun.\" Dee said in a much warmer sort of voice, \"You need some help getting these home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper's blood ran cold at the sight of the seven boxes stacked high on the table. The Ten People Party Palooza was a fixed set of donuts that couldn't be substituted. She'd gotten one for Dakota during her welcoming party. Back then it had taken her, Dakota, Zack, Madi, and Max to even make a dent in that thing. They'd all gone home with more donuts than they could handle and it took a whole three weeks for the Black family's portion, at least, to disappear. That hadn't been all that long ago, and Piper could have sworn she'd never eat donuts again. But now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nbut now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Piper asked finally, half-looking up at the manager<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked if you needed help getting these home?\" Dee repeated, \"I know your mama will appreciate you bringing these home. Good lord, she must be four months along now, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not for ma.\" Piper rasped, her mouth sandy and her throat dry, \"They're for here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, hun, I didn't hear you, it sounded like\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I SAID THEY'RE FOR HERE.\" Piper hollered and slammed her open palms on the table, \"Thank you, Dee, I think I can take it from here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, the manager did her best to put Piper's strange behavior out of her mind. Meanwhile, the poor girl had been left licking her lips as she began to rip into the boxes of donuts. Every flavor she could imagine was in there\u2014starting with apple cinnamon. She practically forced the first donut into her mouth; amber colored filling oozed out from the sides and dolloped onto her cheeks and plopped on her boob. The taste was exquisite. Divine even. Piper had never tasted a goddamn donut so good in her entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree donuts went down without a hitch, all in four bites or less. She opened her mouth as wide as it could possibly go and forced the flaky pastries inside. She nearly choked a few times in thanks to the brown sugar powder. A quick run to the soda jerk for a free water fixed her issue and gave her enough time to move onto the boston creme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper was an animal. She felt like she hadn't eaten anything in days. Weeks. Months. Ever. But the more Piper ate, the more her stomach seemed to feel empty. Bit by bit, she slowly filled her gullet with sugary snacks. But even as her first dozen fell by the wayside, all Piper could think about was more, More, MORE...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Christ.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota had spent her morning trying to track down her friend. Piper had shot off on her own in the middle of their jog, leaving her standing there worried out of her mind. She walked all around DP and had been calling her like crazy. Texting, messaging, she'd even tried Snapchat to check her location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until Hurley said Yanira had seen her in D's Donuts during a munchie run that she got a clue as to where she was. And that had been hours ago, there was no way she was still there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut sure enough, there was Piper Black. Stuffed to the gills with a cemetery of discarded donut boxes around her. She'd been leaning back in her seat, a rounded stomach doming out from underneath her always impressive bust. She had a dazed, stupid look on her face. Almost like she was asleep. A low moan sounded from her booth\u2014whether it was one of agony or enjoyment, Dakota had no idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew Piper was having a hard time with her diet, but this was a little extreme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piper?\" Dakota asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dee...\" the glutted gal said weakly, \"Heeeey...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to move. God that looked painful. Her stomach was hard as a rock, and she looked more far along than her mom was. Leaning forward was out of the question for poor Piper. There was no give in that belly! Dakota hurried to her side and grabbed her by the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You flaked on our jog to go get donuts?\" Dakota sounded more hurt than anything, \"Jeez how many of these did you eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno.\" Piper burped, \"I just got... so hungry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Texan clicked her tongue in mild concern for her friend. She'd been acting so weird lately, but this was strange even for her. She definitely didn't have the money to be buying expensive donuts like this willy-nilly. Piper was normally all about exploring the town, and she'd been super into their jogs! Whatever was going on with her friend must have been pretty important...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything okay at home, P?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why\u2014<i>ooogh</i>\u2014does everyone keep asking that?\" Piper whined, touching the sides of her kicking food baby, \"Fuck, I just... got hungry, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay.\" Dakota eased her friend to her feet, \"You, uh... wanna finish our jog?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo...\" Piper whined, leaning belly-first towards the floor, \"Take me home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper had no idea what had come over her. The impossible pile of donuts had seemingly met its fate at her hands. And her hands alone! That had to have been at least fifty donuts, all by her lonesome. That was incredible. It was impossible! And it certainly wasn't going to help her work off that starter belly she'd been sporting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomorrow would be another day. Another chance to get this diet thing right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut tonight, maybe, she should get some rest...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This had to be what hell was like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the week came to a close, Piper didn't have a repeat encounter of the party pack incident, but God she came pretty damn close. Dakota, being the awesome friend that she was, kept a close eye on her, making sure she didn't inadvertently jog into a greasy spoon to order a delectable cheeseburger or stray from her usual lunch options of salads and soups, but it just made things worse. Her stomach screamed, wailed for nourishment when she gave it so much as a passing thought. It was enough to make her question whether or not something was seriously wrong with her, not just because she was NEVER this desperately hungry from dieting before, but because it didn't seem to be working. At all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat belly of hers remained steadfast, and the day after the donut incident was even joined by a slight layer of pudge on her hips that made her jogging pants tight and uncomfortable. Mentally exhausted by the gnawing hunger, Piper didn't even have the energy to mention her inexplicable sizing up to anyone, and if Dakota or her family noticed they kept polite about it. It may not even have been real, just her wild, hungry imagination at work, since thinking about putting on pounds was the next logical step to having your every waking thought dominated by this torturous, gnawing hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill she suffered through it all, oftentimes reduced to tears out of sheer frustration, but she held. And after a agonizing night where she declined a second helping of her mom's famously awesome meatloaf, she collapsed into her bed, weak and destitute, hoping this was a night she wouldn't spend dreaming of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeey Piper? You up yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper groaned, sluggishly sitting up in bed as her rat's nest hair fell into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she mumbled almost incoherently at her sister peeking her head through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well when you have a minute, gotta ask you something,\" Parker said snootily, vanishing behind the doorframe. Piper growled as she spun her legs out of bed, getting shakily to her feet and stretching out her back. Stumbling to the bathroom, she scratched herself in a way that would get her a scolding from her mother as she braced herself for another day of ceaseless unrelenting hunger. Though, now that she thought about it, it wasn't that bad today. Almost felt like normal.  Grateful for this small relief from the agony of the last week, Piper crossed the threshold and turned on the light of the bathroom, grabbing her toothbrush and applying a liberal helping of toothpaste before-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toothbrush clattered into the sink as Piper stared openly at her reflection. Her...her belly. The one she spent so long agonizingly trying to lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It was gone!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran a hand over her abs to be sure, feeling the usual flat surface she came to know and love. Her heart felt like singing. At last, the dieting worked! Skinny Piper was back, baby! And...surprisingly fast too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly getting dressed, and reveling in the ease of tugging her pants, Piper dashed out of her room and nearly slammed into Parker on the way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! Watch it, tubby!\" Piper snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't even make sense, pitstain!\" Parker sniped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" Piper grumbled, her mood somewhat spoiled by her sister's bitchiness. \"What do you...uh...\" The younger sister openly stared again, not sure what she was looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're done being an ass, did you sort the laundry last night? I think you gave me mom's maternity stuff by mistake, these shorts are HUGE on me.\" She gestured towards the large shorts she held onto her skinny frame with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker was wrong and right. Those shorts were definitely the cute ones that Parker picked up after she burst her jeans open after a second helping of dinner the other night, and what's more...they were way too big on her. Piper wasn't braindead, right? Her sister had spent the whole last week porking up like crazy, and now...she was back to normal? What the fuck happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't sort any laundry,\" Piper said dismissively, the cogs in her mind turning, unceremoniously shoving past her. \"I think I'm losing my shit,\" she mumbled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Piper, wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger Black sibling paced back and forth at the street corner, her mind trying to process the impossible things she saw, when the voice she was waiting for chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Piper!\" Dakota called out, in the same tone as one would use with a sick friend you needed to help out. \"Ready to get going? We can take it easy if you need to, once around the-yeaah!\" Dakota yelped as Piper grabbed her by the arm and led her back to the house a few doors down. \"Okay, I'm s-sorry about making you jog, I'm just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need a second pair of eyes, to make sure I'm not going insane,\" Piper announced unceremoniously. \"C'mere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair of them stumbled up to the Black residence again, Piper kicking open the door as she strolled right in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god would you fucking stop it?\" Parker snapped, standing in the living room, a modest bagel clutched in her hand and her jacket around her other arm. \"If you break the door again mom's going to kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I needed to show Dakota something,\" Piper explained, looking over at her friend's shocked expression on seeing the incredible change to the piggy Parker's figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. I'm going out, I'll be back at lunchtime.\" Shoving past the two friends, Parker departed for her day trip, slamming the door behind her and leaving a stunned duo in the dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She...she got skinny fast,\" Dakota said stupidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too, and it happened overnight,\" Piper explained, lifting up her shirt to demonstrate. \"So I'm not going insane, this really happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I see it too, definitely.\" Dakota looked shell-shocked at the impossible transformations taking place in front of her. \"I...what the hell happened? How did you and Parker lose weight so quickly? How come you don't look like you want to gnaw your own face off anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper winced. \"Was it really that bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, kinda,\" Dakota admitted. \"Last night you looked like you could clean out Polyburger's whole stock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I felt like I could, this whole week I couldn't stop thinking about eating,\" Piper ranted. \"It was insatiable, I remember just waking up feeling so hungry. I almost cleaned out the leftover pizza from the other night but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething finally clicked into place. Dakota looked on in confusion as Piper put it all together. The gnawing hunger, the pizza, a reward for cleaning out the attic, where they found...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THE WINE BOX!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Dakota asked, but Piper was already gone, having sped into her room. Tenatively following, Dakota peered around the corner and was hit in the face with a dirty bra carelessly flung behind Piper as she dug through the dirty pile of laundry, finally revealing a familiar wooden crate. With a look of triumph, Piper picked up the box and showed it to Dakota like a prized hunting trophy, opening it up to show off the tincture and the glass vials inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's this stuff!\" Piper exclaimed. \"Me and Parker were in the attic and found this thing, she said it was a old timey wine box so we tried it out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota raised an eyebrow. \"You found an old box full of a weird liquid and you decided to drink it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was HER idea!\" Piper scowled in the direction that Parker had gone. \"And it tasted like carpet cleaner, I bet it messed up my system or something, probably screwed with my sister too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why would it cause you to suddenly lose weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper's triumphant smile faltered, unable to explain this little snag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of alcohol even is this?\" Dakota questioned, pulling out her phone. \"Maybe Zack knows, his parents are wine collectors and...eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota looked down, realizing she stepped on something when she idly shifted her feet. Reaching down, she picked up an aging piece of parchment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dearest Abigail,\" Dakota recited. \"Is this some sort of school project?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it must have come from the box,\" Piper said, looking at the similarly aged looking papers tucked into the sides of the tincture case. \"What's it say?\" Dakota scanned through the letter at a quick pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Uncle Martin'...'duchess'...yada yada...'white plague'...'My attempts to combat the wasting away'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota looked up from the parchment, her expression a mix of shock and amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piper,\" she explained. \"I...think you two drank medicine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Gimme that!\" Piper said, snatching the paper and scanning through it, her expression softening. \"Fuck me, you're right, it's medicine, some sort of cure for a white plague. What the hell's a white plague?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tuberculosis,\" Dakota pointed out. \"And it doesn't seem to have worked anyway. Though that duchess character seems to have liked it for some other reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she just liked eating?\" Piper suggested. \"I know I couldn't stop thinking about it when that stuff was in me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I remember you ate like fifty donuts and now look at you, skinny as ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound jealous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls laughed, trailing off as they looked at the tincture set, still plenty full of that weird old-timey medicine. As Piper looked at the stuff with mixed feelings at the idea of such a strange thing actually existing, Dakota spoke up to break the silence.</span></div></div>",

She was still kinda sleepy and their Mom had a thing against overhead lighting. Maybe it was like the way she was sitting or something or maybe it was the way <i>Parker</i> was sitting or whatever. Piper told herself that it could have been anything...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Parker stretched like a cat, throwing her olive toned arms up in the air and arched her back, Piper would have been hard pressed to find an excuse for that little belly that poked out from underneath Parker's old Ke$ha t-shirt. Underneath the blue and purple hem, Parker's stretching had released a little curve. And as she settled back into her place, her daily Steve Wilkos indulgence commencing, she sat back in a way that didn't quite allow her shirt room to fall back over the little roll nestled on top of her previously flat stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd honestly, the more Piper looked at her... Parker just seemed a little bigger than usual, y'know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't really a surprise or anything. Parker had the motivation and drive of a slug. All she did was lay around the house all day, shuffling from her room to the couch to the pantry before she and a couple of her degenerate friends from high school got together and decided to go out clubbing. With the amount of alcohol that her sister consumed on a daily basis, Piper was honestly kind've shocked she hadn't gone into liver failure\u2014let alone put on a couple of pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere those actual <i>love handles</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God can you believe this?\" Parker snorted, \"What a piece of trash, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Piper blinked, distracted by the emergence of the slightest second chin whenever her sister spoke, \"I, uh... what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, <i>of course</i> he's the father, right?\" Parker continued, clearly as engaged as their conversation as Piper was as she cracked a Coke open, \"Gawd. Like, she looks <i>just</i> like him. These are just straight garbage-tier people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker lifted the coke can over her head and killed it\u2014Piper had seen her do that plenty of times with beer. Maybe that was where all that mysterious mass had come from? She had been drinking a lot of soda lately, come to think of it. But then again, she\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>BURRAAARRP!!</i>\" Parker let out a belch loud enough to rattle the panes on their sliding glass door, \"Ururp... damn. That was a good one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It <i>was</i>.\" Piper conceded, \"Bravo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so she wasn't <i>that</i> different. Honestly, Piper was surprised by this point that Parker hadn't started filling out beforehand. All that girl did was eat, party, drink and sleep. Even still, should she say something? Like, it may have been rude to call someone out on their weight, but Parker looked to have put a lot of it on. They <i>were</i> still sisters, after all...</span></div></div>",

Who cared what Parker did to herself, right? It wasn't like she was much help around the house. Or fun to talk to. Or particularly nice or redeeming in anyway... hence the burp in the face. Why should Piper put in the effort of being a good sister when Parker had done everything but?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, get it yourself.\" Piper curled her nostril and kicked her sister in the thicker thigh, \"Friggin' <i>gross</i> Parker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" the older Black sister rolled her eyes as she poured herself onto the cheap hardwood floor, \"You're such a baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there too, Piper noticed it. Whatever weight Parker had put on, it had settled nicely in the seat of her pants. Whereas the Black women tended to be busty by nature, Parker's posterior seemed a bit more plush than Piper cared to recall. It wasn't just the softness of her stomach; Parker had packed away an awful lot more junk in her trunk since Piper cared to look. Had she always had that thing? That bubble butt jutting out behind her? No, couldn't be. Otherwise it wouldn't be that big of a deal now... right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper let the Steve Wilkos show play in the background\u2014she wasn't really into daytime talk shows anyway\u2014as she waited for Parker to return from the kitchen. Sure enough, there was that little pot-belly she'd sprouted miraculously without her knowledge, just sort've hanging out there. It was this little round pooch, no folds or rolls, and two little dollops of olive-colored chub that made up her lovehandles. Her boobs were bigger, that much Piper could tell. Her shirt was riding up ever so slightly thanks to those meaty mams, leaving just a <i>little</i> sliver of Parker pudge out in the open...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker plopped down next to her sister on the couch, cracked open her cola, and took a big fizzy gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh.\" she sounded content with herself before\u2014 \"URRRAAAP!!

Parker was lazy, but she was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, Parker was always this exact amount of lazy. Literally all the time. She was the only twenty-something year old without a job within a three block radius. Piper wished she <i>could</i> have been surprised, but no. Parker had always been useless and lazy. And honestly, Piper was less shocked that her sister was getting fat, and more shocked that it hadn't started happening sooner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven still, she <i>was</i> getting awfully chunky...</span></div></div>",

What's that supposed to mean?!\" Parker's voice screeched through the thin walls of Casa de Black. She had been going on like this for almost an hour. At first Piper had put her headphones on and just tried to watch some Netflix, but Bojack Horseman wasn't the same when occasionally punctuated by an overgrown womanchild. So Piper turned it off, got herself and aspirin and was just...waiting, for it to be over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She knew it was Parker's ho-bag friend, Tina. Tina always came around in these tiny miniskirt dresses that had one shoulder exposed, way too much makeup and hairspray, and was basically everything Piper hated about Parker, purified and concentrated with a dash of redneck. Because both horrid bitches, Paker and Tina had a fight like this about once every three months, usually over literally nothing. Maybe one of them forgot the other's purse when they left it with them, while they were both drunk, or maybe they were fighting over a guy who just pumped and dumped them anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fuck you! Fuck YOU!\" And then she threw the phone against the wall right behind Piper's head. Piper had enough and stormed out of her room and threw open Parker's door. She was about to tear into her with every grievance she'd accumulated over the last few weeks, but then she saw something she hadn't seen since she was like, five years old. Parker was crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Piper just stood in the doorway, waiting for something to happen. Finally Parker let it out between heaving sobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Tina doesn't want to be seen with me anymore! She says I'm fat and disgusting!\" Well...Piper couldn't dispute the fat part. Parker had eaten herself into plus sizes. The Black family had always hovered around there, being slightly taller then average, and all being what they now called thicc, but Parker had jumped straight up there. She'd even gone to Torrid especially to buy a size 22 dress that would fit her to go out tonight, and it was a bit...clingy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As for disgusting well...Parker was a tramp who now had a habit of burping anytime she was in the room, calling her 'pitstain,' her mascara was running from crying and her hair was a trainwreck. But still! She was her sister!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So she came up onto Parker's bed an hugged her, and for once, Parker didn't protest. As she wrapped her fingers around her sister's shoulder, she found it incredible how much padding even that had. Sitting here, this close to her, she really couldn't believe it. This was Parker?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Come on, Tina was a total bitch anyway, even to you.\" Piper insisted. Sometimes she wondered if the problem was that Parker fell in with the wrong crowd. Tina and her friends were the only ones who actually hung out with Piper, starting when they got out of High School. And since Tina was everything bad about Parker, but worse, Tina was probably a terrible influence. Piper had a hard time hiding the glee she had at the thought of never seeing Tina again, which didn't do much to help Parker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Remember when you got glue in your hair that one time, and then Tina told <i>everyone</i> that you got hair extensions? Come on, you're better off without her.\" That only provoked further wailing. OK, time to change tactics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What would make you feel better, right now, sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You want Pizza?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I want so much pizza.\" Ah, the fat girl stress eating. Piper had done it herself a few times during her 'heavy days.' Fortunately Parker hadn't really reached those levels yet. 'Yet', the word weighed heavily on Piper's mind. She'd been down this path before. She knew all the trouble Parker was getting into and...also the few glimmering upsides. She knew how good a pizza could be on a night like this. She knew how good Pizza itself could be. She knew how good fullness itself could be, and that really, genuinely that might be the only thing that could make Parker feel better now. She decided to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Look, okay, maybe pizza wasn't the best thing in the world right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker was in a bad place, and the last thing that her sister needed was to start linking eating and not feeling like shit about herself. But Piper wasn't exactly a psychiatrist, and it was clear that Parker wasn't going to stop bawling her eyes out any time soon. If she was home, she wasn't going to be drinking or taking anything she might regret later. If Parker needed some pizza, to have a little pity-party all for herself, what was the harm in indulging her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Piper did what any good sister would do; she went out, got some Brent Brother's Pizza, picked up a couple milkshakes, and cleared off the couch in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crumpled twenty that Piper had been saving had gotten them four pizzas, each of them dripping with grease and just as nasty as the two of them remembered from when they were kids. The other bit went to the milkshakes\u2014pizza was one thing, but frozen dairy treats were not something that one tended to skimp on in <i>this</i> household. Piper had splurged and gotten her still-sobbing sack of a sister the Sweet Treat deal; a vanilla milkshake with M&amp;M's, Oreos, and Nutter Butter bars crumpled up, blended in, and sprinkled on top in various assorted fashion. Piper herself had gotten the standard (but <i>classic</i>!) Strawberry Banana Blitz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey huddled up in the living room, their mom having gone to bed for the night, turned on the lights, set the television on low volume...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...ate pizza, drank milkshakes, and talked about how much of a fucking <b>bitch</b> Tina was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. My. God.\" Parker's head rolled back with laughter, \"Do you remember that time that she convinced me to hide that Derek guy in my room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking <i>yes</i>!\" Piper leaned forward, sugar tickling her synapses and keeping her wide awake into the wee hours, \"Didn't he live with us, for like, a week?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three days!\" Parker snorted as she cracked open another can of Coke before lowering a dribbling triangle of nasty pizza into her mouth before smacking out a rebuttal, \"And she said she'd pick him up that... what, Friday? I had to hide that motherfucker in my room until school on Monday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot all about that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a way this was nice. Piper and Parker never got to share too many of these moments growing up. Either because Parker was being a bitch or because Piper <i>assumed</i> that Parker was going to screw things up somehow. And to be fair, she was usually right. But lately, ever since Parker stopped getting out of the goddamn house so much and started getting fat, there had been a lot more opportunities for things like this to occur naturally. They couldn't force it, like Mom seemed to always try to do, and it wasn't happening every night. But this... this was nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFleeting. But nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Pitstain.\" Parker gave her little sister a slight shove in the bicep, her own thick arm jostled by the sudden movement, \"I needed this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, not even <i>you</i> deserve to let that skank ruin your night.\" Piper shotgunned her soda, \"URRP... oof... <i>fuck</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good one.\" Parker belched sleepily, \"Imma head to bed, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.\" Piper smiled, \"Good night, Parker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deuces.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Piper's pudging sister lumbered out of the living room and towards the hallway, her bubble-butt bobbing behind her as her rolling backfat quivered slightly with the motions. There was no way Parker was up to two-fifty yet, right? Sure she'd gotten kinda fat lately, with her chunky thighs filling out her pajama pants and her belly eeking out from underneath her shirts, but the big two-double-goose-egg was overshooting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just dark in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She left the door open because, hey, closed doors were a thing that they didn't do very often in her house. So imagine her surprise when, out of the fucking blue, Parker comes up squeezed into some of her old (<i>definitely</i> slutty) clubbing clothes, threatening to pop out of them like biscuits from a tube!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Piper blinked as she tried to understand just what... the <i>what</i> was going on with all that, \"I'm sorry, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this look slutty or not?\" Parker rolled her eyes and sighed, her double chin showing as her face fell, \"Like, is it good slutty like 'hey, you're cute, buy me a drink' or is it bad slutty like 'rape me out in the parking lot?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker had decked herself out in, honestly, one of the most ridiculous things that Piper had ever seen in her life. Maybe it was just because Parker had blown up past the point of thiccness and well into the Fat Chick territory, but Parker did <i>not</i> look good squeezed into that slutty dress. Piper understood the point of hiding her belly, but the outline that her sister's tight dress left around her didn't leave much to the imagination. It wasn't slimming\u2014she just looked like a sausage in its casing. Add to the fact that her huge tits were starting to rest <i>on</i> her stomach, and that her tray ass stuck out further than her weird little jacket number could cover...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>God</i> why was this her sister?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Pitstain, I'm going out tonight and I need to know what to wear.\" Parker whined petulantly, \"Good slutty or bad slutty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Good</i>. <i>Slutty</i>.\" Parker repeated, slowly and tersely, \"Or\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I understood the question, dumbass.\" Piper looked up from her computer, \"You're going out? With who? I thought you and Tina weren't a thing anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not!\" Parker puffed matter-of-factly as she hiked up her panties, \"I'm going out by myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\" Piper cocked an eyebrow \"Because that's safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're the one who told me I didn't <i>need</i> a dumb stupid fucking slut like Tina to have a good time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well <i>yeah</i> but\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late!

Her titties were teeming right out of her already low-cut dress and her fat gut bounced liberally in front of her. Piper had to practically smack her hand every time she so much as <i>thought</i> of something delicious. Seriously, Parker had porked right the fuck up, and something told her that she wasn't exactly going to find her old habits of shaking her ass on the dance floor and high-intensity sexual escapades compatible with her new habits of sucking down soda and binging on Netflix and cheap takeout...</span></div></div>",

She had her own life going on, Mom was getting more and more pregnant by the day... it just wasn't going to be the Parker-centric world that her narcissistic older sister liked to think it was about eighty percent of the time. She helped out a bit around the house, ate dinner with her Mom, and went to bed without losing a wink of sleep over whether or not her shitty older sister was going to have a good time or not because, honestly, there were just more important things to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer level of enthusiasm was about the same when she was woken up by a very drunk and very upset Parker who had appeared to have, quite literally, popped out of her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were fuckin' <i>right</i>.\" Parker wailed, reeking of cheap flavored vodka and... was that pizza? It was hard to tell. The stain on her cheek looked like pizza, \"You just think you're so fucking smart, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...what?\" Piper blinked stupidly, \"Parker, what time is\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About half past <i>fuck Tina 'o' clock</i>!\" Parker said, suddenly shouting as she teetered on her fat feet, thick thighs rubbing against one another as she struggled to keep her standing position, \"I'm so fucking done with her. D'you know what she did? Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Rip your dress?\" Piper looked down at the large gash of exposed olive-colored blubber going straight down the middle of Parker's oozing gut<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>No.</i>\" Parker barked, plopping herself down on the mattress (and on top of one of Piper's shins) \"She fuckin' turned the whole club against me, s'what she did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't rightfully see how she could\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Started callin' me a skank, tellin' everyone that I was <i>ffffat</i>!\" Parker struggled to sound the word out, \"We got in a fight, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an awkward pause. Was that a question? Had Parker just asked her a question or did she change the subject mid-sentence. Midnight drunken ramblings weren't exactly <i>un</i>common in Piper's house (though thankfully her late-night conversations with Drunk Mom had stopped all-together after she found out she was pregnant with Hunter) but Parker usually never sought Piper out to talk. Mostly to just bitch. This was an unprecedented turn of events to say the least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally any drunk conversations with Parker were broken up by their mom shouting at them to go the fuck to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\" Piper finally said, \"Did you... did you win?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Parker's expression lightened considerably. Her fat face twisted into a stupid drunken smile as her dull brown eyes gleamed with delight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're damn right I did.\" Parker laughed, \"That skinny fucking cunt went down in one punch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job, Parker.\" Piper yawned, \"Maybe you should go to bed. It's la\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'wanna know somethin'? You were <i>right</i>.\" Parker slurred, laying down next to her sister over the covers. The smell of alcohol and <i>definitely</i> pizza (and chicken fingers?) was much worse up close. Her leather coat was still cold from the outside weather, \"I'm fucking <i>done</i> clubbing. Fuck those bitches. Amirite?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...Yeah.\" Piper stammered, \"Parker... you're... you're really heav\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BECAUSE I DON'T NEED ANYONE TO HAVE A GOOD FUCKING TIME.\" Parker shouted suddenly, rocking herself back up to a seated position with all the grace of a manatee on land, \"GOT MY SISTER, GOT ME SOME PIZZA, AND I GOT MY MUTHERFUCKIN' DRANKS.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh god this was so awful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was this her life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"GIRLS.\"</b> a strong, stern voice came from down the hall, <b>\"GO THE FUCK TO SLEEP OR I SWEAR TO GOD I WILL BURN THIS HOUSE DOWN WITH YOU INSIDE IT.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was sort've that. Parker just gave this stupid little smile, shushed her sister, and tottered off into the hallway, off to her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least, Piper <i>thought</i> she had tottered off to her room. The truth of the matter was that Parker had gone to the kitchen and eaten an entire box of Cocoa Pebbles before puking in the front yard and crashing on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was a story for another day.</span></div></div>",

For the life of her, Piper couldn't figure out what her obsession with having a good time was. It wasn't like she had any actual friends now that that skank Tina was out of her life, seemingly for good this time. Tina was a bad influence on Parker, showing her the ropes on how to be a disgraceful piece of party trash, and had been for so long that she was just sort've going through the motions now. All Parker wanted to do was go out and have a good time, and <i>unfortunately</i>, that didn't mesh well with Piper's desire to ever get any sleep again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause she did it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she skipped one night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then it happened again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were only, like, three clubs in Daven's Port.

He peddled laptops to kids who otherwise wouldn't have gotten a chance to have them, so he performed a valuable service. He took the shitty old ones that the school donated to the low-income families in the neighborhood once they got their kickback and upgraded them for a small surcharge. Great guy. He's in prison now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Piper was in middle school, just coming out of her chunky phase, and in the early days of high school (because why not), she could spend hours on this thing. It had games (Sims 2 was <i>life</i> back then!) and it was portable so she could take it down to D's or wherever there was Wi-Fi. Now that the neighbors had it installed (and she had figured out the default passcode for said Wi-Fi) she had actually been fiddling with it a lot more lately. Sure it was a little slow, but it wasn't exactly <i>bad</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a dragon priestess.\" Piper explained as if it were the most simple thing in the world, \"You fight monsters, get gold, buy shit, repeat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper had been playing with it, in fact, when Parker stumbled out of her latest drunken stupor. She came thundering in, her cascading gut bouncing with every lumbering step and her fat thighs audibly swishing as they touched. Somehow all the excess partying Parker had been doing seemed to have made her even <i>fatter</i> than usual, despite all the vomiting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker had caught sight of something vaguely interesting on Piper's screen and... well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So like that World of Warcraft shit?\" Parker asked with a curl of her nose, sitting down next to Piper on the couch<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh no.\" Piper halfway laughed, \"WoW costs <i>money</i> and this is a totally free ripoff. It's called BattleCraft IX. It's awesome. It's free. And I haven't seen my cool little elf bitch since like tenth grade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper pressed a button on her computer, and her digital avatar waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say hi little elf bitch!\" Piper laughed, and so did Parker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, like, did you <i>make</i> her or what?\" the older Black sister said, scooting a bit closer, \"She's hot as balls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right?\" Piper said with no small modicum of pride, \"See, I started out as just an Elf, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor about the second time in Piper's recent memory, she had a good day with her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it didn't involve a whole bunch of crying or screaming, even if it was at someone else's expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter showing Parker the glories of trashy flash animated games, it hadn't taken much persuasion for her to fire up the old Xbox. It was <i>actually</i> the Black family DVD player, and for the longest time only Piper really knew how to use it (Harper always made her do it anyway, and Parker had little to no interest in movies anyway). But once Piper made a couple of references to a few games she knew, and Parker seemed interested enough, well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUCKING DIE.\" Parker roared at the screen, kicking her chunky legs in abject dismay, \"YOU FUCKING SUPER MUTANT SON OF A BITCH\u2014FUCKING FUCK WHY THE FUCK IS HE INVISIBLE HOLY FUCKING SHIT.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFallout: New Vegas was never a big hit with Piper. Never quite got into the whole lore shit. But apparently, Parker was just dumb enough to not care about any of that and dove head-first into the radioactive wasteland. Or she just <i>really</i> needed to let off some steam in a way that wasn't completely self-destructive. Either way, Piper was happy to oblige.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was afternoon before either of them realized it, and they'd spent the whole day on the couch playing video games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Parker?\" Piper asked her sizeable sister, \"Don't you, uh... have plans tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Fuck that.\" Parker rolled her eyes, \"I've gotta help Sergeant Sexy up in that dinosaur.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow <i>there</i> was a thought. Come to think of it, Parker hadn't been bitching or moaning about doing much of anything all day. She'd actually been rather pleasant. Maybe there was something to this \"getting her anger out on virtual characters, rather than being a burden on herself and others\" thing... </span></div></div>",

The poor boy had three sisters and yet somehow, never developed his feminine side enough to know how to shop for them, beyond knowledge that they liked \"girl stuff.\" Once that was taken care of, Zack popped the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"OK, Dakota, who's your nightmare to shop for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh?\" She asked, clueless. Piper elbowed her playfully in the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You know, who on your list is hardest to shop for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh uh...that's really hard to say. It's kind of all equally difficult.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh no.\" Zack sighed, resting his face in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I just get my father a tie, my mother a name brand appliance, and Kenny a video game every year.\" She explained, counting them off on her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Every year?\" Zack asked, perking up at the possibility that there wasn't THREE impossible to please people in her household.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It always makes them happy.\" Was the only explanation Dakota could give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's so...predictable.\" Zack said, in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's cute!\" Piper declared, wishing her own household could be that 'predictable'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And so, one maroon tie with gold diamond patterns. One Watanagashi home food processor for fruit smoothies and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As soon as they stepped in front of Gamestop, Piper was swept up with such a feeling of elation she started dancing, <i>dancing</i>, in the middle of the busy mall walkway. She squeeled and jumped up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Piper what's gotten into you you?\" Dakota asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"My shopping nightmare is over!\" She declared<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What?\" Dakota asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She means Parker.\" Zack explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She was a <i>nightmare</i> to shop for Dakota! You have no idea! How do you shop for someone who only likes to get drunk with her friends? How, I ask you? Last year, I was this close, this close.\" Piper held her fingers together. \"To buying her box wine for Christmas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She got her Mascara.\" He mentioned to Dakota. Piper rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It was the wrong shade, and got bitched at, and she made ME return it. But this year? This year it's simple! All I have to do is pick out a video game and...\" Piper's expression sank. \"I haven't played a video game in years. And the last one Parker bought lasted her a weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Picky?\" Zack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No.\" Piper explained, \"She finished it. She even showed me the 100% completion ratio. If I'm going to need to get her something cheap, but also that can last her a while. She has 400 hours on Fallout already, and that's her standard. Zack, you play more games than me, help me out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hmmm.

Zack started to protest, but she threw a hand up.  \"<i>That being said!</i>  This is totally up Parker's alley, as much as I hate to admit it.  But it runs on my ridiculously old 360, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack stared at the box in her hand.  \"I mean.  It should?  Game is like, ten years old.  And also, it's five bucks.\"  Piper stared at it incredulously.  \"Jeeze, just give it to me.\"  He snagged it out of her hand and stormed towards the counter.  \"Merry Christmas!  Presents that are going towards your picky sister are the best present I could ever give.  Let me know if it doesn't work out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota and Piper both laughed- But Piper couldn't help but feel concerned.  Given her sister's recent... Obsession with games- New Vegas' hypnotizing effect on her sister immediately came to mind- She wasn't sure if it was a great idea to give her yet another fantastical world to delve into.  Of course, ten seconds later, Zack stormed back, although 'stormed' was a strong verb, since it was more of a swagger.  \"There you go.  Merry Christmas.  Hell, I'll even buy you an Orange Julius for a bonus round.\"  With that, the two ladies and single lad went towards the food court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper ended up buying her Mom a sweater that would (hopefully) encompass her massive chest and post-baby belly, along with some Ferrero Rocher chocolate.  She knew pregnant ladies loved chocolate first-hand, but she wasn't sure that post-baby Harper would... But she could make a safe bet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristmas was a blowout.  Harper actually attempted to cook- By the end of it, her white tank top was completely splattered with various stains.  They were primarily located along her chest, but her post-baby tummy was a pretty impressive swell on it's own, and owned its fair share of the stain splatter..  Of course, now Parker was definitively larger than Harper by a long shot.  Her chest had, of course, swelled outwards, but now her boobs diverged and happily sloped down either side of her massive gut.  Her elation at Piper's (Or, by process of elimination, Zack's) present was met with some monumental jiggles, the kind that put the Black residences tit-wobbles to shame, by the sheer mass of poundage presented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had a fairly standard Breakfast and Lunch.  Neither were healthy.  Both were easily gorged upon, though- and gorge they did.  While hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, Piper would argue Hell also has no fury like a fat ex-party girl and a chubby mother of three.  Piper was no slouch when it came to eating, but watching her rapidly-approaching obese sister and her mother, sans morning sickness and general third-term unpleasantness glut themselves on food was a sight to behold.  The Harper women were no stranger to grandiose meals, but these woman took the cake, both hypothetically and literally- Piper had managed to snag a \"Christmas cake\", which was really just a discounted cake she had spotted at the grocery store while fulfilling Harper's food requests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper, of course, was exhausted after breakfast and lunch, meaning she took naps and tended to baby Hunter.  And while Mama bear was away, the cubs shall play- which really meant Parker played Xbox while Piper watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so dragons are real?  They just said-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  Clearly they are real.  You just saw one burn up a village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I want to use bows?  This is made by the same people who made Fallout?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this is by the people who made Fallout 3.  You played Fallout: New Vegas.  And also, yes.  Use bows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, who are the Dark Brotherhood?  They sound cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They aren't.  But, it's your weird cat lady.  Also, why did you pick a cat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a lot of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it came to dinner, Harper staggered out of her room.  Parker was glued to the screen, but Piper spotted her immediately, and stood up. \"Hey, so, uh, Parker is really into this game, and you kinda look like shit, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piper, are you offering to cook for me?  Because if so, you're really trying to get on my good side.  Guess you figured out that Hunter was my new favorite?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper blanched.  Her original idea was to propose Chinese for dinner- Hell, it was Christmas, and that's all you can order, right?  \"Um, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chinese it is.  Look... C'mere.\"  Harper steered Piper away from the living room and into the hallway. \"I'm not dumb.  I know Parker is really...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting fat?\"  Piper said quietly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper blushed.  \"I would have said 'Looking healthier than usual'.  But look- We've all been kind of letting ourselves go lately.  But I'd rather have a fat daughter than one who's dying of a failing liver in five years.  Point being- Hunter is a little baby, and I need all the help I can get.  You and your sister lend a hand, and I could give less of a shit if she weighs a ton.  Okay?\"  Piper began to think up an argument- until she saw just how <i>tired</i> Harper looked.  It was hard to think of her Mom as anything other than the glowing pregnant saint who yelled a lot- but now that Hunter was born, it was apparent that her Mom was completely run ragged.  And for the first time, Piper appreciated it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  I get it.  Sorry, Ma.\" She muttered- only to feel herself embraced in a warm, soft embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.  It's a better Christmas present than a sweater that's too tight on me.  No offense.  You still got the receipt?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Piper should have known. The golden rule of her entire life was that, if it involved her sister, things were never easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking it easy on Parker because of everything that seemed to go wrong in her life\u2014the friends ditching her, the weight gain, the general lack of any employable skills\u2014would only go on to enable her. Parker was a leech, a mooch, a spoiler of all things done out of the goodness of other people\u2019s hearts. It wasn\u2019t in her nature not to take a mile whenever she\u2019d been given an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Piper, she knew that. Their mother, not so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPiper, stop picking on your sister.\u201d Harper groaned, \u201cLet her play her games.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Piper, let me play my games.\u201d Parker raspberried, \u201cI wasn\u2019t even bothering you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the volume all the way up and you keep fucking FusRoDah\u2019ing right in my ear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have a bedroom.\u201d Parker grunted triumphantly as she struggled to resituate her heft, \u201cGo sit in there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the only room with cable!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Mom</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker had quickly come to take advantage of the situation. No longer content to go out and party, and no longer on speaking terms with the only people outside of her family who could tolerate her, Parker had no reason to leave the house anymore. And even though their mother had been really hard on her before all of this had started, having someone to help watch Hunter while she was at work was a lifesaver. Plus, look at her. Her baby <i>needed</i> her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Parker Black continued to grow\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Ma!\u201d she bellowed from the couch, \u201cMind bringing in more chips?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd grow\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPIPER WHERE THE FUCK IS MY MOU\u2014<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">shit, nevermind it was under my tit.</font>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd <i>grow</i>\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys welcome back.\u201d Parker burped into the microphone, \u201cDPNipSlip back at it again, we\u2019re gonna do the Markarth questline again\u2014one of the <i>stupidest</i> fucking parts of the game but\u2026 whatever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe office chair in Parker\u2019s room clicked ominously as she tilted her tonnage towards the desk. Her chest, already resting heavily on some parts of the poor thing, rolled forward like an ample avalanche of olive colored asp. The supports creaked as the cheap hex bolts fought the battle against all of the weight that Parker added to its frame with her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026 fuck\u2026 hold on.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker\u2019s grunts filled the dead air as she struggled to situate herself. Her wide wobbling wingspan was only just barely enough to let her lean forward like this. She had to sit her arms on the top of the sides of her funbags, and it pinched a little with all the extra rolls. She\u2019d gotten used to it\u2014just a lift here, a tuck there, and she\u2019d be golden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck.\u201d She gasped, out of breath, \u201cOkay, here we go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one hand, Parker moved her character\u2014about her tenth Khajit stealth archer, Dark Brotherhood assassain and leader of the thieves\u2019 guild\u2014through the stone gates of the simulated city. If it weren\u2019t for the pink LED lights, you never would have known that there was a mouse underneath that fat hand of hers. Her palm was so broad, her fingers so thick and sausage-like, clicking the mouse was about all that they were good for anymore. That and snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her other hand, she did that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker had made sure she had a smorgasbord of snacks to game with. Rather, her mommy had. Harper was happy to provide her daughter with everything that she could need in her exciting career as a Twitch Streamer, as long as it kept her fat ass inside to watch Hunter when she needed it. And honestly, at three, how much could Hunter have really needed her? Kid played in her room all day\u2014and Parker, her\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of Parker\u2019s chewing filled the feed, crunching on chips as the loading screen zoomed in on Alduin on a Word Wall for about the billionth time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you can get mods to change these.\u201d Parker crunched, \u201cBut like, some things are just too sacred, I guess? Like it wouldn\u2019t feel like Skyrim if you changed too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>agreed\u2014some things are sacred<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat\u2019s for lunch today Nip?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty seconds in and you\u2019re already eating\u2014incredible.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker snorted through her nose as she forced another fistful of chips past her lips. God, these fucking weirdos loved this kind of shit. They got off on watching her fat ass eat chips\u2014they even paid her for it! Parker didn\u2019t understand why these fucking fetishists came to this site, but she couldn\u2019t complain. Not when they were basically keeping her rig up to date. Keeping her fat gut full of food and pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGamers were weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotta keep my strength up for this boring ass questline.\u201d Parker snarked into the comments, \u201cKeep it up and I\u2019ll keep my shirt on the whole time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker\u2019s office chair creaked again as she leaned back a bit to grab her Monster. She couldn\u2019t get enough of the stuff\u2014it had helped fuel her through many nights of trying out cheap games on Steam. Killing the half-can that had been left, she let out a monstrous burp that rattled her monitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck.\u201d She curled, \u201cSorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>literally never apologize for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour so sexy!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou up for some pizza?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honesty, Parker had mixed feelings about being so fucking fat. She hated it, but she was long past the point of actually doing anything about it. None of her old friends saw her anyway, so what was the point? These nerds on the internet had always known her as DPNipSlip\u2014who\u2019d been a \u201cbbw\u201d for as long as the account existed. They told her she was pretty, even when she felt like an ugly fat piece of shit, and they allowed her to pursue her passion for video games in comfort and swagger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure these chubby chasers were just beating their meat to her, but that wasn\u2019t\u2019 all that bad\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoops. Lived up to my name there.\u201d Parker winked saucily, unfurling a foot and a half of tank top and letting one of her saucer nipples out to play before quickly reeling it back in, \u201cMaybe send me some Mexican food and it\u2019ll happen again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife was good for Parker Black, Gamer Gal Extraordinaire\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Piper was used to some serious snackage around the house.  Parker (back when she was a thin(ish) bimbo, granted) was the Queen of midnight snack sessions.  Harper, rapidly approaching (and passing) hilariously rotund status throughout her pregnancy, usurped Parker's drunk binges when it came to odd food stuffings.  One had never seen explicitness quite like a 9 month pregnant woman eating over half a dozen fluffer-nutter sandwiches in nothing but a tank top and panties- not what one would like to witness their own Mom doing, but it wasn't like that get-up was uncommon in the Black household.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to her word, Piper was helping out as much as she could with Hunter.  It would've been cruel to do anything else- Piper and Harper had their petty squabbles, but she still was a single Mom raising two- no, three- daughters.  Piper had even gotten Parker to help out every now and then!  And things were great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne might argue they were <i>too</i> great.  Piper was no activist in the Black household, but she found herself running around a lot more than usual.  Her massive chest had gone from burdensome to brutal- Turned out that all those big-breasted ladies whining about their rack on television weren't bluffing- Piper just never struggled with it because she was pretty sedentary until recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, between her ballooning sister and the increasingly lazy- and greedy- Harper, Piper had her work cut out for her.  Hell, she had started <i>cooking!</i>  Thanks to a few choice tips from Zack and Dakota, she had managed to serve up quite a few decent meals- But Harper and Parker were pretty stingy when it came to meals.  If it wasn't loaded with carbs and calories, they lost interest.  This meant that a lot of meals were starches and heavy dairy.  Mac and Cheese seemed to be a household staple, alongside variou<i></i>s potato dishes.  On the off chance Harper got some overtime at her job (she had finally gone back to work, even maternity leave had it's limits) they'd splurge and get some delivery... Until they found out that:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA.  Frozen pizzas are way cheaper, and<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB.  You can totally put <i>whatever you want</i> on a frozen pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis lead to a lot of really weird combinations.  Turns out, between an ex-partier and an ex-pregnant woman, tastes can get... A little weird.  Of course, said tastes were always a combination of fatty foods.  Piper was particularly amused by the \"Macaroni and cheese/french fries/ Hamburger Helper pizza.  It was truly a nightmare.  That didn't stop Harper and Parker from going to town.  Of course, Piper had a slice too.  It was tasty, but extremely filling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, raising a baby was hard.  Piper knew this now, because she found herself increasingly taking care of Hunter.  Harper, of course, did all the feeding- but diaper duty, nap-time settling, and bath time quickly became Piper's job.  This lead to an increasingly stationary Harper.  If she didn't have her desk job, she'd be as big as Parker in six months!  That being said... She was quickly approaching 'Fat' territory.  Piper didn't really feel comfortable with pointing this out, given Parker had been ballooning up at a rapid pace... Until one night, when things reached a head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess who just got paid for <i>forty-six hours!</i>\"  Harper shouted, slamming the door behind her increasingly bouncy booty.  Piper glared at her- She had just gotten Hunter to sleep.  This glare doubled as an examination of her Mom's increasingly blobby physique.  There was no denying it.  Harper was getting <i>fat</i>.  Her generic office attire- Which had been replaced since her pre-pregnancy days- was increasingly tight.  But now?  Look, Piper was no stranger to having a hefty midsection- and all the difficulties it presented- but Harper was literally busting at the seams.  Her khakis were painted onto her thicker thighs, her belly caused diamond shaped gaps between her buttons, which exposed her skin-tight undershirt, and her boobs...  Look, it was weird to stare at your own mother's chest, but her chest was <b>massive.</b>  Like, outstripping Piper by miles, and... Well, it was hard to get a grasp on just how big Parker was, since she was so damn fat, but it was an easy assumption that they were larger.  Y'know, because of nursing and all that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you got big bucks, Mom, whatcha gonna do about?\"  Parker grumbled from the couch, before slamming her can of Red Bull and immediately launching herself into Skyrim.  \"Gotta kick some vampire ass.  Got no time for bragging.\"  She muttered, before letting out a massive belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper slamming the door didn't wake up Hunter.  Parker's belch did.  \"Asshole!\"  Piper shouted, punching her sister in the arm before launching off the couch.  \"And Ma, quit bragging.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christ, you two!  I'm not bragging!\"  Harper shouted, immediately pulling her blouse over her head, leaving her tubby tummy exposed as her undershirt rode up, which only emphasized how under-sized her bra was: tit-flesh oozed over each cup.  \"I'm saying... We should have a <i>feast!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well let's feed Hunter first, 'kay?\"  Piper grumbled as she rushed into her Mom/Hunter's room to soothe the sobbing infant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong story short, Harper (with Parker's guidance) ordered about a hundred dollars of take-out.  To describe what happened next as anything other than a literal food massacre would be doing it injustice.  By the end, Harper was passed out on the couch, her undershirt rolled up under her massive chest, her tummy domed out in all of it's post-pregnancy stretch-marked glory, and her work khakis unbuttoned with the zipper split about as hard as one's zipper could split.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker, meanwhile, was reclined in their used and abused recliner, her controller loosely gripped in her greasy hands.  Her pajama pants were equally pushed down by her distended tummy- but unlike Harper, who had opted to keep her shirt on, Parker laid in just her pathetically undersized bra- boob flesh oozed out from over and under the cups in equal measure.  Every now and then, one of the Black women would let out a sleepy belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper was just glad that Hunter was asleep again.</span></div></div>",

Harper was apparently the new office sweetheart- her overtime pay became more common, and the day she came home, tearing up and holding several bags of fast food and talking about how she had been promoted to some manager position, Piper had actually found herself tearing up too!  Of course, Parker continued to be a fat piece of shit on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper and Hunter had formed a pretty regular routine that kept the ever-fussy baby two steps removed from a full blown meltdown, but it didn't prevent <i>other</i> members of the household from throwing their own hissy-fits.  Parker's pudgy post-party bod had only continued to bloat upwards and outwards, and watching her ever-expanding sister stomp and shout and <i>literally cry</i> when the XBox broke?  That was definitely a scene Piper could do without remembering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHY IS IT RED AND WHY DOESN'T IT WORK?\"  Parker screamed at the top of her lungs.  Hunter was already up and screaming because of Parker's initial outburst, and between the stomping sister and the screaming infant, Piper was one second away from losing her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christ... Parker, it's- look, it's pretty common.  Just go and fuckin' buy a new one!  Also, shut up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, YOU shut up!\"  Parker retorted.  \"You KNOW I can't dri- I mean, I don't...\"  Piper arched an eyebrow.  \"I... Look, I can't get the seat to go back far enough.  My boobs get in the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Parker.   When did this happen?\"  Piper asked incredulously.  Her sister's tits couldn't be <b>that</b> big... Right?  This was a purely hypothetical question since Parker was standing not even five feet away from Piper and she could very clearly see that yes, her sister's massive form would make driving a car difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look...\"  Parker sniffled pitifully.  \"I can watch Hunter.  Can you...?\"  She began pathetically.  Piper didn't blink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With what money, Parker?\"  Piper asked bluntly.  Her sister sure as shit didn't work or contribute anything to society, so the fact that she seemed to think Parker had the fifty bucks or so that a new XBox would cost was pretty telling of her sister's current mental state-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is a hundred enough?\"  Parker sniffled, pulling a rumbled handful of bills out from behind the couch cushions.  \"A hundred and twenty?\"  She finished lamely, counting the handful of green strips of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom gives me money sometimes.  For groceries.\"  Piper glared at her sister.  \"Look, I just... Ugh.  You can have the rest if you just go get a new one!   I... It's not like I'm gonna use it.\"  Parker looked so pathetic that Piper couldn't help but say yes.  Grabbing the bills from her sister's hand, she began to storm towards the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... Can you... Grab some soda on the way home?\"  Piper relented.  \"And... If they have a copy of Just Cause 2...?\"  Piper slammed the door on her sorry excuse of a sister.  Part of her almost missed when Parker just got drunk with her idiot friends every other night.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Piper sisters jumped up wooping in victory, slapping double high fives, briefly hugging their increasingly soft bodies together, but victory celebrations lasted only a few seconds before Parker felt light-headed and out of breath, and was forced to collapse her weight in the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fuck...\" She said, panting and red in the face. \"I'm out of shape.

We're a team, right?\" Parker said, digging around the couch for a food container that wasn't empty, and finding some cold Brent Brother's Pizza. For the first few days, Super Smash Brothers had let Piper and Parker vent some built up frustration with each other, as they smashed each other with various virtual objects for days on end. But venting their emotions gave way to having fun with each other, and once they started having fun together, something strange happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Piper and Parker actually started enjoying each other's company. So much so, that they found they preffered working as a team to fighting each other, for the first time in...maybe forever. In the two months since Christmas, there had not been a single fight in the Black Household. Their mother, Harper, considered it such an unexpected blessing to have a harmonious household for her last two months of pregnancy, that she decided not to challenge the girls about their growing waistlines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Parker had continued to grow at apace, and there was no denying it, she was no longer chubby or chunky, she was downright fat now. She'd gained over 100 pounds since the summer, and would be cresting 300 pounds any day now. Both the girls were hourglass shaped, but most of Parker's weight settled in her still shapely behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Despite her weight, Parker had the habit of lounging around all day in a t-shirt and underwear, and almost all her underwear were thongs. So everyone in the household got an eyeful of that giant, cellulite free butt. Piper used to complain, but lately she'd taken to the habit herself. Her gain had centered in her chest, and the fact that she hadn't gone shopping since Christmas (who had the money?) meant that currently, not a single bra in her closet fit Piper, and she was left going <i>au naturale</i>. She still wasn't nearly as big as her BIG sister, but Piper had put on a good, 20 pounds since she retreated into her sisters gamer cave, combined with the usual holiday pounds, Piper had developed a noticable little paunch.<br>\r\nWhile Parker caught her breath, Piper's phone buzzed for like the 5th time today. She finally decided to check it. She had 12 unread texts from Dakota.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">5:36<br>\r\n\"I'm Going to keep messaging your until you answer me, Piper. I'm actually worried something has happened to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5:15<br>\r\n\"Is everything okay? You're not mad at me or something, are you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3:13<br>\r\n\"Earth to Piper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2:32<br>\r\n\"We're leaving the arcade, and heading to the movies. We can still swing by your house and pick you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n12:03<br>\r\n\"Hey Piper! Zack found this new arcade that opened up, you want to come with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYesterday<br>\r\n7:32<br>\r\n\"Piper, it's been ages since we hung out like before. We should do something tomorrow!</div>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It went on like that from there. Yeesh, Piper wasn't trying to blow Dakota off she was just...having a lot of fun with her sister. Getting to know her really. She looked over at Parker who, having regained her strength via cheap psuedo-pizza, was feeling revitalized. \"Ready to take on the next challenge, Piper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Piper really <i>looked</i> at her sister for the first time in a while. Parker used to tan herself until she was almost a nice golden brown, but now she looked paler then she thought a member of the Black family was capable of. She had bags under her eyes from staying up all night playing video games, and watching Netflix. Her hair was greasy. Her pits were unshaved. And the swell of her belly spilled out from under her shirt to rest on her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then Piper wondered how many of these things were true of her. Maybe some more social interaction would do them some good. \"Just a second, Parker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her thumbs got to work on texting back Dakota.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, sorry I've been such a flake Dakota.

They'd hung out at the pier... that sounded dumb. What was there to do at a pier? They used to window shop, but it wasn't like a beach town like the Port had any new kitschy stuff to offer in the middle of January. D's Donuts sounded nice, at least... but could they really do that every day?

And it was <i>really</i> fun\u2014Dakota would definitely like it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, as soon as she hit the SEND button, Piper felt like she'd made a mistake.

No sweat.\" Piper morosely typed out, \"Some other time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second thought, more than a little disappointed in her friend's refusal to answer the call of simulated adventure, Piper threw her phone onto the pillow of Parker's bed. She tossed herself down in a very similar fashion, splayed out over the covers. It wasn't like she was heartbroken or anything, just... well, she missed Dakota too. It kinda sucked that she wasn't down to try anything new. It really <i>was</i> fun...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was that?\" Parker's lips smacked through gobs of greasy not-pizza as she nestled back into the well-worn spot on her bed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just Dee.\" Piper answered nonplussed, \"Checking to see if I'm still alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, that's great.\" Parker widened her maw and stuffed down more of her Brent Brother's pie, \"You ask if she wanted to join our guild?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she said no.\" Piper almost sighed as she reached into the sopping cardboard box to pull out a cheesy slice for herself, \"Some other time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, that sucks.\" Parker curled a nostril, \"Get better friends, Piper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You</i> get better friends.\" Piper laughed, swatting at her sister with the unused pillow, \"M'gonna go get some soda. You want some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure.\" Parker said as she chose Ganandorf for the umpteenth time, \"Gonna try to knock out this sandbag challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper shrugged her meaty shoulders as she hoisted herself up. God, it felt so weird to be walking. Like, her legs were still kind've numb. How long had they been playing? She'd missed all those texts from Dakota, yeah, but... wasn't it light out when they whipped out with WiiU? Piper couldn't shake the feeling like they'd been playing a lot longer than they realized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed in nothing but her panties and a baggy t-shirt from her Mom's party days, Piper shuffled into the kitchen. The hardwood was still cold, and getting colder. With baby Hunter to take care of, it was cheaper to get a couple more blankets than it was to turn on the heat. Parker barely noticed it, but Piper wasn't quite as well insulated as her sister. How her mom handled it, she'd never know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper grumbled and opened the fridge, grabbing an off-brand Coke from inside. She cracked it open loudly and took a good long swig. Who knew maining Diddy Kong could make a girl so thirsty? She killed the can, tossed it in the trash, and dragged out two more before closing the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey hun.\" came her mother's voice, quietly, as she entered the kitchen, \"Just put Hunter down for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hope she stays that way.\" Piper joked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know she won't.\" her mom said with a little laugh, her slight double chin catching, \"Mind keeping the TV down in your sister's room? You know, just in case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure thing Ma.\" Piper cracked her second can, \"We'll keep it quiet for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper started towards the doorway, her footfalls carrying throughout the house. There was the slightest movement in her thicker calves when she walked, and her footsteps echoed in her tiny tummy. Piper had definitely put on some weight since last year, but then who hadn't? Her mom was still sporting an extra forty pounds of baby weight and Parker, well... was Parker. Piper could gain another twenty pounds and still be the skinniest girl in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was <i>almost</i> into the hallway when her mother called out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piper? Sweetie?\" she asked, \"I just wanted to talk to you...\"</span></div></div>",

I'm actually having a lot of fun.\" Piper smiled, \"She's not <i>that</i> terrible to hang out with. Until she loses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women embraced, their teeming tits touching tremendously as they pressed against one another. Harper had gotten so soft since the baby was born, in more ways than one. She was still all mushy from the hormones, and having a new baby in the house did wonders for her ability to put up with all this gaming nonsense, so long as it meant having a tighter-knit family. It was almost like her daughters were speaking a different language sometimes, but she would never get over the fact that her little girls were bonding. Of their own free will!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna head back in. Still got <i>lots</i> of smashing to do.\" Piper scratched her side through her t-shirt, \"Do we have any more chips?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pick some up tomorrow when I go to the grocery store.\" Harper kissed her daughter on the cheek, \"Love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you too, Ma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Piper walked back in just as she had walked out. She tossed Parker a soda, who caught it with one pale meaty arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, did you have to milk the cow yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't make any sense in this context, Parker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, you were gone a long time.\" the older, bigger Black sister cracked her can, \"Did your dumb friend text you back? She gonna join our guild or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I got caught up with Mom. She's putting Hunter to bed, says she wants us to keep the TV low.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lame.\" Parker rolled her eyes, \"Hold up, I'll turn it down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker began rocking arduously in place, her swelling stomach folding into rolls as she hoisted her heaviness up off of the bed and lumbered towards the television. Sticking her fat ass out, she fiddled with her chubby fingers as the idling theme music of Super Smash Bros got quieter and quieter. When the task was done, Parker's fat face was beet red. You would have thought she'd benchpressed something other than a can of Coke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uff.\" she whined as she collapsed down on the bed, \"I've <i>got</i> to get a remote...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper agreed. Whenever Parker didn't feel like getting her fat ass up, she made her do it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd mom want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper <i>wanted</i> to tell her sister the truth. It was a knee-jerk reaction, a holdover from their more bitter days. But as they had gotten to know each other, and Piper learned about her sister's insecurities (about her weight, her not having friends, her recent bout of celibacy) she had become a bit more gentle in her handling of her. So, of course, she wasn't going to say <i>she wanted to thank me for hanging out with your fat ass!</i> in that way that could be taken facetiously or at face value, and cause a fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wanted to know what we needed from the store.\" Piper half-lied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was true. She was doing a good thing here, wasn't she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sweet, tell her to pick up more chips.\" Parker burped, \"And some cookie dough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper picked up her phone and relayed the message via text, and then reclaimed her controller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe <i>was</i> a good sister, wasn't she?</span></div></div>",

Maybe it was because Parker already had more weight to maintain, maybe it\u2019s because she had a history of obesity, or maybe it\u2019s just something about Piper Black that was born to be fat. But since she retreated into her nerd cave, Piper had put on over one hundred pounds. \u2018Fortunately\u2019 most of it had ended up in her chest. Each of Piper\u2019s breasts was as big as her belly, and she had a big round potbelly now. Her bras no longer came close to fitting, and as tight as the family finances were (and they were made tighter by having to feed two insatiable tubsters) there was no way she could possibly afford a new one. So her habit of going commando became a necessity, as her wardrobe was replaced by Parker\u2019s hand-me-downs, as she grew into sizes formally only occupied by her \u2018big sister.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there were plenty of hand-me-downs as Parker wasn\u2019t done growing either. She was \u2018only\u2019 growing at 10 or 15 pounds a month, which meant that she had rocketed past the 300 pound mark and kept going. Her ass had spread out so much that more and more Piper found their heavy hips touching when they sat next to each other on the couch for hours on end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it was up to the Black Sisters this would be the end of their story. Their were both so greedy, so lazy that if you let them vegetate in front of tv screens and provided them with snacks, they\u2019d do nothing else for the rest of their lives. But life doesn\u2019t work that way. It always has a funny way of throwing interruptions just when you\u2019re comfortable. Piper had one little hiccup she hadn\u2019t accounted for.</span></div></div>",

When their mother sent them food shopping, they noticed 2 liters of soda were only 88 cents. So they loaded a shopping cart full of them and decided to see who could finish more in a single day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Piper had only chugged the last quarter of the bottle after nursing it for a while.

She didn't realize it but it was the first time in ages that Piper had actually paid Parker a compliment. Just a few months ago, Piper would have thought this talent was 'skanky', but now she looked at Parker like a mentor a...big sister. Parker seized the moment to return the affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey uh...I'm sorry for making fun of you for making fun of you for all those years...for being fat you know?

Plus it felt SO good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pffft, you'd be big as a house.\" Parker scoffed.\"Exactly!\" Piper sighed happily, daydreaming about all the donuts she would have eaten if she gotten the chance. \"...do you think we can get mom to make us some extra lunch today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I wouldn't push it Piper...\" Parker said, nervously. \"I don't want her figuring out what we're up to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah...I suppose you're right...but I'm going to try anyway, because I want some fucking pizza.\" She said with a mischievous grin. \"Moooom!\" She hollered. \"Can you make us some more Ellios?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"AGAIN?!\" Came the answer from upstairs.

The fact was, her little sister was more courageous than her, and she'd follow her lead.\"Don't come whining to me when you blow up like a balloon then!\" She warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh believe me.\" Piper said with a satisfied pat on her belly. \"I won't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And you <i>won't</i> be sitting around on your fat butts for another weekend.\" Harper insisted. \"You're getting out and getting some fresh air.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Growing up, there were times when everyone knew that both Piper and Parker knew that her mother was serious. And this time, with the new baby in tow and money stretched tight as it was, even the lackadaisical Black sisters knew that their mother\u2019s wits were at an end. But that didn\u2019t mean they were going to go out without a bang\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel ridiculous.\u201d Parker pinched one of her fatty rolls that stretched her t-shirt tight, \u201cI <i>look</i> ridiculous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look like a fox.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore like a cow\u2026\u201d Parker huffed as she adjusted her incredible udders, the ocean of olive-colored adipose jiggling and sloshing drunkenly as she fought with it, \u201cThis is a dumb idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Piper and Parker were going to have to grow up and get out of their little nerd cave, they were going to have some fun before they did it. Harper had warned them that they would be getting off of their expansive asses \u201ctomorrow\u201d, but she hadn\u2019t specified <i>when</i> tomorrow. Piper had successfully convinced their mom that they were going to go out for one last hurrah before they got the new year off right. Just a little get-together, nothing special. And perhaps it was because of her daughters\u2019 respectively weight gains, or maybe she was just happy to hear that they were getting out of the house, she didn\u2019t seem to mind too much that they intended to prolong their lives as couch potatoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a party going down at Dauphin Towers\u2014Piper\u2019s pals Hurley and Yanira had let them know about it. And they always threw the best ragers. Plenty of booze, plenty of friendly faces, and more importantly\u2026 plenty of food! You don\u2019t get to be Hurley\u2019s size without a wife that cooks like Yanira! Even if everything else sucked, at <i>least</i> there\u2019d be some grub to chow down on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop worrying so much, you look great.\u201d Piper\u2019s lips curled into a smile as she rolled her shirt up along her belly, \u201cDoes this look stupid?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike, I mean, you holding it back there yeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking of tying it off.\u201d Piper said with a proud pat to her pudgy paunch, \u201cLetting it all hang out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have the figure for it.\u201d Parker made a face as she scarfed down a couple of pizza pockets, \u201cCover up that jelly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou cover up yours.\u201d Piper spat back, \u201cI\u2019m looking <i>pre</i>tty hot right about now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the night grew darker and Parker\u2019s confidence wore thin, Piper finally dragged her outside to the Black Family\u2019s puttering old minivan. Just about the time that could be considered \u201cfashionably late\u201d for a girl like Piper, the silver Honda came to a halt in the parking lot, and the Black sisters wobbled inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper had dressed in a tight t-shirt with short sleeves that pinched the small layer of fat that coated her arms. Her breasts distorted the Floating Heads logo beyond all recognition, and her tummy rolled out to ride it up all the way along the soft brown curvature. She filled the seat of her jeans well as her broad butt and wide hips pressed tightly against the faded denim. Her hair was down, letting her long black locks flow freely in the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile her sister, immensely fat and swollen beyond recognition, wasn\u2019t nearly as confident. She waddled meekly and slowly, her fat quivering with every step. She looked around hesitantly as if she were afraid of running into someone she knew. And why shouldn\u2019t she be? Parker had blimped up! Even if they had seen her, no one would have recognized her as the lithe attractive lush who partied her brains out around Daven\u2019s Port. Instead they\u2019d only see a busty zeppelin floating behind her\u2026 her more attractive sister\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realization hit Parker right in the gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ready to go inside?\u201d Piper asked flirtatiously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know, P.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome <i>on</i>. Don\u2019t be such a baby!\u201d Piper wrapped her arms around Parker\u2019s and pulled the heavier girl, \u201cDo you <i>want</i> to get laid or not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sisters waddled towards the door\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She smiled a little, thinking back to the times when she had secured her dates (well, playdates) as a poor little fat girl. Luckily they had a tool on hand now that was not available back in elementary school \u2013 alcohol. \u201cCome on, Parker, it'll be OK. You just need a drink first. Or a dozen. And there's bound to be plenty here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eYeah, right\u2026\u201d whined Parker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, Parker, when Hurley lets us in, just go hide yourself in one of the bedrooms if you're not feeling up to it. I'll secure booze and join you. After we get smashed, it's up to you what you do next. Hell, you can lock yourself up in there, I won't mind.\u201d Though Yanira or Hurley might. \u201cOK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, OK.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper loudly knocked on the door and sure enough, a deep bass called out: \u201cComing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavy footsteps not long after announced the arrival of their humongous host. \u201cPiper! Hi! How have you been? Haven't seen you in ages!\u201d Hurley gave her an appreciative look before enveloping her in his bear-like hug, \u201cLooking better than ever, eh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up!\u201d she punched him playfully, \u201cD'you want Yanira to hear you? Anyway, I brought my sister too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, so this is the legendary Parker Black. Huh,\u201d Hurley swallowed a remark, likely about her size, and went on, \u201cwelcome to the Jones-Sanchez household. Come in, come in, both of you. Still getting everything ready, y'know, but don't let that stop you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as his spherical gut cleared the hallway, Piper set for the living room, sure she would find alcohol there. She made a gesture behind her back, directing Parker to the bedroom, and peeked into the kitchen. \u201cHi, Yanira! Ooh, smells good!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks but I'm not done yet! And I need more helpers!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure! I'll get you some!\u201d Misunderstanding her words on purpose, Piper ran out, her boobs and potbelly bouncing as she did. It was just a couple steps to the living room and to Piper's relief she saw a lone figure there, arranging plenty of beer and bottles of stronger spirits around the room. \u201cJay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Pipes! Long time no see! Have you...\u201d Jay Collins turned around, made a double take and nearly tripped into the vast expanse of her olive cleavage. \u201cUhh\u2026 sorry. I mean\u2026 have you seen Yanira around?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, she's in the kitchen, I think. And wants your help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks. Uh, OK, I'll do it\u2026\u201d his gaze was still locked on Piper's boobs, \u201clisten, we need to chat later, huh? To, uh, catch up, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d Piper watched him leave the room, then surreptitiously snagged two bottles of vodka and made herself scarce as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker was already waiting for her in the guest bedroom, otherwise empty at this early hour. Sitting on the bed, her T-shirt gave up on trying to contain all that flab and rolled up, reduced to a mere boob tube. She was sizing up the lowest and biggest spare tyre that spread over her thighs with a glum face. When she heard steps, she looked up tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to cover her belly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHiya, sister dear. Here's the booze like I promised. Except I couldn't find glasses so\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Y'know what? That's even better. Drinking by shots is is too fuckin' slow.\u201d Parker grabbed one bottle, opened it with a practiced hand and started drinking straight from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the liquor was half gone, Piper withdrew and hid in a corner of the hallway, watching. As she expected, soon a lone male figure veered in toward her big sister, still drinking from the bottle. \u201eAnd who're you, cutie? Can't say I've seen you round before. I like a gurl that can hold'er drinks,\u201d he slurred a little despite it being so early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell hello there, loverboy. Like what you're seein'?\u201d Parker thrust her boobs out, making her whole body jiggle. Piper had assumed it would take more than a bottle of vodka to get such a fatty in the mood but on empty stomach it seemed to have worked just as planned. Her big sister shamelessly segued into an old routine, developed back when she was less than half her current size. Luckily her partner of the moment didn't seem to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, a lot. I'm Dick, by the way,\u201d sitting down on bed next to her, he casually slid his arm around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh, sounds promising,\u201d giggled Parker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper sighed at her sister's blunt approach. Still, it seemed to be working for Parker. And now the other bottle of vodka in her hand was calling to her, plus there was Jay's earlier invitation. And her stomach was growling, demanding to be fed. Should she seek her own entertainment?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I turned him down but the more I think about it, the more I like it. He said it's well paid. Just imagine, being able to buy three, no, four pizzas for lunch,\u201d she smacked her lips in anticipation. \u201cAnd you wanted that new game, whatsitsname, right? Look, I'll just tell him to drop by and explain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 if he comes we could at least ask him to join our guild.\u201d Parker's mind slipped back to gaming again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 we could.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting Zack to come was difficult at first, but surprisingly easy once she promised him a quarter of Ellio's pizza. When he knocked on the door, Piper waddled to open \u2013 and they were both in for a surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Pipes. You've, eh, upgraded, right?\u201d The same could be said for him though. Piper's eyes were first drawn to a sizable potbelly, but the blonde boy had grown all over since she'd last seen him. He puffed up his cheeks: \u201cSo where's the pizza? Look, I'm yours but make it quick, OK? My evening shift starts in two hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPizza?\u201d Harper chose this moment to appear with the pie ready in her hands. \u201cHi, err, Zack?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Zack called me with some news about a job so I invited him to tell us more about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA job?\u201d Her Mom nearly jumped at the word. \u201cOh! And the pizza is for him? Why haven't you said so? Come in, come in, Zackie, enjoy your pizza. Here, take it. If you need anything else, just holler.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper had intended for Zack to have a slice, leaving the rest to her (and possibly Parker). Instead the growing boy hogged it on his knees and Black sisters were lucky to snatch a slice each while he munched like a champion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what's all that talk about a job?\u201d Parker asked impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, Piper didn't tell you? It's at the zoo,\u201d he grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! But animals stink! And\u2026 and\u2026 don't we need, like, some papers for that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, no, not as caretakers. The Daven's Port Zoo managers had an insane idea to include humans in their great apes pavillion. You'd be exhibits, not workers. But you'd get paid for it and you wouldn't be locked up in there, it'd be a 9 to 5 job and you could leave at any time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPiper was right, this is silly. And weird.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When the job interview is based around how \"average\" you are, how do you dress up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't like there were many options for either of the Black sisters. Between Parker's monumental weight gain and Piper's comparatively smaller plumping, it wasn't like they were left many options. Out of all the articles of clothing that Parker had outgrown since she'd starting getting fat, her only professional attire was among the first to go. A black button-up sportscoat with a long dress and killer heels, all wasted because Parker couldn't keep herself slim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper's whale of a sister had dressed in the only thing that they could find on such short notice, and it was hardly impressive. One trip to Goodwill after Zack had made his little announcement, and Parker was all decked out in the finest sundress that her restrictive size and twenty dollars could buy, complete with matching flats that weren't too horrible, she supposed. Or rather, she sighed dejectedly before slipping her fat feet inside of them--there was no way she was ever going to see them over her gut, so why bother getting all worked up about it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked enormous. Fatter than ever, somehow. The dress was clingy, but loose where it wasn't hugging Parker's prodigious paunch. The white fabric that made up the upper area of the bosom and around her shoulders was so ample that it looked ridiculous. Her breasts hung over her stomach, leaving the seam where the fabric met completely hidden. From her waist down, the soft blue fabric just wouldn't leave her alone. It outlined her every curve, every fold, every roll on her body. Behind her, Parker's couch-cushion cheeks bounced and shimmied awkwardly. You could hear them brushing against the fabric of the dress as she waddled her way behind her little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper had fared slightly better in the fashion department, but not by much. Since her gain wasn't nearly as prodigious as Parker's, she could still squeeze into a few old things around the house. Her mom's old things, but still. She'd lucked out and managed to get <i>just</i> busty enough and grow <i>just</i> enough around the booty so that her mom's old pantsuit fit. The plump Armenian teen looked quite the professional, walking up the zoo's walkway with some swing in her wide steps. The only hitch was that she was just a bit <i>too</i> chubby. The pattern on the jacket was distorted, made clear by the vertical lines giving slightly around where her belly was the largest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piper... I don't know...\" Parker whined, \"This is stupid, let's make money another way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come <i>on</i>, Parker. You used to be so confident!\" Piper said in an exasperated sort of way, \"Just pretend these Zoo people are hot guys and getting a job is... <i>giving</i> a job!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Parker swatted her younger sister, her exposed brown upperarms wobbling with the motion, \"Don't joke like that! I'm already super upset...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe office of the Zookeepers in charge of this strange new exhibit was small, even taking the Black sisters' relative sizes into account. It made sense, Piper supposed, to minimalize the space for the humans in an exhibit for animals. But on the outside, it may as well have been just another ticket hut...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" asked a frumpy woman in cargo shorts<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we're, uh...\" Piper cleared her throat in an attempt to sound older, \"We're here for the job interview?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe zookeeper cocked an eyebrow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The uh... human exhibit?\" Piper smiled (she hoped) convincingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper gave her skeptical older sister two thumbs up and turned back to the woman, who escorted them inside. It seemed slightly larger, if that way saying much. There were chairs lined up and down the walls as the hallway cut into a ninety degree angle. On the walls, there were motivational posters of animals and a flatscreen television, showcasing some of the attractions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a seat, we'll be with you shortly.\" the zookeeper said, her voice unchanging and her eyes as listless as they were out in the hot sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door shut behind her, and the Black sisters did what they did best. They sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still think I should have gotten a job at the pizza shop.\" Parker said distastefully, \"This is so dumb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, it's awesome.\" Piper rolled her eyes, \"Besides, you'd get sick of pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could never get sick of pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you'd get fat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm already fat.\" Parker huffed with a pinch of her blue-colored inches, \"And I'll never get sick of pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you ever get sick of sitting around and playing video games?\" Piper asked enticingly, \"Because if we get this job, our lives are gonna be <i>E</i>-<i>Z</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get tired of people staring at me all the time.\" Parker said matter of factly, \"They already have a whale exhibit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't have a <i>fox</i> exhibit.\" Piper winked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...okay, that was pretty good.\" Parker admitted with a smile, \"It's just... what if they don't like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if they don't like <i>me</i>? Fuck 'em, we'll go get a job at the pizza shop.\" Piper shrugged her meaty shoulders, \"But that's not gonna happen because these guys are gonna love us and we're totally gonna get the job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to appease Parker's strain. She relaxed slightly, sinking into her shoulders as her ass unchlenched and she sank a few inches into her seat, spreading out that much wider. She leaned forward, and grabbed a pamphlet detailing the specifities of the experiment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, check this out...\" Parker said after a good minute of examining her find, \"It says here...\"</span></div></div>",

Piper's eyes were naturally drawn to the guy first, she admired his biceps for a while before her subconscious forced her to look at the girl. She looked familiar, more than familiar.

Perhaps we should switch you with the other pair?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Parker's eyes widened in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, we can always go sell pizza.

It is. And yes, the idea is to show people how little we humans differ from other great apes, within the confines of our little pavillion, that is.

Even the love handles, okay, she didn't normally spend a lot of time looking at Parker's skanky body. But now when she looked over, Parker had a double chin, and a straight up gut. It hung down to her lap, and jiggled every time she laughed at whatever stupid shit was on the television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper stopped following the TV, trying to follow Parker's transformation. It never happened before her eyes. No matter how long she stared at her, Parker remained Parker. There was no change, she wasn't blowing up like a balloon. But eventually Piper would blink, or lose concentration or look away, and then Parker would be a little bigger...she thought. Every time it was so subtle that she would second guess herself. But the cumulative effects were anything but subtle! Parker was downright fat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you staring at?\" Parker asked, in a moody voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper blinked and rubbed her eyes, confirming Parker's expansion. What was wrong with Parker? Maybe something was wrong with herself. What the hell was happening? \"N-nothing.\" Was all Piper could stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Parker's expansion quickened. Now it was happening before her eyes, coming on quickly like  a flood. Parker's butt expanded so fast that Piper had to scooch over to give it space, then schooch over again and again. Before long, Piper was pressed up against the arm rest, with no where to go, with Parker's butt still pushing against her. Parker's ass filled up the whole couch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach split into two giant tiers, the lower one sagged below her knees, just barely avoiding brushing the floor. Her breasts rested on that belly had flattened out under their own weight, and splayed out to the sides, until the spilled onto Piper. Everything about this girl was obscenely fat. Her elbow had a fold. Her forearm ended in a little ring of fat that swallowed up her wrist and part of her swollen hand. Even her face was so overwhelmed with fat that her cheeks stuck out farther than her lips, forming yet another indentation in her body where the fat spilled over. Piper couldn't be silent anymore, especially as she was threatened with being smothered under Parker's encroaching flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Parker...You're huge!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She almost seemed hurt, but the fact that she was incredibly, inhumanly obese was too obvious to deny or shrug off. \u201cBut so are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper\u2019s heart sank into her stomach. Her stomach, she didn\u2019t even feel it expand. It was already there. A big weight upon her. She turned down to look at it, but her chins got in the way. Her arms and legs splayed out to make room for the impending bulk. Piper felt her face drowning in fat as it sank lower and lower into the meat surrounding her head, her chins bunching up against her shoulders, and her cheeks blocking out part of her field of vision. She could barely move her head, it was so encased in fat, so she could only stare at the TV screen in horror as fat filled her field of view, first from her puffy cheeks, and then the slowly rising mountain of flesh that was her now pale belly. It rose up so high she could barely see the TV past it. Her arms felt her massive side rolls and hips. Even bending her fingers was hard, like she was wearing really thick gloves. They must be fat little sausages too. She tried to raise her hand in front of her face, and found it took considerable effort. She felt her giant bingo wings flapping against her with a wet slap with every little effort. When she saw it, her hand was like a ball of flab, with stubby, swollen fingers attached, covered in a thick layer of Dorito dust. Without even realizing it, she brought her fingers to her mouth and liked off some of the coating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis chilled her to the bone. It was a small thing, compared to her expansion, but it was something she could grasp. She couldn\u2019t recognize her own hand. She couldn\u2019t recognize her own behavior. Her brain then started making further rational connections: She was just pinned up against the edge of the couch by Parker. She looked over at her with some effort, and Parker was just as much a blob as ever. They both fit on the same couch somehow. Was it the same couch? Oh my god, was that the same TV? Was this the same house? She couldn\u2019t tell. She had a hard time piecing together details, what exactly looked different about this place. Because she could remember perfectly how everything got here. Even the towering piles of pizza boxes, and other debris of her and her sisters constant gorging. She could remember watching that pile grow taller and taller for weeks, wondering when someone would be bothered to take it out. She remembered it but\u2026she also remembered things being different. This all felt somehow wrong. Most of all, she knew she shouldn\u2019t feel trapped like this, by her own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Piper grunted. A new horror. She couldn\u2019t recognize her own voice. It came out thick and wet and deep. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d She admitted, terrified. Parker started to try and shift her tremendous bulk to somehow move herself closer to Piper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPiper, are you OK?\u201d She asked, sounding and looking tremendously concerned. \u201cDo you want me to try and get a doctor or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince when do you care?\u201d Piper instinctual scoffed, then gasped for breath. Even this much conversation was exhausting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPiper, of course I care. I\u2019m your sister and you\u2019re my best friend. And I\u2019m really worried about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper never heard Parker speak to her like that before. A new body, a new voice, and now a whole different attitude. Piper had no idea what to make of this. It was like talking to an entirely new person. A person who evidently cared about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, things are\u2026I feel like I\u2019m losing my mind.\u201d Piper stumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you can tell me anything, remember?\u201d Parker said, speaking immediately and directly, despite panting and beginning to sweat from this much talking. Piper took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and gathered her thoughts.</span></div></div>",

It was like her memories were fighting with some outside force. She moaned and pressed her pudgy hands against her head. She remembered walking all over town, running, hiding, nearly getting caught so many times. But at her weight that would be impossible. She wasn't even sure she could stand anymore. She could never climb a fence to escape any those pursuers like this. It'd probably fall under her own weight. Would her fingers even fit through a fence like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-we-we weren't like this,\" she started to say, her deep, slow voice disgusting her as much as her enormous body did. She remembered how that morning she was slightly annoyed that her breasts appeared to have grown enough to make her shirt fit tighter than usual. Now they were even bigger, and flabby, sagging over her giant belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, that recent memory was enough to hold onto. She turned towards her sister's round, fat-engulfed face, which as unrecognizable especially with the look of genuine concern she wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were thin, both of us. Just minutes ago. And then-and then-\" Piper felt panic gripping her again. And not the exhilarating panic of swiping something from a store and being almost caught, but the horrible kind of panic as she imagined what her life would be like with this new body. Her heart raced, her breathing quickened, \"Parker, something happened to us. This isn't us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker looked confused as much as she looked worried for her sister. Her flabby lips pressed into a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piper, what are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper struggled to turn to not be pressed against her sister's fat. She struggled to get off the couch, wobbling, jiggling, waving her flabby arms pathetically. She wanted to scream. She was trapped by her own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't get up!\" she yelped, her thick voice oozing out of her. She could hardly work up the energy to properly yell. \"I'm stuck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker moved a little, jiggling all over, and Piper did stand. The weight kept pulling her down. It definitely didn't feel like something was around her, trapping her-this was her. She turned to face her sister. She was sweating just from having to stand. She had to catch her breath again. She tried to rest her hands on her knees but her belly got in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't right! That can't be our couch! We're not like this!\" Piper was speaking as fast as her now lethargic, fat-laden voice would let her, \"We'd never get so fat and you would never ask me what was wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Parker looked just as oblivious as before. Piper started to move, trying to get away, trying to do anything but stand there and feel her grossly obese new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no, gotta' fix this,\" she huffed to herself. She held her head in her hands again. Her head throbbed as the reality of the situation hit her again, or rather, the unreality of it. She repeated it, her words growing more frantic, her whole body shaking with fear. Her belly, thighs, even her face all quivering uncontrollably reminding her that something had taken her body away.</span></div></div>",

I've never had to be helped when standing up. I've never had a belly down to my knees. I've never had a butt too big for two chairs,  I've never had thighs so wide I'd have to waddle\u2026\u201d She concentrated all her thoughts, all her willpower on the past as she knew it and tried to make it a reality again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, perhaps since it was her own doing, Piper felt reality shimmer around her. She felt her belly retreat, her thighs and hips shrink to a more manageable size. Suddenly it was so much easier to breathe, to stand. She sighed in relief but as her hands slid down her body she found she wasn't back to normal \u2013 not quite. There was still plenty of pudge around her waist and her chest obscured her field of vision a lot more than it did in the morning. All in all, she could still be forty, maybe even fifty pounds heavier. She didn't know whether to rejoice or despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she searched herself, she heard Parker speak again. \u201cI don't get it why you're making such a fuss about your weight, Pipes. I mean, if I had your body, I'd be happy as a clam. So you put on a couple pounds, big deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper jerked, looking at her big sister again. And Parker was big indeed, she didn't shrink at all, may have even got a little bigger. <i>Oh, right, I haven't included her in my litany.</i> She tried to correct it. \u201cWe're not like this! We have never been this big. We've never had a belly...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, no matter her efforts, new reality stayed stubbornly the same. Perhaps she couldn't change both of them alone? Perhaps her sister's help was necessary? Or she could be actively resisting the change? What next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It didn't seem to be coming from anywhere in particular, in fact it didn't seem to arrive in her brain via her ears at all. Still, it couldn't hurt to ask. \u201cParker? Did you say something? Is this your idea of a joke?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat joke? Your figure is a joke! Stop flaunting it here!\u201d Parker relented a little. \u201cLook, girl, you know I like you, even though you're a skinny skank, but you're blocking my TV! Either sit back down or get out. And order me another bunch of Ambrioli's pizzas while you're out there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, fine,\u201d Piper started to retreat, thinking it might be easier to communicate with that spirit (or hallucination or whatever) in private. Especially if it turned out to be just a hallucination. As she passed through the door, she paused, startled. Instead of the familiar narrow hallway, she stood in a wide-open space, clean, airy, with expensive-looking paintings on the walls. This was new too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of her wanted to go explore but first she needed to find out what was going on. \u201cYou there, voice! Who are you? What are you? What do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice, vaguely, possibly male, repeated its question. <i>\u201cWhy are you fighting the changes? All this is exactly what you wished for!\u201d<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\u201cI did?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cYes, you did. Or you didn't? Well, if you didn't yet, you will. Why do you insist on a single rigid timeline anyway? Dealing with you mortals is so confusing sometimes.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mortals? \u201cWho am I speaking to? Answer me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice sounded a little miffed by her attitude.<i> \u201cYou may address me 'Oh, Great Spirit Manitou,' mortal.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. And what was I supposed to wish for?\u201d Piper somehow perceived what could be only called an offended silence. \u201c Oh, Great Spirit Manitou,\u201d she added hastily.\u201d<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\u201cWell. Firstly, you wished or will wish for your father to stay with the family, then you wanted to be rich and as your last wish you asked for Jean-Claude Moreau to be your lover.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper thought about it. All three wishes were\u2026 believable. In fact, if someone offered her three wishes, she would likely have wanted those three things. But how could they lead to her ballooning like this? \u201cAnd what would you want in exchange? I don't suppose you grant your wishes for free. Oh, Manitou.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cI ask for nothing major, mortal, just a piece of your attention and some\u2026 minor, symbolic sacrifice.

The protagonist, played by some young starlet using unflattering makeup in a bid to be taken seriously, starts raving about how everything should be different. Her family thinks she's having a nervous breakdown and sends her to a mental institution. There's a pretentious monologue by one of the doctors, probably an Oscar winner hamming it up for an easy paycheck, about electroshock therapy and the old diagnosis of hysteria. Finally, she's introduced to her nurse, who turns out to be Dakota for no adequately explained reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNuts too that. Hospital food is terrible and her massive new body didn't exactly seem ready to sneak through any air vents. She'd just roll with this for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker's eyes broadcast increasing levels compassion towards Piper. Granted, not enough concern to stop snacking, but certainly more than she'd ever shown before. It would be one thing if her sister was suddenly obese and had plastered on a fake Stepford smile. Then she could think about pod people or androids or holograms. Being lost and confused while feeling love and affection was far more disorienting. She needed to get somewhere that she could think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay, real. That was just a joke sounded that better in my head.\" Piper put on a fake smile. \"Anyway, I should probably get dressed. I was thinking of heading out for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Piper. I'm still the funny one. You'll just have to settle for being the smart one\" said Parker, slowly turning her attention back to the television. \"I know you're meeting up with Zack and Dakota later. Dad told me to tell you to take the Mercedes. He's running some errands with Mom later and they're going to need the Lexus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, yeah, sure\" Piper stammered. Her parents were together and doing well financially. Combined with having a healthy drinking relationship, Piper was about ready to learn that they lived on the moon and the president was a smurf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, as Parker looked around, she realised that she shouldn't be surprised. Those pizza boxes stacked on the floor weren't the Black family's usual Little Caesar, but Ambrioli's, the local, pretentious gastro-pizzeria. In her old life, she's only ever been there once, where she lost fifteen dollars to learn that duck doesn't belong on a pizza. These boxes were a lot larger than the nine inch pizza her fifteen dollars had bought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Piper started getting up of the sofa, she realized that getting off the sofa was now something that she started, instead of simply doing. Some sort of muscle memory kicked in and she began rocking back and forth, slowly building up the momentum to leave the couch. Eventually, her center of mass passed beyond the edge of the sofa and her mammoth legs sitting into action before the weight of her belly pinned her to the floor. She also felt Parker's arm giving her am extra boost toward, as though standing unaided was a foreign concept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper lumbered toward her bedroom. She didn't actually know where her bedroom was, but her aching feet appeared to know the way. More muscle memory of this new life.</span></div></div>",

If anyone was going to go to college and better themselves, it was going to be her! Sure her life had got put on hold a bit there, what with her Mom being pregnant with Hunter and all, but the important thing was that she was finally going to start the next chapter of her life\u2014and that was a chapter that unfolded at Stuffington University.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was weird being so far away from home. Piper had lived her whole life in Daven's Port, crammed into that little house with two other women just as loud and obnoxious as she was. Coming this far inland made her feel uneasy. She'd never the ocean cresting in the background until it was two states over, with the rest of everything she left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Mom and her sisters had come to see her off, albeit begrudgingly. Hunter was being fussy, so her mom had to spend the whole time over making sure she didn't scream too loudly.

No one could rifle through her stuff, no annoying older sisters who liked to steal money out of her super-secret cash stash, no <i>younger</i> sisters to wake her up in the middle of the night. And no mom to bug her about keeping her room clean! <i>This place was gonna get wrecked the fuck up</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper threw herself down on the bed triumphantly, her arms sprawled out in her newly redecorated dorm room. She had her posters up, her clothes hung, and all her favorite little pieces of home had been artfully placed around her bedroom.

She had to carry all her luggage, heft it, and her own weight, up the stairs started unpacking and...well, that was a lot already. Plenty, in fact. Most girls would be in a bind at this point. Just moved in, nothing in the fridge, too worn out to go to the cafeteria, and too hungry to wait for delivery. But Melanie Carlyle wasn\u2019t most girls. She didn\u2019t get to be four hundred pounds without planning ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of why her luggage was so heavy was she stuck a 2 liter of Dr. Pepper and two sleeves of Pringles in there, just in case she needed it. Because of course she needed it. So she unpacked that first, left all of her clothes for later, and sat her fat ass down in a loveseat in the common area, which was meant for two, but had <i>juuuuuuust</i> enough space for Mel, and only Mel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was midway through a maneuver she called the \u2018Pringles chug\u2019 (tip the can backwards and eat your way through half of it without stopping) when her roommate walked in. Figuring that she was already caught acting like a pig, Mel just polished off the rest before tossing the can in the trash. It clattered off the side...then off the other one...then finally went in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d Mel pumped her pudgy fist in triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice.\u201d Her roommate said, appreciatively.

Working two jobs to support her struggling family had meant her girls often went unsupervised, and the two elder girls had certainly taken advantage of that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker and Piper had both been fairly wild in high school. Detentions, suspensions, cutting class, failing tests, and partying to all hours had been the norm, and Piper felt bad for how much stress she'd caused her Mom and Buby over the years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had seemed that Piper the Punk was destined for the life of the perpetual slacker, until she carried on the family tradition and got knocked up by some loser. Before such a thing could occur, though, two things had come along and changed her life forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was the birth of her younger sister, Hunter. Suddenly, there was a life that depended on her frequently, as Harper was still working terrible hours (the two woman agreeing that they should NEVER rely on Parker for this). Whether Piper meant to or not, she quickly became a reliable homemaker and caretaker for her newborn sibling. Her Buby even started teaching her how to cook, though it was admittedly an uphill battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, at least she could now boil a pot of rice without nearly burning the house down (again).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other was meeting a new to town girl from Texas by the name of Dakota Johnson. She was a beanpole, a nerd, and honestly kind of awkward. In the not too distant past, Piper would have been teasing the ever-loving sh*t out of a girl like her. For some reason, Piper instead started spending time with her, and the two quickly became the best of friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, to be fair, Piper still did tease her a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota's book smarts had proven to be a good match to Piper's street smarts, and as Miss Black realized that she needed to accomplish more in life then spotting off another pack of Natty Light, Dakota proved an invaluable resource to the struggling student. Piper managed to significantly improve her grades, and she could proudly claim to be the first member of her family to move on to post-secondary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper had done a two year program at the local Daven's Port college, attending and successfully graduating from their computer science program. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota, meanwhile, had gone to the Daven's Port Uni's College of Medicine, aiming to become a Registered Nurse. It was a four year program, plus a year of internship, so Miss Johnson was still in school and racking up an impressive amount of debt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Piper's oldest friend, Zack, he'd moved straight into the work force after high school. He'd had his start in construction, then apprenticed as a roofer. About eight months ago, he'd started his own company, and when Piper last spoke to him, was booked solid for the next several weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, the fact that his new career had led to some pretty impressive muscles brought a blush to Piper's face a fair bit more then she'd care to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her grad, though, Piper had struggled to find work. It may have been the information age, but unfortunately it seemed everyone else was also aware of that. She was typically one of several applicants, seldom got called for an interview, and never saw a second. Piper figured it was her lack of work experience that was hurting her, but it was awfully hard to gain any XP when no one was willing to give her a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the better part of six months, Piper was planted on the living room couch, occasionally firing off her resume to a potential employer, disappointed every time. Accomplishing nothing more then watching trashy daytime TV and eating mounds of junk food, Piper felt like she was wasting her life away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil last week, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Yeng Corporation was an international giant, and they were currently in the midst of a major expansion outside of their native Japan. Daven's Port had been home to a small R&amp;D house for years, but now the company was significantly expanding their local operations, and the once quiet port town was quite simply booming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeng had built a new office building downtown and had put out a notice for around 250-ish job openings. When Piper had applied, she never thought in her wildest dreams that they would call her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they did, she damn near dropped her milk shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne interview and an orientation later, and Miss Piper Black was now an employee of the Yeng Corporation. And now we come back to the present day, where Piper is beginning her journey to her new workplace...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** *** ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she left the house, her older sister's words echoed in her mind. <i>\"You won't last a day. Your blubbery gut will be back on that sofa by the end of the week.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogically, Piper knew that Parker was full of it. As she'd gotten her life together, her layabout sibling had become increasingly hostile, which for Parker was quite the accomplishment. Piper could only guess as to why, though it was clearly related to the fact that she was getting her life on track rather then Parker's \"Party Hard, Pay Never\" ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmotionally was a very different story, however. Piper had only held two jobs before, and was fired from both after about a week. She'd found it really funny as a teen, but now she kept wondering if something was indeed wrong with her. Was she unhireable? Could she hold down a job? Or was she destined to lose this one and couch surf until the day she died. Or maybe she'd get lucky and become a trophy wife for some rich man? Or was she too crude for that? God, would she have to do porn?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper shook her head to stop that wicked train of thought from running away with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked down their front stairs, a slight jiggling sensation brought her attention to the other major problem she had with her sister's pronouncement. Namely, that she was gaining weight again, and had been for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Piper had been fairly rotund in her youth. The family diet was less then stellar, and she'd always eaten far more then her share. The end result, as you might imagine, was the chubby little girl blossoming into a pretty fat kid. By the time she entered middle school, Piper was struggling to fit in the desks, and gym class was simply a joke. Had it not been for the sudden onset of puberty and a killer growth spurt, she likely would have continued to balloon. Instead, she became one of the true beauties of her school, and nearly every boy had fantasies about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that state of affairs was not to last. Really, she was hit across the board. The improving family finances meant that she longer had to do without, and could pig out whenever she wanted. Being more responsible with Dakota meant she was staying at home, whether studying or watching a movie, snacking as opposed to partying. She'd eaten all her woes away in college, and all her fears of unemployment and debt had been buried under bags of chips and slices of pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCombining all that food with a rather sedentary lifestyle had only one result; Piper had gained a lot of weight. From 120 pounds at her thinnest, the former rail had steadily ballooned over the last few years. When she'd last weighed herself, she'd been a hefty 236 pounds, though that had been back when she graduated in June. She tried not to think about how much she must have put on since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYanking down on her tight work blouse, Piper was really regretting not buying a new set of clothes before her first day. Still, she tried to put it out of her mind as she walked the half a block to the bus stop, ready for her first day of work.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>\"A bus stop right in front of the building? That's really convenient,\"</i> Piper thought as she stepped off her bus. She walked the few short yards and entered into the air conditioned lobby. A long information desk was directly in front of the glass doors, and Piper headed towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the desk sat a tall, leggy blonde. She was stick thin, and her bountiful curls were tied back into a loose pony tail. She smiled as Piper came towards her. \"Hello, and welcome to Yeng's Daven's Port office. Do you have an appointment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'm Piper Black. I'm starting today in the I.T. department.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Well, welcome aboard, then! I'm Stacy, by the way. Stacy Reynauld.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you,\" Piper said as she shook the enthusiastic woman's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same! I'll page Mr. Brownstone for you, and while we're waiting, start getting you set up.\" Stacey turned towards her computer, and quickly typed out a message. Checking her screen once more, she opened her desk drawer before continuing. \"Okay, so here's your name tag and security pass. The pass also doubles as your punch card, so when you swipe in or out with security, it clocks you in and out. You'll want to take the door on the right; our PR offices are on the left, so they're readily available for customers and what have you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnything else Stacy would have said was interrupted by the opening of the right hand door. An older man walked out. He was dressed in a quality black suit, with a red tie. His salt and pepper black hair was kept short, and a welcoming smile broke his clean shaven face. He extended a hand as he stepped forward. \"Miss Black, I presume? I'm Malcolm Brownstone, Director of Human Resources. If you'll follow me, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrownstone turned and walked ahead of Piper. Malcolm was built like a human scarecrow, and honestly looked like he might be able to bench press a solid 35 pounds, but he walked very quickly and Piper struggled to keep up. The two walked past the currently empty security desk, pausing only a moment to swipe their cards before continuing along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize if I seem like I'm rushing you, but given we're building this office up from scratch, there's about a hundred things to do, and the list just keeps on growing. Our new security personnel will be starting later this week, so don't get used to this desk being empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This,\" he said as the two entered a large, open area. \"Is our main floor. Most of the desks here are for data entry, a small call center, and the like. Each floor has a break room and bathroom, and the lunch room is on the third floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awful lot of vending machines,\" Piper said. She had thought she was muttering, but the way Malcolm responded, it was clear she wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, each and everyone stocked with our fine in-house products. This is probably a good point to discuss your Yeng credits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeng credits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Malcolm said as the two entered the elevator. He pressed the button for the 19th floor, and continued as the lift began to move upward. \"Each employee receives a weekly allotment of Yeng credits to spend at the vending machines, or to use in the lunchroom. They will accept cash as well, but given the credits are a free perk, it's usually a good idea to use them first. Everything for sale in the building is also offered to employees at a sizeable discount as well, so the credits will go quite far. As your tenure with the company increases, you'll start receiving additional credits as a bonus at regular intervals. The credits also don't expire, though you aren't allowed to transfer them between employees.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator dinged, and the doors slid open. Malcolm continued, \"The I.T. offices are here on the 19th floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking past a fistful of vending machines and a bathroom, he pointed to a door to the right. It was an impressively large opening, at least 48 inches wide, and with no obvious door knob or handle. \"And this is you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper was, in a rare moment, shocked to silence. She hadn't been expecting to be given her own office, but there was her name in an embossed brass plaque. As Malcolm pushed a large button beside the entryway, the door slid silently into the wall. The office behind was as large as the opening, with a large desk and the biggest office chair Piper had ever seen. A couple plants sat on a small table by the large windows, and she was rather surprised to see a pair of vending machines, one for soft drinks and one for food, standing in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I have an office?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older director smiled at the incredulity in the new hire's voice. \"That you do, Miss Black. We at Yeng have found through focused studies, as well as trial and error, that maintaining employee comfort maximizes both productivity and employee retention. Our benefits package is also second to none in the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" he said as he passed her a card, \"this is your current password. Please change that after the first time you log in. Today will be mostly training videos and the like, but you'll be thrown into the thick of it almost immediately, I'm afraid. We're still in the middle of networking the building, so there's no shortage of stuff to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate to run, but I'm expecting no fewer then 88 new hires arriving over the course of the day. I'll let you get to it, and we'll go from there. I hope you come to enjoy working for Yeng corporation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door slid closed behind the Director, Piper turned around and let out a breath she didn't know she was holding. <i>\"Holy crap. My own office. Holy crap.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper walked slowly around the large space, running her hands along the walls, as if disbelieving that was in fact hers. As she slowly lowered herself into the surprisingly comfy chair, she felt almost impishly small for the gargantuan seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Jesus, were they expecting only land whales to apply for these jobs? Really comfy, though. Wonder if I can get something a bit more my size?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Piper was logging into her computer, she looked at the vending machines in the corner. As the machine slowly came to life, she decided to test her company credits while she waited. Rolling the chair over as opposed to walking, she swiped her card and worked through the interactive touchscreen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Let's see what we have here. Oh wow, these prices are ridiculously low. Holy hell, I don't even think I can make a dent in this card. What do I want...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's grab one of those honey cakes. Those chips look good. Ooo, donuts! Nice! Oh, and some cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, how about the beverages... Jesus! Why is Yeng Cola half a credit, and water 24 credits!? Who priced that!? Well, grab a cola, then.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling back with her haul, Piper set her packages down on her desk. As she started the first of many tedious training videos, Miss Black took a big bite of her first honey cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wow, those are damn good.\"</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHuh, let's see. Anything else? No, that should be it.\u201d Piper leaned back in her sinfully comfortable chair. It took her well over two hours to wade through mounds of -virtual- paperwork that followed first training videos and since she at least tried to understand all that legalese, it made her feel groggy now. Groggy and maybe a little peckish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were several other videos queued up and a workplace safety quiz too but now she was drained. Perhaps another Yeng Cola could perk her up? When Piper recalled its invigorating effects from earlier, she rolled the chair over to the vending machine, swiped the card and punched it in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sipped the bubbly beverage, she couldn't stop looking at the long list of snacks. Piper knew she shouldn't, she'd already eaten plenty this morning but those mozzarella sticks looked really inviting\u2026 Engrossed in her thoughts, Piper was startled when she heard a knock on the door. Was it a manager, here to check her productivity? Would she be in trouble? She knew she had to make a good first impression. \u201cWho's there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, Rob Watford, may I come in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, of course.\u201d Piper quickly rolled away from the machine and bent down to hide the Yeng Cola behind her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young, portly man entered. The first things Piper noticed was an unkempt beard and plethora of dark hair. A ratty T-shirt with a weird logo stretched over his potbelly and his sartorial ensemble was crowned by tattered jeans. This was no manager. \u201cHi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. Are you\u2026 Ms. Black?\u201d His last words turned into a squeal when he noticed her chest rise behind the desk. He opened his mouth again, only to spray chip crumbs all around. \u201cOops, sorry,\u201d he chuckled sheepishly, his eyes still drawn to Piper's assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper sighed. How old was he, fifteen? \u201cYeah? What brings you here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, well, my office is next door and I found out that the canteen is already open so\u2026 Wanna go have lunch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlready? What time is it, eleven?\u201d Still, better go to lunch than stuff herself with junk food like her new acquaintance. Or like she was about to do but Piper pushed that thought away. \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d She pushed herself upright, the hydraulics in her chair hissing as she vacated it. Standing, she found was a little taller than the boy which made his eyes swivel back into her cleavage. She seriously thought about punching him. But<i> first day at work </i>popped up in her mind so instead she pointed at the door to make him look away. \u201cLead the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, I don't know the way either but the orientation video said it takes up most of the third floor.\u201d Rob pointed at the lift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer door clicked behind them, locking itself. Piper checked if she had her card on her. \u201cI haven't seen that video yet,\u201d she admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well, I haven't seen most of them but this one's<i> important!</i> You need to know where you're getting your grub!\u201d He emphasised his words by grabbing a bunch of chips and stuffing it into his mouth.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cBy the way, why are you eating chips when you're going to lunch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not? They're almost gone anyway. Oops, sorry. Want some too?\u201d he offered her the family bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper knew she shouldn't. The jiggle she felt at every step told her so. But the guy was friendly, if nerdishly awkward, and she didn't want to alienate him this early. \u201cSure, thanks.\u201d She took a handful and poured it into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper had been expecting something like a school cafeteria \u2013 she'd seen plenty of those in her life. And she wasn't that far off a target. Sure, this one was clean, spotless even, and at this hour almost empty too, but she spotted only two major differences. One, throughout the hall there were so many square pillars or columns or whatever, each table had one in its middle. And two\u2026 \u201cUh, Rob? Can you see where we're supposed to get our food?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right, there aren't any serving tables\u2026  Look! Over there!\u201d Piper followed his pointing hand to a skinny employee who was here even earlier than them. She was just taking her tray out of an opening in one of the columns. \u201cYou order at your table and they serve it to you through one of those shafts. Now that's what I call high-tech!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut how do you order?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, we'll find out at a table? Come on, let's go there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Piper noticed another difference from a school canteen. This place smelled <i>nice.</i> Their pace and beat quickened as they hurried to seize a table nearby. \u201cI wonder why they're so big. They could've easily put two chairs to each side, not just one.\u201d She was right, there was enough space for 8 or even 12 people at each square table but there was only one chair on each side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, perhaps the building's half empty since they're still hiring? Anyway, who cares. I want to know how I am supposed to order. I don't see\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do.\u201d Piper was happy that this time she was the attentive one. \u201cLook, there's a touchscreen under this wooden panel.\u201d It lit at her touch, offering her a complete menu. As her upbringing taught her, she looked at prices first and soon exclaimed: \u201c69 credits for salad?! Now that's absurd.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeated diagonally across the table, Rob chuckled. \u201cCome on. You weren't going to order a salad, were you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, no, Rob, but still\u2026\u201d She settled for lasagna and another Yeng Cola, nothing else. At mere 14,25 credits it was the cheapest meal on offer. Frankly, she was worried she might still be a tad hungry \u2013 but no, she'd had all those snacks before! This must be enough for her lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough the middle column chimed and opened and two trays rolled out. And she found out she needn't have worried. Her portion was an entire <i>pan </i>of lasagna! A small pan, to be sure, but she doubted she'd be able to eat it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were interrupted by an exclamation. \u201cLet's chew!\u201d and she saw her companion eagerly attack a huge steak. Piper followed his example. It was so tasty, delicious and greasy. Only once before she'd eaten homemade lasagna, made by Dakota's mother, and this was\u2026 this was even better. <i>Sorry, Dakota's Mom,</i> she thought as she shovelled the pan contents into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper ate like possessed, lost in a trance, not seeing nor hearing anything or anyone, not even Rob Watford. She was surprised when her fork picked up last scraps, she couldn't believe she'd already eaten it all. Her trance broken, she raised her head to look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lunch room was filling with people, it was over half full now, but there still wasn't much noise. She supposed most people were too busy eating like her new friend. He seemed to be struggling, pink in face and leaning back in his chair, but he still kept laboriously chewing a bite after bite of a huge cheesecake portion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts smell was so enticing, Piper realised when she noticed it. And given how much Rob was enjoying it\u2026 almost against her will she brought up the menu again.<i> Only 4 credits? I can easily afford that. It's my first day on the job, I can splurge a little. </i><br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n*** </div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n/and character limit strikes again/</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Piper wasn't one for post-lunch naps \u2013 she always made fun of Mum for that! \u2013 but after this lunch her brain simply switched off. It was a struggle to walk back to her office and then she simply collapsed into her chair. It didn't help that it was so big and comfy that it felt more like bed to her. She didn't want to sleep but as she launched another boring video, her eyes started closing on their own accord\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper awoke with a start. Had she slept through the afternoon? On her first day? They'd surely kick her out again! A quick glance at her phone and she sighed in relief. It was only 3:13 p.m. She woke up her computer, picked up the opened bottle of Yeng Cola and rushed to complete her daily tasks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, just as she was finishing the safety quiz, her inbox started flashing. Piper quickly guessed the last answer, pressed the last enter, glanced at her score (78% with 75 required to pass, nothing to write home about but at her present state it was the best she could hope for) and opened her work e-mail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Dear new employee of Yeng Corporation,</b> she read,<br>\r\n<b>the Director of Human Resources would like to address you at 16:30 sharp in the building lunch room. Please be punctual.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow many did the director say they were taking in today? Ninety? Piper knew this could easily be the dealbreaker. First impression were the most important. She quickly closed all the windows, logged herself out, cleaned out all the empty wrappers and rushed to the lifts, glad that her door was self-locking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got downstairs, there were already several dozen others milling about in the hallway. As far as she could see, Rob was not among them. Piper wondered what next when Mr. Brownstone's voice shouted from behind. \u201cWhat are you waiting for? It's open. For your convenience, the lunch room is open all day long. If you need a snack or a meal at uncommon times, you'll be welcome. Now find a seat and listen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile everybody was sitting down, he slowly walked to a speaker pedestal that wasn't there at lunch and started speaking about values and principles of the company they joined. He went on in the same rather vague vein for several minutes, mentioned their duties and eventually announced: \u201cAt Yeng we like productivity and initiative. And we reward them accordingly. To give you an idea, your first day at work has been carefully monitored. I am now transferring 500 Yeng credits,\u201d he brought up his tablet, \u201cto the accounts of the twelve of you who have already finished all entry procedures. You know who you are and now you know we appreciate you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper felt her cheeks colouring. Did she really finish it all? Wasn't there a video or two she missed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Mr. Brownstone spoke on: \u201cBut even those of you who didn't finish it yet need not despair. There were other minor rewards distributed for your achievements today. Almost everyone of you is a diligent enough worker to be eligible. If you like, you may now log into the lunch room terminals to see how much you got. Enjoy them but remember, from now on these bonuses will be much harder to get. So be ready to give it your best and you'll be noticed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing everyone else do it, Piper also logged and was welcomed by a scrolling text:<br>\r\n<b>Dear employee of Yeng Corporation, <br>\r\ntoday you have been awarded the following bonuses\u2026 </b><br>\r\nAnd there it was! +500 Yeng credits for completing first day assignments. But there was more: +50 credits for <b>sampling the Yeng merchandise</b>, +20 for <b>meeting your colleagues,</b> even 10 credits for <b>coming on time to the DHR address</b> and another 10 for <b>keeping the workplace tidy</b> \u2013 Piper congratulated herself for collecting all the waste before she left.

They don't want leftovers. That's it, have a pleasant evening, dear colleagues.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper hesitated. It was getting close to 5 and she should hurry home, if only to see whether Hunter needed food or drink or company or\u2026 or anything really. Plus it would feel nice to boast about her first day to her mother \u2013 and especially to her layabout sister before she went out to another booze fest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Hunter was growing up and should be able to take care of herself for another hour. Plus Piper just got almost 600 credits, more than another weekly allotment that she couldn't spend anywhere else but in the company. Given the prices she could be spending it a whole month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do?</span></div></div>",

Wearing a cozy, maroon-colored fall sweater that just barely failed to cover the swell of her considerable paunch, Piper tried to maneuver her bulk past the various clutter that a bathroom shared by three (four kinda!) women accumulates, and make it to the scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was an old, well worn thing, white at one point, now more of an off-white with rust eating at the edges, but it still worked. It was one of those old-fashioned kinds with a face like a clock, a big red needle, and numbers going around in a circle from 0 to 300.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Piper took a deep breath, sucked her gut in (she hoped it would help somehow) and stepped on the scale. She could feel the thing bending under her feet. Once she moved her mammaries out of the way to actually <i>see</i> the scale, her heart sank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The red needle was at the 300 point, and straining, wiggling with all it's might, to go past the limits, the breaking point of the scale. Piper decided to get off it before it really did break under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She looked in the mirror and rolled up her sweater, revealing a round gut that grew out of the swell of her hips in a single, smooth roll, with a little cleft at the bottom and a horizontal slit for a belly button. She reached one hand under it and gave it a contemplative jiggle. It felt heavy in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sometimes, Piper Black thought she was a fat kid trapped in a hot girl's body. She hadn't really done much to lose weight in high school. Her diet changed, but that was all her mothers doing. Puberty did the rest for her. So mentally, she never fully adjusted to being this hourglass shaped bombshell everyone else saw. Which might explain her recent 'growth spurt.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The fat kid trapped inside Piper Black had gotten out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was October 31st, the start of the holiday season. Between now and January 2nd, would be a non-stop obstacle course, as she'd be tempted with a barrage of fattening treats at every angle. She knew from previous experience that if she didn't prepare herself for a major diet, she would easily gain 30 to 50 pounds this time of year. And over 300 pounds, there was no way she could let that happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She sighed. She always knew her weight could slip if she wasn't careful, but how did it get this out of hand?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her thoughts were interrupted by someone pounding on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Just a freakin' minute! Gawd!\" Piper bellowed. She assumed it was Parker, being a bitch and trying to monopolize the bathroom. It was not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm taking Hunter out trick-or-treating, I need you to watch the door and give out candy!\" Her mother called out from beyond the door. Harper decided to ignore her daughters attitude today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Piper sighed. \"OK, I'll be right out!\" The barrage of temptations was already started. But she could do this! She was Piper Black, kick ass, take no-shit, street rat! Wasn't she? Looking back at the pile of pudge her reflection, she didn't see that person. She saw 'Porky Piper' looking back at her...she could still do this, right?</span></div></div>",

The sounds of a theremin provided the soundtrack as the first bit of chocolate passed by Piper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lips, and the adventure began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What passed for a plot in this movie slowly advanced as Piper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes began to glaze over. On screen, the doomed protagonists of Ghoul School watched in horror as rotting human hands reached hungrily for their faces through a barricade, despite a few attempts to ward them off with gunfire. <i>\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re mindless, and completely unstoppable!\u00e2\u0080\u009d</i>  As Piper watched the walking dead devour flesh, she mindlessly consumed chocolate for hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was only halfway through her pile of sweets, and two zombie flicks, when she started feeling sick from all the sugar. Her head buzzed, she felt tired, and her stomach felt queasy. But she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop. As she watched repeated image of unrelenting ghouls closing in on the protagonists, her hands snatched up snacks and reached toward the bottom of the bowl with the same unyielding force. As the hours past, the combination of sugar and trashy movies rotted her brain, first into semi-consciousness, then into a serious food coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When she woke up again, she felt fatter. Her upper arms felt pinched by the shirt she was wearing. She could feel a little extra weight in her cheeks, and everything seemed a little greyer. Her mother was standing over her, shaking her awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome on Piper, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to get up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There was something off about her. The rings around her eyes look a little darker. Her skin looked a little pallid today. Something about the whole situation put Piper on edge. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to eat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That seemed a little odd. Last she remembered, her mother was on her case about needing to lose weight and diet. She tried to grasp the meaning of her mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s change of motivation, but she found it hard to concentrate. Instead, her mother pulled her to her feet, and herded her like a cow into the kitchen, where an enormous feast of pancakes and absolutely drenched in butter and whipped cream. Piper didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t question it, she just sat down and started eating. After all, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all she seemed to do lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how long she had been eating when her skinny, skanky sister came over to tease her. She jabbed a finger into Piper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gut, sinking in up to the second knuckle \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know Piper, you keep eating like this and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re only going to get fatter...and softer...and more succulent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Piper tried to ignore her and just kept shoveling whipped cream into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tease the girl.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Her mother chided Parker. She came at Piper instead, armed with a measuring tape and calipers, gauging just how round her belly was, and just how fat her upper arms were, while Piper kept eating. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still too Skinny Piper. We really need you to eat more. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost Thanksgiving, and we need to get you ready.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0By now, Piper was becoming alarmed, but she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t link it to any concrete ideas. Her head was too slow and fuzzy. She laboriously stood up and announced \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think I should go.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She made her way ponderously towards the door, but her mother was faster. She easily made it there first, and locked it. And for some reason, there were chains across the door, and bars across the windows now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get up, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll only make yourself tired and stringy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah Piper, you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to lose this fatty hindquarter of yours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Her sister came up behind her and grabbed her ass flesh <b>hard.</b> It was enough to freeze her in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She looked around for help. There were other people in the house. Lots of them, her friends, her co-workers people from all over town. They surrounded her. They all stood perfectly still, shadows cast over their gray faces, staring at her with the same hungry, unblinking eyes. The last thing she saw was her mother with those same hungry eyes, sharpening a butcher knife as she closed in, and everyone set upon her for their gorey feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Piper would have sprung to her feet, but her weighty chest pinning her to the couch prevented her, so she just flailed and struggled helplessly until she got her bearings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cFucking finally, fatbutt. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to get up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It was her sister, Parker, who couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be counted on doing the smallest task these days without giving her shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt...is? What time is it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Piper mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dinner time. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ask me why, I told mom you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re better of skipping it, but she insisted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She said, walking away with a roll of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While Harper mushed up some of her sweet potato and played airplane with little baby Hunter, Piper pushed the vegetable around her plate. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that she was a picky eater. There had been times when a full plate with three different courses on it would have seemed like a feast in the Black household. But the last year of eating junk food had destroyed her pallet and left this all seeming...unsatisfying. But then her stomach growled, and she must have wolfed things down in a minute or two. The next thing Piper remembered, she was heading out the door, and checking out her wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One upshot to her diet was, at least she had some money from cutting back on eating out. That was nice. She could still have fun tonight, even if she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to go to a party. Especially with fifty bucks burning a hole in her wallet. At least she could get fucked up. She texted her dealer.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYo, you available tonight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah totally. U want something? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m hanging out at Burger Binge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ugh. Piper rolled her eyes. This diet was such shit. Why was she hanging out at Burger Binge, where she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be tempted?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Even worse, when she got there, she saw no sign of her dealer, Max, so she just had to awkwardly hang out by the entrance for like, 15 minutes, smelling the deep fryers until her knees started to hurt. Pot wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worth this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m at Burger Binge, where are you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m out back!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Okay...Piper headed around back and Max climbed out of the dumpster. Max was a tall, lanky girl a few years older than Piper. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099d hung out in high school, which made Piper feel cool, because she was a senior, and Piper was a freshman. Max was the one that showed her the ropes on cutting class and all other kinds of slacker activities. Right now, she was bearing two plastic garbage bags like they were prizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey Piper! Check it out!

She was proud of herself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey were just <i>throwing them away</i>. Why does anyone buy anything?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know...maybe no one wants to just eat stale hamburger buns for dinner, Max?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Piper said with a heavy shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009c<i>That's the beauty of it</i>. Burger Binge <i>also</i> gives you all the free ketchup packets you want!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Max reached into the pocket of her skinny jeans and pulled one out, causing a dozen more to spill out at her feet. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey give you everything you need for a free meal. How does this place stay in business? You want one? <i>It's my treat.</i>\u00e2\u0080\u009d Max said, with a smile as she squirted a ketchup packet on an old bun. It sputtered and sprayed a wet mess over the dry bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Piper was ready to refuse, when her stomach growled again. Things went...not black, but vague. It was like watching a clip show. She knew she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pass out, but everything seemed...distant. She leaned forward to bite into the ketchup burger, without using her hands but...she bit of more than she could chew. Bread, Ketchup and...a little bit of blood got into her mouth, restoring her senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She stumbled away horrified with herself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh shit, Max I am so sorry.

It really embodied the two things she loved: Tricks and Treats. When she was little, the treats were the best part. Every year, as her legs grew a little longer, Piper would push their journey through the residential sections of Daven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Port that much farther, even as her pudgy knees and feet would ache. Some of those trips got freakin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 epic. She would head out at 3 in the afternoon, as soon as she got home, and was unwilling to head home until after 10 o\u00e2\u20ac\u2122clock and people stopped answering the door. She also had an epic stomach ache when she tried to eat all when she got home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Despite her current predicament, Piper couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but look back on that story with a sense of pride and accomplishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But when adolescence rolled around, Piper found <i>new</i> delights to be had on Halloween nights. Toilet paper, silly string, cherry bombs, scaring little kids, scaring adults, and one time she made out with this goth chick in a cemetery at midnight. Good times all around. She didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even miss the sweets of childhood, enjoying the pleasures of adolescence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But now she was an adult, and found herself unable to enjoy either pleasure. She had to stick to this diet, so she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any of this candy, and she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly run from the cops anymore with this body, either. So...she was stuck inside, waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She checked the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a06:15. Waaaay to early to do anything with friends. She had heard about a party she wanted to hit up later. She was a <i>little</i> nervous going, because her Harley Quinn costume was totally slutty. Probably sluttier than she intended because it would be even smaller and tighter then she planned But whatever, she had huge tits so it was going to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her stomach gurgled. She texted Dakota to distract herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>6:17<br>\r\n</b><i>Heeeey, watup?<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<b>6:20<br>\r\nDAKOTA:</b> <i>Not much, you?<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<b>6:20</b><br>\r\n<i>Stuck sitting around handing out candies to kids, you?<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<b>6:25<br>\r\nDAKOTA:</b><i> Got my mom to do that.

She had actually <i>never</i> had her hair done professionally before.

Even at her thinnest, Dakota had been thinner. That was back when Dakota first arrived, before she got her job and tried community college at the same time. Her job at the Yeng shipping center meant that she had spending money for the first time in her life. It also meant that she had to be up at three AM to work, then sometimes do two shifts, before taking night classes. It was hell on her body. She wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t getting enough sleep, she was snacking all the time to replenish energy and what meals she did have were usually on the go. And whenever she got a day off...she relaxed a little. Maybe a little too much. Whatever it was, frequently trips to Dee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Donuts, Nitoli\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pizza and a slew of other local eateries that were a little out of her price range before had piled on at least 150 pounds onto Piper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s frame in a little under 2 years...and in the same time, Dakota put on 10, 15...<i>maybe</i> 20.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper was just a little jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>6:38</b><i><br>\r\nTragic.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a brief time in the life of Piper Black where she was thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll throughout her childhood, Piper had been fat. Growing up poor with a mother eager to band-aid her divorce with copious amounts of cookies, takeout, and quick fixes had never done her any favors. Not only had a lifetime of comfort food left her as the fattest kid in her class, it wasn\u2019t long before she was the fattest kid in her school! By the time she had gotten to middle school, Piper Black was big enough around that she had trouble fitting into desks, and an even harder time getting them to not creak underneath her. Her mother, Harper, had seen the warning signs\u2014she\u2019d put her baby girl on a strict diet, made sure to cook at home more often, and then she let nature do the rest. By the time Piper\u2019s metabolism kicked in, she had shed a good eighty pounds and kept the remainder in all the right places. By the time she entered high school, Piper was a busty, broad-hipped bombshell with dark hair and killer taste in the punk scene. Her active lifestyle of scampering around Daven\u2019s Port on adventures and the shrinking budget of a broken home life meant that Piper simply couldn\u2019t <i>afford</i> to be fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all that changed when the baby came. Little Hunter was an expensive ball of love and black curly hair, and that meant that everyone had to buckle down. Harper went back to work, and so did the rest of the Black women. Her older sister got a job on her feet, but Piper lucked out and scored a neat job where all she needed was good service and she could work right from home. With everyone in the house working again, that meant that there was plenty of portions to go around. The cubbards were filled with snacks again, the freezer stocked with ice cream, and takeout was no longer a once-in-a-while option\u2014in fact, she could afford to have it every day of the week!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for old habits to resurface. The fat girl that had been sealed away within Piper by the twin gates of poverty and diet was unleashed with a reckless fury, making up for lost time as she scarfed her way through the many moons that she was kept at bay...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it say, what\u2019s it say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding on her own two feet for so long was like agony for Piper Black now. As she was, almost six hundred pounds, hefting herself from the living room down the hall and into the bathroom, stepping onto the scale and standing there while it calibrated had really knocked the wind out of her. All without a snack to tide her over too\u2014that was the hardest part of this diet. She\u2019d gone so long getting to eat whatever she wanted, whenever she wanted, that the thought of going even a few minutes without something to drop into her hollow leg was lip-bitingly frustrating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me bend over, god.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper winced as she felt her older sister\u2019s hand push into the bottom of her stomach, propping it up like an avalanche of pizza dough. It hung all the way down to her knees and stuck out far enough that they\u2019d had to push the scale back so that her stomach didn\u2019t get caught on the towel rack. Her fat toes ached, her legs screamed. What she wouldn\u2019t give to just be able to <i>sit</i> on a scale for this\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Parker!\u201d Piper whined, \u201cJust read me the goddamn numbers already!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt <i>says</i> five hundred and ninety seven pounds.\u201d Parker grunted as she rose to a standing position<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut judging by all these extra inches, I\u2019m guessing your fat ass just broke it.\u201d Parker palmed a portion of Piper\u2019s prodigious paunch and shook it up and down, up and down, forcing her entire volume to jiggle and quake like a flabby earthquake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck off, Parker!\u201d Piper groaned, \u201cI knew I shouldn\u2019t have asked you to help me with <i>anything</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper began to slow, laborious process of storming out. She was so big now that she had to make sure to take her time, turn sideways, and step gently out the door so that she didn\u2019t get stuck. That was the last thing that she needed right about now\u2014getting stuck halfway in the bathroom with her bitchy older sister. That would be a riot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow had it gotten this far? How had she gotten <i>so</i> fat, <i>so</i> fast? It wasn\u2019t like she was trying to bulk up, it just sort\u2019ve\u2026 happened! But then again, all the extra food that they could afford now that everyone was working. The trips to the bakery and Big Burger, plus the fact that she didn\u2019t really have to <i>leave</i> anymore unless she wanted to go hang out with friends\u2026 yeah, that probably had something to do with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to be almost 600 pounds at just twenty years old? Piper was gonna have to start cutting back if she wanted to stay <i>mobile</i>! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that laying around the house couldn\u2019t be fun, just\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d only lost three pounds after a <i>week</i> of dieting. And she was <i>starving!</i> There had to be an easier way, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe if she got out and cleared her head\u2026</span></div></div>",

Despite her incredible increase in size the past few years, Piper had maintained a small but dependable social circle of native Daven\u2019s Porters that were more than willing to put up with all things Piper\u2014even as those things got increasingly doughier and flabbier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing out at Piper\u2019s size was always a hassle. She almost never had any clothes that fit her, and muumuus were stupid. They made her look like someone\u2019s fat old bubby (actually, it made her look like <i>her own</i> fat old bubby!), and Piper wasn\u2019t about to go out on the town looking like a walking whale of a grandma. Ordering clothes online was always so risky, especially when it became hard to count the X\u2019s on the labels. She might have had more money than normal, but even Piper couldn\u2019t afford to waste precious funds on clothes that were too small for her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wound up showing a lot more skin than she intended, but that couldn\u2019t really be helped given her choice of clothing. She\u2019d insisted on wearing the same style, just in bigger sizes. So her jeans may have been practically elastic at this point, but even they had trouble keeping up with Piper\u2019s rolling folds of dough as she waddled out the front door that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was enormous\u2014a beached whale if there ever were one. Her stomach rolled out hard and far in front of her, obscuring her every motion beneath a big bronze curtain of corpulence. Her chest alone was enough to practically blind her, but the belly that brewed below them had long outpaced her growing girls. It swung low, tucked into the stretchy denim as far as it could handle, and still showing by a couple of inches as it weighed the fabric down. Her awkward heaving steps were met with her knees bouncing against her gut like a great big airbag\u2014walking was more of a chore than ever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pillowy arms swung side to side as she waddled to the bus stop. Even given her newfound creed of retaining her mobility, Piper had a hard time not turning around and plopping down on her couch. It was a hot day and she was clearly in no shape to be walking all the way to the bus stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod\u2026\u201d Piper whined, fanning her fat face with a chubby hand, \u201cI need friends with cars\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo! They were doing exactly what she had told them to do\u2014<i>get her out of the house.</i> And another movie night or gaming session was only going to add even more inches (god, maybe even <i>feet</i> at this rate) to her own circumference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going to have to deal with it and waddle her way to the pier by herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least the bus stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Piper had unwedged herself from the bus doors, she was exhausted. It seemed that even the twenty minute ride from town to the pier couldn\u2019t let her catch her second wind. It seemed like just about the time she managed to stop wheezing on the poor guy next to her, she had to hoist herself up to a standing position and waddle on out the doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod she wanted to go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPiper!\u201d came a voice further down the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Sam!\u201d Piper waved one of her wobbly arms weakly, \u201cHey Jay, hey Madi!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree of Piper\u2019s closest friends were the ones who were the most adamant about getting her out and about. She had blown up so fast over the years that they still looked twice whenever they saw her\u2014but at the same time, they never overtly judged her about her weight. Sam worked at a movie theatre down town, Jay worked as a barista and a bassist for some band, and Madi worked at D\u2019s Donuts, so they were always willing to coax Piper out with a good time, even as she got heavier and heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she waddled onto the creaking wood of the old pier, her friend\u2019s forms came into better view\u2026</span></div></div>",

They all knew Sam, at least vaguely as the proprietor of the local movie theater, but things really started to congeal last year, when Sam met Jay at Daven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Port Community College. Sam was taking some courses on film studies, and Jay was taking some on music theory. Sam played guitar, and Jay played base.  They tried to make a band work, but Jay was more 21 Pilots, and Sam was more Joan Jett.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Around this time, Piper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long term friend Zack hooked up with a girl named Alice. They had a habit of making her feel like a third wheel. It also shot down Madi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempts to hook up with him. Madi however, discovered Jay was a \u00e2\u0080\u0098passionate soul\u00e2\u0080\u0099 with \u00e2\u0080\u0098artistic vision\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and \u00e2\u0080\u0098dreamy eyes\u00e2\u0080\u0099.

She was on a diet, but she still hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t eaten. And she hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t eaten at all since Dinner which..for Piper was, maybe a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSecond, I want something to eat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Piper said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI figured that out, yeah.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sam chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Visiting the fair offered Piper a rare treat.

So Piper and Sam each had a spicy sausage. And a drink. And...that was it. That was absolutely where Piper stopped, even though she could put away a dozen, easily, and had funnel cake after. Ooooh, funnel cake. She had to distract herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou mentioned something about a giant stuffed animal?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sam smiled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI sure did.

Sam had a pair impressive even to a Black girl, and the way she fluffed her giant 80s hair-do wants the jacket was off. How much hair spray did it take to do that? Piper was staring.

As much as she would have preferred to stay in today, it did feel nice to be in good company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Piper!\" Sam sauntered over, one hand raised in a wave and ready for a high-five. \"Glad you came!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad I did,\" Piper laughed weakly, still winded from the trip. She met Sam's raised palm with her own, the action causing her arm to quiver and a sea of ripples to travel past her limb and to all over her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What up, P?\" Jay drawled, raising a casual fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jay,\" Piper returned the fist-bump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that was Sam and Jay. That only left...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piper!\" Madi cheered, her footsteps making the old wooden planks creak alarmingly as she all but jiggled over, her giant belly hitting Piper's globular paunch first before she threw her arms around the other girl in as much an embrace as she could manage. \"Good to see you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You too...\" Piper said, returning the embrace as best as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pier floor groaned beneath them, and for a second Piper was sure it was going to collapse right under them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy shouldn't it? Both Madi and her were the resident fatties of the group, both weighing in the same range, with Piper still the heavier one of the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hadn't always been like this. Granted, Madi had always been on the chubby side, even back when Piper was still thin. Then she began to frequent D's Donuts &amp; Malts, where Madi worked. The two quickly struck up a tight friendship, bound by a mutual love of the high-calorie sweets, and the fact they found the time to emotionally support one another. Piper would order an entire box of donuts when feeling down or just very hungry, and Madi was happy to be her \"big eater bestie\". Madi would need a friend when distraught from either a relationship fallout with an ex-boyfriend, or work being particularly stressful, and Piper was ever a loyal, present friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they just liked to eat out a lot, their combined appetites making most of their hangout plans one of the many eateries around town. It was no wonder they'd both gotten so big. Yet Piper couldn't help but feel responsible for Madi's ballooning waistline. She used to be just chubby, plump even. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Madi's belly had grown from a noticeable, yet cute with its tininess, pot to a multi-rolled gut that was pushing mightily against her sweatshirt and hanging out of her sweatpants, leaving a big pale slab of blubber exposed. Her arms and legs looked like they had been inflated with lard, completely puffy and saggy with fat fingers and toes on chubby hands and feet. Her thighs were quite big, her behind looking to be about the second biggest part of her, everything else, chest included, paling in the face of her dominating belly. Even her face, once simply round, was now coated with fat cheeks and extra chins, her neck nearly covered by that layer of facial flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now, Piper wasn't sure what to feel. It was a bit comforting not being the only landwhale in the group, a truth that left her feeling guilty. She felt even more guilty Madi may have gotten this fat because of her. She would never want to wish the discomfort of enormity on anyone. The struggle of just getting up and stay standing under her own power, the exhaustion from even the simplest walks, the need to find bigger clothes after outgrowing them, the seemingly endless hunger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Pipes?\" Madi said, fat face creasing in concern. \"Are you...okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, yeah, sorry, just...spaced out. Tired, is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadi smiled sympathetically, giving Piper's meaty shoulder a tender pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, we're here, so let's get this party started!\" Sam announced, clapping her hands to get everyone's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Max?\" Jay asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about her?\" Sam rolled her eyes. \"Not our fault she can't manage time. So, what are our options?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carnival just opened up,\" Jay held out an arm to indicate the other side of the pier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great, but...\" Madi made a face and brought her hands down to rest on her belly. \"I don't really want to walk around much. It's too hot out, today...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what would you suggest, then?\" Jay asked, reaching into his pocket for his pack of cigarettes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we go for a bite? Y'know, sit down, air-conditioned building, eat and talk...\" she shot a meaningful look at the bassist, whom didn't notice at all, much to her disappointment. \"Like Nitoli's. Anyone up for pizza?\" she finished dully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam merely rolled her eyes and turned to Piper. \"What do you say, P?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper blinked, thinking over the options, and deciding to add her own. \"Uhh...movie at your theater?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! Movie!\" Madi squealed, jiggling where she stood as she clapped her hands together. \"I'm down for that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I've seen the listings, and they're all crap,\" Jay retorted, lighting his cancer stick after a few flicks of the lighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judging by what the reviewers say instead of seeing it for yourself?\" Sam snarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, excuse me for wanting to save us from wasting time and money,\" Jay shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, we can still have a good time laughing at a bad movie,\" Piper offered, shifting slightly on her feet. They were getting sore, and no matter what they agreed on, she just wanted a place to sit. Madi did, too, judging by the look on her face and how she was similarly subtly shifting her feet ever so slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your call, girl,\" Sam smiled, reaching over and patting Piper on her fluffy backside. \"What do you want us to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper took a moment to think it over, finally deciding on...</span></div></div>",

Sam was cool, she ran the local Movie Theater. Big Hair, big tits, big ass. Ina lot of ways she looked like Piper except 200 pounds lighter, 20 years older in her fashion, and a few inches taller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cHey Piper.

Max was Piper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pot dealer, and was dating Sam. Max had this cool shaved head and green side-hawk look going. Like Sam, she was a full 6 feet tall, making them a really imposing couple. And also like Sam, Piper was cresting north of 300 pounds, or more with her height, and almost all of it landed in this big saggy gut that hung out of her tank top. She was so belly heavy, she looked awkward with like, no butt and still a gangly set of arms and legs. Sam and Max weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t <i>always</i> so fat. In fact, when she met her, Max wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just skinny she was ultra-skinny. The kind of skinny Piper never even got close to on her best day. She was like 110 pounds. No tits, no ass, you could see all her ribs, and you could get your hand around her calves easily. And then, sometime after she started dating Sam, Max started getting fat. Really fat. But then, who of her friends here tonight wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Madi worked at a donut shop and it showed. She was even fatter then Sam and Max, and just kind of was this...cherubic ball of fat, with really round cheeks, a round belly, just...a round happy little blob. And her date Jay was looking even bigger. He was the only one that came close to Piper. Not nearly as fat, but he was entering into the \u00e2\u0080\u0098obviously too fat phase\u00e2\u0080\u0099 where he was out of breath constantly, needed to sit a lot, and couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be accommodated by most seating. Piper was actually relieved to have some companionship in these regards, even if she was a little worried about him. It didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop Madi from feeding him every chance she got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A sinking realization hit Piper. This was a double date, and she was the single friend.</span></div></div>",

As one may have guessed by even a casual glance, none of the bloated beach locals were quite the active type. Doing anything or going anywhere too strenuous on their big round bodies was a no-go, and that thankfully limited their opportunities to make Piper feel like even more of a loser than she already did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Un</i>fortunately for Piper, however, their activities for the evening weren't exactly along the same train of thought that she'd hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScoring her sweet job with Yeng, getting to eat whatever she wanted all the time without any hassle, combined with her overbearing and coddling mother had crippled Piper's willpower to the point of almost nonexistance. It was one of the main reasons she was <i>so</i> big. Even in a sea of fatties, the only one who came close to her size was Jay--and he had a nearly professional feeder in Madi. Piper wanted to be skinny again, but she didn't want it more than she wanted to say no to things like pizza, donuts, funnel cakes and corndogs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Pipey, you know you want to try some.\" Max said in her low voice, literally waving a footlong hot dog in her friend's face, \"C'mon, like, open up or whatever...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper's big brown eyes widened in wonder as the meat log lingered over her open mouth. She knew the vendor just by the smell. It was from Mr. Papadonikos' stall on the corner of Daniel Morgan. She knew it just by the Greek spices and herbs he put on it, which wafted through the chili and onions. Piper's plump lips moistened as her tongue lolled out. Her thoughts grew dizzy as she took a clumsy step forward, her entire body quivering with her one awkward movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too slow! Ha!\" Max grinned as she took a honking bite of the thing, her chubby cheeks smeared with orangey-brown chili, \"You gotta be quicker than that, Piper!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had been the absolute <i>least</i> thing that Piper needed right about now. She had left the house with the confidence that she was going to finally get off her (increasingly enormous) ass and lose some weight. That she was going to get herself back on track and finally weigh something <i>normal</i>. What she wouldn't have given to weigh even, like, Max's size. Dumb hotdog eating bitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it had been an orgy of food. Like, street vendor food. From all walks of Daven's Port. How her fatass friends got the energy to scour the piers and broadways, or the funds required to get <i>this much</i> food for a party like this was beyond her. She tried not to think about it too much, as she fought back the familiar smell of grease and calories that hung heavily in the air of Jay's apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDating Madi had not done well for his boyish figure. The slim hipster had practically ballooned in size, gaining more than four hundred pounds over the course of the past few years. His great mass sat on the couch, beached like a whale, as Madi happily halved donuts by the dozen with him. They were so cute, so squishy and soft. Like a big puddle of a couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unlike Jay, Piper had no one but herself to blame. What's worse, she knew it. She knew that she had no self control. And being around all this food was making her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwas making her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Piper.\" Sam purred into her ear. She'd leaned up against the couch, her big belly rolling over the armrest and her big round butt stuck up in the air, \"You can always diet tomorrow, can'tcha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge Yankee, her hips as big as her hair, fluttered a donut underneath Piper's desperate, scouring nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know you want to~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Piper gulped, her fat face flush, \"I...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Piper's job was not a difficult one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike many of the Daven's Port youth would in the coming years, Piper got a job at the Yeng Corporation fresh out of high school. This was back when it hadn't quite taken hold of the community as it would eventually go on to, and it was still trying to find its foothold in the States. Piper was one of the first wave of employees to be hired on in the (then) new Research &amp; Development department, and had been nestled comfortably in her position there ever since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeng was something like an umbrella corporation. It provided technological goods primarily, but in its success overseas it had branched out into things like apparel, home and office supplies, and eventually wound up starting its own line of designer foods and food products. As a member of the R&amp;D team, Piper often joked that she was a lab rat, but it wasn't that far off of a comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt an entry level position, Yeng paid Piper twelve dollars an hour at forty hours a week to sit on her butt and test various products before they hit the larger consumer market. Her input, among many others in the department, would determine whether or not these products were \"ready\" to hit the market. She was given access to all kinds of cool tech to play with, got to listen to music all day, and was given her own private testing area after six months of quality performance. It was any lazy girl's dream job, and even before she started blowing back up again, Piper wasn't exactly one to work particularly hard for her money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only \"problem\" (as in, it had only become a problem once Piper realized that she couldn't stop herself from porking out) was that it was all the snacks that she could eat. Even back when she was rocking a tiny waist, Piper could knock back some snacks without realizing it. It was the fat girl inside of her, banging on her ribs to get out. In fact, snacking on the job was <i>encouraged</i>, practically a requirement even when she was testing things like armchair durability and stereo quality. After two years of her willpower eroding away with free snacks and tempting discounts on all the high-tech Yeng products, plenty of opportunities for pay raises leaving her with little reasons to <i>want</i> to go anywhere else, Piper had become the model Yeng employee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least that was what her supervisor, Dr. Helen Schwartz, seemed to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little blue-haired woman had been watching her favorite employee expand for years, her pet project going from skinny to plump to porky and beyond was her end-all be-all for her workplace. She had been given many opportunities to thrive in a place like Yeng, where her sadistic streak and eye for consumer behavior and psychology were put to good use. But to her, she served her purpose well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy be trapped in a Corporate Office, stuffed in a desk somewhere, where she could have a more <i>hands-on</i> approach right here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading the R&amp;D department meant that, not only could she \"improve\" some of the various products that they provided, but also that she could make her own improvements to the staff...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Piper Black had been a personal favorite of hers since the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look tired, <i>liebchen</i>.\" Dr. Schwartz clicked her tongue in a worried way, \"Are you not sleeping enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper, heifer that she was, was still tired from her trek. The handicap spot in the Yeng parking lot seemed to get further and further away with every pound that Piper gained, so of course she looked a mess. Her black hair was frizzy, pulled into two pigtails that rested on her meaty shoulders and on either side of her colossal chest. An ocean of olive skin heaved up and down, up and down, as her calamitous mams rose and fell like fleshy empires. Her face was red and blotchy, her plump lips parted as she wheezed away on her itty-bitty boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... not really...\" Piper puffed, wiping the sweat from her brow as she lumbered towards her station, ready to begin her long day of Research &amp; Development...</span></div></div>",

She had better things to do with her talents. Like amusing herself by picking Piper Black\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Piper had told her she needed to talk to, and had grown so enormous that she needed help just rolling her bulk onto Dr. Schwartz's heavily reinforced couch. She had made sure that the thing was tested for up to a thousand pounds, but she still wasn't sure of it in this situation. She sat down at her desk and prepared for the session while Piper regained her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So,\" Schwartz crosses legs, and checks her notes. \"Piper.\" She leans forward with a predatory grin. \"How was your weekend?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, you know...did my weekly weigh in. Went out with some friends...had some fun.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Piper said, sounding morose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don't seem to happy about that...\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Schwartz noted. Piper just took a deep breath in and exhaled long and slow through her nose. \"And your diet?\" Helen continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Piper's response was barely audible grumbling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What was that?\" Helen continued to pry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm so fat, jesus, why!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Piper yelled at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Helen smiled. Delicious response this morning. She reached into her filing cabinet and drew a big, fat manila folder. Almost the entirety of it's contents were dedicated to that question. It was one of Helen's proudest scientific achievements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe've already talked about that a good deal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helen dropped the folder on her desk with a flat 'thud' and licked her finger before <i>slowly</i> flipping through the files, letting the agonizing length of the documentation sink into Piper's brain. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat brings it up like this now\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI just...\u00e2\u0080\u009d Piper was out of breath just from yelling. Just  from feeling the emotions she felt. Her breaths were slow and wet sounding. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOK, I tried going on a diet this last week...\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cMm-hmmm.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Schwartz took down notes again. She wasn't surprised or concerned. She had a very detailed list of Ms. Black's 'diet' attempt, and none of them got very far. She liked that her pet still struggled though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd...I only lost three pounds after a week of dieting and so...I thought I'd go out with some friends to cheer myself up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She closed her eyes and balled her fists for a moment before proceeding. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly my friends aren't interested in dieting so I...I probably gained it all back already.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She tried to sulk down into her bulk, and hide away from the world, causing here four chins to bunch all up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009c<i>Piper</i>...we've been through this before. Three pounds in a week is excellent. In a year that's 156 pounds. That's about as fast as you can expect to lose weight in a healthy manner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhatever I just...It was really hard dieting for this week. And what's the point of working hard if you have nothing to show for it? Where's my reward in all of this?!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She tossed her hands up at the ceiling in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009c...That's a good question, Piper.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helen agreed, closing the file shut dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cHuh?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Piper struggled to turn and face Helen, forgetting that it was impossible both because of the way the sofa was set up, and because the hundreds of pounds of blubber that kept her trapped on the couch like a beached sea mammal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere <i>is</i> your reward in all this?

Dr. Schwartz made a mental note to have the true capacity of her furniture tested. But it really helped drive home the fact that Piper Black was almost six hundred pounds of woman. She had no right being <i>so</i> heavy, or being <i>so</i> big that her supervisor had to make mental notes regarding the stability of the literally steel-reinforced couch beneath her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a total blob, and a day didn't go by that Piper didn't feel every pound that her immense expanse commanded. Even sitting down, now, her movement was restricted. She couldn't make direct eye contact with the tiny German woman sitting behind the desk; her face was too fat and her chins too thick. Her shoulders were too meaty, and her breath too short. But she couldn't <i>turn</i> to face her because of the great amount of energy that such a feat would require. Her gut parted her legs out to either side of her, meaning that she had to kick one of them out at an angle just to keep herself stable. Even reclined and relaxed, Piper's hot wet breathing sounded labored\u2014Piper was miserably overweight, and she wanted desperately to do something about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus the dieting. Well, thus the <i>attempt</i> at dieting. Attempt<i>s</i>, as her file folder showed. Piper had always been big, but she'd never been this big before. No one in her family had. Heck, most people in the history of the world had never gotten as big and as fat as Piper Black. She was a cow, a whale, all of the mean things that they used to call her back in elementary school times like a zillion. And she felt trapped in her own blobby body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, though she could have never known it, the smile that spread across Dr. Schwartz's face was a silent reassurance that those days would soon be long behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ach\u2014you are never going to believe this.\" she said, gesturing emptily to some far-off corner of some far-off room, \"But I think, if you give me just a little bit of time, I may have an answer to your predicament.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another three days of comfort binging before Piper would learn just what it was that Dr. Schwartz had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was how it worked with Piper. One day of discomfort could set her back weeks, months, or evidently years of dieting. Her dismay at failing  to lose more than three pounds of denying herself anything and everything her greedy guts required had lead her to practically emptying out her house. The rounded tummies of the other Black women weren't pleased in the slightest, but stood no chance at making Piper feel any worse than she already did, several thousand calories into noon by lunchtime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn all days for her life to change, it was on a Thursday. Nothing particularly special, except for the fact that this marked the fourth day in a row that Piper had come into work feeling like the biggest, fattest piece of shit in Daven's Port. Sam and Max and Madi and Jay had all done their part in trying to make her feel better, but the only way that those fatties knew how to cheer anyone up was with food, and lots of it. Something that Piper was already <i>well</i> accustomed with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, she was already biting into her second muffin of the day when Dr. Schwartz found her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, it's Piper!\" she said in her thick accent, \"Just the associate that I was looking for\u2014come, come with me <i>fraulein</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the tiny woman grabbed Piper by the thick, padded hand and lead her down the hall and into her office...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, Dr. Schwartz had spent a long time thinking about Piper's predicament. And she had come up with a solution to all (or rather, most) of Piper's problems. Albeit, not in the way that any <i>sane</i> woman would have thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Schwartz was going to solve Piper's problem...</span></div></div>",

Her great gut bouncing against her humongous thighs, weighed down by the combined force of her titanic teats. For so long, Piper had rightfully felt that she was this immovable, uncoaxable blob. It used to take so much effort to get her going at even a snail\u2019s pace\u2014she was just lucky that most of her friends were total lardasses like her, or they would have surely left her behind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, with Dr. Schwartz\u2019s help (and, she supposed, Dr. McCarthy\u2019s too, but she didn\u2019t really like to attribute her success to her!) Piper felt light as a feather!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKey word being \u201cfelt\u201d, of course. While her muscles received a boost, the chemicals in her body had been tinkered with, and her internal organs had received what was basically an industrial-grade booster shot, Piper\u2019s girthiness hadn\u2019t actually diminished. She still weighed just slightly north of 600 pounds. The only difference was that she no longer felt the limitations that such an inhumanly large weight had set upon her shoulders. And her back. And her hips. Or her ankles, her stomach\u2026 Piper felt <i>great</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as anyone who knew Piper well enough would tell you, whenever Piper felt <i>great</i>, Piper <i>ate</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever Parker had said to her in hopes of bringing her down, Piper hadn\u2019t heard. She had been far too engrossed in her breakfast. The greedy noises of her own eating had long been the means of which Piper used to tune out the nasal jabs of her older sister. The hot, wet breathing that played as a backdrop to her spastic chewing, the chorus of gurgling that came from her gut made up of equal parts \u201cdigestion\u201d and \u201cmore please\u201d; it was all very encompassing. But admittedly, it had been a little harder to pay her mind on this particular morning than it had been any other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Piper did catch was her mother\u2019s swollen sweaterpuppies wobbling beneath her t-shirt as she elbowed her eldest daughter with one fluffy arm. Harper Black had been Piper\u2019s biggest defender in recent years, a fact that didn\u2019t look keen to change just because of a little shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t pay her any attention, Piper.\u201d Harper smiled, \u201cShe was just joking\u2014<i>we\u2019re all very happy for you.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker pouted. Piper beamed behind chubby cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m happy too, Ma.\u201d Piper\u2019s voice was husky and heavy, her mind dancing with all the possibilities that lay ahead of her on her first day of \u201cfield testing\u201d her new capabilities, \u201cPass me some more pancakes, wouldja? I\u2019m about to head out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo soon?\u201d Harper glanced at her phone, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to\u2026 digest first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper slapped her gut happily, the great olive ocean of expansion bobbling as it hung towards the kitchen floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNuh-huh, not today!\u201d she said, chest swelling with pride, \u201cM\u2019gonna go out and have some fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe instinctively braced herself against the back of her chair.

Her mother took a half-step forward as well, having grown well-used to caring for both her youngest daughter <i>and</i> her biggest one.

Despite her still enormous size, Piper felt like herself again. That was what was really bringing her down. She needed to be her, and do her own things, and now she could do that again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And with that out of the way, Piper forgot all about dieting, and went and got herself a bikini. She didn't buy it, just like she didn't buy any of her clothes. Technically, they were all 'loans' from the Yeng Corporation, as she helped them develop a new line of (extremely) plus sized clothes. She helped let them know helpful things like when they made jeans that were painfully restrictive when sitting, or so loose that they were in danger of falling off when she stood. She let them know her taste and fashions, so they could know what a girl her size actually wanted to wear. It was no small irony that for the first time in her life, Piper didn't lack for bras that fit her well and supported her. It was thanks to their helpful tailors that she knew she was, as of her most recent gains, an absurd 82W cup size. Sometimes she was a little proud of that. Dr. Schwartz told her she could be a Guinness Record holder if she bothered. And now, walking around Daven's Port, not feeling any pain in her knees or back for the first time in ages...that didn't sound like such a bad idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She wore her new swimsuit under her clothes, and got changed in bathroom stall, behind the concession stand. Oh god, getting dressed was so much easier now! I mean, still difficult in the confined space. At one point, when she was getting her jeans off, her ass bumped backwards into the sink. Her ass took up so much space, not only horizontally, out behind her, but vertically, top to bottom, that the top half of her butt cheeks began 'pouring' over the lip of the sink and filling it, weighing it down. Piper felt the sink giving way under the tremendous force she could carelessly exert, and jumped, literally jumped away to keep it from breaking off the wall, causing her whole body to shake wildly, especially those world-class titties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But Piper didn't care about that. Piper didn't even care if she broke the sink and they made her pay for it. Piper <i>jumped</i>. This was so awesome! She turned, and checked herself over in the mirror, adjusting the cups of the black bikini top to make sure they were properly positioned and even. But catching herself in the mirror...she didn't look bad. Sure, she was as big as a whale, but now that her shoulders were no longer slumped, her eyes weren't baggy from how badly she slept, now that she could stick out her chest and wiggle her hips again...she didn't look bad. She made kissy faces at the mirror and headed outside.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When was the last time she took a selfie? Piper stashed her clothes in a hiding spot in the bathroom she'd been using since middle school, and headed out into the sunlight. She was all smiles and confidence,  even as people slowed down to stop and stare at her from the moment she stepped out wearing almost nothing and letting it all hang out. <i>Nothing</i> could ruin this day for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She took her phone off of the cups of her bikini. One of the plus sides to her size, she could hide so much in there. She then went off to the end of the pier, aligned herself so the morning sun was at her back, wiped her bangs out of her face, leaned back smiled and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Even her selfies looked super fat. She'd stopped taking them a few hundred pounds ago. At first, it was because she was confident she'd lose the weight soon, but over the last few months it was because she'd finally despaired of ever being skinny again, and basically thought she'd never wanted to be photographed ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So her face was a bit of a shock to her. No facebook angle could work on her. She had big apple cheeks pushing up against her eyes, leading to one, two three, four chins the lowest of which wrapped around and connected with a neck roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But you know what? It was a damn good selfie. The wind was in her hair just right. Her smile looked honest and not awkward. The sun was perfectly positioned and shining off her dark eyes, and the waves looked beautiful beneath her. So she posted it on Instagram and Facebook without any reservations. She even tagged Dr. Schwartz in the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She flagged down a nearby guy eating a hotdog and watching the waves.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, Buddy. Do you mind taking some pictures for me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Noticing Piper for the first time, he dropped his hot dog and stood there with his mouth hanging open, in total shock of this nearly naked walking pile of blubber talking to him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUm...uh, yeah sure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He managed to mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Piper handed him the camera, and leaned back against the railing to pose for him. The railing groaned, and pier-goers looked on with horror as they were sure Piper would snap it off and kill herself, but Piper wasn't worried at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cUm, here you go.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said, handing the phone back to Piper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Piper looked it over. Both arms against the railing, her hips were turned in a gentle contrapposto, causing her belly to curve and favor the right side more. It hung down nearly to her knee, and with her left leg up like that, her fatty thigh supported the weight of her giant gut, and the even heavier weight of her breasts pushing down on top of that. Her breasts were only given shape by the confines of her swimsuit. Wherever she showed some skin, they burst out in every direction. She had side boob for miles. Her top forced them up and together, to create a lot of cleavage, but gravity still did it's part to make her breasts wide and broad. Turning her hips like that also showed off just how big her butt was. She had an ass shelf easily three feet deep. While her butt was certainly wide, and riddled with cellulite, it had retained a sort of shapeliness, where the weight mostly pushed straight back in a giant bubble butt. Looking at the picture, she unconsciously shifted her weight from one leg to the other, and felt her butt cheeks bounce, one at a time. She captioned it '#BeachBod' and posted this one too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOkay, just real quick, one last thing. Can you take like, 5 seconds of video for me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOkay I guess...\u00e2\u0080\u009d He grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cGreat. Super. You're really sweet for doing this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Piper took a dozen steps back and planted her feet. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you ready?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cReady for what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you filming?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Piper rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah, you're on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Piper smiled, pumped her arms in the air causing her huge arm rolls to jiggle in the summer sun and yelled \u00e2\u0080\u009cCANNON BALL!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She ran forward across the pier, each footfall causing the whole structure to shake and then she mustered all her strength and speed and...jumped right over a four foot high railing. She could be heard screaming \u00e2\u0080\u009cWahoo!\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the way down. She hit the water so hard that the spray of water actually reached the top of the pier twenty feet up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In the water, Piper rolled over onto her back and let her blubbery buoyancy carry her comfortably. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBest. Day. Ever.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She sighed with contentment.</span></div></div>",

Sometimes she found it amazing that Yeng actually paid her to do this job. Then she remembered that they should be grateful to have her doing it. She meticulously backed up every photo, video and comment, just in case Piper decided to delete any of them later. She also took scrupulous notes on likes, dislikes, views, comments...she understood the metrics of Piper\u2019s social media presence better than Piper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe looks happy.\u201d Came a voice from behind her. Helen jumped in her seat, expecting to see Fukada judging her for how a genius spent her time. Instead, it was Dr. McCarthy, looming over her like a gangly scarecrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re skulking again.\u201d Helen said, crossing her arms under her well padded chest and sunk into her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m skulking. I\u2019m a skulker. It\u2019s what I do.\u201d She teased. Helen enjoyed McCarthy\u2019s presence, she really did. She was the only mind she respected at this company.

I never discouraged her from exercising.\u201d Helen said firmly, refusing to face McCarthy and focusing on her computer screen instead. She minimized the window including Piper, and brought up some spreadsheets where she was tracking data of eye movement in response to a new Yeng Cola ad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, I had her well trained, then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there a point to this visit, Evie?\u201d Helen asked, gripping her mouse so tightly, her knuckles were turning white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoint?

Come forward with their work on cracking the human genome? Admitting to years of secret study, based around multiple subjects whom could only be classified as \u201chyper-obese\u201d? Dr. McCarthy might have been considered something of an odd duck, even in the pond full of odd ducks at the Yeng R&amp;D labs, but even she was wary of coming forth with their findings so soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be joking.\u201d She rasped, lowering her voice instinctively, secretively, \u201cHelen, we can\u2019t just <i>come forward</i> with something like that because your personal pet project has\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>I believe</i>.\u201d Dr. Schwartz stated firmly over the protests of her colleague, \u201cI believe that Dr. Hinamizawa will be happy with what we\u2019ve gotten so far.

She was so caught up in her negativity and opposition that she lost all meaning in what Helen was offering her. The chance to work together on a project, just like old times. It was their cooperation that had brought Piper to be where she was today, after all, give or take some outside influences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen and Evie delighted in fattening up test subjects. Personality alteration, delight in suffering. Oh it was so rich. So delicious to the both of them. Though they both preferred different aspects of their little experiments, neither could deny the joy with which they tackled new projects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as soon as Evie McCarthy caught wind of her colleague\u2019s meaning, a slow grinch-like smile began to crawl onto her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Helen you tease me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAch, I would never do such a thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou <i>really</i> want this, don\u2019t you?\u201d Dr. McCarthy sauntered closer, putting a hand on her hip seductively, \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to work on one of <i>my</i> projects for a change.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Helen sniffed, \u201cI am just speaking of\u2026 ach\u2026 <i>reciprosity</i>.

Anyone\u2019s brain, even one as big as Fukuda Hinamizawa\u2019s was putty in her hands if she set her mind to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy Evie had taken such a shine to this woman, Helen would never understand. So officious and prim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you believe.\u201d Dr. Hinamizawa said with a polite suckle on one of Helen\u2019s hard candies, \u201cThat going forward with this will bring profits then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI firmly believe this, yes.\u201d Helen said conclusively, \u201cPiper Black\u2014subject X2\u2014has ingested a steady diet of Yeng additives since her employment here began. Despite her propensity for weight gain, as per your specifications, and her metabolism further slowed by substance Y4A, the injection seems to have negated not only the negative aspects of our own testing, but also the regular ailmments of such extreme obesity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukuda furrowed her brow slightly, swallowing the hard candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have an anti-obesity drug, then.\u201d The Director said with some degree of awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAch. Not quite.\u201d Dr. Schwartz clicked her tongue, \u201cIt is not an <i>anti-obesity drug</i> so much as it is\u2026 an anti <i>ailments of obesity</i> drug. We can negate heart problems, bolster muscular structure, reinforce internal organs\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slight Asian woman paused before a big, money-grubbing grin washed upon her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe that I will have to speak with our board of directors, Dr. Schwartz.\u201d She said, bracing herself to rise, \u201cBut, suffice it to say, I believe that we can go forward with this as soon as all the necessary precautions have been taken.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWunderbar.\u201d Helen clapped her hands together, \u201cNow, herr doctor, shall we celebrate? Perhaps you are hungry, yes? Such a momentous occasion calls for celebration!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ouch!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She winced, rubbing her hamlike arm. Dr. McCarthy had just yanked out the needle from her arm after taking her last tube of blood for the day. She smiled at Piper, with a toxic insincere sweetness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSorry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Piper rolled her eyes, trying not to let McCarthy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behavior rattle her today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cRight. Aside from the frustration with the testing procedures, how has your mood been? Socializing?

You guys did great. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m feeling great. This stuff is like magic. They better have given you a raise for this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, actually.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Both Schwartz and McCarthy grumbled in stereo. Helen chuckled, remembering why they were best friends. This whole process with Piper really was straining that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, that sucks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Piper nodded. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo uh...I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m getting another dose this week, right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helen said, encouraging and soothing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhich means...\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009c--One more needle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d McCarthy interrupted, this time sticking Piper in the shoulder. Or at least the huge roll of flesh where her shoulder should be. Feeling confident enough to wear a tank top into work today, Piper had given McCarthy easy access to her bare flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOw! <i>Goddamnit</i>. I think you enjoy that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Piper whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course.\u00e2\u0080\u009d McCarthy teased. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my job. And we all do what we love here at Yeng, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Piper just gritted her teeth. She could tell by Dr. Schartz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s look of anger and frustration that she sympathized with her, and wanted McCarthy to just cut it out already. Still, Piper had put up with worse teasing from her big sister. She had a thick skin. She knew not to give her what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know what, Dr. McCarthy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Piper hopped off the examining table, landing with so much force that the whole room shook. Evie had to brace herself against her table, and scramble to keep some of her samples falling on to the floor. Even Schwartz seemed frightened. Piper crossed her meaty arms over what might have been the fattest chest ever, and leaned a little closer to her tormentor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI weigh 600 pounds, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m probably in better shape than you now. Yeah, I like my job.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She turned and smiled at Helen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAm I free to go, doc?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot without your lolipop, for being such a good sport.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helen said, holding out the treat for her. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099d already unwrapped it. Piper grinned. Sometimes she thought about objecting to the doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little ritual at the end of these tests. She wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a kid anymore. But hey! Free lolipop. She popped it in her mouth and headed back to work, squeezing sideways through the doorway with ease and closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell. She sure shut you up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helen teased, while Evie worked to regain her composure. Evie just glared at Helen. \u00e2\u0080\u009c...should we tell her?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo. That could produce a placebo effect and taint the study. You should know that, Helen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cRight. Right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helen grumbled, crossing her own arms in thought, and crashing down in a chair now that she could relax. She knitted her brow in thought. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hard for a mind like hers to work out this latest medical mystery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you <i>sure</i> the latest doses haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been changed in anyway from the initial dose?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are you implying?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Evie asked, defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing! Nothing. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just...trying to figure out what could be happening. Do we have any idea how long it will be before the effects wear off?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Evie said flatly before taking a deep breath. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHelen, this is <i>experimental</i> research. This is the nature of the work. I tried to tell you, you were presenting the findings to Dr. Hinamizawa too quickly. Piper is our very first human test subject. She could be developing a tolerance for it. It could be something in her family history. It could be any of the <i>other</i> drugs we subjected her to. I need thousands more samples to give you firm answers and...I think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re too close to this one. Emotionally.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Helen just looked at the floor for a bit, distraught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009c...Maybe I can start increasing her dosage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d McCarthy relented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you Evie.

And would she have cared? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in a long time, Piper Black felt like herself again. She was going out, seeing her friends, and having more than a quarter ton of fun. Even if she had known the machinations behind the recent cure for what ailed her, would Piper have really cared? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was young, she had plenty of free time, and she had been completely freed from the responsibilities of her diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat girl wouldn\u2019t want that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI gotta tell ya, Pipey.\u201d Sam said as she burped into the back of her hand, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten into ya, but I <i>like</i> it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe immense Italian leaned back into her seat, hands resting on either side of her distended mass of middle. She was no stranger to snacking\u2014it came with the territory as a manager of a movie theatre, and was a given with her social circle. But lately things had been taken up a notch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but P, slow down.\u201d Jay mewled as his pale freckled gut gurgled in protest, \u201cSome of us don\u2019t have your magic Yeng juice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadi leaned in and rubbed her boyfriend\u2019s belly, playing with the ginger wisps of fur that ran up the curvature of his gut. She pressed her bodily heavily against his, seeking to ease his aching tummy. As she herself was no lightweight, the impact of their blobby bodies caused Jay much discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, like\u2026 whatever\u2026\u201d Max panted stupidly, \u201cI could like\u2026 go for another dozen\u2026 pizza\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe belly-heavy blonde could <i>not</i> have gone for another dozen. In fact, she was sure that if she had even one more bite, she would rip down the middle and spill her guts all over the table. But she didn\u2019t like the way that Sam (her girlfriend <i>and</i> the biggest rack on the block not named Black) kept giving Piper the once-over. If Sam wanted to see someone stuff themselves\u2014by god, Max was the girl to do it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, if you guys say so.\u201d Piper agreed readily with the blustering blonde, leaning her girth onto the table towards the SERVICE button, \u201cI was gonna say we head out of here and get some ice cream at the pier buuuut I wouldn\u2019t mind another order of breadsticks or something~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper\u2019s ham like arm brushed against the surface of the table, her oceanous tits tilting it slightly as more of her olive-colored flesh weighed it down to one side. Her eyes shimmered greedily, her lips moist and ready for more. She hadn\u2019t gotten to really pig out in what felt like so long\u2014her friends were so great, not being all judgemental about this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo orders.\u201d Max belched<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh baby stop. You look like you\u2019re gonna puke.\u201d Sam said with a sympathetic pat on Max\u2019s fleshy back, \u201cYou don\u2019t gotta impress me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, with garlic butter.\u201d Piper licked her lips, \u201cGreat idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the waitress toddled over to the party-sized table filled with guests worth three or more in size, Piper prattled off their most recent addition to an already massive tab. She ordered her breadsticks, Max\u2019s breadsticks, the garlic butter, marinara sauce, and just a half order of chocolate chip cookie pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the road, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright everybody, dig in!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spreads at the Black household had gotten more and more extravagant lately. It helped that they had money coming in from three ways now. Everyone was employed at some level now, which meant that there was a little extra cash to flash here and then. Since Piper\u2019s wardrobe was being taken care of entirely by Yeng, that left all the more money for the once impoverished family to focus on the simpler things in life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike grocery shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t have to tell me twice.\u201d Piper wiggled her plump fingers as she eyed the latest in a long line of meals that evening, \u201cI\u2019m <i>starving</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomehow I find that hard to believe\u2014\u201c Parker felt a sudden swat at her arm, \u201c\u2014OW! MOM!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPiper, don\u2019t hit your sister.\u201d Harper helped herself to a heaping helping of four-cheese macaroni, \u201cParker, don\u2019t be such a buzzkill.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since the injections began, Piper had been eating a lot. Comparatively a lot. Like, for her, she had been eating a lot. Not just at work or out with her friends, but also at home. Harper was still on a very maternal kick (for once) after Hunter was born, and Piper was just one more mouth to feed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hungry, hungry mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, pass the garlic bread.\u201d Piper held out a pillowy arm, reeling it in with three pieces of toaster-oven faux-talian appetizer, \u201cMm; thanks Ma. Where\u2019s the butter\u2014Parker, pass the butter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker curled a nostril and passed her little sister an entire stick of butter. One that wouldn't last the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Piper answered huskily, \u201cHey\u2014you know what would go great with this? Chocolate chip cookies. Do we have any of those left?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping Piper fed was a chore before. But ever since she started getting those injections, it was becoming increasingly difficult to keep her sated. Now that she didn\u2019t have to worry about her health, Piper was free to do what she wanted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt just so happened that what Piper wanted to do most of all was <i>eat</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as time passed...</span></div></div>",

Or at least me and Max.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sam said between heavy breaths as she struggled to reach her chair in her tiny, cramped office in the back of the Movie theater.

She distracted herself from the question by looking around the office. It was cramped, and loaded down with Sam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taste for kitsch. Movie posters lined the walls, little action figures and maquettes lined the shelves and all available space, and it had grown increasingly messy with old and forgotten paperwork since Sam discovered she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lean forward anymore without her heavy breasts heaving her to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, <i>you</i> look athletic.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Piper didn\u2019t know shit about what Sam was saying\u2014getting fat on purpose? That was just crazy. Piper had suffered (most of) her whole life for her weight, and had finally found a way to make something of herself <i>because</i> of it, not in spite of it. And with no drawbacks to boot! But if it weren\u2019t for these Yeng boosters, she\u2019d still be putting in every stop at trying to slim down\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the knowledge of what it was like to weigh two hundred pounds <i>less</i> than her (give or take\u2014she\u2019d been indulging recently!) and what a struggle <i>that</i> had been\u2026 Piper was obligated to help her friend out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether Sam (and Max too! Who knew?!) were getting fat on purpose, or if they just so happened to be unrepentant gluttons like Piper, no one should have to suffer if they didn\u2019t have to\u2026 right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of the largest lesbians in town had ever worked for the ever-expanding, shady-as-hell Yeng Corporation. Sam ran her independent movie theatre and Max had been between jobs ever since anyone could remember, so they had been given no predilection for the eerily sterile environment that they had found themselves in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper had been working for Yeng for years and no longer found herself uneased by the stark whiteness of the labs, but the two scruffier subjects bristled at the serene cleanliness of it all. Where some may have been awed\u2014maybe even amazed\u2014these two found it incredibly suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike them Oompa Loompas at the chocolate factory.\u201d Sam curled her nose as she watched a pleasantly plump lab tech totter down the hallway, \u201cNot a stain on \u2018er.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need whoever cleans this place.\u201d Max observed more plainly as she scratched the lip of her outermost belly fold, \u201cThink they could keep up with us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith me maybe\u2014but not your fat ass.\u201d Sam tittered, her teeming titties toddling in her tight top<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m the cute one, you\u2019re the neat one.\u201d The belly-heavy blonde pressed her sausage digits into her fluffy flanks, \u201cAnd after this, you\u2019re gonna be the fat one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah? You think so?\u201d Sam raised an eyebrow, \u201c\u2019Cuz after this, I\u2019m gonna be movin\u2019 around a lot more. Cleanin\u2019 up after you most likely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m gonna bring you down to my level.\u201d Max purred, \u201cMake you big and sloppy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I wanted to live in a pigsty, we wouldn\u2019t be getting these shots.\u201d Sam turned to face her girlfriend, her mass of her bronzed Italian <i>pancia</i> settling like jello in a dish across her acres of lap fat, \u201cI wanna be able to move around, y\u2019know. Not like you, ya slob.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not a slob.\u201d Max sniffed, \u201cI\u2019m mobility impaired.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah? Because of that big ol\u2019 gut ya got there?\u201d Sam ran a porky hand of plump pointers across her girlfriend\u2019s fleshy white waistline, \u201cY\u2019think the doctor\u2019s gonna like it when ya break her scale, huh porky?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHrff\u2026\u201d Max purred stupidly, \u201cYou think I\u2019m getting that big?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re enormous.\u201d Sam said with an adoring little wrinkle of her prominent nose, \u201cMy big blonde butterball.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax made a familiar, guttural sound as her instincts began to kick in. Sam was getting her all hot and bothered. If only they didn\u2019t have to go to this stupid doctor. If only they could have just stayed home, and ordered in. If only they could have stayed in their beds\u2014two queen sized mattresses pushed together\u2014and done a little experimentation of their own\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m inclined to agree.\u201d Came a sudden intrusive voice, \u201cYour partner has done a fine job of telling you what I\u2014and you, presumably\u2014already know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam and Max snapped to attention, caught in the act of PDA, as a slender black woman click-clacked her way into the waiting room. She was a different kind of big. Dr. McCarthy was tall, and wiry. A totally different manner of mammal to the fat, bloated beauties in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou.\u201d She pointed at the one with the hair, \u201cDr. Schwartz will see you in her office.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. McCarthy loved this part so much. She knew co-dependency when she saw it. The Italian one, not so much. She was stubborn and loud, totally opinionated. Just Dr. Schwartz\u2019s type. She ate up big, brassy shikshas like this and begged for more, if her treatment of one Piper Black was any indication. Evie would gladly take the more confident of the two, and that left the blonde girl quivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLook at her; four hundred pounds and you would have thought she was a leaf in the wind. Maxine\u2014\u201cMax\u201d, as she\u2019d deciphered from her patient\u2019s horrible handwriting\u2014was clearly the least stable of the two. The prospect of being separated from her enabler, from presumably her partner and lover, left her preemptively crushed. A fine start to Evie\u2019s preferred method of drinking in the torment of her special projects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis one would do just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou.\u201d She pointed a long brown finger at the poor, unsuspecting zeppelin, \u201cYou\u2019re with me\u2026 \u201cbutterball.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf her neck hadn\u2019t been buried underneath chins of fat, Evie was sure she would have seen Maxine gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be so much fun.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Piper was a special case. Max was..Max. An \u00e2\u0080\u0098uninteresting layabout\u00e2\u0080\u0099 as Helen described her. Evie would have described her as \u00e2\u0080\u0098delicious\u00e2\u0080\u0099. The girl stored weight almost exclusively in her abdominal region, which meant plenty of wonderful subcutaneous fat in and around her organs, filling them with fatty acid. Just the thought was enough to make her shiver. It was a pity she would be working to mitigate that danger to her, liver at least temporarily. Maybe it would be more fun to give her a bit of hope, before taking it away. Or maybe she could find some complication, some genetic abnormality that would allow her to reject Irene Maxwell as unsuitable. To tell her right to her face that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never, ever be healthy again. Evie bit her lip. She hoped she would cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But those were hopes for later. Now she had Max in her office, alone and vulnerable without her girlfriend or Helen to protect her.

She really liked it. For the first few hundred pounds, she was still a skinny beanpole, just a skinny beanpole with a giant gut on her. But lately, finally, her face, arms and legs were getting fat too. Really fat, and she loved it. \u00e2\u0080\u009c<i>I</i> could have told you you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d need your biggest one for that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, well\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Evie took a moment to straighten her glasses and fix her composure. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get very many patients of your size.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She lied.

She held her arms aloft, but she was going nowhere. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLittle help?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Evie crossed her arms under her chest as she watched the pathetic display. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it on your own?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy girlfriend usually helps me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you do when she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not around?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Why would I get up if nobody else made me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Max asked, like it was a stupid question. Evie relented and gave her a hand, the delicate doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emaciated muscles struggling to lift the tremendous weight involved.When they got her up finally, she seemed more tired and covered in sweat then the belly heavy blimp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d She panted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you could...step onto the scale for me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She kept it right in the middle of her open floor space, so no extraneous bits of lard would make it hard to get onto. Which was good thinking, because if she had put it up against a wall, Max would have to turn around to try and get on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cCan you help me with that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Max asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Evie asked, a sadistic smile spreading across her lips. She knew exactly what the trouble was. With that belly--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see shit with my gut in the way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Max said, jiggling it for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Evie just stared at her new patient, wide-eyed. Who was this girl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cRight, just, follow my lead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She said, putting her hands on Max\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulders. They maneuvered her bulk onto the scale and it read out loud in an automated voice. \u00e2\u0080\u009c557 pounds.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWere you <i>aware</i> you weighed that much, Ms. Maxwell?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Evie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Max shrugged. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean, I weighed more this morning, but I guess that was right after breakfast.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Her stomach gurgled with anticipation at the mention of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cReally, because I find that kind of surprising\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d She was almost as fat as Piper! Without any work done on her. She didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look it though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, that! It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cuz I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so tall. Nobody ever believes me when I say how fat I am.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Max said, slapping the top of her gut, happily. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLike you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009c...Come again?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re like the same height.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Max leveled off her hand against her head and then moved it back and forth towards the doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo if you ever got fat as me, no one would believe just how much you really weigh, either.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Evie worked very hard to suppress that mental image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo...Ms. Maxwell, do you have any other physical activities you struggle with in your day to day life?\u00e2\u0080\u009d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really do physical activities.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She said, collapsing back onto the examination table so hard the room shook. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI guess using m \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0y vibrator became kind of a struggle. So I stopped doing that and just let Sam handle it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Evie was losing her patience, and fortunately, she was done with her stupid questionaire. On to the evaluation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If you don't start losing weight right away, Ms. Maxwell, you're going to have your first heart attack sometime soon!\" She spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Neat!\" Max smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"...You think that's 'neat?' \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah.

Even after her partnership with Yeng made an exploration of her specialization (special<i>ty</i> was more like it) more feasible, Dr. McCarthy had never encountered a specimen quite like the big blonde blowhard like the one squashing her counter right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisgusting is what she was. Laden with fat, absolutely covered in the stuff. For as big as she was, Evie had no doubt that every one of those inches was nothing but wobbling, useless lard. There couldn\u2019t have been any muscle in those quivering bingo wings or underneath those pillowy thighs\u2014Ms. Maxwell certainly wasn\u2019t hiding a set of chiseled abs underneath all that fat around her belly. She was so very large, and\u2026 and <i>round</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Evie sniffed, \u201cWell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod this was hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF-Fortunately for you, Ms. Maxwell,\u201d Dr. McCarthy attempted to brave through her diagnosis without losing her composure, \u201cDespite your best efforts in making yourself as grossly unhealthy as possible, my work at the Yeng Corporation may save you yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the plan.\u201d Max answered nonchalantly, \u201cI mean, I\u2019d hate to kick the bucket before I broke quadruple digits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Dr. McCarthy been drinking anything, she would have spat it out. Instead, she sort\u2019ve made this hoarse noise of disbelief. A weird and uncanny wheeze that she didn\u2019t actually make, so much as it escaped her. It would have been a sight to see for anyone who knew the good doctor to watch this imposingly tall woman completely fumble over the prospect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you just say what I thought you said?\u201d Dr. McCarthy\u2019s spindly fingers spread out on the desk in front of her as she leaned into her long dark arms, \u201cYou intend on getting even fatter, then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing gets past you, Doc.\u201d Max snorted, \u201cYou think I could slow this down if I wanted to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere the billowing blonde placed her hands on either side of her gut, hefting it forward as if to prove her point. A sheen of sweat had begun to coat her\u2014even sitting for this long at the office was beginning to tucker this poor whale out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo my understanding is that you want to weigh\u2026\u201d Dr. McCarthy gulped, \u201cAt least a thousand pounds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a start.\u201d Max said in the most blas\u00e9 way that a woman her size could manage, \u201cI figure with the way you\u2019ve got Piper blowing up, I could easily put on another two, three hundred pounds in no time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. McCarthy\u2019s legs crossed beneath her desk. Just the idea that someone could be so nonchalant about the prospect of putting on the weight of two or three \u201cnormally sized\u201d people (whatever that meant anymore) was arousing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally it took a fair bit of discomfort and displeasure, even torture to get her all hot and bothered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Irene Maxwell seemed to get the job done well enough\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you think I\u2019m a good candidate, Doc?\u201d Max put her hands on her hips proudly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I think you\u2019re <i>perfect</i> for what we have in mind for you.\u201d Dr. McCarthy smiled that delicious, evil smile that she so loved to intimidate her patients with, \u201cNow, we\u2019ll have to do some bloodwork, but I think you\u2019ve got a lot to look forward to in the coming weeks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We both do\u2026</i> McCarthy licked her lips\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They met Piper there for lunch, and no one was prepared for what happened next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For thirty minutes straight, none of them said a word to each other. Three close friends, all with a lot to talk about, all with only one thing on their minds: food. Their social outings usually involved eating to excess, but not like this. Usually the pace of dining was set more by their obese lethargy than their extreme gluttony. They would lazily pick at chicken wings, pause to catch their breath after a trip to the buffet table, ask someone to hand them something they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel like sitting up for and thereby invite conversation, as well as letting their weak stomach muscles a chance to catch up under the strain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now, there was none of that. The only sound at the table was the clanking of dishes and silverwear, and the occasional slurping at their drinks and the creek of their chairs as they went back for more. They ate with frantic, mechanical efficiency. One, two, three, four, five bites to clear a plate and then a one tempo break as the grabbed the next one, then one two three for five. They didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so much eat as just shoveled everything in with their forks, relying on plenty of rice and strong jaws to deal with getting it all down before the next forkfull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After thirty minutes of this, Piper was stuffed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOoooooh, that hit the spot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She moaned as she unzipped her jeans to give her stomach just a little more room to breath. It was still kind of new to her. Before McCarthy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s treatment, she would struggle to reach past her bloated mass for more food, and could stand up maybe twice in a half an hour period and that would be a serious work out. She wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t starving, but rather then stuffed she just ended up bloated, and groggy and miserable. Now she just felt satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou guys ready to talk?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nope. Piper just had to sit there and watch as her two best friends were still going at it strong, forcing down food as quickly as possible after a half an hour of solid eating, smiles plastered on their faces while they did it. They had boundless enthusiasm for seeing how far they could push the achievement of Dr. McCarthy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weight loss serum in the wrong direction. And so Piper sat. She drummed her fingers. She texted Zack and Dakota. She even started eyeing up the buffet and thinking maybe she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d get a bit more, like she was having her second wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlright. Fine!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sam finally said, putting her fork down firmly, and whiping her chins with the back of her hand. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI promised you you could ask me anything you wanted if you got us the shot, and goddamn if you and those weird doctors delivered. So here you go..\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sam used her hands to signal \u00e2\u0080\u0098come at me\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to Piper. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEverything you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Piper grinned.

She wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t paying any attention, busy trying to scarf down as much low mein as she could. She heard her name though and perked up. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHuh?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She mumbled with her mouth full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe wants to know if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to get fat on purpose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sam clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was a slurp as Max sucked down her noodles before answering. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, fuck yeah!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She slammed down her noodle bowl and went back to eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it all that surprising?

She let out a table rattling belch that drew stares from the patrons who had so far managed to ignore the three hippos gorging at the table. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our fetish. *urp* We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re total perverts. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got like a terrabyte of fat porn on my computer.

Then she spent the whole date trying to get me to eat 20 dollars worth of crappy fake pizza, like an asshole.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Between the three of them, Piper Sam and Max weighed in at around 1400 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCumulatively, of course. But a girl could dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their new Yeng boosters, it was entirely possible that the sky was the limit for their gains now. Sam and Max had been intentionally making one another as fat as possible for some time now, and Piper had been far too greedy and trusting of her superiors at the Yeng R&amp;D plant to do anything <i>but</i> get fat. The three of them were enormous, incorrigible, and fresh off of the high that they'd all learned had come with an intense, fervent stuffing session between friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the other two, Piper had never really had any desire to get fat. In fact, she had been really down about herself for a long time. But becoming the fattest, most mobile hunk of blubber on the Pier had really changed things for her. She'd been able to walk around without any trouble, stuff herself until she felt like she'd eaten her weight in cheap beach trash food, and she'd gained a ridiculous following online for... well, she wasn't quite sure what a lot of her followers were there for. But one of the many, many things that she <i>hadn't</i> done since she'd gotten her shots was get laid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Sam and Max would eventually fix that for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper was the heaviest woman there at a door-cloggingly thick 700 pounds. Laying on the bed on a full stomach, she was almost as tall as she was standing up. Piper'd been stuffed good and full by her two feisty friends, focused on fattening her up like a Christmas goose. Her humongous breasts flopped to either side of her gut, pinning her equally fleshy arms down as she laid there uselessly, drunkenly, helplessly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gawd you're so fat...\" Sam said, love-drunk from the sheer size of her long-time crush, \"I couldn't stand watching you shotgun those cannoli. It made me so hot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four-hundred pounder said the last part breathlessly. Her smaller (but by no means small) stomach pressed hard up against Piper's distended gut, shiny with sweat and pressure. At her urging, Sam had convinced Piper to eat that poor place out of house and home. The younger woman had been in the back of Sam's mind for years now, as she'd grown out and out into enormous sizes. But now that she had her all to herself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your belly's so <i>big</i>.\" Max cooed as she dove fingertips first into Piper's pliable pudge, \"God I wish that my skin looked this good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two landwhales had never felt better. At least, not since their respective weight gains. The shots were already taking effect. They could move around their bedroom easier, their muscles were stronger. They suddenly had the energy required to <i>exist</i> as extremely overweight members of society. More than exist. Indulge without remorse! And though they'd eaten more than their fair shares while they'd made their culinary tour around town, Piper had really taken the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiterally and figuratively, as it were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to order pizza?\" Max struggled to maintain her sultry purr as she struggled to lift Piper's immense fleshy gut, rubbing her chubby fingers up and down her hidden sex, \"Would you like that, piggy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Max please, she's stuffed as it is.\" Sam scolded, \"Aren't you, baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been so long since Piper had known the touch of... anyone, really. She'd only been hot for like two years before she started to blimp back up again. These two knew what they were doing. Piper felt chills run up and down her flabby arm wings as Sam's tongue made its way down her throat. Max's chubby fingers worked their way in and around Piper's neglected lips, tickling around her clit to expert effect. It had been so long... so long...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe... maybe?\" Piper puffed, absolutely breathless from her evening-long stuffing session and her throbbing libido, \"I'm just... full...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\" Max leaned forward, her gelatinous belly cut deeply into the bedframe. Her pale flesh rolled over the end, mushrooming over the wood grain as her thick greedy fingers slipped out and away from Piper's vagina. She struggled with one of Piper's enormous legs, inching some space between them that her belly quickly filled. \"I know how to make some room...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax knew what she was doing with her tongue. Piper did her best to support the fleshy avalanche of olive-colored flab from falling on top of her, but she just couldn't keep herself focused. Her fat fingers twitched, her toes clenched, and every muscle in her body screamed for sweet relief as Max's tongue worked its way in and around Piper's delicate insides...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You pig.\" Sam slapped Max on the big fat ass, \"You're pressuring her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm enlightening her.\" Max came up for air briefly before diving right back in, much to Piper's piggish delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, huh?\" Sam cupped Piper's fat face lovingly, \"Is there some room in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor emphasis, Sam slapped Piper's stomach, making it sway dangerously from high in the air. She had eaten so much, so very <i>very</i> much, how could she possibly have any room for more? But then, the feeling of arousal from all of this... <i>debauchery</i>. Max was going to town on Piper's clit like it was nobody's business and Sam had been slipping her tongue since before they walked through the door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was a poor piggy to do?</span></div></div>",

What do you think!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Piper stood up, much more slowly then she used to. Her fatty grunt had returned, and she had to shift her mass from side to side before getting it out of the way enough to stand. By now, Dr. Schwartz was ready for the small earthquake in her office whenever Piper got off the exam table. Once she was on her feet, Piper put one hand against her head and thrust out her mountainous gut and arched her back to try and stick out her boobs. They were far too heavy to be moved that easily, but she succeeded at exposing even more of her massive middle. Dr. Schwartz eagerly tried to count the number of rolls on the titanic twentysomethings gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a great loss to the modeling department.

Piper didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even feel it. Schwartz hit nothing but fat. The roll of adipose around her arm made finding muscle or bone like a needle in a haystack. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow old do you think I am?!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cFortyyyy--\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Schwartz cut off her guess right there.

Then she put the lid back on. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what your treatment is supposed to fix...You got anything else to eat around here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou realize this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just magic, right? There are limits.\u00e2\u0080\u009d McCarthy was indignant and feeling especially unappreciated with this latest conversation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI give you the greatest medical breakthrough of the century, and you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go two months without wanting something better!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course I realize that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Max said, still unaffected by the doctors impotent anger. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut like, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to be testing it, right? Quality assurance. How are you supposed to put warning labels on it if I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t figure out how to break it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Doctor McCarthy tried straightening her hair, and adjusting her glasses. \u00e2\u0080\u009c...You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re serious?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m serious. Do you think it was cheap paying for this much food?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Max said slapping her gut. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m here, trying to figure out what I have to do to get a heart attack or diabetes or whatever while taking your drug, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re giving me shit for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A greedy glimmer lit up in Max\u00e2\u0080\u0099s usually dull, bovine eyes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cReally, you should be paying me instead of Piper for this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0McCarthy took in a long, deep breath through her nose, while she thought if she really wanted to make a deal with a disgusting pig like Max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009c...otherwise I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to start eating less. I might even start losing weight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Max said, as added enticement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOK!\u00e2\u0080\u009d McCarthy relented. Then an evil smile started spreading across her face. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think I have the budget to cover your meals. Just...don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell Dr. Schwartz about our little arrangement, OK? It will be our little secret.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a time after Piper had successfully netted two new \"test subjects\" to test the Yeng R&amp;D department's experimental injections, things went by rather smoothly. Of course, that could only go on for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she wasn't as weak as she had been in the past, Piper's strength was fading. The ease with which she carried her six hundred, now seven hundred (and growing) pound body was beginning to fade. Day by day, as she continued to stuff herself to a steadily increasing maximum, the strain that came with carrying a small family's girth on one waistline was slowly beginning to return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had taken her a bit longer than usual to roll out of bed this morning. The cheap floor beneath the dumpy little Black house's floorboards creaked ominously as they always did whenever she walked, but her unsure footing and fatigued muscles made her gut-first gait all the more worrying. She lumbered into the living room, exposed stomach first, and practically poured herself through the double doorway. She was winded for the first time in months. Not to the point of exhaustion, but her spherical shape rose and fell unsteadily. To Piper, it just meant that it was time for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ma.\" Piper grumbled as she porked past her mother, playing with baby Hunter, and waddled right in front of her older sister's view of the television, \"Hey freeloader.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper took up nearly all of the living room at her size. Even with how big she was before all of this Yeng stuff happened, at least she was mostly sedentary. But watching her waddle around, scratching her exposed stomach as it spilled out and mushroomed over some unflattering teal scrubs of unusual size, it was hard to ignore just how big she was getting. Walking through the living room and into the kitchen, she hipchecked everything in her path. Her fleshy side brushed against nearly every knick-knack and decoration in the room, and her belly scraped against the walls on either side. Piper's gigantic ass had started bumping into the chairs at the dinner table, making a loud scraping sound as she bumped them with her booty blubber on her way to the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs ached a little. More than they had in some time. Nothing a little breakfast couldn't fix, and boy did she have options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking for Yeng meant discounts on everything. Food, furniture, clothing, and just about anything else she could have ever wanted was at a much more affordable price; thanks to her involvement in this experimental procedure, she'd basically been getting shit for free. Every week they'd have a delivery truck back into the drive way so Harper could unload it all and stuff it into their house. Finding it all a place to stay would have been a problem, if it weren't for a seven hundred pound feed-bag living with them. With Yeng backing her in this experiment, Piper could eat however much she wanted and more. Much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Pipey?\" came her mother's voice behind her, \"I... think it's time we had a talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper wasn't the only one packing it on. Living with someone who weighed more than anyone had any real right to had a weird way of affecting what constituted a \"normal\" portion size around the Black house. Harper had gone from a MILF-y mother of three to a real chunker. Her secretary spread had filled her jeans far and wide, and a fleshy olive tum eeked out from just about any shirt if she wasn't careful. The Black family breasts, which she had already inherited with gusto, had begun to sag under their own weight. They bounced slightly as she walked into the kitchen to confront her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure.\" Piper laborously turned her giant fleshy shape away from the stocked pantry to face her mother, \"What's up, ma?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... while I appreciate everything you're doing here, with your job and all... don't you think this place is getting a little...\" Harper raised her chunky arms to gesture vaguely around the kitchen, \"Cramped in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Piper snorted, a hand coming to squish some of her ample amounts of tummy fat, \"Duh. I mean, I'm pretty big. Parker's getting kinda fat too. And with Hunter...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Harper cut her second oldest off, \"Hunter is going to be needing her own room soon. And... you're making good money at Yeng, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an awkward silence between the two women that only grew in solemnity with the ticking of the old clock behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're... kicking me out?\" Piper furrowed her black brow in confusion, \"But... but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not just <i>kicking you out</i>.\" Harper put her hands on her fleshy hips, \"You're my daughter and I love you, but sweetheart... you said it yourself! You're pretty big, and you're obviously only going to get bigger. I'm happy for you and I'm happy you're happy, but you're knocking over furniture and I <i>really</i> don't think anyone could unwedge you from the floorboards if you fell through them, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Piper gulped, her swaddling row of chins jiggling, \"Jeez, ma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that we could <i>afford</i> it.\" Harper continued, clearly on a roll, \"I know those Yeng people are good to us, but I don't think they'd take it too kindly if we had to call them out to get a crane to help you out of the basement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, ma, I get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to mention the example we're all setting for little Hunter. She's going to grow up thinking that eating so much is normal! And I'm happy for you and supportive of you, of course, because I love you, but\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>MA</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meaty mama of three took a deep sigh. Her roly-poly physique made her look all the more pitiful, compared to the somehow more commanding and powerful form of Piper's sheer poundage. She hung her head low, big curly 'do sagging slightly in her shame as she made it clear she wasn't happy with the arrangement. Piper could see that, even if it wasn't ideal. She'd spent so long bitching about blowing up to her size, then reveling in her freedom, and then a little more time really <i>loving</i> how big she was getting, that she hadn't really noticed the fact that her size was clearly taking its toll in other areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't hate me, right?\" Harper asked finally, with a little face, \"You know I love ya no matter what, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure.\" Piper said half-heartedly, \"I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women collided for a hug. Harper's inferior flesh was no match for Piper's mountainous gut. It mostly wound up as Harper hugging the sag of her daughter's stomach, burying her head in one of Piper's airbag breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper knew that it wasn't personal. She sort've wished that it had been Parker that had gotten kicked out, but she understood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only trouble was... where was she going to live?</span></div></div>",

It was lunch time, which was ironically Piper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s break from eating during the day. She normally took it easy during her hour off, so she could return to work hungry and ready to test more snacks for the Yeng Corporation. Today was an exception, as she was too busy stress eating. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLike I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know that already. Of course I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m fat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She dropped the cup and looked around for more. Getting more would require getting up, so she just sulked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cPiper, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to direct your anger where it belongs. You are angry at your mother, not at your body.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Schwartz told her in a firm, but sympathetic tone. Normally, Dr. Schwartz took her lunches privately, in her office, alone. Retreating into her sanctum to recharge and refresh herself was one of the ways she stayed so relaxed and upbeat while at work. Piper already already had a therapy session scheduled for Friday, but Schwartz wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to leave an employee waiting in a crisis, especially Piper. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd your anger at your mother is justified.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Piper yelled, while her eyes tracked the jello cup Helen was eating out of. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe worst part is, I got this way because I was working so hard to support her and my sister! Sisters! Parker still hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t done anything, and she gets to stay, because she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any money to move out. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unbelievable!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She sighed, looked down at her vast bulk with frustration. Sure, she had been feeling better about it all recently, but this was frustrating. She made even Dr. Schwartz look absurdly small sitting next to her. When she first got this job, the marshmallow-like woman was much fatter than Piper, and Helen could still usually count on being the fattest person in the room outside her work. But next to Piper, she seemed like a tiny Teutonic pixie. She had an extra seven inches in height, and hundred inches around her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Helen nodded sympathetically. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you know where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be moving?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Piper grumbled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be any thinner if I moved out.

I want to return that kindness. Have I ever said no to something?

She was choking up a little though. Her eyes were moist. Piper had been the supporting pillar of her family so long, she forgot what real support felt like. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I be, you know, crowding you out of your place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cA Head of Research and Testing salary goes a lot farther than a secretary's, Liechen. I have room to spare...You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to do this, if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to.

You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re like the best boss ever!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Helen stood up, and came over to wrap her arm around as much as she could of Piper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meaty shoulders, in a little half hug, then kissed the side of her head. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you want my last taco? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not very hungry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSure!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Piper said, excitedly. She lunged for Helen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brown paper bag and wolfed down the treat in two bites. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey doc\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Piper pondered with her mouth full. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow come you always bring a sack lunch when they make free lunches here in the cafeteria.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOooh, no reason.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The process of moving Piper out of the Black family home wasn't nearly as arduous as one would have thought. Given that she was basically a glorified guinea pig for her parent company, moving her to a more controlled environment was going to be the end result anyway at the rate she was going. Doing it a few months in advance (initially a year, but Piper's expedient growth had already meant an early forecast) wasn't going to break anyone's budget or throw the projections of their project out of whack. On the contrary\u2014Dr. Schwartz's personal sponsorship of the project in the proposal she'd made to Dr. Hinamizawa was much less expensive. Rather than set aside one of the newly constructed Yeng homes (\"Goldfish Models\" they called them), Piper would be moving in with <i>her</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do you propose we do with all of the funds that we have already allocated into the Black home, Dr. Schwartz?\" Fukuda's fat, flat face creased at the corners of her mouth, open wide as she helped herself to another mouthful of her especially plump pink duck. \"You are aware that we cannot simply <i>abandon</i> the renovations that we have made in the name of success, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of the ownership that Helen felt over the younger, significantly larger subject, moving her into her home without the approval of her higher-ups would definitely complicate things. Piper was, for all intents and purpose, a Yeng asset now that she had received the experimental injections that had allowed her to... no, <i>enabled</i> her to live at such an extraordinarily high weight so comfortably. And while it wouldn't have been the first time that Helen had made off with property that wasn't <i>technically</i> (or legally) hers at the expense of the approval of her financial backers. But in order to give Piper the life that Helen felt she so desperately deserved, a certain level of comfort was going to have to be maintained. And that came with the necessary amount of officious obfuscation that Yeng specialized in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Helen, Fukuda was much more easily swayed these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the time that it had taken Piper to put on another hundred pounds, Fukuda had easily matched that. As payment for Evie's cooperation in getting Piper's friends their injections, Helen had kept to her word about working against their boss. Evie's long-standing, visceral and loathing attraction for the prim and proper head of their department had been something they'd spoken about for years. The tall, sadistic scientist absolutely adored the idea of the high and mighty Hinamizawa succumbing to carnal pleasures almost as much as Helen adored Piper. In a compromise, Helen had been steadily sabotaging her higher-up's every attempt to combat her growing girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ach, I knew you were going to say that.\" Helen said jokingly as she lathered the duck in a thick creamy gravy, to the approval of her porking employer, \"Would you like some more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please.\" Fukuda purred huskily as she watched the brown sauce spread over her meal, \"Just a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen gave her much more than just a bit. As she explained the benefits of Piper moving into her personal living space, rather than a sterilized and artificial environment, Helen took a small amount of pride in how little attention her boss was paying her. The food was divine, surely (Helen may not have known how to properly cook a duck, but working for Yeng had its perks!) but she could almost see Fukuda's mind getting lost in the sensation of her latest meal. Helen could understand Evie's attraction to their boss\u2014seeing the stern, powerful woman melt like a pudgy little puddle in light of her latest meal was quite cute! Perhaps, in another hundred or so pounds, watching her get tired from waddling around the office...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. Well, yes. But not right now. That was pleasure\u2014she was here for business. Or was it the other way around? It was getting so hard to tell these days...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The long and short of it is...\" Helen smiled wickedly as she leaned back into the dining chair, her finger steepled over her plump tum, \"We turn <i>one</i> experiment into <i>two</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Piper had moved out, an entirely different set of weight had settled on Harper's shoulders. She hadn't enjoyed the idea of her little girl having to make it on her own in her condition, especially after having been so good about everything. First the baby, then being the breadwinner, and then of course there was her weight gain. Piper's life hadn't been easy, that much was for sure, but Harper was sure that she could handle it. Now that she was living with Dr. Schwartz, Piper was going to be much happier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all were. Now that there was some wiggle room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper's 700+ pounds had really taken up a lot of space in the already cozy Black house. No matter where she went, Piper had dominated every room of the house and had on plenty of occasions gotten corked in the hallway. Thank goodness for her bosses at Yeng giving her such good insurance. The whole family owed that company a lot, but Piper's living there would have been all but impossible if her size hadn't been covered by their corporate insurance policy. With Yeng backing them, they had been afforded a lot of things. Renovations, yes. The expensive furniture meant to account for Piper's sheer size and the slight modifications that they'd made to the hallways and the bathrooms given her \"disability\", not to mention all of the <i>food</i> that they'd given them discounts on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all of it was just <i>there</i>. No Piper around to gobble it all up or take up the whole couch, and yet her presence was still very much felt. The Yeng delivery van was still bringing by Piper's regular truckload of groceries every Friday (Harper had noted with some displeasure that it was no longer the cute, older Saul and he had been replaced by someone closer to Parker's age who was much more attractive but did <i>not</i> share his predecessor's willingness to flirt with her!) and life still went on as though the big fat Black daughter was still lumbering around the house. And it didn't look like it was going to stop any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt might have been because they all worked for Yeng, Harper thought with her tummy bulging out from underneath her tank top as she leaned ass-out into the bottom of their cavernous fridge. The paperwork just hadn't been worked out, and they hadn't realized that Piper no longer lived with them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was because Piper hadn't actually changed addresses, Harper suckled on her third ice cream pop hotly, her olive forehead glistening in sweat as she baked with her belly-flesh pouring out of her shorts. Maybe Piper still lived with them <i>officially</i>, as in according to Uncle Sam, but Yeng just took care of her from now on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper found herself wondering about it off-and-on. It was hard not to, as Dr. Schwartz's secretary. She saw the woman every day at least once, and asked how her daughter was at length. Such a sweet woman, Helen was. She'd been such a big help to Piper, for sure, and she was such a nice boss. Always asking about how the baby was and making sure to bring plenty of yummy snacks for Harper to snack on. She'd even gotten Parker a work-from-home job from her computer! Surely she couldn't have thought Harper was as terrible as she told herself she was. Kicking her most responsible daughter out like that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of worrying about her daughter from the other room, about her increasingly enormous size and about how they were going to go broke trying to feed her, Harper found herself worrying about Piper from the other side of the spectrum!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better not eat my drumsticks.\" Harper blushed as she felt chilled belly flesh brush against her big brown badonk, \"I will literally kill you if you eat my drumsticks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker's fleshy gut poured into a single olive-colored apron of fat, untucked from her loose gray sweats as it wobbled in place. Parker folded her plush hammy arms underneath her breasts, bunching up her double chin as she made a face of utter Millenial consternation. Harper sheepishly put the ice cream cones back and bumped the fridge door shut with her sizeable booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, I um...\" Harper smiled awkwardly, squishy gut squelching in desire, \"I was just getting some milk for Hunter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Top shelf, ma.\" Parker grunted as she pushed past her mother, \"Now if you'll just <i>move</i> so I can get my ice cream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm your <i>mother</i> and if <i>I</i> want my ice cream\u2014!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two swelling subjects bickered, bellies brushing against one another as jabs were traded and insults lobbed. With the steady \"modifications\" that Helen had been making on the two of them on the clock and off, subliminally and psychoactively, she would see to it that they would reap exactly what they had sewn with how they treated poor Piper. With the strings she'd pulled with Fukuda, Helen had promised her that none of the resources Yeng had already put into that house would go to waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching them scrabble and squawk like two fattened pigeons fighting for crumbs from the Fridge Cam, Helen was confident that her promise would not go unfulfilled.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a soft knock on the door. \u201cPiper, are you feeling alright?\u201d Helen asked. She\u2019d been up in her room alone almost since the day she arrived, except when she went to work. Helen was concerned for obvious reasons. Her recent bout of depression, her skyrocketing weight gain, Helen was worried about a reversion to shut in behavior from Piper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the sound of the bed and floorboards groaning, and the whole house shaking as Piper got up out of bed, and made it to her bedroom door. She opened it a crack, looked at the doctor, and took her headphones off. Helen could hear the music playing from where she stood. \"Sorry doc, am I bothering you?\" Piper offered an apologetic smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could you? I haven't seen you since you settled in.\" Helen said in a teasing tone, her arms crossed under her fatty breasts. \"I thought you were feeling sick or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, I'm fine, I just didn't want to intrude.\" Piper said, getting ready to put her headphones back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piper.\" Helen put an arm through the door, and gave a gentle, reassuring touch on Piper's ham like upper arm. \"You live here too, now. You have a right to everything in this house, apart from my bedroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but...I know how these things are. I don't want you tripping over me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piper...you're not living with your family any more. You don't have to treat me like them. I promise I won't ever yell at you just for being in this home. I <i>want</i> you here, Piper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper just stood in the doorway, really touched, but not knowing how to show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on out to the kitchen. I've baked a pie.\" Helen smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold up, Max. I left my wallet inside. I gotta go back in, unless you want to pay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPiper, in the entire time you have known me, have I <i>ever</i> had the inclination, or money, to pay for you?\u201d Max said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper sighed, and began ponderously turning around. Even that was a slow process these days. It started with one hand thrown out for balance, and to make sure nothing was there, because Piper couldn\u2019t actually see past her shoulders any more, and she hadn\u2019t seen her feet in years. Then she took a blind, careful step, then her breasts sloshed far ahead of her, and she had to stop and regain her balance. She had to do that a few times before she could fully turn around. Even with the strength to lift all this weight, Piper still found being this heavy slowed her down immensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Piper. You\u2019re home early.\u201d Helen said, a little surprised, and a little concerned. Piper was even more surprised, and a lot more concerned. Helen was sitting at her workdesk, in the living room, naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re naked.\u201d Piper noted with surprised. Her understated words belied her shocked expression. The only thing bigger and rounder than her eyes right now were her tits. She\u2019d say a lot more if any words could come to her. Right now her mind was focused on seeing each and every one of the overweight Doctor\u2019s rolls and stretchmarks from her double chin swaddled neck to her chubby feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d She noted simply, with a nod before returning to her work with a few clicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Why</i> are you naked?\u201d Piper asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m normally naked as soon as I get home. But since you\u2019re living here, I only do it when you leave. I am a considerate roommate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. That makes sense.\u201d Piper realized. She still hadn\u2019t stopped staring. But Dr. Schwartz seemed incapable of feeling any shame or self-consciousness under her gaze. \u201cI guess I put a damper on that, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmyes.\u201d Helen said, without looking away from the screen, her face bathed in blue light. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry. You\u2019re more important than that.\u201d She reassured her. Then she finally paid attention to her young roommate. \u201cWhy does it bother you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPffft, it\u2019s nothing I haven\u2019t seen before. I mean, not yours, but it\u2019s all the same, basically.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you wouldn\u2019t mind if I did this when you were home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah!\u201d Piper said, finally looking away to go search for her keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that\u2019s good to hear.\u201d Helen smiled. \u201cAnd you should feel comfortable dressing, or not, as you wish around me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh fuck yeah. Putting pants on during the weekend <i>sucks</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt really does, ja.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWo zum teufel ist mein handy!\u201d Helen roared from somewhere in the kitchen. She didn\u2019t really expect an answer from anyone. She was just frustrated after searching for her cell phone for the last 20 minutes. Losing something was a rare occurrence for Helen, having both a love of organization, and a 200 IQ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAuf dem Kaffeetisch!\u201d Piper called out to her from the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen poked her head into the doorway. \u201cPiper, hast du immer deutsch gesprochen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Ok, I don\u2019t know that one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAm I going crazy, or did you answer me in German?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah. You speak it so often around the house, I was bound to learn some, eventually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen smiled, and came over to pinch Piper on the cheeks. \u201cSuch a bright girl. <i>And</i> you found my cell phone for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piper, if it's alright with you, I'd like to have the house to myself between the hours of...lets say 7 PM and 3 AM?\" Dr. Schwartz casually asked her much younger roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooooooh, you got a hot date planned tonight Doc?\" Piper teased, while gnoshing on some popcorn, sitting on the couch and enjoying Helen\u2019s entertainment center, Helen blushed, and wave away, Piper\u2019s suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo, of course not. Piper you flatter me. I don't get many dates these days, I'm afraid.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what do you need so much private time for, huh?\" Piper teased. She wasn\u2019t buying it. If she was sick of having her around, Helen would order her to leave, not be all quiet about it like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An orgy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Come again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said an orgy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike\u2026a real one. You\u2019re serious.\u201d Piper\u2019s jaw hung open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. I\u2019m going to have about twelve other friends over, and we\u2019re going to be ummm\u2026\u201d Helen vaguely gestured at the couch Piper was sitting on. And to Helen\u2019s bedroom. And to the kitchen table. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to join, if you like, but I was worried it would make you uncomfortable if I asked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper shook her head slightly, to clear it. Sometimes she missed when Dakota was her weirdest acquaintance, just for being from Texas. Sometimes, she really liked the friends she\u2019d made since then. \u201cYou can\u2019t get a date, but you can get an orgy?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s low commitment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow does something like that even happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have my own house, and an active internet connection. It\u2019s that easy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemind me to never use google when I borrow your laptop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Piper...I <i>always</i> delete my browser history.\u201d Helen said with a warm smile.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For most of her tenure at Yeng, Piper had spent her time being unwittingly fattened up by a number of people. There were plenty of spoons in the pot that was plumping up Piper Black, but none of them were more prominent or proficient at the task than Dr. Helen Schwartz. Whether it was because it was her job to oversee such a development (in the beginning, what seemed like a lifetime ago, that's all it was) or because she had genuinely grown fond of Piper and wanted to show that affection in ways that just happened to involve very fattening, very enabling behaviors\u2014Helen had a lot to do with the way that Piper was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only fitting that, thanks in part <i>to</i> the way Piper was now, the reverse would become true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiving with Piper meant that there was simultaneously a lot of food and almost no food at all in the house. With the sheer quantity that she ate throughout the day, enough to feed a team of Olympic gold medalists there needed to be an excessive amount of access to food. And as the injections began to wane at Piper's still increasing size, she was steadily becoming less and less mobile again. While much more sturdy than a woman who weighed more than 700 pounds had any right to be, Piper came to rely a lot on Dr. Schwartz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helen, please, call me Helen.\" the good doctor's round cheeks bunched up into deep dimples as she touched Piper's puddling pillow of upper arm wing, \"Ach, you still do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Helen had wheeled the latest addition to the day's lunch of many courses in front of her couch-sized charge, Piper had not only forgotten what she'd done to earn her roommate and handler's gentle reminder, but she'd also completely checked out for lunch. Her big brown bovine eyes were hazy and her attention was scarce as she moved her hammy arms with surprising and inspiring speeds across the trolleys that Helen had spread her lunch across. She operated entirely on instinct, her acres of arm fat trembling as she hurried the food into her mouth. Hunched forward to better reach over her stupendous beanbag breasts, Piper operated entirely on instinct. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the hungry sounds of Piper's feasting, her grunting, and heavy breathing, Helen watched as her friend and unwitting test subject enjoyed herself. She had always loved to watch Piper eat. She seemed at her happiest, even back when she was a skinny teenager applying for the position when she was indulging herself. It made sense, given her family's history of poverty, but Helen could empathize and even relate to Piper's piggish point of view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd spent so long staying at a manageable weight\u2014her hedonistic desires kept in check by a somewhat demanding career at the Yeng Offices. No longer could she gorge on her favorite foods endlessly, at least not without consequence. Her iron-clad self-control was a point of pride, as was her ability to overcome any and all temptation (though not always happily). No obstacle was too small for Helen Schwartz, but was weight even becoming an obstacle anymore?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Piper, sucking down a hearty mix of German and Mexican cuisine prepared by none other than the good doctor herself, her mind occupied and all of her needs fulfilled, Helen had a thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I want that.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, who was going to tell her that she couldn't? Fukuda? Not with how she had her eating out of the palm of her hand. There was no reason any longer to cut back or deny herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she wouldn't\u2014Helen did what she wanted. And now? Helen wanted to get <i>fat</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper's piggy eyes brightened at the sight of all the extra portions being brought to her today. The greedy gears in her brain began to work into overdrive, driven into an especially excited lurch towards the trollies being wheeled in her direction. But when her hands had <i>almost</i> reached the first cart, greedy mitts nearly touching the serving tray of some kielbasa dish that Helen had taught her how to love, she felt a sting on the back of her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ach!\" Helen reprimanded gently, \"That one is mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Piper's eyes watered at the thought of being told 'no' for the first time in what was far, far too long<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts, <i>schatzen</i>.\" Helen said sternly, \"I will be joining you for lunch today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You eat lunch with me every day.\" Piper pouted, rubbing the back of her hand petulantly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I <i>serve</i> you lunch every day.\" Helen corrected, settling in a seat catty-cornered to Piper's sofa, \"I think it is time that I enjoy myself during these mealtimes too, ja?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...ja.\" Piper relented, \"Can we eat soon? I haven't had anything since breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, <i>mein liebchen</i>.\" the doughy doctor smiled literally licking her lips in anticipation of what was to be a grand meal, Piper looking on in disappointment and shock as Helen took from what she had assumed as <i>her</i> extra big portion, \"Now we can truly <i>eat</i>...\"</span></div></div>",

This answer was followed by a long, wet fit of coughing that Evie had no trouble recognizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you smoking?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Evie asked, scandalized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cJa.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, may I ask?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Evie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s frustration with her friend was growing, and her voice became clipped and curt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, like you have room to talk.\" Helen chuckled. \"Or are you forgetting the last time you stayed up smoking and watching X-Files and called me because you thought there was an alien in your apartment?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s different. That was 3 A.M, on a Saturday, not 11 AM on a Tuesday.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cTime is a social construct anyway. Take it up with Fukuda if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so much trouble.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helen said, before hiding the receiver in her soft chest. If she knew McCarthy, and she did, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be yelling at her for the next minute or two, and she wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t notice if Helen wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there. She was sitting, half naked on the couch, wearing only her pajama bottoms next to Piper Black, who was similarly undressed. Pipers Massive breasts sprayed out and flattened against her stomach, the perkiness they maintained even as she neared 500 pounds was finally lost, as Piper increasingly turned from an hour glass to an undifferentiated blob of adipose. Their naked belies and breasts rubbed up against each other casually. While Piper's shape had become more ambiguous, Helen's became more defined, as the added weight turned her stomach from a small hanging pooch to an almost spherical thing, that stuck up past her breasts and chins, towards the ceiling, in Helen's almost horizontally reclined position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cPiper, could you please pass me the pringles, bitte?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helen asked, pointed at a can in reach of Piper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on the phone, Doc?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Piper said, while starting the tectonic process of leaning forward to grab the chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just Evie. Badgering us to show up for work.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helen rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo is that a no on the Mike Tyson Mysteries marathon today?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Piper asked while waving the TV remote. This was the real driving force of Helen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent weight gain. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so much about the larger meals she enjoyed apart from Piper, but the weekends and evenings spent hanging out on the couch with her favorite test subject, eating food together, and taking deep dives into pop culture, and engaging in Piper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0098hobbies\u00e2\u0080\u0099.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Helen was happy like this. Real happy. Happy enough to not worry about something as petty as \u00e2\u0080\u0098work\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or \u00e2\u0080\u0098obligations\u00e2\u0080\u0099. Helen had spent years waiting for the right time, and conditions to let herself go, and right now, she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t imagine a better time or way to do it then to park her increasing wide tuchuss next to Piper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and just vegetate together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course not, meine schatzi, let me just deal with this real quick.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helen said, before tipping the Pringles into her mouth, and finally picking up the phone. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell Evie, it sounds like you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in charge today. Fukuda can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop you and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not coming in, so you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re acting head of the department today. Have fun with that. Play some Doom at your desk or something. Or don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Like, one where you leave the house? How am I supposed to enjoy my day off with you on the phone all day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a <b>you</b> problem, not a <b>me</b> problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker grabbed a soda from the fridge before collapsing in their recliner, leaving her one leg over the arm of the chair. Dressed in old sweats and a loose fitting sweater, she looked every bit the part of \"don't give a sh*t, I'm on break.\" She cracked her can open and took a sip before turning back to the land-whale her mother swears she's related to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if you had a normal job, you wouldn't be such a hippo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piss off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or what? You'll sit on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awful high and mighty for someone who spent 2 hours last night praying to the porcelain god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker just snorted. \"Least I still get invited to parties, fat-ass. Wasn't any pizza, so I'm sure you're not interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christ's sake, Parker, just f*ck off, already! My shift starts in half an hour!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a <b>you</b> problem, not a <b>me</b> problem. You're not working out here; I'm not spending my first day off in three weeks sitting in the food court, watching porn on my phone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper was shocked to stillness for a moment. A brief look of disgust crossed her chubby yet still pretty face. \"... what kind of person watches porn on their phone in the mall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker raised her hand with a \"Yo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper shook her head, her black hair swishing with each toss of her head. \"I cannot get that image out of my head fast enough. Look, I need to work somewhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't you just work in the office!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What office!? We live in an apartment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the baby sleeps. Duh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunter's room? You really think that's a good idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why not? You used to work in there all the time, then a few weeks back, suddenly it's not good enough for you.\" Parker frowned in thought for a moment, and then a sudden look of clarity crossed her face. \"Oh my God, your fat f*cking ass crushed the chair, didn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker had hit the nail on the head. Hunter's bedroom had served double duty as Piper's office, allowing her to both work and watch her younger sister at the same time, if needs be. She'd purchased herself a massive, reinforced computer chair and put it in bedroom, generally remaining planted on it all day, save the occasional trip to the restroom or the door for her gargantuan take out orders. Despite being such a reliable piece of kit, it had at last surrendered the struggle and collapsed under Piper's mammoth gains. Thankfully, both Parker and their mother, Harper, had been at work, keeping Piper's shame to a minimum, though it had taken her a dreadfully long time to rise again from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chair giving out under her, despite its 500 pound weight limit, had been what drove Piper to the scale for the first time since she swore off ever stepping on it again, back when she'd been a comparatively slim 340 pounds. She remembered how embarrassed she'd been back then, heavier then she'd ever been, and bulging out of everything she owned. How would the \"Her\" back then react to the \"Her\" now, at almost double the weight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't bring herself to confirm or deny her sister's accusation, but her crimson blush and look of humiliation said it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker sighed. \"This would be so funny if it wasn't ruining my day off. Alright, Lard Butt, stand up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper frowned, but didn't argue with her sister, for once. Granted, standing up was a bit of a process for supersized Piper Black. Her huge triple-rolled belly stretched across her lap, reaching towards the arms of the couch and overhanging her knees. Combined with her titanic tits, each the size of a large medicine ball, she had quite the formidable obstacle between her and rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lower half, though mostly hidden under her oversized belly, was certainly trying to hold up its end. Her ass was as large as a bean bag chair, jutting out far behind her. Her huge, almost rectangular, booty provided a solid shelf for her football sized love handles and massive back rolls, and seemed to excel at working together with her belly to keep her pinned to whatever surface she was currently sitting on. Her hips were the only part of her wider then her massively overfed gut, and her thighs were as girthy as a barrel, keeping her extremely well-padded knees as far apart as they possibly could. Hell, even her calves had fattened immensely, being bigger around then her <i>Bubby's</i> thighs, and she had some pretty big thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken altogether - her massive, pinning belly; her enormous ass, moving only reluctantly and with great effort; the sheer quantity of obstructive fat packed around her joints, leaving her barely able to bend - and standing up was a fair challenge for the raven-haired beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shuffled slowly towards the edge of the couch, lightly grunting with each movement as her lardy frame jiggled gelationously. Piper was currently dressed in her largest spaghetti-strapped tank top, the white material stretched to its limits around her unbelievably oversized features. She wasn't wearing a bra, as she'd stopped purchasing them over 300 pounds ago, both because of the difficulty in finding them in her size and the cost of buying new bras so frequently as she grew and grew and grew. Perhaps the only positive she could say about her belly being so huge was that it gave a lot of support to the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the huge size of her shirt, it was doing a terrible job of helping Piper maintain her decency. Her lower belly roll simply refused to be contained, despite her repeated attempts to pull the garment down and under the massive roll. Her breasts worked with her belly to push the material out to its utmost, leaving a veritable Grand Canyon of jiggly cleavage on display. Each large move sent a significant wobble through her surging fat, threatening to give Parker a free show at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper had a pair of large rolls running from her breasts to under her arms, before wrapping around her back. They overhung the sides of her shirt, running out a good ways before drooping down heavily. Her upper arms were larger then hams, with a heavy wobble and droop of their own, and they worked in tandem with her pit rolls to restrict the movements of her arms down and sideways, while her absurdly over-padded shoulders worked to make raising her arms over her head a near-Herculean task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept when she was eating, at least. For some reason, her fat never seemed to make that a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps the only part of Piper that hadn't crossed the line into supersized was her face. Her cheeks had certainly rounded out, developing cute dimples, and she now had a noticeable double chin, but her facial features looked like they belonged to a considerably smaller woman than Piper Black. Only the soft thickness of her neck gave any indication to the size of the woman below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally at the edge of the couch, Piper took a moment to catch her breath. Having spent the last few years doing nothing more straining then sitting on her growing behind and eating an ungodly amount of calories had left her sorely lacking in the cardio department. Piper's muscles were woefully under equipped to deal with her terribly overinflated body, and her stamina and strength stats were virtually non-existent in light of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker was getting impatient. \"God damn it, you f*cking cow, just give me your hands already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper was too busy trying to catch her breath to verbally spar with her belligerent sibling, and she held out her hands. Parker took hold and pulled with a loud grunt. Piper slowly rose to her lightly quaking legs with a loud, steady groan. Her gigantic hips and booty came into view, her decency protected only by a suffering pair of black sweat shorts, which probably fit her better a couple months ago. Her choice of attire, dictated as much by Piper's personal tastes as by the necessities of her size, left A LOT of flabby, olive-colored rolls on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally upright, Piper stood akimbo, feeling her hands sink deep into her back fat as she breathed deeply. Her back was actually feeling a little wore out from the effort of standing, though she kept her silence around Parker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F*cking finally. One second.\" With that, Parker grabbed an edge of the couch and started dragging the piece of furniture down the hall. She was surprisingly strong and moved at a quick pace, leaving her elephantine sister standing in her dust. Pretty soon, she heard a loud thud from Hunter's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There,\" Parker said as she came back out, dusting her hands. \"Now you can work for a living, and I can watch my Hogan's Heroes marathon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper, midway through wiping the sweat off her brow, stopped and looked at her sister. \"You watch porn at the mall, and Hogan's Heroes at home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also routinely scream about the glory of Satan. Word to the not-so-wise: if people think you're crazy or creepy, you don't have to share a seat on the bus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper merely rolled her eyes at Parker's logic. \"Right, whatever. I'm getting ready for work. Just keep it down, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No promises,\" Parker said as she turned on the TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker was moving through the channels as Piper slowly, heavily waddled her way down the hall. Working through the listing to her show, she came across an episode of \"My 600 pound life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That just hits WAY too close to home.\"</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Piper slowly made her way down the hallway. The grandiose measurements of her lower half forced her to adopt a significant waddle in a desperate bid to keep her feet moving forward, a task made all the harder by her knee-length belly. She was running her hands along the wall to help maintain her balance, and occasionally felt her enormous hips graze the wainscotting. At one point, there had been a couple small tables in the hall, bedecked in family photos and souvenirs by her Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said she'd moved them so Hunter wouldn't knock them over, but Piper suspected otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight jiggle passed through Piper's lardy body with each lumbering step. She was trying to step gently, but her sheer mass meant each footfall struck with more weight than anticipated. Piper was breathing heavily, and she took a moment to catch her breath by the bathroom door, bracing herself on the frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"God damn it! This is crazy! Why did I get so fat!?\"</i> Even as Piper thought it, she knew it was a rhetorical question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last act of her deadbeat Dad had been to knock Harper up one more time, and then he was out the door. The Black family finances had been suspect before, but now, they were downright criminal. With Harper soon to be unemployed and a new baby on the way, there was only one option left to the two elder girls; namely, they had to get jobs and help support the family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Piper was hesitant to give Parker props for anything, she'd really stepped up to the plate. She'd gotten a job at \"Wilson W. Wilson's,\" a small chain of furniture stores. The pay was steady, but she also received commissions, and as it turned out, Parker was a born salesman. Her first week had seen her sell two couches and a fridge, adding a large chunk of change to the family kitty. Now employed full time, she had yet to bounce a rent check or fail to pay the cable bill, which is something Piper thought she'd never see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven before their Mom brought it up, Parker had also removed all her alcohol from the house and limited her party-girl antics outside, making sure her little sister never had to deal with her less child-friendly self. Piper couldn't help but feel a little jealous of Hunter in that regard, as Parker certainly hadn't shown her the same courtesy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper, meanwhile, had gotten a job with \"Made for TV.\" The company, as the name implied, made and sold products on infomercials. Piper's official title was Customer Service Representative. While they had a website where people could order their products, many still chose to call and place their orders (or just to complain), which is where people like Piper came in. The company preferred to home-source their operators as opposed to outsourcing, considering the positive PR alone to be worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a lot of ways, this was the perfect job for Piper. She could be unshowered and in her underwear, and still be dressed for work. Working at home also saved a lot of time and money on her commute. Perhaps most important, however, was it meant someone was always at home and could watch Hunter, freeing Harper up to job hunt as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween her responsibilities with Hunter and work, Piper left the apartment with less and less frequency. Cupboards once left bare were now perpetually stocked, and Piper raided them like clockwork as her inner glutton came once more to the fore. Cookies, snack cakes, ice cream, and pastries quickly became her mainstay. Left to her own devices for food frequently, takeout became the bulk of her diet, thanks to an ever increasing number of delivery options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time passed, her consumption only increased. One Debbie snack cake became two, then three at a go. She'd be cutting up carrots and celery for Hunter's snack while downing a row of Oreo cookies. A burger and small fries became two, then two doubles, then three triples. She started ordering pizza to tide her over at work, working her way up from a single medium to multiple larges. Piper always felt compelled to push herself to the point of comfortably stuffed, and everyday seemed to take just a little bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEating more overall then ever, eating more calorific then ever, and engaging in zero exercise, it really shouldn't have been much of a surprise when she started blowing up. At first, she ignored it. It was just a little bit of pudge, nothing to worry about. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Piper hit the two hundred pound mark, she tried to put a positive spin on it. Sure, she had a bit of a pot belly, but it was just a cute little belly. Besides, she now had a booty that wouldn't quit, and her tits were simply huge. Her weight gain might as well have been invisible compared to her now very exaggerated hourglass figure. It seemed every time she went out (admittedly infrequently, and usually Walmart or Costco), someone new was hitting on her, which did wonders for her ego.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt three hundred pounds, she was definitely getting uncomfortable with her build. Her cute little belly was now a bulging, segmented thing, drooping under its own mass as gravity did its work. Her boobs were even bigger, but their perkiness was rapidly going by the wayside, leaving the lardy things draped across her belly when she wasn't wearing a bra. Her ass had gone from booty-licious big to way too big. Even the biggest articles in her wardrobe struggled to contain her cheeks, and it seemed like her ass took each new pair of shorts or pants like a personal challenge, which they never failed to overcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around this time that Parker, always a bitch, started giving her a hard time about her weight. Harper worked to put a stop to it when the fights threatened to break out, but in private tried to gently guide her rapidly ballooning daughter. She was unfortunately limited to advice for a number of reasons; Piper's role as homemaker, it was her money paying the food bills, and her being a grown woman chief amongst them. Harper was also working two jobs at this time, leaving her out of the loop far more then she really wanted to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around this time that Piper started stress eating about how much she was overeating. This was understandably far from the healthiest response, and only made her weight problem worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatters came to a head shortly thereafter. She'd visited her friends, Dakota and Zack, in person for the first time in a long while, and both had been stunned by how fat she'd gotten. They'd both attempted to gently point out the elephant in the room, but only succeeded in starting a fight between the three. Piper had left in a rage, and though she still texted them, she hadn't set eyes on either one in months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day, Piper was getting dressed to go to Costco for a bulk pack of toilet paper, and struggling to pull up her largest remaining pair of pants. She knew she should have bought new ones some time ago, but had been stubbornly refusing to admit to herself that she was gaining more weight. Piper just barely pulled the pants over her gigantic ass, and had finally succeeded in buttoning the tight garment. She let out her breath, and promptly heard a loud \"RIP!\" Looking down, she saw that her engorged thighs had split the inseam of her pants to the knee. Looking in the mirror, she saw that her girth had stretched her blouse tight across her middle, leaving triangles of flesh visible between all her buttons. Even as she watched, a button popped off her blouse, ricocheting loudly off the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper broke out in a cold sweat. Making her way to the bathroom, she stepped onto the family scale. Pushing her boobs and belly out of the way, she read numbers she never thought she'd see: 340 lbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething broke in Piper at that moment. That night, she'd ordered two large pizzas and a bucket of chicken, and grabbed the last two-thirds of that pan of cake from the fridge. Starting her feast at seven, she ate on and off until almost one, leaving herself painfully stuffed and feeling slightly ill. Her consumption never dropped back down afterwards as Piper continued to eat her weight gain fears, and the Black apartment quickly became well known among the local delivery drivers, both for the sheer scale of the orders and the generous tips the increasingly lardy matron gave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper hid the scale under the bathroom counter, swearing that she'd never step on one again. She began ordering all her clothes online, dutifully ignoring how many X's each garment contained, even as she added a couple every now and again once her current wardrobe began to feel a little tight. She stopped ordering bras after outgrowing three in under a month, unwilling to either deal with the cost or be confronted with the fact that she was still expanding rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was sometime after that when Piper ordered her massively overbuilt chair. She was by this point firmly trapped in a vicious cycle of being self-conscious of her weight and eating more to cope, thus winding up even fatter. Still, she managed to convince herself that there was no way she'd ever outgrow such a beefy piece of furniture...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, that didn't pan out,\"</i> Piper thought as her cavernous belly growled hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Piper, her breathing at last returning to a normal rate, reached down and flicked on the light. For whatever reason, the light switch for the bathroom was located in the hallway itself, and had been a source of many fights between Piper and Parker while growing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shower stall had a full length mirror in its sliding door, and the bright LED's let Piper see herself in all her glory. Or, you know, something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, Piper didn't feel much \"glory\" or other such good feelings when she looked at herself lately. She completely filled the door way, and it was painfully obvious that there was a lot more of her hidden beyond the edges of the frame. Her belly bulged out from under her shirt and hung down to her knees, and depending on what angle you viewed her at, left her looking as though she wasn't wearing anything below her belt line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"At least, if I had a belt line,\"</i> Piper thought as she eyed her ocean of flab, barely contained within her supple skin. <i>\"When was the last time I even wore a belt? Ugh, I look like a ball of pizza dough.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper's gaze rose to her lardy breasts. Resting atop her massively protruding belly, they were also large enough to bulge past the edges of the door frame, if only a smidgen. Her poor shirt could barely cover her, and a lot of her tit flesh was on display, with the garment seeming to just cover her naughty bits. White was perhaps not the best color choice, but at least the material was thick enough to avoid being transparent, despite how tightly it was stretched around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arm fat was particularly impressive at this angle. Piper still had her forearms resting against the door frame, with her upper arms forming a pair of right angles with her deeply buried spine. It was a testament to their sheer size that, despite the distance bone to bone, the flab on her upper arms drooped low enough that it never broke contact with her pit rolls. And this was no mere \"barely there\" contact, but rather a full roll atop another (far more substantial) roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Piper pulled her eyes away from her captivating reflection, a soft blue light on the floor caught her eye. As she looked closer, she realized that it was the bathroom scale, still lit up from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper frowned. <i>\"Shouldn't that have turned off by now?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning sideways, she slowly, carefully, squeezed through the door, feeling her expanded features dragging against the frame the entire way. Once inside, she looked at the scale a little closer. It read <i>\"597 lbs.\"</i> She poked and prodded at it with her feet as best she could, although due to her gargantuan measurements, she was forced to operate almost exclusively by touch. Piper had her hands on the wall for support, but trying to balance her weight on one foot for more then a second was tiring as well as dangerous, and her feet thudded heavily into the floor far more often then the scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, stepping back and eyeballing the results of her prodding, she unfortunately confirmed exactly what she suspected. She rubbed her huge, overfed belly as another loud growl echoed from the perpetually hungry organ. She bit her lower lip, the only outward sign of her mounting anxiety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Holy f*ck, my fat ass did break the scale.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper slowly plodded her way into Hunter's room/her office. Harper had taken little Hunter to visit her Grandmother, so the room was currently unoccupied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper was glad to see that Parker had at least had the foresight to leave the couch next to the room's table, and she set her supplies down before gratefully plopping her butt back on the couch with a heavy sigh, her blubber settling around her. She felt her extra-wide tush sink deep into the cushions, and she was pretty certain she could feel the arms of the furniture starting to tickle the edges of her hips. Her enormous belly was thrust upwards by her lap, in turn pushing her blubbery tits and flabby chest practically into her chin. Even her arms were propped up and resting on a buttery mountain of lard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she'd caught her breath from her walk down the hallway (a somewhat terrifying fact that she tried desperately to push out of her mind), Piper put on her headset. Setting her laptop and cooling pad upon her fatty chest, she fired it up and logged into the Employee page of her company's site. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing she still had a couple of minutes before she was on the clock, Piper quickly logged into a couple of her favorite shopping accounts to look at a few things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"A new computer chair is a must,\"</i> she thought as she placed an express order for an absolutely monstrous piece of furniture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper flipped over to ebay, smiling once she saw she'd won her auction. Harper was a frugal woman, but one of the very few luxuries she'd recently allowed herself was a proper record player. Ms. Black was a huge fan of Fleetwood Mac, and Piper had been looking for and found an album for her birthday. It's ETA was well in advance of the date as well, which was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last two items Piper looked at as a pair. She filled out her orders on both sites, but then paused for a moment without clicking \"send.\" Her eyes flicked between them, and she once more bit her lower lip as she looked at the remaining supplies on the table beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA box of maple cookies and a jumbo bag of chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, to hell with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, Piper went to Big Betty's Boudoir. She made sure to move her size up a couple X's and that she'd ticked off Express Delivery, then clicked \"send.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, she opened the tab for Nitoli's Pizzeria and placed an order for two large meat lover's with extra cheese, a double order of cinnamon sticks with an extra icing dip, and a 2L of cream soda. She also tacked on a small vegetarian for Parker, knowing it was the only way to avoid her bitchy comments and get her order brought to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she closed her various shopping tabs and made ready to work, Piper thought, <i>\"I'm starving myself, and I don't even know if I'm losing weight on this stupid diet. I can worry about it once the new scale gets here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, I'm already f*cking enormous. How much fatter could I possibly get?\"</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(A/N: there was a typo in my previous chapter. It was supposed to be Boutique, not Boudoir. Sorry about that.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Black family home was pretty quiet this morning. With Parker still asleep, Piper had the TV volume turned down low. Harper and Hunter weren't due back for at least another day, and for once, Piper had the place all to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so peaceful and quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, except for the sounds of chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper was once more sat upon the couch, Parker having moved it back some time after her younger sister had dragged her enormous ass to bed. She'd planned ahead, loading the end tables to each side of the long suffering piece of furniture with various goodies. Piper had also placed another large fast food order, and was currently enjoying her third greasy breakfast sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast night's extended stuffing had been truly epic. Piper had steadily eaten her way through her massive order in between calls, leaving her feeling so full by the time her shift wrapped up. Despite the tightness in her belly, she still didn't feel like she was yet done. She made her way down the hall to the kitchen. Once there, she grabbed a plate of brownies, a lemon meringue pie and a fork, and slowly waddled to her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving not stopped for a break since rising from the couch in Hunter's room, she was breathing pretty hard. A sheen of sweat glistened off her loose, flabby rolls. Her legs trembled, totally unused to dealing with her mass for such an extended length of time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment to strip off her sweat shorts and white tank top, Piper sat down on her bed. She had debated flopping down, but wasn't sure she really wanted to pay for a new bed right now. And so, she took the gentle route, leaning against the headboard and slowly, carefully moving her legs on and move towards the middle of the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the position, Piper grabbed her desserts and the fork from her nightstand and dug in with a loud, \"Mmm!\" Her boobs and belly made a pretty large, if jiggly, impromptu table, giving her more then enough room to fit both her desserts on. The angle she was leaning on left her chin digging into her soft, pliable blubber. Along with the pace of her mouthfuls of pie and brownies, she was forced to alternate between mouthfuls of food and mouthfuls of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you'd only had the noise to go off of, one could be forgiven for mistaking the sound of Piper feasting as a hog feeding from a trough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as her belly started to hurt, she kept the pace up until she'd finished off both containers in their entirety. Letting out a satisfied coo, Piper placed the empty trays back on her nightstand. She rubbed her packed belly as best she could with one hand. The other, meanwhile, was picking the crumbs off her engorged breast and belly fat, funneling the delicate remains into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since she'd started her abortive diet over a week ago, Piper had been missing the sensation of a comfortably stuffed belly. And given she was now on something of an unofficial break until a new scale arrived, she intended to remind herself of that pleasure as often as she could until then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to enjoy it now, after all. Once the new scale arrived, she'd be eating right, she'd stop snacking all the time, her portions would shrink down to normal, and once she'd lost enough weight from dieting, she'd start exercising again. Yes-siree, she'd be good from then on, so she had every right to enjoy being a pig now. Right? Right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven last night, Piper had doubted her reasoning, but she felt powerless to resist her own gluttony. Part of her worried she was too far gone already, and she couldn't help but wonder whether or not to just give in to the inevitable. <i>\"If there was ever a chance at reining this in, it would have happened before I hit 600 pounds, right? While I could still walk more then twenty yards without a break? When I didn't need a stool and car wash equipment to shower? I can't keep this up, but God, I'm so hungry all the time...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe promptly buried those fears under another breakfast sandwich, scarfing it down in a few loud bites, trying to lose herself in the pleasures of eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper was so focused on eating more and trying to forget about the consequences that she didn't even hear the person behind her until they were right there. Who is it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Piper grabbed her last sandwich out of the bag. Gripping it with her teeth, she picked all the wrappers off her straining shirt and stuffed them in the bag. Crumpling the lot into a ball, Piper aimed for the garbage can in the corner, which was made rather difficult due to the sheer size of her arms. Lining up and firing off her jump shot, sans jump, Piper felt her fatty flesh drag wetly across herself, but smiled as she sank her ball of wrappers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing but net,\" she mumbled as grabbed the sandwich from her jaws and took a large bite. As she bit into the sandwich, she felt a large glob of ketchup drop onto her breasts. Thankfully it missed her shirt, leaving a large blob of tomato red and grease on her gigantic right tit. Wiping her lardy mammary off with her finger, she slurped the digit clean before taking another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer attention was now drawn to her almost cartoonishly oversized breasts, resting heavily on her gargantuan belly. She smooshed her elbows into her tits, confirming what she already knew. Namely, that her boobs were basically giant, definitionless water balloons filled with Crisco. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I wonder how much my boobs weigh? 30 pounds each? 40? Christ, 50 pounds a piece? If my gut wasn't so f*cking huge, my spine would have shattered by now.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft gurgle sounded from her bottomless stomach. Piper was far from enamored with her sheer size and poor physical shape, but her dominant organ was undoubtedly much happier with the current state of affairs, and she was slightly uncomfortable with the pleasant sensations coming from her well-stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well,\"</i> she thought a little sourly as she leaned to her left, struggling to bend as her huge rolls crushed into each other, <i>\"I guess round is a totally legit shape.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper grunted softly as she forced herself over that last inch, her fingers finally catching the edge of the plastic container. Grabbing it, she leaned back, placing her prize on top of her lardacious tits. Opening the box with a loud plastic pop, she revealed the treasure within; six gooey, jumbo sized cinnamon buns, all smothered in a thick layer of cream cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew this wasn't her best idea, but they smelled so damn good. And she was on a break from her diet, so she should cut loose. Besides, with how big she was, who'd notice another ten or twelve pounds?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper ripped out a bun with her bare hands and took a big bite. \"F*ck, those are good,\" she said as she licked off the cream cheese that had smeared around her lips. \"I'm so gonna miss these when I'm back on my diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a twinge of guilt and worry in the back of her mind as she thought about that. If her willpower was so weak after not even a full seven days, could she even hope to succeed? Or was she just doomed to eat and eat until she disappeared into her fat? I mean, forget getting her high school body back; at this rate, she wouldn't be able to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I wonder if that's the key, then,\"</i> Piper thought as she devoured her sugary, calorie laden goodies. <i>\"Rather then focusing on losing weight, maybe I should just aim to get in better shape and be more mobile.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper looked down at her couch-crushing body, leaving the furniture underneath almost a mystery. <i>\"Feels like a safe bet my high school bod isn't coming back.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the next question was how to get in better shape? Eating better was obviously the first step, a thought Piper punctuated by stuffing another cinnamon bun into her face. Thinking about her piss-poor willpower, Piper bit her lip as she thought, <i>\"I don't know if I can do that. The other option is working out, but what exercises could I even do? I'm twenty and I can barely walk. Swimming, maybe? But I can't afford the pool fees alongside all my other expenses, and what would people say about me? And if I tried the ocean, I might get my fat ass harpooned, or get sucked out to sea, too weak to swim back...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper's self-defeating thoughts and massive binge were suddenly interrupted. A fast-moving blur made its way into her vision, and launched itself at her before she could even blink. She felt the fat on her right arm, boob, and belly get almost painfully squished in odd ways as the projectile landed, and she barely managed to catch the bakery container before it fell to the floor. The speedy little love-leech gave her a tight squeeze as she happily said, \"Squishy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunter! What have I said about jumping on people!?\" Harper called from the door, still struggling to take her shoes off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Mom,\" Piper said as she wrapped her free arm around Hunter. At least, that's what she thought she said. Piper had stuffed what was left of her pastry into her mouth to free up her left hand, so instead it sounded like, \"Ddds ugh-kay, mm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper swallowed heavily, nearly choking on her gigantic mouthful, but managing to get it down with only a slight cough. \"How come you two are back so soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we were having a good visit with Bubby, but someone was being a little antsy about getting home.\" Harper ruffled that particular \"someone's\" hair as she hugged her bloblike sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, I missed you too, sweetie,\" Piper said as she felt Hunter squeeze her a little tighter. She kissed the top of her younger sister's head, thankful afterwards that she hadn't just accidentally gotten sugar in her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper was extremely close with Hunter. With Harper working two jobs, and Parker alternating between work and play, she was the one who was always at home, looking after her younger sister. Whether it was playing with her, reading to her, keeping her fed and clean, etc., it was always Piper. She hadn't minded at all, more then happy to look after the little bundle of joy. In a lot of ways, Hunter almost felt like her own daughter, a feeling which only got stronger as Piper got fatter. She was somewhat worried that she'd ejected herself from the gene pool, denying her own chance at motherhood. I mean, it's not like she wanted to have kids at twenty, but someday she did, and who'd want to be with someone as big as her? <i>\"And, to quote Austin Powers, literally, how would we do it? I'm so God damn fat, the sheer mechanics are mind-boggling.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow mutual the feelings were became clear when Hunter started to speak and referred to Piper, not Harper, as \"Mommy.\" It had taken her a couple weeks to clear that up, but Piper was pretty certain she'd gotten it sorted out before their Mom heard her middle child called her title. Of course, how she did had led to her rather unfortunate nickname. Parker, the sibling she was still somewhat afraid of, was \"Sissy,\" while her far rounder sister became \"Squishy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Piper was fairly certain she'd kept her Mom from learning her baby saw her middle child as the primary parent, Harper definitely felt like she'd lost a lot of time with her youngest child. Now that she had a single well paying job as opposed to multiple sh*tty ones, Ms. Black was trying to spend more time with Hunter. This weekend at Grandma's was just the latest in her attempts to reconnect with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a process that wasn't always well received. Hunter really wasn't taking any separation from Piper all that well, and although she kept her peace, Piper was also feeling lonely without her constantly around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was also nice to feel needed. Piper had gotten so large that anything more then basic tasks were beyond her capabilities. Between her extreme measurements and how fast her limbs tired out, even washing the dishes could be a trying experience. As time passed and the situation only got worse, the other two Black's had begun to depend on her less and less, though they never made mention of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Harper didn't. Parker did, although she had been bitching about Piper since birth, so this was hardly anything new and unexpected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, though, never cared how big she was, or if it took her longer to accomplish something then her Mom or eldest sister. Whether it was helping her color, reading a book, or just cuddling her to protect her from a thunderstorm, she depended on her completely, and Piper had not been ready for how much of a gap in her life Hunter's absence would entail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's why Piper was overjoyed when Hunter looked up at her and asked, \"Can you he'p me find Chikken Li'l?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper smiled and answered, \"Of course.\" She moved the now empty container to the end table, happy to begin the difficult process of rising once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(A/N: Just to warn you, but I am not comfortable with child gain at all, so please don't expect any.)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harper felt her breath catch in her throat as she watched the long, drawn process her middle child had to do to merely rise. Each slow shuffle forward was punctuated by a heavy jiggle as her fat simultaneously tried to catch up and pull ahead of her deeply buried frame. Already panting by the time she reached the edge of the couch, it took her three attempts to successfully get her feet securely under her elephantine body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire ordeal, including breaks, almost took a full five minutes. At one point, Harper moved to help Piper, but she subtly waved her away, leaving Mom to bite her lip in frustration and worry as the whole scene played itself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she'd risen and caught her breath, which took yet another five minutes, Piper took Hunter's hand in her own right, grabbing her last two cinnamon buns with her left. Harper watched as her youngest led her huge older sister to her room. So slowly was Piper's swaying waddle that she'd managed to consume both pastries before the two had even entered the hallway, and the last thing Harper saw before her upper body disappeared was her middle child sucking her fingers clean of creme cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Piper's enormous butt, crammed into an undersized and fraying pair of sweat shorts, glacially followed the rest of her around the corner, Harper let out a breath that she didn't know she'd been holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Holy Christ, she's gotten so fat.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her Ex had left for the second and final time, Harper's world had promptly fallen to pieces. Now a single Mom with two kids and a third on the way, she'd been impressed with how her two girls stepped up to the plate to help her out. Still, even with both of them helping, it'd barely been enough, and she went straight back to work shortly after Hunter was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hadn't been easy for her to find a job, to be honest. She'd dropped out of high school when her then-boyfriend-now-ex husband had knocked her up, believing him when he claimed he'd be able to support his new family. The two were unfortunately wed before Harper realized that was just one in a sea of lies he routinely told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point, she'd been working two jobs, working as a cashier at Walmart during the day, and the evening shift at a local Hooter's after that. Combine that with her struggles to earn her GED, and Harper hadn't been left with a moment of time for anything else in her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper had been her saving grace through it all. As her Mom fought tooth and nail to get something better for herself and her daughters, Piper became the home maker of the family. No matter how late she came home, the house was clean and orderly, a plate of food or something in the slow cooker was waiting, and Hunter was soundly asleep in her bed as Harper came to give her a kiss goodnight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd been so busy that Piper's gain caught her almost entirely by surprise. It was like one moment Piper was a fast-moving high school student, always on the go and thicc at most. And then, out of the blue, she was chubby, then fat, followed shortly thereafter by becoming <i>really</i> fat. Overnight, Piper was gaining so quickly that, at one point, she was enlarging her wardrobe every other week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn July, she had a pot belly. By August, a sagging, multi-rolled gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Thanksgiving, her booty overhung the sides of her chair. By New Years, she was spread across two chairs, and struggling to fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts had been huge in March. By May, they'd gotten so big that they were interfering with Piper's basic arm movements, and dealing with anything directly in front of her (chopping vegetables, for example) was nearly impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper tried to delicately broach the topic with her daughter, but she was never that successful. Usually, she wussed out, unable or unwilling to ruin what little time she had at home fighting with her not-so-little girl. The few times she had, Piper had been terribly embarrassed, and Harper had always found herself recanting her previous statements. After all, she owed Piper so much. It was just a little bit of weight, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper was really regretting enabling her daughter's spiraling weight gain now, let me tell ya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy Piper gained weight wasn't a great mystery. That woman ate more then the rest of the family combined. Her mealtime portions had grown until they were indescribably huge. She was constantly snacking, and the scale of those snacks always seemed to be on the rise. <i>\"I mean, for Christ's sake, she just ate an entire tray of cinnamon buns as an after-breakfast snack...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking matters worse was a complete and total lack of exercise. Piper typically only walked from her bedroom, to the bathroom, to the door, and back, and that was it. Her daily movement likely wouldn't even total a thousand yards, and none of that any faster then a slow walk. Combine that with a diet that likely broke 10 or 20,000 calories a day, and it was no wonder she'd gotten so huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper really didn't know what to do at this point. Piper was so very big, and showed no signs of slowing down. Worst of all, it was like she couldn't help by enable her even more, as it only seemed to take the slightest bit of pushing by the blobby girl to convince her Mom to get her even more food. <i>\"God, what can I even do...?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper's worried thoughts were cut off by a loud, resounding crash. Harper was already moving down the hallway when Hunter came out. \"Mommy, Mommy,\" she cried out as she took her mother's hand. \"Come see, come see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened!?\" Harper said. She didn't need an answer, as she found out the moment she rounded the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper was currently laying atop the shattered remains of what used to be Hunter's bed. The young woman, red-faced with humiliation, had clearly attempted to sit on the bed, and her gargantuan mass turned out to be well in excess of what the child's bed was capable of supporting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha wzz 'at?\" came the groggy voice of Parker from behind the two Black's. The crash and Harper's shout had clearly woken up the notoriously deep sleeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter giggled as she answered, \"Squishy squashed my bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Piper could have turned redder, she would have after that. She looked every bit the part of a beached whale, and as she ineffectually kicked her fat enshrouded legs and attempted to peer around her towering, sprawling belly, it became quite clear that she wasn't likely to get up on her own without immense difficulty, if at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she realized what happened, Parker let out a snort of laughter. \"Oh, nice going, fat ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Parker!\" Harper shouted. Piper, meanwhile, could only let out a whimper as her belly let out another rumbling growl...</span></div></div>",

Don't forget, Dude, I've been doing this run since they moved in, and she used to be a lot smaller then this. Granted, she was still pretty fat even then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does someone that fat even move!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just barely. Besides, you saw how much she eats. It just keeps going up every time she orders. And if she keeps that up, moving's not going to be her problem for very long...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least she tips well, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** *** ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks... *gasp, pant* ...again,\" Piper said between gulps of air as she closed the door behind the delivery crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper had had a pretty big day by her recent standards. The family's groceries had arrived earlier that day, and it had taken Piper a bit to rise and open the door to let them in. As she was putting them away, another buzz came to the door, announcing the first part of her lunch. And again, just as she was dealing with that, the buzzer sounded off again as the second portion of her lunch had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing on her feet so long was simply torturous, and Piper plopped heavily down on a nearby bench as the door closed, her gargantuan ass overhanging the sides, with her belly reaching dangerously close to floor as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Holy... shit...\"</i> Piper thought as she struggled to catch her breath. She could feel a sheen of sweat spreading on her skin, leaving her rolls slick and shiny looking. She could feel the uncomfortable sensation of liquid pooling between her rolls, currently unable to escape her bountiful layers of firm, heavy fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdding insult to injury, Piper's bottomless belly growled in hunger. She whimpered a little as she reached over to her overloaded cart. Grabbing one of the wrapped burgers from the large bowl on top, she took a massive bite in between her breaths, her taste buds overjoyed at the greasy treat she was consuming. Within a couple of mouthfuls, she'd finished her first burger, and reached for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** *** ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last six months had seen a lot of changes in the life of the Black family. Harper's promotion at work had seen her rise to the position of Confidential Secretary of Lemon Technologies. Her wage had nearly doubled, and for the first time in their lives, the Black women were living in a house that they out-and-out owned. Even the mortgage hadn't been that bad, since the place had been a bit of a fixer-upper, and it had been on the market for some time before she looked at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd though Piper wouldn't dare say it out loud, she was pretty happy that the place was built on a cement pad rather then having a basement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was now in preschool, and was currently having a wonderful time. Always a chatty and gregarious child, she'd made many friends quite quickly, and had developed quite the love of painting and music. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker, for reasons she'd never disclosed to the rest of the family, had taken a few months off work and gone to Columbia. On her return, they saw she'd increased her cup size from an already large D to a whopping Double K. Prying from both Harper and Buby had failed to get any answers from the young woman, though given her recent fixation on spin classes and the fact that she'd really reduced her drinking, the family generally considered recent events a net positive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest gains though, at least in terms of weight, was undoubtedly Piper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the time since she'd crushed Hunter's bed under her enormous tush, Piper's consumption had reached lofty new heights as she buried her weight gain under yet more food. Her daily intake had gone from comfortably full to painfully stuffed, and she continued to grow like a living balloon, her lardy body being steadily inflated by an endless deluge of calories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time her new wardrobe had arrived, she'd already almost outgrown it, forcing her to place an even larger order almost immediately. She'd been so embarrassed that she'd promptly ordered a feast of Chinese food, using the guise that she just wanted to treat the family to a meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper had ordered the Dinner for 12, consuming everything that night no one else had eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her fatty form continued to swell by leaps and bounds, Piper tried desperately to convince herself that everything was fine. <i>\"It's just a bit more weight. I'm already so big, so this is fine. Once that new scale arrives, I'll start dieting again, and get this under control, so I might as well enjoy it now...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that would have required her to have actually ordered the scale, a fact she was dutifully trying to forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper's already poor physical condition worsened in equal measure to her recent gains. Walking from her bedroom to the couch had become quite the hurdle to overcome, and she occasionally needed help to rise after a big meal, which was only becoming a more frequent occurrence over the past few weeks. So far, she hadn't needed help to get out of bed, but she was coming worryingly close to asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact is that Piper's appetite and weight gain were totally out of control, and her body grew and grew and grew...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** *** ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUURRRRRRPPPP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper, having eventually managed to marshal enough strength to move herself back to the living room and assume her natural position, was spread across the couch. Her fat ass stretched from arm of the couch to the other, and her massively oversized arms funneled more greasy food into her limitless maw. Her belly overhung her knees, and pushed up her breasts into her growing second chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ate, Piper heard a loud rip. The sweat pants she'd managed to somehow force her flabby body into had burst a seam from the pressure of her belly, but she didn't slow down her consumption in the slightest. Despite how much she'd eaten, her stomach growled again, urging her to eat more and more and more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper's feast was interrupted as she felt her phone vibrating in her pants pocket. Stuffing a slice of pizza in her mouth, she chewed as she pulled and pushed the many layers of fat between her and her phone. She grunted in triumph as she pulled out her phone, hot and wet from her sweaty body. She stuffed another slice in her mouth as she checked the message. She was so shocked she almost failed to eat it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hey Piper, it's Dakota. I rang the bell, but no one answered. Could you let me in?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper quickly scarfed another slice into her mouth as she thought over the message. What was Dakota doing here? Wait, was she here, or was she at their old apartment? God, did she want to see her?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Piper couldn't help but be taken a little aback when she set eyes on Dakota for the first time in literal years. <i>\"Holy crap, she's gotten big.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypocritical, she knew, given the doughy Texan was still less then half her weight, but it was still shocking. When she'd last seen Dakota, she'd been quite thin. Granted, Miss Johnson had put on a few pounds since she arrived in Daven's Port, but even at the time of The Fight, she had a small pot belly at most. Next to Piper, she'd seemed downright anorexic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, however, it was a whole 'nother story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it hadn't been for her face and hair, Piper wasn't sure she would have recognized her. Even still, her face had noticeably rounded out. Her cheeks had grown into full chipmunk cheeks, and she now had big dimples when she smiled. A double chin now graced her face, and even her neck was a fair bit thicker then the goose neck Piper remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes moved down, rapidly past Dakota's still smallish breasts, to her belly. Unlike Piper's triple-rolled affair, Dakota's gut remained as a single mass with only a slight indent around her belly button. The overdeveloped organ stuck out proudly in front of her, and was wide enough that she couldn't drop her arms straight down her sides anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompared to her lower half, though, her weight gain upstairs might as well have been invisible. Her hips were quite broad, and combined with her thick, jiggly thighs, gave Dakota a heavy waddle as she moved. As she walked by Piper's seat, the raven haired blob got quite an eyeful of her distant friend's biggest feature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota's booty was simply immense. Her cheeks were slightly wider then her hips, stuck out a fair bit behind, and even seemed to be trying to rise up her back. Her love handles and rolls of back fat were nothing to sneeze at, but compared to each wobbly cheek, Piper could barely see them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota lowered herself into the family's loveseat with a grateful sigh. The piece of furniture gave a creak as it took her weighty load, and she wiped off the sweat that was starting to bead on her forehead. She took a swig from a bottle of coke, downing a third of it in a swallow, and giving Piper a good view of her flabby arms crammed into her skin tight sleeves. She covered her mouth and gave a suppressed burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that's better. It's really hot out there. So, how you've been, Piper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper blinked, stuck for words as she took in Dakota's new measurements. Collecting herself, she replied, \"Um, good, I guess. Mostly been busy with work and looking after Hunter. And, you know, I put on... some weight. Like, a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper blushed, and it only got worse as her bottomless gut let out a loud growl. If Dakota noticed, she gave no sign. She rubbed her belly as she said, \"Yeah, I know the feeling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper snorted. \"Not quite to my scale, Dee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota flinched. \"Shit, sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper waved it off, trying to fake more confidence then she felt. \"Don't worry about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But yeah, I've gained a lot. School was brutal, and between dropping my workout routine and stress eating, I kind of ballooned. Finished my program, though, so that's good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congrats. I'm happy for you, Dee,\" Piper said as she absentmindedly unwrapped another burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence dominated the room for a moment, broken only by the sounds of Piper chewing. She was mentally kicking herself for grabbing more food when Dakota finally spoke. \"I've missed you, Pipes. Zack has missed you, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper swallowed her mouthful. \"Yeah, well, I got busy, you know. And our last conversation was a bit... rough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know. We were worried, and weren't really delicate about pointing out the elephant in the room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean that I AM the elephant in the room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dakota flinched, Piper immediately regretted the harshness of her statement. \"F*ck, sorry Dee. I didn't mean it to sound like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't worry. It's been quite a while and stuff.\" Silence pervaded the room for a moment. \"It really got awkward fast, didn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really did,\" Piper said as she leaned over for another slice of pizza. She grunted as she attempted to reach the box, squishing her fat rolls as she tried to stretch to the next box. Dakota, seeing her struggles, got up and moved it closer to Piper. \"Thanks, Dee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Piper said as she chewed, \"What made you come here out of the blue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, beyond missing you and not wanting to lose touch, I finished my nursing papers, and your Mom wanted me to come by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper frowned. \"She wanted you to check me out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and no. My training specifically was as a live-in caretaker, and she said she'd been looking into someone to help you around the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat comment made Piper grimace. Having it confirmed that your own family thought you were almost completely helpless hurt a fair bit. <i>\"I'm actually at the point where Parker is more useful than me. Seriously, friggin' PARKER.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're looking for a job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, and a place to live. I've no savings, my lease is almost up, and I can't really move home. My parents downsized after my brother went to college, so I'd be looking at sleeping on their couch. And getting a job with no experience isn't easy; the only things I've found so far are unpaid internships at a couple different retirement homes. Seriously, you guys hiring me would really help me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you wanted to make sure I was okay with it before you agreed to anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. We didn't part on the best of terms last time, and I was scared if I said yes and just showed up out of nowhere that'd it'd be a disaster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper patted her lardy tits, sending a fatty ripple through her gelatinous blubber. \"And you'd be fine taking care of a fat ass like me? Getting me food, and helping bathe me, and stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pipes, that's literally what I've been trained to do. Besides, it's not like I'm the poster child of moderation,\" she said, giving her blubbery booty a smack. Dakota smiled, but it almost immediately turned to shock. Dakota's wardrobe hadn't kept pace with her gain, leaving her clothes horribly tight. That smack apparently sent one ripple too many through her frame, and her shorts popped their button. Adding insult to injury, the escaping mass of her fatty flesh pushed her fly open with a loud zip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women giggled after a moment of silence. Piper wiped a tear from her eye. \"Well, heh, if you're fine with it, I'd be happy to have you be my personal slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, thanks. You're all heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't I know it. So, you want to pop in a movie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** *** ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota moved into the spare bedroom that weekend. One of the benefits of moving in with an extreme fatty like Piper was that Dee didn't have to continue suffering from her too-tight wardrobe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that came with its own subtle insults. Namely, the clothes Piper wore when she was Dakota's size didn't fit her. The tops were ridiculously loose, especially around the chest. The pants, meanwhile, were far too tight, forcing her to grab Pipe's larger pairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota was far too embarrassed to ask how heavy she was when she wore these. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends decided to celebrate Dakota moving in with a movie marathon and a Chinese feast. They ran out of food around midnight and ordered pizza, keeping the night going until 3 am. Dakota's belly had never been so packed, and Piper was subconsciously enjoying seeing a belly so fat and full of food that wasn't her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter helping Piper to bed, Dakota was getting undressed in her room. She gingerly took off her clothes, noting with shock just how firm her belly was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh God, I'm so stuffed. I can't do that too often; I'm overweight as it is. Well, I'm already pretty fat. It's not like I can get much bigger. And while it might be a little rude, I'll never look big next to Piper, especially with the way she eats. If I didn't know any better, I'd swear she was trying to get fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, it's not like I could ever get that fat, right?\"</i></span></div></div>",

That took for freaking ever,\" Parker replied, releasing Piper's right love handle, causing the blubbery flesh to drop onto her overgrown hip and butt cheek with a wet slap. The sound echoed lightly in the bathroom, and as she waited for the gelatinous wobbling to stop, she asked, \"Remind me again how you managed to convince me to help out with this BS?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota was currently hanging the towels up to dry, and didn't turn around before answering the eldest of the Black girls. \"Because she's your sister, and you love her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker snorted and rolled her eyes. \"Sure, whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, sis. I can just feel the love in the room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, bite me. I can think of a hundred things I'd rather be doing then helping wash and dry your flabby ass.\" Despite the comment's venomous tone, Parker made no attempt to leave her sister and Dakota alone. Though she'd never admit it, she did worry about her sister (at least some of the time). And she also knew that the two women had <i>very</i> little chance of moving Piper if she wasn't there to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota had, by this point, been living with the Black's for a number of months. Her presence was a God-send, in a lot of ways. Harper in particular felt a significant increase in her peace of mind, knowing that Dee was there to see to her daughter's needs when she wasn't. Between her many obligations, she was frequently out of the house or occupied with Hunter, and though Parker had been acting more responsibly lately (which many were convinced was the first sign of the apocalypse), she was certainly not ready to trust her eldest to look after Piper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota also fulfilled other duties in the house. She was the primary cook for the family meals, and often saw to the cleaning when everyone else was at work. She'd even seen to the family laundry a couple of times. Harper had told her a number of times that these sorts of things weren't her job, but Dee wouldn't hear it, telling her she was grateful to them for this job and this was the least she could do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Dakota's presence also had quite the effect on Piper's weight. In some ways, perhaps it had been inevitable. Piper was already supremely gluttonous and lazy, barely moving except to get more food. Once the family homemaker, she'd grown and grown until all but the simplest tasks were beyond her capabilities, generally with long rests required between them. To say she struggled with the cleaning was an understatement. Before Dee had even come to visit her about a job, Piper had already fattened herself so immensely that even standing for an extended length of time was simply torturous, to say nothing of walking even a short distance. Only her appetite and a desperate need to remain more useful then Parker had kept her at least trying to move around and do things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota moving in had removed even that rather paltry bit of exercise from Piper's day. She now had no more chores to worry about. She no longer had to choose between rising and walking, or going without food, since Dakota would bring it to her with no effort expended on her part. The only reasons she had to get up anymore was either to go to bed, or to make a trip to the bathroom, and now she always had someone present to help her move. Piper didn't even have her job to distract her anymore, as she'd been laid off due to budget cutbacks recently.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And so, with nothing left to hinder her bottomless maw, Piper had surrendered to her out of control appetite, and daily stuffed herself silly from sun up to sundown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper, already huge, had grown truly vast over the last several months. Her gargantuan, tri-rolled belly tumbled over and between her splayed knees in an avalanche of fat. It hung perilously close to the floor when she was seated on her shower stool, and when she was sitting on their living room couch, rested and spread out upon it. It was an ever-hungry mass of stretchmarks and cellulite, clear signs of her rapid and massive gain, though Dakota and Parker tried to deal with the worst of the marks via cocoa butter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts were enormous, doughy things, sloping off the sides of her belly as gravity did its dirty work. The only thing comparable that Parker could think of was a pair of jumbo-sized beach balls, with all the consistency of lightly-warmed Crisco. They constantly hindered Piper's arm movements, and seemed intent at times to either pin her arms under their mass, or run into her arm pits, depending on where she was sitting at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer back was a mess of fatty rolls in turn. Her shoulders had grown into shapeless, blubbery masses, leading into a series of sprawling rolls that could only be described as oozing across one another. Her love handles were by far the worst, so overgrown and so massive that it took two people in order to clean the flesh between them and Piper's ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of her ass, her hips and cheeks had thickened so much and protruded so far, that even her heaving, rumbling gut couldn't fully cover it when she was seated. Her lardy thighs were as broad as a barrel, and smashed into each other with such intensity that Piper was forced to waddle like an A frame those few times she moved. Even her calves had become thick with fat, and Parker could only look at the rolls covering her ankles that she'd had to pull away in order to swab out not too long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Piper's face, which had resisted her weight gain with such tenacity for so long, had at last given up the struggle as her body scrambled for yet more places to stuff such a deluge of calories. She now had a firm, drooping double chin to go along with her growing chipmunk cheeks, and even her neck had thickened, leaving a small roll forming just behind her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper had evolved into a sprawling mass of quivering lard, drooping under the force of gravity and seemingly expanding by the day. Her physical aptitude had fared about as well as her physical shape. Piper grew red in the face as she thought back to when she'd weighed herself with Parker's help. She'd been 597 pounds then, unarguably the fattest person she knew and liable to get winded walking across the house. Her current weight was unknown, as they'd yet to purchase a scale big enough to weigh her, but she'd grown so huge and useless since, that she couldn't help but feel she'd been practically <i>athletic</i> by comparison to now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota, having finished hanging the towels, turned back to her planetary charge. \"Okay, Pipes. Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure,\" Piper said, holding out her hands nervously. She hadn't moved unaided in at least a few months, and in the past six weeks, the process had grown incredibly dicey. Parker's presence was now a virtual requirement, and even then, it was a damned near thing at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Piper. You can do this.\" The other two women each grabbed one of Piper's hands and braced their legs. \"Okay, on a count of three?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three. Heave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dakota and Parker pulled with all their might, Piper added her own laughable strength to the mix with a loud, pained groan. Her legs shook as she tried to make her deeply buried muscles obey, and for a long moment, she was worried that her fatty frame had remained pinned to the stool it hid within its depths. However, slowly, painfully, she rose to her shuddering legs, her opulent deposits of heaving flesh doing everything in their power to remain firmly planted, only jiggling slightly in response to her herculean efforts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a seeming eternity, though it was likely less then a minute or two, Piper was at last upright, already breathing heavily from the effort. Dakota and Parker promptly put one her arms around each of their shoulders. Much like the rest of her body, they'd bloated massively over the course of her gain. Bigger around then Parker's waist, they left her friend and sister's heads encased in blubber. Even with the two helping support her, Piper could already feel her legs beginning to quake, and she leaned into her nurse and sister a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, see? That wasn't so bad. First try this time,\" Dakota said, breathing heavily in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper could only grimace and nod. \"Uh huh,\" she said, feeling a wobble pass through her grossly overfed body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could we hurry this up a little, please!? She ain't exactly light!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Piper. Ready? Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne step at a time, the trio slowly plodded forward. Piper could only move in a slow shuffle due to the extreme quantity of lard weighing her down and obstructing her movements, and each heavy footfall sent another trembling shudder through her vast reserves of blubber. Squeezing through doors presented a particular challenge to the obscenely obese young woman, and she was eternally grateful that whoever had built this house seemed to have a thing for unusually large pocket doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, first Parker and then Dakota had to squeeze through, half drowned in Piper's fat. They made their way down the hall, one slow step at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper was panting quite heavily by this point. The trembling in her legs was getting worse by the second, and just when she was worried she was about to collapse any moment, Dakota at long last said, \"Okay, we're almost there. Side shuffle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper almost collapsed in relief right there, but she forced herself to move until she was aimed for the dead center of the couch. And, at long last, the three could slowly lower Piper onto their long-suffering couch. Piper let out a sigh of relief as she felt her ass slide into its traditional groove. \"Thank God. So glad that's over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker popped her back with a groan. \"Me too. Next time, hire piano movers to deal with this shit. They're used to moving heavy crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper somehow got even redder in the face, and opened her mouth to respond. However, she was interrupted by a loud rumble of desperate hunger from her stomach, punctuated with a light burp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer look of anger turned to one of embarrassment. Parker merely rolled her eyes. \"Oh, of course. Might as well make the problem worse, right, fat ass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Parker!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** *** ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what happens now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Choice 1:</b> Piper's weight isn't the only one out of control. An endless deluge of snacking with Miss Black is catching up with our favorite tubby nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Choice 2:</b> Zack comes to visit his two best friends, and is seeing Piper for the first time since she was a mere slip of a girl at only 340 pounds. This should be GRAND.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Choice 3:</b> Left blank for whatever else someone may have in mind.</span></div></div>",

Just because it's summer doesn't mean you can sleep all day, lazy bones!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Harper Black called outside Piper's bedroom.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh god, she's trying to kill us. There's no other explanation. She is trying to kill us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lazy said from inside her head. Lazy, looked much like the Piper Black everyone else saw, but a few key details marked her out. She was covered in the biggest, baggiest gray sweatshirt and sweatpants. The sweatshirt had her name, 'LAZY' emblazoned in big black letters in front of it. Her black hair was split and frayed. She had exaggerated bags under her eyes and her skin was pale. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI vote we stay in bed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou <i>always</i> vote to stay in bed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Whined Fat. Fat was the youngest. She looked like, ten years old. Back in the day, Fat ran thing in Piper's head, until that age. But for the past 8 years, all of the others conspired together to keep Fat in check. Maybe that's why her looks never progressed beyond that point. Maybe she was just immature. But either way, Fat always schemed and conspired to get back to her former heights of power she'd known during Piper's 'chubby phase.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The very word 'Fat' was emblazoned in red letters stretched along a too tiny T-Shirt that failed to even make it half way down her round blubbery boulder of a belly, and tucked beneath that was an unbuttoned pair of Jeans that inevitably left angry red marks in her tummy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe should get up! Maybe Mom made breakfast! And if she didn't, that's just an excuse to have Pop-Tarts for breakfast!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI vote we stay in bed too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Horny said. If Fat was the most childish of them, Horny was the most...adult. She was taller, and leggier than any of them, and the only one of them that could fit into a pair of skinny jeans, which she wore with a <i>very</i> deep cut black V-neck halter top. Like the others, she had her name written on her clothing. Unlike the others she had it written somewhere you couldn't actually see it with her clothes ON. She chewed on her index finger. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was having the best dream about x...and that new girl we just met, Dakota? At the same time!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She purred with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cGross, and also stupid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Greedy cut in. Lately, Greedy had started to put on a white office shirt, a pair of black slacks, and a black tie. The tie was a clip-on, but she said it make her 'look professional.' Her name was marked with a little card clipped to her breast pocket that said  <i>'Hello, how can I help you? My name is: <b>Greedy</b>.'</i> And lately, Greedy had a one track mind. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNobody is going to want to sleep with your gross ass when you're eating government cheese.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe government will just <i>give you</i> cheese?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fat asked, wide eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot the point here, Fat! The point is, we need to get off our ass and get a J-O-B Job. Which we'd <i>have</i> by now, if this bitch didn't keep getting in the way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She said, jabbing her finger into Lazy's chest causing her tits to wobble. Lazy never put on a bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, don't pick on me. I just got up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lazy protested meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorny just crossed her arms under her chest, causing her boobs to roll up over her arms and rolled her eyes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo we have a tie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, in the real world, Piper Black just groaned and tossed and turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPiper Black you get out here this instant. I did not yell and scream in agony for eight hours to bring you into this world so you could sleep in until noon!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Harper yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreedy grinned, seeing an angle to work. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou like that, Horny?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She asked, leaning in close and taking the taller emotion in by wrapping an arm around her shoulder. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou like the visual of our mom shooting a wet baby out of her...you know? Does that get you in the mood? Maybe have her join in your little threesome?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorny sighed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFine. We'll get out of bed...\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vote tilted in favor of 'getting up' and so Piper Black started the laborious process of getting out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOK, so first thing we should do, we should get in the shower, and then brush our teeth so we can look our best for the day ahead--\u00e2\u0080\u009d Greedy started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo we can attract boys? And girls?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo Horny, so we can attract employers. Employers with big, meaty...paychecks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLazy started sulking into a depression, realizing this day was not going her way, and Greedy was going to call all the shots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u00e2\u0080\u009cI WANT BREAKFAST!\u00e2\u0080\u009d</b> Fat shouted loud enough that the others had to cover their ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOK, but let's just get a shower first and then we'll get--\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u00e2\u0080\u009cI WANT BREAKFAST!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\nLazy smirked. Maybe Greedy wouldn't call all the shots today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper ate an entire box of Pop-tarts for breakfast, and got int the shower.</span></div></div>",

Lazy was still sulking and Fat seemed to be going along with the plan\u2026 until Piper Black walked to the bus stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe butterball, quietly licking her fingers until then, suddenly perked up. \u201cOoooh, look! This bus goes to D's Donuts! I wanna donuts! <b>I wanna donuts!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else rolled their eyes. \u201cFat, stop!\u201d \u201cYou seriously need to grow up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you let me have my way more often, I would.

No, no, no, no,\u201d despaired Greedy. \u201cWe need money. Dinero, cash, dough! Horny, how many hot chicks have you seen in D's Donuts?

DO-ZEN DO-NUTS!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! This is all wrong\u2026\u201d Greedy tried to halt them but Piper already boarded the wrong bus. A couple stops later she waltzed into the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Madi!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to D's Donuts, Piper! Glad to see you again!\" a plump girl greeted her cheerfully from the counter. \u201cWhat will it be today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026 \u201d Piper hesitated while Greedy tried to overturn the decision one last time \u2013 in vain. \u201c\u2026a baker's dozen, some apple-filled, glazed\u2026\u201d she repeated what Fat was telling her to order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect. And here's your thirteenth, on the house. That'll be ten ninety,\u201d Madi leaned forward to pass them to Piper, her belly spreading on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Piper swiped her credit card and went to pick up the donuts when the terminal beeped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh, sorry, Piper? I'm afraid your card seems to be\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell, no...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Piper's head, Greed triumphed. \u201cSee? What did I tell you?! We \u2013 need \u2013 cash! Let's leave the donuts here and look for work!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWork?\u201d Lazy shuddered, \u201cyou wanna kill us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorny wrinkled her pretty forehead. \u201cWait! Didn't that guy in the bar yesterday leave us a tenner? In should still be in the purse,\u201d and Piper started rummaging inside. \u201cSee? Crisis solved.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSolved? You call this solved?\u201d fumed Greedy while Piper brought her donuts to a booth. \u201cWe just spent our last money on a heap of empty calories! And if we eat it all, we'll be too sluggish to do anything else today\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d sighed Lazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to pack it up, take the rest of donuts home and start looking for employers\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI WANNA DOZEN DONUTS!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Piper munched happily away, unaware of the struggle that went on in her subconscious. It wasn't her first binge at D's Donuts, in fact she'd recently become something of a regular here, stretching her stomach. But still, thirteen donuts was a lot\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her head, discussion was slowly losing volume as everyone was getting lethargic, sprawled on their couches. Greedy made it one last attempt before they fell asleep. \u201cGirls, seriously, we need to get money. We're broke! And I saw a very interesting advert yesterday. Some rich lawyer's looking for a secretary. I was trying to steer you there from the beginning. The salary's huge! And\u2026\u201d she switched gears, realising money aren't going to appeal to other aspects of Piper's personality, she tried different angles. \u201cwe could afford donuts every day, we'd be just taking phones and looking pretty all day long plus the lawyer might even be cute!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHah, fat chance,\u201d snorted Horny. \u201cIn fact, if we really need money so much, why not find ourselves a sugar daddy? Or mommy? Remember that tenner from yesterday? And that was just for a bit of touching.

As she collapsed on the bench, her tummy spilled out of the blouse and rolled over the hem of her skirt. She looked around uncertainly. Where should she go next? She yawned. All that food in her stomach was making her want to curl up and sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her head, the four-way tug of war was not yet over but its protagonists were getting sleepy too. \u201cLook, we simply <i>have</i> to get a job,\u201d argued Greedy, sprawled on her own upscale pink settee. \u201cWe can't just sit here all day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Lazy yawned too, imitating their person. \u201cI'm all in favor.\u201d She stretched on her bed, unkempt and dirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause we need that taste-tester job, like Greedy said,\u201d Fat lounged on her overstuffed futon, belly up. \u201cBut there's nothing wrong in resting our feet first. We need to digest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, no, no! We are going to that lawyer's office, is that clear?\u201d Greedy looked around and sighed. \u201cWe need a fifth aspect and fast, otherwise we'll always end up tied.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, girls, girls, but we don't need a job! We're sexy, right?\u201d Horny chimed in from her blood-red sofa. \u201cLet's go to the yesterday's bar again and find ourselves a sponsor, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that what you call it now, you s-?\u201d Greedy's tirade was interrupted by rhythmical snoring. \u201cAnd Lazy's out. Now that takes the cake!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCake? What cake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't play stupid, Fat. In fact\u2026\u201d Greedy paused, a malicious smile forming on her face. \u201cWith that lazybone out, we might finally come to an agreement. Listen, the lawyer's\u2026\u201d she paused to think, then went to retrieve a memory ball from the bank. \u201c'James Phillip Williams the Third, 30 years, of Briscombe, Frisch and Williams, at a newly established branch office.' So he's likely the grandson of the founder and I bet he's ripped from all that rowing they do at posh universities. You'll like him, Horny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHardly,\u201d Horny snorted but she snatched the memory for herself, trying to get more info out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou'll never know until you see him. Let's just go have a look at him, OK? And if Horny doesn't like him, we can try the taste testing next. Right, Fat? So, who's in favor?\u201d Greedy stood up and approached the control panel, looking hopefully at her counterparts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two let out an exasperated sigh. \u201cOK, fine!\u201d just in time for Piper to jump up and board the right bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting off in the Business District, Piper was lost. This was terra incognita, enemy territory for her. She wandered uncertainly along the street, unsure where to look for the office. She was getting sleepy\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 just like her guides. In fact, Fat was already fast asleep, snoring in a duet with Lazy, and Horny was not far off. Only Greedy struggled to remain vigilant. She peered around once again and pointed. \u201cOh, look! There it is! Let's go!\u201d Among two dozen other plaques on the wall of an office building, there was a discreet sign announcing <b>Briscombe, Frisch and Williams, est. 1886; Daven's Port Branch Office</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper smoothed out her blouse over her bulging waist and entered through the glass double door. As she approached the concierge, she tried to suck her tummy in. \u201cHello, I'm here for the secretary job at Williams, uh, I mean\u2026\u201d she trailed out uncertainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d The man didn't even look at her, just pointed at the elevator. \u201cFourth floor and turn left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, thanks.\u201d as Piper punched the button, her hand shook a little. This was her big chance, no wonder she was getting nervous. Upstairs another discreet sign steered her to a nondescript door. She rang and a speaker on the wall came to life. \u201cWho's there?\u201d a male barytone asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, P-Piper Black, uh, for, for the interview.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, good. I'm buzzing you in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper nervously swallowed and stepped in. What was her future boss going to look like, supposing she got the job? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Guys loved her\u2014especially the types of guys to throw extravagant parties for no reason other than the weekend. She and her gaggle of woo girls were welcome guests to almost every partier in Daven\u2019s Port.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the parties that no one saw coming, like this one, that threw her for a loop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho would have ever guessed that the owner of the Hammond Hotel open up its doors to the top floor and let them all act like animals? Skylight Heights (or some stupid shit, whatever they were calling it) was an official, sanctioned event hosted by the owner of the hotel that came with a thumping bass you could feel ten floors down from the rooftops and enough alcohol to fill the Wharf. Young people were lining up at the doors, and Parker was no exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, she might have met the owner? She was some young, big-nosed snob. Squeakiest voice, super annoying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, that\u2019s not the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hotel\u2019s main event was hosted on the top floor and divided into two sections. The portion of the floor that was inside served as the dance floor, and the remaining high ceilings of the hotel\u2019s opulent design meant that it had killer acoustics and plenty of room for stage lighting, as well as the bar. Outside, in the \u201cskylight\u201d portion of the sanctioned soir\u00e9e, was a bar with a smaller selection and more sitting areas, as well as a catering table to match the spread inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis Hammond lady really went all out when it came to party favors. The pill choice was shit (<i>legal</i> parties tended to be that way, she guessed) but the booze and the food was sublime. Parker had never eaten so much at a party. And all of it was covered by her cover charge\u2014she could really pig out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich got substantially easier the more she drank. And boy could Parker drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friends, Tina and Carlie, had ditched her at some point. They were <i>probably</i> still here? Either way, Parker had a Lyft home. It didn\u2019t matter too terribly much. Just eat \u2018til she barfed, drink \u2018til she could barely walk, and try not to manage to fall over the high railing somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo anyway, it was a little difficult to point out exactly <i>when</i> they\u2019d met. But it had for sure been at the concessions table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker wobbled over to the spread for the billionth time that night, her knees weak and her head swimming with liquor. She\u2019d kept her plate from her first venture over, and it bore the stains of grease and sauces and the like. She did her best to hold onto it, in her stupor, thinking that it would steady her. She was drunk and she was hungry\u2014though she had no right to be the latter. Her mostly flat stomach domed underneath her little black dress, stretching the sleek material to its limit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, watch it.\u201d Someone yelled as Parker hip-checked them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wash it.\u201d Parker whipped her head back dramatically, and then back once more, \u201cFuckin\u2019 throw you off the ceiling. Roof.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker was not an especially nice girl, that much was for sure. Luckily for her, everyone around her wasn\u2019t looking for nice. They were looking for booze, fun, and to have a good time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne guest, however, was looking for <i>food</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Parker\u2019s life, she had often dealt with people over a certain size. Some of the best parties in town were thrown by these two fatties named Hurley and Yanira, and those were <i>great</i> if you were just looking to get absolutely fucking trashed on tequila and jello shots. But as we\u2019ve mentioned before, Parker was not an especially nice girl. And to the big blonde blimp eclipsing her vision of the hot dog table, Parker saw no reason to start pulling her punches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey whale-load, beach issat way.\u201d Parker pointed somewhere North, \u201cSave some fuckin\u2019 hot dogs fer the ressofus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOcean\u2019s that way.\u201d The big girl turned and pointed towards the shore, \u201cWonderful execution. Great stuff. You want a hot dog?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck yeah I d\u2014urRRRP!\u201d Parker belched loudly as she tried to step past the blonde\u2019s spectacular girth<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d been talking to a girl about her age, maybe a little younger, but almost four times her size. She had this enormous stomach, poured into (and at parts, over) her long black party dress. Her legs were hidden by the flow of her gown, but Parker could make out the large amounts of ass spreading it out on either side. Her fat face and round cheeks were contoured with a decent amount of effort, but there was no \u201cblending\u201d or \u201cmasking\u201d the definitive double chin that hung down from her neck. Smiling, her dimples deep, the girl passed Parker a hot dog. And then another one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know the girl who threw the party, and trust me, she\u2019d want you to have two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker, drunk off her ass, was flabbergasted at the slight show of affection and appreciation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you!\u201d she said stupidly, \u201cWh-you\u2019re so fuckin\u2019 nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne of my many amazing qualities, for sure.\u201d She said with a smile, \u201cI\u2019m Mel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM\u2019Parker.\u201d The busty booze hound slurred, gnoshing on a hot dog already, \u201cAn\u2019\u2026 I approve this hot dog.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the party was over, which wasn\u2019t until <i>late</i>, Parker still hadn\u2019t sobered up. She\u2019d gone and gotten blackout drunk (the Parker Black special, as her stupid little sister called it) and barely remembered a thing. She didn\u2019t know how she got home, she didn\u2019t know where her friends were, and she may or may not have lost her shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But</i> one thing was for sure\u2014even drunk off her ass, Parker vaguely remembered the really, really fat girl that gave her two hot dogs and sat with her while she was drunk. They\u2019d talked for a little bit more, she was sure, but the rest of the night was a complete and total blur. It wasn\u2019t often that people were actually nice to Parker when she got all obnoxious. It stuck out, and it meant a lot more than she might have otherwise let on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing to, as best she could anyway, she kept that thought in mind when she woke up...</span></div></div>",

So your average morning after a real rager for sure. For the brief moments that Parker dared to open her eyes (before she\u2019d pressed her face deep into a throw pillow) she recognized that she was not in her bedroom, or even at home. This wouldn\u2019t have been the first time that this had happened, for sure, but those times usually didn\u2019t end particularly well for her. One time she wound up all the way in Hesper\u2014getting her Mom to foot the bill for <i>that</i> walk of shame almost didn\u2019t happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d a new voice rang in Parker\u2019s ears, \u201cAre you awake? Can we have our couch back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a loud groan and throwing the pillow off to the side, Parker struggled to wriggle her way to a half-seated position. There was a girl, kind of fat, looming over her. Her long red hair fell and brushed against Parker\u2019s face\u2014the slight sensation enough to make her want to vomit\u2014but at least she had the common decency to stand in front of the light. Parker winced and shielded her eyes with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey m\u2019like havin\u2019 a rough morning, \u2018kay?\u201d Parker mumbled, her sharp tongue dulled by dehydration and motion sickness, \u201cThink you could keep standing there but, like, not be so fucking loud?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of biting back, the chunky redhead just dipped out slightly and exposed Parker to the full force of the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGODDAMMIT.\u201d Parker shut her eyes tight, \u201cFucking <i>fuck</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like our patient\u2019s finally awake!\u201d came a much more familiar voice, followed by heavy footsteps and the sound of the front door closing, \u201cAmy, thanks for making sure she didn\u2019t choke on her own vomit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny time.\u201d She said, catching a biscuit as it bounced off her prominent chest, \u201cYou made sure to get me two this time, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah yeah.\u201d Mel\u2019s chunky arm dug deep into the smaller bag she\u2019d pulled Amy\u2019s breakfast from, \u201cParker? Think you\u2019re up for some breakfast?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker braved the bright light and forced herself to look towards the sound of Mel\u2019s voice. Sure enough, there she was, big enough to eclipse the whole doorway. She was still wearing the makeup from last night, but she\u2019d changed. Now she had on a big (big, big <i>big</i>) t-shirt and scrubs that managed to bury her figure. She looked bigger than Parker remembered last night, that much was for certain. With her hair up, chubby cheeks flaring out, and smuggling what had to have been at least fifty bucks\u2019 worth of Bojangles and drinks, it didn\u2019t really help reconcile the image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Parker asked gruffly, \u201cM\u2019sorry, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBuh-rek-fast.\u201d Amy plopped down on the armchair next to Parker\u2019s couch, \u201cMost important meal of the day? Today\u2019s choice of carbs and chicken?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh fuck no.\u201d Parker\u2019s burps still smelled like raspberry schnops, \u201cI\u2019ll fucking puke.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you <i>sure</i>?\u201d Mel wobbled heavily, her footsteps muted on the more solid flooring inside of their dorm, \u201cYou know, biscuits are bread. Bread absorbs alcohol. It\u2019s like eating saltines and water, except it\u2019s more fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker steepled her knees so as to allow Mel room to sit her huge self down, and even then, she wound up with the top part of her feet submerged underneath Mel\u2019s massive ass. With a grunt, she reached one meaty arm over the huge airbags that were her breasts and placed what Parker would later guess to be her portion of the breakfast binge on the end table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got water?\u201d Parker asked, weakly taking a biscuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got Sprite!\u201d Mel said with a dimpling smile, \u201cIt\u2019s better for your hangover anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d The dehydrated diva managed to take a little nibble before slurping down her soda<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs mentioned previously, this would hardly be the first time that Parker had wound up in someone\u2019s dorm room. She\u2019d seen enough of them to know that this one was in Stuffington U, about an hour out of DP. <i>Plenty</i> of parties used to be thrown here, before all the people she knew in high school graduated. Granted, this was the first time she\u2019d woken up here hungover <i>without</i> some half-drunk frat guy next to her in his bed. But being rescued by this whale was almost just as embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better listen to Mel.\u201d Amy said with a happy slurp of her sweet tea, her first biscuit already half gone, \u201cShe <i>knows</i> about biscuits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLiterally the Biscuit Queen.\u201d Mel\u2019s second chin creased into a third as she smiled and gave her fleshy flanks a squeeze, \u201cCarbs are life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRiiiight.\u201d Parker would have rolled her eyes if it wouldn\u2019t have made her puke, \u201cSo, like\u2026 you guys party a lot?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, not <i>really</i>.\u201d Amy made a face, \u201cYesterday was Mel\u2019s birthday, and she knew the owner, so she got us in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow the fuck old are you people?\u201d Parker asked, aghast<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEighteen.\u201d Amy chirped helpfully from her seat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEighteen.\u201d Mel burped, \u201cNineteen now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoly fuck she\u2019d been rescued by some toddlers. At the ripe old age of twenty-two, this was embarrassing. These girls barely partied and they\u2019d had to come to her rescue. They were her <i>sister\u2019s</i> age. What the fuck were they even doing partying when they could be staying home watching cartoons or whatever the fuck children did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid the woman who\u2019d been partying just as hard since sophomore year of high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, these girls were <i>way</i> too young to be so fat. Amy was like, normal fat. The kind of fat that girls like Parker made fun of in high school. Mel was\u2026 Mel was fucking huge, man. How does someone even <i>get</i> that big? Even when Piper was fat, she never got nearly as big as this fucking pig scarfing down biscuits next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJesus Christ.\u201d Parker held her head in her hands, \u201cI gotta get out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we took an Uber back here.\u201d Mel said nonplussed, \u201cSo I can\u2019t exactly drive you back to your car.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, they thought she had a car. Like an adult. That was neat. At least they thought she had her life more together than it actually was. Stupid kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight.\u201d Parker lied, \u201cI came with my friends, Carlie and Tina.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd her mom had dropped them off, but that was neither here nor there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I don\u2019t exactly have a ride.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I guess you\u2019re stuck with us for a while.\u201d Amy snorted as she picked her thick legs up into the chair, sitting with her knees to her impressive chest, \u201cWe\u2019ve got class in like two hours. Mel, you wanna try and sneak her into the cafeteria so we can get lunch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, fuck that, I\u2019ll just\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s <i>freeeee</i>~\u201d Mel tapped her Stuffington ID card on the wall, produced from somewhere in that valley of cleavage, \u201cCome on. A little lunch, and then you can call your friends to come pick you up. Plus, you look like shit no offense. You could stand to get some rest and some food in you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker took a contemplative bite of her biscuit, a little bigger than the last, and a sip of her Sprite to help wash it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker cocked a black eyebrow at the concept, her Poor Kid Instincts\u2122 outweighing her sense of better judgement, and the throbbing in her head. Sure, she felt like she wanted to puke right now. But maybe not in three hours. She\u2019d bounced back from worse hangovers. And plus, these fatties were going to pay for her breakfast <i>and</i> let her use their student card to get into the cafeteria here. That was <i>way</i> better than the pump and dumps she was used to after waking up in this kind of situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFree, you say?\u201d Parker smiled, \u201cI think I could do lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And while Harper had to admit that she wasn't <i>quite</i> in the shape she assumed she'd always be in after high school, she also didn't think she looked awful!  Sure, Harper couldn't lie:  Her body jiggled more than it ever had before, and <i>yes</i>, after she had her (beautiful perfect shining light) baby, her hips were <i>still</i> too wide to shove into any of her old pants, and <i>sure</i>, none of her bras actually fit her anymore, and <i>fine</i>, her addiction to sweets hadn't curbed in the several months after she gave birth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcuses are easy to make when you blame hormones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Harper was feeling good!  Her two, lovely, wonderful daughters were splitting baby duty (Piper was usually more than happy to, Parker was more than happy to whine at every opportunity, but they both still lived under her roof, <b>dammit</b>, so she could shove it) which meant Harper got plenty of opportunities to go out and... Well, do what a woman in her late thirties could do, which was get drinks with her coworkers and awkwardly hit on men who looked to be in her age range!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for the most part, it was awesome!  Harper wasn't dumb, she knew that despite having three kids, she was an attractive woman.  The extra pounds weren't doing her a lot of favors, but between her first two daughters loudly fighting, and her newborn crying, she didn't really have a whole bunch of time to go outside and jog, or whatever people did to lose weight (Harper's astounding lack of knowledge regarding a dietary stable and physical activity lifestyle didn't help her lose pounds either).  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, to her credit, post-pregnancy hormones were a beast unto themselves.  It wasn't rare for Harper to wake up in the morning, stagger to the kitchen, and find herself making a hearty, healthy breakfast consisting of Frosted Flakes with chocolate milk (and chocolate syrup), along with a grittle of nothing but bacon and a nice tall glass of coffee that consisted of 50% cream and a hearty splash of caramel.  While she didn't quite recall what she had been munching down on while she was <i>actually</i> pregnant, she did recall more than once morning where she just ate an inhuman amount of donuts.  Like... <i>Way</i> too many.  An alarming amount of donuts (usually frosted, sometimes with sprinkles).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, now that she was several months away from pregnancy, it occurred to Harper that maybe blaming the hormones wasn't exactly... Accurate.  However...</span></div></div>",

It was one of the rare occasions where all three of the Black women were up and about. Harper on her way to work, Piper getting ready for her shift at the movie theatre, and Parker\u2026 was just up early. It was the perfect time for such an announcement, given that all concerned parties were present. But at the same time\u2026 was there ever really a good time to announce such a thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean <i>we</i>?\u201d Parker curled her lip as she bit into her Pop Tart<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean <i>we</i>.\u201d Harper put her hands firmly on her hips, a little jiggle rippling throughout her supple shape, \u201cAs in you, me, and your sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper\u2014who had just scarfed an entire mouthful of Captain Crunch\u2014looked up guiltily from her bowl. Then to her mother, Hunter in the high chair, and back to her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy to put babies on diets.\u201d Piper said obliviously, \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be just a little chunky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper rolled her eyes. Hunter may have supposed to have had a little extra puppy fat, but she definitely wasn\u2019t. Nearly six months after the birth of her third (and final!) daughter, and Harper was still lugging around an extra thirty pounds of fluffy fat. It hung from every inch of her, making her boobs hang lower, her tummy softer, her hips wider. It was like she was still pregnant! Except instead of a little bundle of joy, she was retaining maple syrup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery funny, Piper.\u201d Harper rolled her eyes and crossed her arms underneath her heavy chest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBuhbuh!\u201d Hunter squealed from her seat, slapping her hands on the plastic counter\u2014Piper immediately darted to cleaning up the slight spill she made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, even the baby thinks it\u2019s a dumb idea.\u201d Parker scoffed, staring at her Instagram feed, \u201cAnd she\u2019s, like, not even two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cParker, she\u2019s not even one.\u201d Piper interjected, playing peek-a-boo with her smaller sister<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven better.\u201d The older sister said with a scarfing bite of her tart, \u201cIf you want to lose weight just go to the gym. That\u2019s what I do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate to agree with Parker on this one Mom, but\u2026\u201d Piper sat back down in her chair, \u201cDiets are dumb.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Harper puffed her chest out proudly, \u201cTell that to those tummies you two have been growing lately!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true. While no one had put on quite as much as the matriarch of the family, neither of the Black daughters were faring as fit as they had been this time last year. The stress of a newborn and a still hormonal mother was enough to get to anyone, but Harper\u2019s cravings had kept the house filled with junk food! With nothing else to snack on, it was only understandable that Parker had put on a good fifteen pounds, and Piper about twenty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSitting on your butts all day.\u201d Harper poked Piper in the little pot belly she\u2019d grown<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys need to diet just as much as I do!\u201d Harper pinched Parker\u2019s arm\u2014a little extra give going a long way in the eyes of the vain twenty-two year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls hung their heads, embarrassed and fondled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought!\u201d Harper said confidently, her chest puffing out proudly and pushing her blouse up ever so slightly over her olive-brown pot, \u201cSo starting today no more junk food. Parker, your job while we\u2019re at work is to clean this place out of anything unhealthy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhaaaat?\u201d Parker whined, \u201cMom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! Don\u2019t Mom me. It\u2019s not gonna work this time, porky.\u201d Harper kissed her daughter on the forehead, \u201cI expect this pantry to be cleaned out by the time I get back from work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither daughter seemed particularly enthused\u2014who could blame them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I really didn\u2019t want to pull this card, but I <i>did</i> just have a baby.\u201d Harper said flatly, her stance loosening and her girth widening, \u201cI could really use the support of my otherwise very helpful, very generous, very <i>not-homeless</i> daughters\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the Black sisters sighed in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d Harper perked back up, \u201cSee you guys tonight~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only she had known what she had signed herself up for when she walked out that door\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wasn't so bad, as far as bosses went. She was Yeng's official on staff Psychiatrist, which meant she went out of her way to look after the emotional wellbeing of all her fellow employees, including Harper her new secretary. \u201cHow's the kids?\u201d She asked, putting her coat up on a rack next to Harper's desk, and the entrance to her own private office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA pain. I wish they'd all stay cute and...unable to argue, like Hunter.\u201d She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't we all.\u201d Helen nodded in knowing agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have kids, Dr. Schwartz?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAch, nein.\u201d Helen sighed. \u201cI am too busy taking care of my patients. Ah, speaking of which.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed her briefcase on Harper's desk and opened it up. She fished around and came up with a plain sealed plastic, marked only with a number 'MU-77'. Harper had learned in her time here that that was a Yeng Snack getting passed around for internal testing. \u201cI was just down to see Dr. McCarthy. She has these new Chocolate Peanutbutter balls, and I know how much you like Chocolate and Peanut Butter and so--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDr. Schwartz...Helen, look I appreciate that. I really do but uh...\u201d Harper reached down and jiggled her side rolls for emphasis. \u201cI'm on a diet. So...no more sampling products for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, oh! Well that was just what I was about to get to. That's the <i>best</i> part. They're appetite suppressants! They're made to stop food cravings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut...they're chocolate peanutbutter balls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly. To...satisfy your emotional and mental satisfaction. If we just gave you a pill, you'd feel miserable even if you weren't hungry. Instead, when you feel a temptation to overeat....\u201d Helen held the ball up to guide Harper to reach her eye. \u201cLook at me Harper.\u201d Harper was momentarily entranced. Helen had the most beautiful, almost scintillating green-brown eyes. She could lose herself in them. They were like gemstones with infinite facets. Like a swirling kaleidoscope.  <i><b>\u201cWHEN YOU FEEL TEMPTED TO EAT, TAKE ONE OF THESE. AND YOU CAN BE CERTAIN YOU ARE EATING LESS. DO YOU UNDERSTAND HARPER? YOU WILL BE CERTAIN YOU ARE EATING LESS.\u201d</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen finally blinked, and the spell was broken. \u201cHarper, do you understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, uh...Yes, Dr. Schwartz. Thank you, Dr. Schwartz.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFantastisch.\u201d Helen clapped her hands together. \u201cI'm going to get ready for the day in my office. Hold my calls for the next half hour, say I'm not in yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing, boss.\u201d Harper said, leaning back in the chair, and popping one of the treats in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was safe Inside her soundproof office, Helen picked up her phone and dialled the internal number for Dr. McCarthy, her best friend and associate down in Culinary Chemistry. The one who actually MADE all these wonderful addiditves and snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it Helen?\u201d She asked, always direct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we have a little competition.You remember that MU-77 sample you gave me? I passed it on to my new secretary. I told her it was an appetite suppressant. Would make her eat less.\u201d Helen tucked the phone under her chin and sat her plump rear end up on her desk while they talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelen, MU-77 was an appetite <i>accelerant</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cExactly. My hypnosis versus your chemical inducements. It sounds like a good bit of fun. Of course,  I'm going to program her in such a way that she eats anyway. But I want to see if I can get her to do that without <i>noticing</i> she's hungry and eating more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...I expect pictures. And updates on her weight and eating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, of course. What are friends for? By the way, how's my last secretary holding up with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell enough. She's not actually that useful as a tastetester. I'm pretty sure I could feed her a stack of pencils and she'd think they were delicious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm...Sloppy.\u201d Helen noted. \u201cWell, hopefully I do a better job with Ms. Black.\u201d</span></div></div>",

But yeah-\"  Parker paused to let out a loud belch, before cracking open a can of cola.  \"I don't think we're gonna be able to eat all this today...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper slugged down half her can in a single go, letting out a much more modest burp, before noticing that Hunter was starting to doze off in her chair.  \"Yeah.  Let's wrap this up.  I'm gonna put Hunter to bed.  I wonder how Mom's doin'...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper was not doing well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer workplace was not a healthy environment.  Now that she was being \"health conscious\", Harper realized that there was a pretty good probability that her workplace was just as responsible for her rapidly reducing clothing options as her house, and her new baby- and if she was being honest, it was probably time to stop blaming Hunter for her extra flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonuts and bagels littered the break room, and people would actually <i>bring</i> her food if she didn't have any!  She had already eaten three eclairs today, and it wasn't even noon!  On top of that, two of her coworkers had already asked her to join them for lunch- something about coupons to the burger joint across the street.  Mentally, she tried to add up her calories for the day.  \"One eclair is probably... What, 200 calories?\"  This wasn't even close to accurate, but food science had never been Harper's forte.  She took a brief aside to google some nutritional information, which she promptly got incorrect:  \"According to most health physicians... Blah blah blah... 2500 calories!  That's easy!\"  Oblivious to the fact that her three eclairs, along with her heavy usage of cream and sugar in her several coffees had already put her close to her daily calorific intake, she couldn't say no to her coworkers request to accompany them to the burger joint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd hell, a double cheeseburger with no fries and a diet coke was healthy enough, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, if I drink another soda I'm seriously going to dissolve into a puddle of sucrose.\"  Piper groaned, laying on the floor of the kitchen, her stomach bloated and jutting into the air.  She let out a hiccup and winced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Lord hates a quitter, y'know?\"  Parker retorted, continuing to drink out of the two liter of grape soda she had dug out of the rear of the pantry.  \"That being said, I might actually explode if I eat any more.\"  It was getting into the afternoon hours, and both girls were glad that Hunter was a heavy sleeper- the amount of noise they were making, between the almost constant onslaught of belches, the slamming of the door as they ran trash bags out, and the amount of food being stored away into \"discrete\" boxes- IE, an empty box they had found that said \"Christmas\" on it- would have woken up any normal baby, but their sister was a Black, and she slept like one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we at least-\" Piper let out a belch, winced, and grabbed her overfilled stomach \"-Done storing shit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker, never one to be outdone, let out a much louder burp, before flashing a grin and a thumbs up to her sister.  \"Yeah.  I'm gonna shove this under some other boxes.  We've got 'til December to finish off our stash.  Cripes, our pantry is... Real depressing without all this junk in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper craned her neck and stared into the now empty pantry.  Two cans of cooking spray, a pile of empty tupperware containers, a thing of vinegar, and some flour were all that remained.  \"Wow, shocking.  A family barely above the poverty line doesn't have anything but junk food in the house.  Who'da thunk it?\" She let her head flop back down.  \"I cannot WAIT for Mom to get over this diet shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper was actually sweating as she drove home.  Her sugar and coffee buzz had worn off hours ago, and the paltry lunch she had didn't even keep her full for an hour!  Somehow, she resisted the urge to hit the vending machine, but damn if quitting junk food was ten times harder than kicking cigarettes back in her 20s!  She was jittery, shaky, pissed off, too hot AND too cold!  On top of that, traffic was backed up for almost five blocks before her next turn!  Her stomach angrily grumbled as she turned on the radio, flipping through channels- of course, at this time of day, nothing was on but news updates and commercials, apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-And all I'm saying is that Gritty looks like Jim Henson took acid- that's a terrible mascot, and I'm-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nclick<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Our new 18 piece nugget meal, with extra sauces included, is only $4.99!

Well, with our new 'Family style' basket, you can keep the youngsters happy, while you get to enjoy three wings, two breasts, and six tenders, all for only-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nclick<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sizzling burger noises*  We know you like your burgers a specific way- Fast and cheap.

Whipping out her phone, she texted Parker- Piper was less likely to have her phone on her, but Parker was damn near glued to the thing.  \"Gonna be late- traffic's a bitch.  Buy something for dinner, give you cash later.  HEALTHY!\"  Sending the text, Harper veered out of the stopped traffic and into the nearest drive-thru, which happened to be a BurgerSling.  \"I'll just get something small while I wait...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom's missing dinner.  Said to order something.  Something... <i>healthy</i>\"  Parker warbled from the couch, while Piper tried to convince Hunter to eat some mushed up carrots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Hunter, the internet said you should at least be <i>curious</i> about baby food by now!  You can't keep drinkin' formula forever, this shit is expensive.\"  Piper turned to face her sister.  \"Are you serious?  Fuck, Parker, we must've eaten ten pounds of junk food between the two of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but she's paying!  And besides, I think the pizza place has a special on two meat lovers for the price of one, with some garlic bread.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving up, Piper went to the fridge and grabbed a bottle of formula.  \"...Fine, fuck it.  But seriously, I'm only having like... Two slices, tops!\"  Returning to Hunter, who happily cooed at the sight of a bottle, Piper sighed.  \"Kid, I hope you don't inherit the Black family appetite...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was dark when Harper got home.  Grumbling angrily as she <i>finally</i> pulled up the driveway, she glanced guiltily at the small paper bag on her passenger seat.  BurgerSling's Siren call had certainly worked on her, but- in her defense- She actually sat and read the calories on the food she ordered (She had plenty of time to stare at the board, as she wasn't the only person who had angrily decided the traffic jam wasn't worth starving to death for) and had gotten a sensible meal of a chicken sandwich, a side salad (risking Salmonella or some other horrible disease from the lettuce was better than getting the fries, at least in terms of calories) and a DIET soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, getting back ON the street after she had finished her meal was harder than she expected.  Backed-up rush hour traffic was rough enough, but trying to get back into the traffic once you're out of it was worse.  The line of cars in front of her, trying desperately to merge back in, was bad enough, but the final car in front of her had sat and sat and SAT <b>forever.</b>  \"YOU STUPID OLD BITCH JUST GO!\" Harper had shouted several times to no one but herself.  When her tires finally hit her own driveway, she considered just shutting the car off and sleeping in it- but her grumbling stomach had other plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelicate as a mouse, she tip-toed into the house, lest she awaken Hunter.  To her surprise, the house was empty and darkened.  She checked the glowing clock on the microwave: only a little past 8:30!  Flicking the light on, she wasn't <i>completely</i> surprised to find the obvious remnants of a clearly unhealthy feast on the counter.  Two partially finished boxes of \"Meat Lover\" pizza and a quarter of a loaf of garlic bread, not to mention several empty cans of soda.  \"Those two literally could not order healthy food if they tried.  I'm gonna have to get serious about this 'diet' stuff, unless I want two blobs for daughters- and if they rub off on Hunter, God help us all.\"  She grumbled (quietly) as she started attempting to clean up the cans of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Later...</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker woke up with a grunt.  \"Fuuuuuuuck.\"  She moaned, her stomach gurgling angrily at her.  Eating was great and all- until you woke up from it.  Slamming sodas and sugary treats all day was awesome, but the resulting stomach ache afterwards wasn't.  She let out a pitiful belch as she rummaged around behind her mattress until she found what she was grasping for: a bottle of (very very cheap) vodka.  Taking a few gulps, she let out another annoyed burp and flopped back down onto her pillow, attempting to sleep- until she heard an alarming noise from the kitchen, followed by a few curses, Hunter's tell-tale screaming, and a louder curse from her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>In Piper's Room...</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper was sleeping fitfully.  Hunter had passed out in their highchair and tucking them away was a super easy task.  However, Piper was born a worrier- She'd never admit it, but sometimes when their Mom was coming home late, she'd imagine all these terrible scenarios, and they affected her sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso the fact that she had several thousand calories of junk stuffed into her gut didn't help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up several times throughout her food coma was rough, because it was usually followed up by her having the hiccups, or burping uncontrollably, or a combination of the two- which was a major annoyance, because she had to be as quiet as possible so Hunter didn't wake up.  So it was to her major annoyance when she awoke for the billionth time- but this time, because Hunter was screaming and Parker was swearing up a storm from the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling, she lurched out of bed, letting out a small gasp when she felt just how heavy her stomach felt.  In her sleep, her black tank top had rolled up and her gut looked like Harper's in the earlier stages of her pregnancy- something Piper immediately felt herself turn red at.  Still, she pulled it back down and walked as quickly as she could towards the sound of Hunter's screeches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?!\"  She shouted at Parker, who was bolting towards the easier job- whatever the source of the original noise was.  Grabbing Hunter, Piper patted them on the back several times while snuggling her tightly as her screams turned into gentle \"coo's\" and finally light breathing.  Tucking her back into her crib, she (SILENTLY) stormed towards the kitchen.  \"<i>I SWEAR TO GOD WHOEVER WOKE THAT POOR BABY UP IS-</i>\" Piper began, before surveying the mess in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker and Harper were both squatted down, trying to clean up what appeared to be a shattered tray of microwavable lasagna.  Parker was struggling because she was already feeling the effects of the cheap vodka, combined with her still prevalent food baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper was struggling because she looked like she was about to vomit- and surveying the scene, Piper could see why.  Both the half-full boxes of pizza were empty, there were several new empty soda cans on the counter, the garlic bread was gone, and the toaster was out, along with a clearly empty box of frozen waffles (Piper could've sworn they ate those, but the evening was kind of a blur).  Grabbing more paper towels, she squatted down along side her mother and sister and helped clean, internally groaning at how upset her stomach was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess the diet didn't start so well?\"  Piper whispered, annoyance creeping into her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess you two didn't do a good job of 'throwing out' the junk food?\"  Harper retorted with a slight burp.  \"Don't think I can't tell that you two have been pigging out all day!  And I'm pretty sure I told you to order something <i>healthy!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess what?  You two should shut up and clean so I can go back to bed!\" Parker responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell you've been drinking!\"  Harper responded- whispering be damned, her voice rising to a sharp point.  \"And I'm <i>positive</i> the pizza was your idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a small gurgle of noise from Hunter, at which point everyone froze.  \"Voices.  Fucking.  Down.\"  Piper whispered, a finger in the air once the noise ceased.  \"Shut up.  We clean.  We talk tomorrow.  I'm not putting that baby down another time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three women grumpily cleaned for another few moments, careful to make as little noise as possible, and retreated to their respective beds.  Aside from the occasional belch, no more noise was made that night.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>More than one coworker had made the comment that Harper was still blimping up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in a desk job where most people had already given up their hopes and dreams <i>in addition</i> to the figures of their yesteryears, the fact that Harper Black was getting fat was enough to count as <i>gossip</i> should be saying something. No, it wasn\u2019t enough that the hottest woman in the office (who just so happened to be old enough to mother a few of the younger interns) was going from sexpot to potbelly, she was <i>b l i m p i n g</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll throughout her pregnancy, Harper had been subject to some really fucking weird cravings. Combinations of things, mostly. Like, per se, everything and everything else. Harper had been stuffing herself like crazy ever since she\u2019d gotten pregnant, but the last trimester had really helped pile the pounds onto her meaty milf spread. Having gone from thick-hipped and big-breasted to just plain <i>thicc</i> in a short amount of time, no one was really complaining until she came back to work with yet <i>another</i> twenty pounds added to her pudding-thick body\u2014each one of them earned in addition to the previous forty she\u2019d gained during the pregnancy by sitting on her butt and drinking up every minute of maternity leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd <i>that</i> had been a few months ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then, Harper had cracked the big 2-double-0 with gusto. It was like her eating switch had been set to \u201con\u201d, and there was no way to flip it back to \u201coff\u201d\u2014day in and day out, Harper always, <i>always</i> seemed to be snacking on something. Donuts, candy, sandwiches, donuts, stuff from the vending machine, donuts, pizza from the office parties, and <i>maybe</i> just a few more donuts. The woman was insatiable! And practically inflatable, if you asked some of the other resident chair squashers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, look at her butt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is <i>so</i> big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper had waddling through the aisle of cubicles when she\u2019d hip-checked someone\u2019s pile of papers from their desk and sent them flying. Popping the rest of her donut in her mouth, the husky mother of three bent over to quickly scoop up as much of them as possible, while spreading the glaze all over what looked to be <i>very</i> important paperwork and also giving everyone a front-row seat as to just how fat her ass had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper stood back up straight, arching her back and wiping the sweat accrued from the strain of bending over her own belly for so long, and let out a satisfied \u201cphew!\u201d as she shuffled away from the desk in question. Then, right on cue, into the break room to go for yet another snack run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat woman\u2019s a hog.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo think I used to think she was <i>so</i> hot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, yeah, what a hog.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blimping matriarch of the Black family was quite the hot topic around the office, that much was for sure. Her tits had long gained the ire, fascination, arousal and outright delight of almost everyone on staff since she\u2019d scored the job. But now that she was beginning to fill out proportionately (mostly proportionately\u2014damn those things were huge) all anyone could seem to say was just how large she was getting. And so quickly too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe has to weigh two thirty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeez, way to lowball Mike.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo fifty, easy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper had been busy ferreting her snacks back to her workspace when her blouse finally bit the bucket. A pearl-colored button popped right off at the strain of having to endure such tightness. But no, not around her chest\u2014but her belly! Harper\u2019s dark skin peerked through the diamond of space opened up, fleshy but taut at capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome to <i>mama</i>.\u201d She said lustily to a cheese Danish that she\u2019d scored from the machine, biting into it lovingly as sweet, sweet goo filled her mouth, \u201c<i>Mmmm</i>\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper had never really been big on dieting. You didn\u2019t get breasts like hers from skipping meals, after all! But as her figure only continued to expand, so too did her appetite. She was showing no signs of slowing down any time soon, that much was for sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question was\u2026 what\u2019s her deal, huh?</span></div></div>",

Pretty big was an understatement\u2014Harper had ballooned up to two hundred and fifty pounds in such a short amount of time after childbirth that it looked like someone had pulled the cord on a life raft! Every day she just continued to grow and grow, sitting at her desk all day and snacking to her heart\u2019s content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Helen would have ever had a problem with this development. Nine times out of ten, she would have been responsible for such a development! But in this one-tenth of a possibility, where Harper had been slowly succumbing to a natural laziness and an incredible appetite all her own\u2026 Dr. Schwartz was stumped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that I should diet\u2026 it\u2019d <i>probably</i> be good for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper had leaned back in her chair after lunch, her button undone and her zipper pulled down. She\u2019d made a complete pig of herself yet again, and it showed\u2014her stomach rolled out onto her lap, taut as a harp string as she burped quietly into her hand. She looked as contented as could be, seemingly having spent every minute of her hour-long feast dedicated to enjoying herself as much as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands resting tidily on her stomach, just under the swell of her impressive breasts as they rolled like waves over the round horizon of her gut. She drummed her fingers happily, a contented smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut everything\u2019s just <i>soooo</i> good.\u201d Her head rolled and her big curly \u2018do rustled, \u201cI\u2019ll start cutting back next week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe winced, her outer monologue interrupted by a sudden realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh that\u2019s Hunter\u2019s birthday\u2026 <i>cake</i>\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is, erm\u2026 <i>always</i> room for cake?\u201d Helen offered in a rare moment of confusion from behind her desk, \u201cUnd it <i>is</i> klein Hunter\u2019s birthday. Perhaps you can make an exception?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll just do it next month, I\u2019m just\u2026I\u2019m just trying to figure out if we should get a whole sheet cake or not\u2026\u201d Harper\u2019s hand began to rub concentric circles in her stomach\u2019s fleshy side, \u201cThe girls won\u2019t eat it all\u2026 <i>but their mama might\u2026</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change that had overcome Harper since she\u2019d begun her employment at the Yeng offices was astonishing. Helen had never seen anything like it\u2014at least, not in a naturally occurring state. It was her job (well, passion, but she\u2019d often intermingle it with Research &amp; Development!) to tinker with the minds of her underlings (and basically just about anyone else who got on her nerves) to make a bigger, fatter, more gluttonous version of themselves for her own amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was maddening\u2014Helen had been particularly drawn to Harper for many a reason (not all of which were HR friendly) for years, and now she was well on her way to eating herself to the size of a house and\u2026 and Helen had no input on the matter at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a woman like her\u2014who prided herself on her intelligence and comprehension of the human brain\u2014to have such a puzzle placed in front of her with no obvious answer was <i>maddening!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething had to be done\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption A)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen's ego is way too big to allow something like this to go unanswered, even if it <i>is</i> exactly what she's always wanted! Helen will just have to stick to Harper like glue to figure out the answer! All those extra meals might catch up to her down the line, but it'll be worth a little self-sabotage if it means figuring out the answer to her (at the moment) biggest fascination!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption B)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Schwartz might not understand <i>why</i> Harper is blowing up like this, but she's definitely not one to question a good thing. A great thing. <i>The best thing</i>. In fact, she'll be more than okay with not knowing if it means getting to watch someone give into their Id with such gusto!

What- no- fuck?\u00e2\u0080\u009d a long, pale arm groped and clawed its way out of a tangled cocoon of blankets, before completely missing the alarm clock and sliding a lamp, along with the clock, onto the floor. No longer being immediately pushed into \u00e2\u0080\u009csnooze\u00e2\u0080\u009d yet again, the alarm beeped incessantly at Max, who tried her best  to go back to sleep anyways, ignoring the alarm out of spite. However, the alarm proved too good at its job. Max finally emerged from her cocoon, tumbling out of the blankets to land on her belly and crawl to the alarm, smashing it off. But the damage was done: now she was awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In grey boyshorts and a stained, once-white tank top, Max stood up to reveal her form, which could most aptly be described as \u00e2\u0080\u009cgangly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lanky, sinewy, spindly, and the underachieving but correct \u00e2\u0080\u009ctall,\u00e2\u0080\u009d would also suffice. Stumbling through the darkness of the apartment, Max teetered amongst her strewn about mess, which was in such an exact state of disarray that she knew precisely where everything was. First her pile of unwashed jeans, each pre-torn yet many damaged besides, leading to a mix of tarnishes juxtaposing the natural and artificial. After tugging up the first pair she blindly grabbed, with several jumps up and down, Max bumbled to her pile of shirts. Here the lottery from a lack of light gave her a black shirt that once bore an obscure band name, which now (much like the band\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lead singer) had been wiped out by bleach. She likewise scrounged socks and a faded denim jacket, finally completing her dress code for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cFuck, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too early,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Max groaned, plodding her way to the blinds on her windows. Tugging them up, her eyes reactively squinted as they were blasted by the midday sun. Posters, dirty cloths, the remnants of takeout, and empty beer cans were all illuminated as light made its way into the apartment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNeed a pick-me-up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Max shuffled to her fridge, pulling it open. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHmm\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d she browsed the racks inside, each totally empty except for a few inedible items. Expired milk, due for disposal this past month; shoe, a complete mystery Max couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand to do away with until she could use it as a conversation starter at least once, ignoring that no one ever came to her apartment; and finally The Grunge. The last time Max had tried to get rid of it, she had attempted to chisel that black mass of crust off of the bottom shelf with a screwdriver. Instead, the tool slid askew and sliced her arm something fierce. And so The Grunge remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Max\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomach growled as she looked over the frozen wasteland. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, shit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Now she remembered realizing she was running low on food a week ago. And she remembered also realizing that again, the day after. Now that she was finally, actually out of food, Max had to do something about it. She begrudgingly admitted to herself that she could probably get a job again. But on the other hand, Max had gotten pretty good at mooching from her dear, generous friend, Josie. All she had to do was ignore the exasperation, teasing, and sometimes straight up insults, and she could get a free meal, which sounded like a good deal to her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Do I have the best job in the world or what?\" Josie said, gesturing down at the chaotic gym on the floor beneath her. It was new years, and countless women had waddled in in the hopes of shedding a few pounds as part of their new years resolution. A gaggle of fatties bounced up and down hypnotically to the demands of the cardio kickboxing class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Josie's relationship with Max was an odd one. On the one hand, the affinities were obvious. A tall, butch lesbian who understood all of Max's...peculiar affinities. But they'd never actually attempted anything. Instead, Josie stayed quite skinny so-far, and had settled into the role of Max's 'bro'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She'd share her choice selection of pornography, discuss which celebrities needed to eat a fucking sandwich, play wingman, and grab a beer afterwards. So it was with great pleasure that Josie had introduced Max to the benefits of her job: the annual exercise in inevitability, that allowed Josie to oggle and even video tape increasingly fat asses forced into increasingly thin spandex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Josie herself was wearing some pretty thin spandex, but hers showed off thick, developed musculature. The only thing covering her midriff was her long, french braided black hair. She seemed immensely pleased with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait, and you're telling me they actually get bigger?\" Max gawked, eyeing up a passing steak flank of fat ass with no subtlety whatsoever. She got a couple stares herself, but that was mostly a passing curiosity as to why someone was here in ripped jeans and an unbuttoned button up shirt that revealed a t shirt with some shitty unheard of band name on it. Max wasn't here to exercise. Not that she needed to. While a bit scrawny, Max was even taller than her friend and had the long, slender legs that come along with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Every year like clockwork.\" Josie shrugged. \"No willpower.\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pfft, who needs willpower. Just stop shoving in the donuts each morning,\" Max was oblivious to the fact that she'd basically just repeated what Josie had said. \"...not that I'd recommend that to 'em,\" she filled the silence with the extra remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I mean, I know it's hot, but could you ever imagine doing that to yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What do you mean?\" Max laughs, obviously only half paying attention. Despite probably ogling fatties way more often than Josie, what with being currently unemployed and having access to the internet, Max couldn't resist the real deal. Or maybe she couldn't because of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Josie slapped Max on the back jockularly. \"Could you imagine carting around a sack of blubber like that all day?\" She said, holding out her hand to mime Max having a hefty gut of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ha, like I have to imagine that. Last girlfriend, Sophie, you remember her? Anyway, tiny little thing, she was like a ball of pure blubber. She gained like ten pounds, and I swear I gained like two pounds of muscle just from carrying her so much,\" Max pushed away Josie's hand, brushing her own stomach in doing so. She made a small frown for just a second. \"I'm surprised you haven't added something like that to your workout by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh I have.\" Josie grinned. \"Every tuesday, this one chick, I get her legs around me, and I hold her up. That works the shoulders. But theeeeen I get the abs into it. Get the glutes into it, know what I'm saying?\" She said, while thrusting at the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, yeah, I get it,\" Max waves her hand at Josie dismissively. Recently she'd really felt being single, and didn't need to be reminded. She found herself rambling, \"I've been trying to get something going myself, but the scene keeps changing you know? Now they're all going for shorties, or into the chub themselves. Is to too much to ask to not have to work for it? Give me the amusement parks again, where all I need to do to get a ride is pass a height check.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Eh, it's the internet.\" Josie shrugged, \"It's not so big of a secret. Besides...\" Josie flexed, letting Max see the latest product of countless bicep curls. \"Working for it pays off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, and you remember what happened when you tried to get me to 'work for it' here. That is not happening again,\" Max puffed a strand of hair out of her face. \"I'm perfectly happy with this 'svelte charm' I got going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Whatever works. Just don't go getting soft on me.\" Josie said teasingly poking Max's midrift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You and I both know I don't get fat. How else could I have survived Sherly Six Meals?\" After some silence, eyes scanning the parade of poorly exercising fatties, \"have you ever thought about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah. Not seriously. I'd fucking hate it. Hey, since you don't get fat, you're up for Hooters after my shift, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Always,\" Max straightened up and flipped her half a head of hair. \"Robbie fucked Claire's sister again so band session won't be happening for at least a couple days. And this girl don't got no job, so I'm free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Which means I'm paying again, right?\" Josie grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Unless you want to see how long before they kick us out if we just come there to stare,\" Max flashed one of her rare smiles, only halfway through her comment realizing that that would be fucking awesome to do some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"OK, but you know the deal. I pay, that means all the pussy goes my way, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're killing me,\" Max say apathetically, resigned to it at this point and too lazy to try and bargain.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Needless to say, Hooters didn't appreciate Josie's \"aggressive tipping style\" and her cruel, barbed comments to the most overweight staff girls. However, through her usual brand of psychological warfare, Josie ended up breaking down the ego of the fattest girl there and taking her home for some \"horizontal exercise.\" Of course Max was excluded from this activity. \"No hard feelings, skinny,\" said the toned trainer as she shut the door on her friend. \"Maybe you'll get some ass next time! Heh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax was not exactly welcome at her parents' house these days--being a no-show at school and utterly unwilling to get a job had ensured that. And since Josie was \"occupied\" with slamming the two-hundred-and-eighty-pound waitress, she decided to wander around town for a while, feeling sorry for herself and burning with sexual frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she found herself sitting on a suburban doorstep outside her neighborhood, mowing on some Twinkies (the Hooters hadn't been enough to satisfy her razor-sharp metabolism, and she didn't have the nutrition knowledge to dig herself out of permanent hunger) and trying to light a joint, when a gentle male voice floated from the basement door nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo. You okay, dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Zach, one of that yuppie town council girl's buds. Max rolled her eyes initially, but then looked down at herself: eating Twinkies, basically homeless. She sighed and shrugged at the thick-set guy with his Lootbox clothes and stubbled chin. \"I dunno. What does it look like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it looks like it's two in the morning, and I'm gonna catch hell if my folks see you smoking that here,\" he said. \"You're Max, right? I always see you down by the gym, hanging out with that...\" He was going to say \"that weird girl who catcalls fat women,\" but though he was a few brain cells short of Einstein, he did know enough to try and be sensitive. \"That trainer chick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. That's me. Sidekick extraordinaire.\" Max kept trying to light the joint until Zach walked up the basement stairs and took it off her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it. At least come in and smoke inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought you said...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My parents don't care what I do, as long as I don't toke in public.\" He led her into his basement \"apartment,\" really just a concrete floor with a boiler, bed and crappy office carpeting thrown down to shrug off the chill. Gaming and action-movie posters coated the walls; Zach's computer rig dominated one corner with his bong, Big Bertha, dominating its own corner on the gaming table. He closed the door and flopped onto a bean-bag; old couches and sofas littered the periphery, forming a useful crash-pad no matter how high you got. \"Okay, wild child. Go nuts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax took a couple hits, blowing the smoke out of the basement window. She coughed, rubbing her eyes, and saw how Zach was looking at her. \"What, dude? What's your deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged, fishing tortilla chips out of a bag. \"I'm not the judgy type. But you don't look so good. You always been that skinny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Being homeless kind of does that to you.\" She tried not to sound bitter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sprayed chip crumbs. \"You're homeless? What about your folks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They gave me a week to move out or get a job. That was like...\" She counted, her fingers numb and feeling fuzzy. \"Eight weeks ago. I've just been sneaking in their window and staying with... koff, with Josie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grunted. \"That sucks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it.\" There was a brief pause. \"You want a beer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but smile. \"Aren't you a little young?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waved her off. \"Like I said. Keep it at home, and Clan de Zach don't give a fuck.\" He tossed her a Coors from a mini-fridge under the stairs. \"If you don't have a place to stay, you know, you can crash here a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe considered it. This was the first genuine kindness she'd had in a while, and while she worried what Josie would think of her hanging around a \"fucking penis,\" she really was tired of listening to sex noises from Josie's room while she slept on the couch. She was also tired of trying to masturbate while Josie worked out on her Bowflex not ten feet away. \"Yeah,\" she said, grinning as she slurped the cheap brew. \"Yeah, I'd like that a lot.

To try and mitigate the hunger pangs, Max had grabbed a handful from a \u2018please take one\u2019 tin at a restaurant where she hadn\u2019t bought anything. Now the gangly woman was sitting in a fast food joint, a pile of mints on the table in front of her, with her phone out. Slender fingers slowly typed out \u201ccraigslist\u201d into her phone\u2019s web browser, using the place\u2019s free wifi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Max knew she needed this, the blue haired slacker found her fingers rebelling against the job search. Her eyes similarly wavered from the task. Max quickly found herself looking around the place as her eyes hunted down what was always somewhere on her mind: fatties. Whether Max was just that much of a pervert that she could never get sex off her mind, or she never had the willpower to break what was now a perpetual habit, the fact was she couldn\u2019t stop scoping out fat chicks wherever she went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently her eyes were glued to a meaty shelf of an ass. Each meaty cheek heftily wobbled up and down, tightly wrapped in dark leggings that left the outline of underwear much too small for a donk of that magnitude underneath. The overstuffed buns were attached to a red haired woman who obviously spent a lot of time at this establishment. Her heaving gut drooped out the bottom of a white t-shirt to slap at those tree trunk thighs, while relatively small breasts still spread out on top of that gut like fleshy dollops of cream. Max was only shaken out of her blatant ogling when she heard the clack of her mint falling out of her gaping mouth. Whoops. Max plucked the sticky mint off of the table and popped it back into her mouth, eyes darting back to her phone. As someone who had eaten out of dumpsters before, Max wasn\u2019t going to let that ruin a perfectly good dirty, half dissolved mint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Max narrowed her search down to three jobs. Despite usually being unemployed and lacking much talent for anything, the slacker was surprisingly efficient at sniffing out the lowest effort things she could.</span></div></div>",

While Nitoli's Pizza was the crown jewel of easy, greasy and delicious in Daven's Port, a pie would cost you twenty dollars, or more if you wanted toppings. Brent Brothers, would sell you two pies for six dollars. The one time Max had a date, she brought them here and expected them to eat six pizzas. What? She spent twenty dollars on their dinner. That's not being cheap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Anyway, Brent Brother's was well known to Max not just for her rare attempts at fattening her dates, Max herself took advantage of the incredibly cheap fare, as part of her life's quest to avoid getting a job. And she might be failing that today, but the entire place looked cheap, insufficient, and half-assed. The pictures of their pizza for the Chinese-Restuarant-Style-Menu were obviously first page google image search results. Anything they didn't immediately sell went under a heat lamp, where Max suspected they could leave it for days. The entire resturant was coated in this thin layer of grease that stuck to your hands and left them feeling weird. Max felt at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In the back office, she kicked her feet up on her Boss's desk. She'd arrived at the interview wearing a tank top, and a pair of jeans that had so many holes in it, Max decided to just convert them into a pair of 'stylish' torn up jeans. By shoving her shoes in her bosses face, she showed that the bottoms were all full of holes, with those little pockets of air in your sneakers all exposed. Meanwhile, her boss, Brian Brent, a fat, balding, middle age man, lit up a ciggarette without even asking Max if she minded. His office was cramped, and made worse by his insistance on filling it with random crap that lined wall to wall shelves, some of it paperwork, but a lot of it was basically toys, including a Giant Ass TV, an X-Box AND a Playstation. Also, Max immediately noticed that this office STANK of weed. So this guy obviously didn't give a shit, and Max didn't give a shit. They'd get along famously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What makes you think you're at all qualified to work at Brent Brother's Pizza.\" He grunted, from behind Max's resume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Because I've SEEN your employees at work, dude.

They bought them elsewhere, from something called the Yeng Corporation. They didn't even need to be frozen. As far as Max could figure, they were just made of plastic and so they never went bad, ever. It was kind of scary. She figured the only reason they didn't have roaches was that the things wouldn't even recognize the Pizza as food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But Max was smarter then a roach. She recognized it not only as food, but cheap as free food. There were so many opportunities to get Pizza, ASIDE from the ones she was just stealing. Anything that came out wrong in the factory and looked 'weird?' Max got to mark that down. The Yeng Company would compensate for that, and since it wasn't good for a customer, Max could freely heat it up and chow down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then there were all the deals she was aware of just from being around the company. Max was already an epic level couponer, As part of her quest to be as lazy as possible and never get a job, Max would pour through multiple coupon clippers, take advantage of sale days, of marked down items. Some days she'd get lucky and stores would actually be /paying/ her to buy their stuff. So she also bought a ton of cheap pizza entirely legitimately, especially now that she had some source of income. Which was good, because it threw off any suspicions about her stealing pizza; because there was no hiding that she was eating a /lot/ of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Irene Maxwell, beanpole chubby chaser, had finally fattened a girl up: herself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If she let her belly hang over the button of her pants, or just unbuttoned it to let it hang out, Max didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to increase her pants size, so she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. All her weight just accumulated in this big, flabby gut that had already lost the fight with gravity and started to sag over her pubic area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They made her pay for new shirts at work, so she was putting that off until she got yelled at, and because she worked in the back where no one could see her, Brian didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really care. So she would show up to work early, and get the two pies for $8 deal, then, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d apply her employee discount, to knock 40 cents off the deal, an then she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d offer up a coupon for a dollar off, same coupon, every day, and then for every five ordered, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d get one free, and so she managed to get it down to $2.66 for a pizza. Not one of those big giant ones that had at Nitolli\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s but still! That was better then a sale at the supermarket!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But now there was a motive beyond thriftiness. Max always loved Pizza, but never had the money for it. But not that she had glutted herself on the stuff, she found she always wanted more. Her body went from demanding pizza because it was starving, to demanding pizza because this was it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new concept of normal eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d show up early, order two pizzas, eat them. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d steal at least two on her first shift, take another two for lunch, steal some more on her second shift, and then order two more for dinner, and enjoy her freebie. So she was looking at 11 pizzas a day at minimum, plus whatever she ate at home (which was, increasingly, pizza. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d think she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d just get sick of the stuff, but no). It was no wonder then, that Max was packing on pounds like a professional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Max really caught sight of this one day while browsing the frozen aisle at The Dollar General after an epic victory of managing to get 15 pizza pies into her greedy stomach in one day, all for less than 20 bucks. That left her with plenty of money after her day ended, and she collected EBT and housing assistance to treat herself. Beating the system rocked! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But the consequences of her particular means of sticking it to the man? Maybe not so much. As she closed the freezer door after selecting six packages Titoni\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pizza for 8 bucks. Only six per customer, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to come back later. Or so she thought until she caught her reflection in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So much of her belly was hanging out out of her shirt, she looked like a white egg with spindly arms and legs. She looked more belly then person at this point. She looked...pregnant, most of all. Max jiggled her gut contemplatively.</span></div></div>",

Why not use any of that? She thought. But she'd seen almost all of it (sad as that was), and the new stuff was expensive. Plus, she had no wi-fi in her house. Now, she could have brand new, free porn whenever she wanted. Wasn't that worth it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The idea had come to her while she was in the frozen foods section, shopping for her fix of frozen pizza. As she slammed the freezer door closed, she caught her reflection in the mirror, and instinctively, she started checking herself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She'd blown up so fast that her brain hadn't yet adjusted to the fat girl in the mirror being HER. So instead, her brain went to it's most common function: scoping out the pudge on a fat girl. The whole incident took maybe 3 seconds tops, but it had planted the idea in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She went home and gorged herself on all the pizza she could afford today, until she puffed up big and round. The slight cleft in her gut diminished as it stretched out wider and wider, and most of all further and further in front of her until it was covered in a thin glossy sheen of greasy sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then, she took her phone camera, and angled it to take some headless photos of herself. It was a big tricky while feeling so full, but she got it done, mostly with the aid of her bathroom mirror.'This was so stupid, this will never work.' She plugged her phone into her ancient PC, sat down on her well worn, second hand computer chair, and unzipped her pants before she could inspect her failure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The results were hot. Like...really, really hot. This bitch had a huge belly, and seemed so shy, it was kind of cute. Like she didn't know how hot it was. It was with a bit of dissociation that Max remembered that SHE was 'that bitch' in the photos. She didn't care. Almost immediately, she got her hand down her pants, and got to flicking her bean. She realized she'd want to find like a webcam if she kept doing this, so she could take pictures from other angles easier. But right now, she had a more immediate concern:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This big stuffed belly was in her way. At first Max was annoyed, and then she decided it was hot. There was this big, stuffed, belly right here! And she was allowed to grope and play with it as much as she wanted! It occurred to Max that this was really her first time touching a fat belly, really know what one felt like. It was so good! Everything she ever dreamed of! Only she wanted more. What feeder didn't? She imagined a giant, pillowy soft, quaking belly for her to grope and fondle, even while she groped and fondled herself, one of her hands moving to cup her small breast. It wasn't long before Max was in the throes of ecstasy, and collapsed into bed, stuffed and deeply satisfied.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Indulging in this new side of her fetish was hitting her hard, and fast, and her weak, ineffectual, formerly underfed muscles muscles weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t up to the task of hauling around the extra pounds she piled on every day now. She was still malnourished, of a sort. While she loaded herself with tens of thousands of calories a day now, it was only every so often that her body had access to a vitamin, or a gram of protein in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She started her day off right however, with a shower at least. Really, it was just excuse to lather up and feel up all her new rolls and inches. And there were a lot of them. She could hardly recognize herself in the bathroom mirror. She was piling on weight so fast, over a pound a day, she could hardly keep up with the changes. Her hair was longer, and she needed to shave the side of it again. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been too lazy to manage it lately. Her cheeks were rounder, and no matter which way she turned it, she could see a double chin. Finding her neck was a little harder. Her collar bone used to be really prominent, and now that was buried in softness. Even her arms had lost their weird, gangly quality and rounded out significantly. Her breasts had grown, but were still small for their size, and kept a certain amount of perkiness to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cGoddamn, you have gotten fat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She said to her reflection, licking her lips lustfully. She took out her cellphone to take another nude pic of herself, making sure to capture her real pride and joy, her belly. It was a big pale, gelatinous mass, covered in stretch marks. She lifted it up and jiggled it a few times, feeling it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weight in her hands, before deciding to drop it in the sink. It hit the bottom. Max could feel, but not see, the cold linoleum against the hot underside of her gut. In the front, the faucet was pushing up against her belly button, suggestively. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099d discovered her navel was something of an erogenous zone lately, and Max was as likely to use her vibrator there as anywhere else these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Speaking of which, in the shower, she had trouble getting in past the shitting, semi-transparent door her apartment shower came with, and once she was inside, she was having a harder and harder time getting the shower head beneath her belly to get her off. The exercise only stirred her appetite, and still tingling with excitement, she headed off to her little kitchen area to have breakfast. She was up to five frozen pizzas for breakfast, but was looking to diversify it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Yesterday when she went shopping, she spied the discount baked goods on sale. Stuff that hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sold and was getting sale, so it was half off or more. Max had snagged a whole pie for dessert last night, and six powdered donuts for this morning. Plus, she wanted to up her soda intake to two 2-liter bottles of soda. It was a lot. It was a lot, a lot. By the time she had finished, Max was painfully stuffed, sweating bullets, and horny. She was horny all the time now, no matter how often she got off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She hauled her even bigger belly back to her bedroom to get dressed for work. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much of a surprise when she realized her largest pair of jeans no longer had any hope of closing. So she just tucked the flaps under her gut and figured no one would notice. Or notice that she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any underwear that fit. Her red polo shirt with her name tag was unwashed, still covered in pizza stains from last night, pinched at her upper arms, and exposed grabbable handfuls of belly flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cUrp...I look...like the model of Brent Brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pizza.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Max declared.

The Brent Bros. employee was standing, pants wrapped around her thighs, in front of her bathroom mirror. Her face was red and damp with sweat, and she alternated swearing under her breath and puffing out her cheeks in exertion while tugging up at the tall, slim fit pants she\u2019d gotten when she started working at the pizza place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as she pulled, the pants had found their stopping point, and that was tightly wrapped around two thick, pale thighs that idly wobbled their meaty masses with each of Max\u2019s movements.

Her ass was a jutting bubble in shape, each cheek massive enough to dwarf her head and jiggling independent of the other. The fatty flesh bulged around the boundaries of Max\u2019s taut panties, threatening to snap the stretched fabric with every gelatinous jiggle. With a growl of defiance, Max mustered up the mightiest tug her wimpy arms would allow, and then fell backwards as the momentum knocked her onto her pizza-fed rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOof!\u201d now dripping with sweat, Max gave up. Her cheeks wobbled idly as they propped her up from the cold tile floor, having cushioned her fall considerably. With a lot of jiggling, Max finally pulled herself up and kicked off the pants she would never wear again. \u201cGod fucking damnit!\u201d the half naked woman shouts when she sees the time. Max had spent fifteen minutes trying to put on a pair of pants, and now she was running late for work. Normally she got there early to get in an order of two pizzas (employee discount paired with a deal on getting two at once) and sneak in another two or three \u201cdefective\u201d pizzas behind the scenes after. Of course, now she reflected that this might be part of her problem, a scowl on her face and each hand coming to rest on her fattened, extra wide hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax had to pay for a new pair of work pants after that, shuffling her fat hips into work with a pair of sweatpants that still managed to be tight around her jiggling shelf of butt. With the clothing cutting into Max\u2019s expenses, she couldn\u2019t stop herself from continuing to gorge on the incredibly price efficient pizzas. It\u2019s not like she could starve herself when discount food was right there for the taking. Max also couldn\u2019t stop stealing pizzas, considering that was the greatest discount of all. And so her work clothing upgrade was the first of many, each one convincing Max she had to keep on her Brent Bros. diet for cost reasons, and her diet leading to yet more horizontal increases in pants size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally, the weekend,\u201d Max sighed, a couple months after her first pizza-induced wardrobe malfunction. She pulled the sheets off her torso with a slender arm, knocking aside three empty pizza boxes from her dinner in bed the night before. Rubbing the sleep out of her eyes, Max let out a high pitched yawn, tossing her messy locks of blue and pink hair that cascaded down one side of her thin neck and across a slight shoulder. Max was naked, her tiny mosquito bite chest bare to the morning chill. Then, she began to shuffle the rest of the sheets off of her legs. Each of Max\u2019s thighs was still thick and wobbled with the effort, although they hadn\u2019t grown much. No, almost all of Max\u2019s weight was now funneled directly into her disproportionate butt. Stuffing her body with grease, meat, bread, and cheese had caused her booty to balloon even further. Sitting up in bed, the extra mass of her ass shifted her head and shoulders above the bed\u2019s headboard, even with her fat ass squishing into the mattress and spreading across it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHauling herself out of bed, Max had to reach forward with both arms and grunted with the effort, stumbling to her feet and nearly falling backwards back onto the bed from the meaty counterweight of her ass. The twin pairs of jello junk in the trunk wobbled and audibly smacked, constituting another person behind her in size. The ass was so fat, it reached up to Max\u2019s elbows and almost halfway down her thick, doughy thighs, and wobbled wildly from the smallest of motions. The pizza pig dragged herself to the bathroom, having to wiggle her butt out of the door frame as had become habit when it got stuck, and was met with her mirror. Even from the front, Max\u2019s ass was clearly outlined in its unreal enormity. All she could do was\u2026</span></div></div>",

Bent over like that, the entire work crew couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but stare at her jiggling bubble butt. Not out of lust, but out of curiosity. Her ass was like a train wreck, they couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but stare. And one of them, Kendra, couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but poke her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cEw, it feels like Jello!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The teenager squealed, pulling her finger away in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt feels like fat.

Do you want to hurry about an do something about it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Brent thought about it for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009c...No.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0OK, so work sucked. But worked always sucked. And sure, it might have sucked more than usual today but...that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the point. The point was, Max had a hot date tonight. An alright date. The girl looked kind of chubby from her profile picture, and that was enough for Max. She actually took a shower, put on her best outfit that still fit (sweatpants, a band tanktop, and her black leather jacket covered in patches) and took the bus down to the Daven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Port pier for her date. Max liked taking dates to the pier because you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to pay any money to be there. You could buy a hotdog for dinner and walk around all night and say you were being romantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Max started to get anxious waiting around the rigged basketball games with the hoops too high and too far back. She felt hundreds of eyes on her hips as the crowds went by, and she tried to turn so that it was less noticeable. She checked her text messages. Nothing. She was still looking at her old Nokia brick of a phone when she heard someone say \u00e2\u0080\u009cMax?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Max looked up at her phone and saw, Sharron? Karen? Something like that. She couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember her name. She was this kind of cute nerdy girl with glasses and red-brown hair that looked like she cut it herself. She brought an NPR tote bag to carry her things on a date, and wore this Pea Coat thing, even though it was already May. Not Max\u00e2\u0080\u0099s type. Most disappointing for her though, Sharron/Karen was not as chubby as her profile made her out to be. Even in that Pea Coat and sweater, Max\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trained eye could tell she was <i>maybe</i> 170 tops? She only had her face to judge by online and thought she was using Facebook angles to hide her fat. But no, she just had a chubby baby face. But that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s okay, Max could still make this work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cHeeeey...you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Max started. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou look great. Really great. You picture REALLY didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do you justice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If Max was any other girl, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d actually be able to mean that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour photo...\u00e2\u0080\u009d Karen looked Max up and down, from her thin narrow face and shoulders to her enormous posterior. At least she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t accuse her of not using a recent photograph. But none of them included her giant butt! Total Facebook angle! \u00e2\u0080\u009c...I prefer not to get hung up on photos, you know?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah, totally? You want to get something to eat? You know like a couple of pizzas or something?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Max said, kind of anxious to move things along. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI got a discount from my job. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m kind of a big deal over there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cA couple of pizzas? Are you sure you should be having that for dinner?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat? No. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not for me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d OK, she totally could go for a couple pizzas for dinner, but still, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for you. You know, because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so skinny?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"Excuse me?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supposed to be a compliment, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0OK, so Max\u00e2\u0080\u0099s date didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go well. But that was fine. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099d had a million unsuccessful dates. In fact, all her dates were unsuccessful, so this had nothing to do with her butt, or how much Pizza she was eating. Easy come easy go. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099d just get on the bus, head home, put on a porno, get high, eat a couple pizzas and the night would still be great. This was totally great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Until she got on the bus. There was one seat available, and it was on the inside, next to the aisle. There was an old lady sitting next to the window, nodding off opposite her, holding a bag of groceries in her lap. Max nudged closer, trying to precariously lower as much of the two basketball sized butt cheeks as she could into the seat. She got less than half of her hips onto the seat when the bus started up and Max toppled onto the floor, struggling to pick herself up with her huge center of gravity pulling her down. By the time she got up onto her feet, she nearly toppled forward when the bus came to a sudden stop. She tried to settled her butt down next to granny again, and once again the bus started up, and dropped her with her gelatinous ass on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Max blew a wisp of blue hair out of her face and decided it was best if she stood for the way home, and she <i>hated</i> standing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis sucks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She mumbled, glaring at her reflection in the bus window.</span></div></div>",

She was beginning to think she should start collecting overtime just from waiting. In actuality, she had been there three hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They had reassured her over the phone that they were looking for a 'diverse array of individuals' who were 'not necessarily professionals' who would 'represent a diverse array of economic and social demographics' which meant Max didn't even bother to worry about how her appearance or behavior would effect things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0From the outside, the Yeng Corporation facility looked like some kind of compound, huge, sprawling, weird, egg shaped architecture. It was far enough outside the city limits that the city buses ran directly there, and from there, there were shuttle buses around their whole weird techno-futuristic plastic dreamland. It was kind of weird seeing something so Silicon Valley in Daven's Port.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0On the inside, the waiting room was so new that Max could smell it, the fresh couch smell that she had never once in her life had in her own home. Max didn't hesitate to get horizontal, and nap on the couch while she waited. Napping was what Max did best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After about an hour of that, a very serious looking Japanese lady, who said her name was Fakuda came out and offered Max one of the new Y-pad's to keep herself entertained, and apologizing deeply for the delay. Max shrugged, took the Y-pad and spent the next two hours watching pornography of morbidly obese women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What she didn't know was, the Y-pad was part of the interview process. While she was watching a 500 pound woman explain that she had a herniated disk from the weight of her stomach, and still planned to get fatter, Fukuda was in her office, watching what Max was watching. Her notes were so exciting they got green ink. 'Interesting. Very Interesting. Schwartz will like this one.'<br>\r\nShe reached out and hit her intercom. \"Send Irene Maxwell in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Max came in, reached under her t-shirt to scratch herself, and sat down. She loooked at the Y-Pad for the rest of the interview.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Irene, it's good to finally see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Max flinched under the name. \"No-- Nobody calls me Irene. Call me Max.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Max...Maxwell?\" Fukada said skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Max shrugged. \"I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"...Very well, Max.

I mean...cool.\" Max said, trying to play it casual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's because you have a high degree of honesty, about your wants, needs and qualifications.\" Fukada explained. \"Most people try to put together an image of a young professional with a lifelong interest in quality testing.\" She paused here. \"There is no money in marketing products aimed at young professionals with a lifelong interest in quality testing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Max tried for the life of her to figure out if Fukada was making a joke here. \"And there's money in marketing products aimed at--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"18 to 30 year-olds with limited career prospects and income, but lots and lots of recreational time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ouch.

This guy kept going on, and on, and on. Wasn't wearing clip-on tie and a shirt with buttons torture enough? But on top of that, he kept talking and talking, and he wasn't saying that much. Just that she'd be working in the mail room, and that she'd be working for the latest branch of Gordge Incorporated. She still couldn't figure out what Gordge exactly did, beyond push papers around, and her task was to ensure everyone here had their papers to push around. This was it. This was her personal hell. A real job at a faceless corporation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Max was trying to figure out if the Gordge office building was tall enough to jump off of when the H.R. drone starting introducing her to everyone, guiding her through an endless sea of cubicles that the workers were herded into like cattle. Normally, these kinds of meet and greets and forced politeness and smiles and sunshine were only further drudgery, but two of them stood out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0First, was Parker Black, the new secretary. She looked even more bored and miserable than Max working here. But that's not what Max cared about. What she cared about was that this girl was stacked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey.\" She tried. Her favorite pick-up line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey.\" She answered. Then waited...\"Are you going to say something or just keep staring at me like an idiot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um...maybe some other time.\" Max said, with a nervous grin. Smooth. Time to move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0HR Drone droned on about how it was very important that she memorize everyone's names and faces. She'd remember that name and face at least, little miss Pepper Black. She'd remember that face, for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And this butt! She would remember this butt until the end of her days.  As she rounded a corner, standing in front of her, was one of the biggest butts she'd ever seen. And then the owner of that butt picked up the binder she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d dropped and turned to face her. She had and even<i> bigger</i> belly and chest.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Plenty of people were shocked when Harper Black had brought home Sam Palmero home for supper one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a mother of three and just over forty, no one had ever expected her to develop a taste for other women this late in life. Certainly not Harper herself, who had gotten a little buzzed after a few too many beers barely a month beforehand and loudly proclaimed to her daughters in the living room that she was done with dating. Done. D-O-N-E done; she\u2019d spelled it out just like that, standing in the living room in her pajamas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman sitting at the head of the table opposite Harper was an obvious contradiction to that statement, in that she had been brought to the Black dinner table as their mother\u2019s date for the evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, there was nothing wrong with dating girls. Piper\u2014the responsible middle child and a frequent movie-goer at Sam's theatre!\u2014had been wondering just where she fell on the Kinsey scale after a cute little girl from Texas had moved into town, and Parker\u2014the oldest\u2014was no stranger to getting a little too drunk and making out with other women for attention. The orientation of their mother wasn\u2019t the strangest thing about her latest attraction, so much as it was how differently they expected her mother bringing a woman home to go down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo start, Sam was a fair bit younger than Harper. The big woman that Harper had brought home proudly wrapped around her arm was thirty to her forty, a full ten years (and change!) younger than the Black family matriarch. Then there was her accent. She clearly didn\u2019t come from bumfuck North Carolina like the rest of them. With her big hair, leather jacket, hoop earrings and pronounced accent, Sam stuck out like a sore thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was before she started the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou used ta go to South 29, didn\u2019t ya?\u201d Sam asked, open-mouth with excitement after a small smack to Parker\u2019s arm, \"<i>Oh my GAWD you're the putz from the bar!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what now?\u201d Harper raised a curious, skeptical eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re not gonna believe this Harpah.\u201d Sam chuckled as she turned back to her date of the evening, \u201cI beat the snot outta this one a few months back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe size difference between Sam and everyone else in the room couldn\u2019t have been more obvious. She was broad-shouldered, wide-hipped, and thick armed. Her hands were the size of softballs! Not to mention the weight difference (there was certainly some extra padding to fill out her bigger frame that further set her apart from the other svelte girls at the table). It was really easy to see how someone of Sam\u2019s size could have knocked a lazy freeloader like Parker on her ass, and that should have been the end of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept it wasn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Harper\u2019s shocked expression quickly melted into a boisterous laughter, \u201cMy <i>God</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve <i>got </i>to be kidding me.\u201d Piper was grinning ear to ear, her chin propped up in both hands as her elbows planted on the table, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, please tell me more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck, Pitstain?\u201d Parker gasped, \u201cMom, Jesus Christ!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so.\u201d Sam said, turning so as to include Parker in the regaling of their awkward first encounter, \u201cThere I was with my friend Max. An\u2019 y\u2019know we\u2019re talkin\u2019 about whatever. Who cares, it doesn\u2019t matter. When this one\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam pointed a thumb at Parker<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I said HEY, people are tryin ta DRINK here! An' I don't remember what THIS ONE said, but LET ME TELL YOU\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI was <i>SO ANGRY</i> I coulda <i>plotzed</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd somehow after that every date, whether they were at home or out on the town, was miles less awkward than that time she told her girlfriend about the time she literally kicked her daughter\u2019s ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper and Sam were so smitten with each other, you would have thought they were teenagers. Whenever they had the free time, they were always talking to one another. Harper would hide her phone underneath her desk at the Yeng offices at text her new girlfriend, and Sam would prop herself up at the Rio theatre and check out moviegoers with one hand while snapping cute selfies with the other. They met up at least three, four times a week. Harper got off at four every day and Sam could make her own hours, so they quickly started to see a lot of each other. They went out for dinners, they watched old movies on the big screen in private showings that Sam had arranged. As simple as it sounded, Harper and Sam fell for each other hard and they fell for each other fast.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHarper.\u201d The older woman kept the syllables on her lover\u2019s nose, tapping at Sam\u2019s proud Italian schnoz, \u201cC\u2019mon. You can do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHah-pah.\u201d Sam repeated in her thick accent, only to be met with a forkful of spaghetti.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarrrpe<i>rrrrr</i>.\u201d She giggled, wrapping her free arm around Sam\u2019s broad bronzed shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I said!\u201d Sam answered incredulously, \u201cHaaaaah-<i>paaaaah</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them began to titter. The night had been perfect. Sam had done everything, earning the affections of an overworked mother of two the old-fashioned way by bringing good wine, candles and incense, and topping it off with a glass container of spaghetti and home-made garlic bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It\u2019s okay. One day you'll get it right.\" Harper leaned in with eskimo kisses<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already did.\" Sam said with a smile as she pressed her lips against her girlfriend\u2019s for a long, passionate kiss. <br>\r\n\"Now get offa me, yer layin' on dinna. I'm gonna barf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting Parker and Piper out of the house hadn\u2019t been hard. Keeping them out of the house all night would later prove to be more difficult, as they\u2019d learn at three a.m. But for now, in the candle-lit living room of the tiny Black abode, all that mattered was the two of them. <br>\r\nTogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, I know how you feel.\u201d Harper retreated back to her side of the table, her soft stomach swollen with more carbs than she knew what to do with, \u201cI ate way too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo such thing.\u201d Sam bit off another forkful of what remained of her plate, \u201cIt\u2019s good, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s great.\u201d Harper admitted, \u201cIf all your cooking is this good, I might start to get fat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s\u2026\u201d Sam bit her bottom lip, \u201cHave this conversation later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam leaned in and licked the corners of Harper\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike tomorrow over breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the first night that they made love, and it would be far from the last...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith very few faults to find with one another, Harper and Sam only continued their love affair. Dinners every week, then every other night, breakfast on the weekends and cute little lunch dates all started to add up. The two lovebirds only continued to fall further and further head over heels for one another and be obnoxiously cute about it until, eventually, Sam moved out of her crappy one-bedroom apartment and into the Black household. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one (except for Parker, naturally) could find a good enough reason to complain about the newest addition to their already cramped home life, but it wasn't until after Sam moved in that it was becoming increasingly obvious...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When she wasn't at the movie theatre, Sam kept herself busy by making family recipes by the boat load. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It helps me feel more at home\u2014I cook when I'm stressed.\" she'd say, stirring a pot of her mama's sauce, \"Whaddaya want from me, I just moved all the way across town! Now open yer mouth an' tell me what you think, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't like anyone was going to complain about it. Harper's nine to five kept her from being too terribly domestic, Piper had the same excuse while also having no talent in the kitchen at all, and Parker was... Parker. The fact that they weren't eating takeout every other night or living off of cheap sandwich meat was enough, but these women were getting <i>home-made</i>, <i>traditional Italian cooking</i> every night, with plenty of leftovers. The dinner table would be filled and emptied like clockwork at every meal, and honestly no one in the Black Family could remember a time when any of them had eaten so well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it made Sam feel good to have found her niche in her girlfriend's family, and she wasn't exactly <i>complaining</i> about the extra inches that found themselves going Harper's way, sooo... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt just sort've happened!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's position at the Rio became more administrative, she made sure the table was full and everyone was happy, and Harper and her girls got really, <i>really</i> fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam got up before everyone else in the house to make breakfast every day except Sunday mornings\u2014that was <i>her</i> time, and there wasn't ever <i>not</i> leftovers for her girls to grub on before dinner. That way she got one good day of sleeping in, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's hands could palm a basketball, but ever since she had placed herself in charge of keeping Harper fed, she'd been having more and more trouble getting a good handful on her girlfriend's gut. Back when it was a little tum, a nice little layer of olive-brown chub that hung over her panties, no problem. Even as it blossomed out into a tummy, and then a belly proper, Sam had always been well-equipped to get the jiggle job done. She loved to feel Harper's stomach wobble between her fingers while she slept, to feel the weight of her girth heavy in her hands. But now that Harper had grown an out and out gut, Sam was finding for the first time that even her hands weren't big enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer girlfriend was huge. Her milf-y figure had been signed over as soon as she entered a relationship with Sam. In exchange for a soft, but hot, mom bod Harper had ballooned up into a melon-chested heifer. Her round face hid prominent features behind chunky cheeks and a low second chin, with a little orange dot of Bolognese leftover from last night. While she slept, Harper's huge chest\u2014famous around town even before she started to chunk up\u2014sloped to either side of her and nestled in the crevice of her insulating puddles of arm fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Granita.\" Sam said with a soft sloshing motion across Harper's cuddlefluff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrm.\" Harper's face scrunched, \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes good morning.\" Sam said with a squeeze of Harper's belly as inched closet to the edge of their bed, \"Sleep well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still sleep.\" Harper grumbled, \"Sunday sleepday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nine 'o' clock!\" Sam said a little loudly, \"You don't wanna sleep all day, do ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do.\" Harper whined, \"Sleep all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam watched her girthy girlfriend wobble on the bed petulantly, fighting consciousness as she struggled to stay asleep. In nothing but yesterday's lacy top, her boulder-sized bra flung over the closet door and her biggest pair of pants lying next to it, all of Harper's flabby flesh was free to puddle wherever it liked. Her belly grumbled, equally as petulant as the rest of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not even a <i>little</i> hungry?\" Sam teased her girlfriend, giving her gut a playful tap, \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarper paused and made a face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breakfast in bed.\" she finally said, \"If we've got anything leftover from last night, I want that. Or pancakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam hurried excitedly out from under the sheets, her own softening body jiggling excitedly. These days were becoming more and more common on Sundays, and they were her favorites. Harper was getting so lazy these days, and Sam was just the girl to help her out. Even if it didn't result in an especially round of heavy petting, it was always fun lay in bed with Harper, watching TV while they ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the hall, into the living room and finally into the kitchen, Sam hurried to the fridge. However, finding a big round butt sticking out of it wasn't exactly what she'd expected this early in the morning. Harper's girls were just as lazy as she was, so seeing them up and rolling before she was came as a bit of a shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sam.\" Piper burped, scratching her exposed stomach as it rolled out over her sweats, \"Morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper was the most helpful around the house, and Sam had known her for quite a while. Back when she was a teenager, she used to come into the Rio. She'd never have guessed in a million years that she'd be a running candidate for step-daughter, or that they'd wind up living together. They liked each other! Which was probably why Sam gave preferential treatment Piper's way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat? It was a thing, people do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Pipey.\" Sam said, wrapping her arms around her chubby not-daughter, \"Sleep well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After last night?\" Piper snorted, cracking open a Pepsi can, \"I slept like a rock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like Harper, Piper had started to put on a lot of weight when Sam moved in. She looked a lot like her mother, especially as she started to fill out, T&amp;A first. Piper was wearing hand-me-downs from her ma, bras and shirts that could fit her rapidly expanding physique didn't come cheap after all. She seemed to take to having Sam around the best\u2014not like that other one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna do something today?\" Piper asked, plopping down at the dinner table with her first bowl of cereal, \"Dakota's at work and Zack is being stupid, so my whole day's free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, sorry, me an' yer ma got plans honey.\" Sam made a face as her soft belly touched the inside of the fridge, \"I promised her a lazy day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least, a laz-<i>ier</i> day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe later, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh.\" Piper groaned, her head rolling back, \"Dumb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just you wait.\" Sam stuck her tongue out, \"When you find the right one, all you'll wanna do is lay in bed and eat pasta with them too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is my soulmate Garfield?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably, with how you scarf down lasagna.\" Sam snorted, \"Hey, where's that stuff from last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not in there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, should be right... fuckin'... here?\" Sam grunted as she stuck her arm in further towards the back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Parker ate it?\" Piper offered less-than-helpfully, \"Saw her fat ass sticking out of the fridge last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always with the midnight snacking...\" Sam muttered under her breath, feeling the pressure of so many hungry mouths to feed, \"What do I get? Nothin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike her mother and sister, Parker had taken well to the new menu presented by Sam's presence in the house. Unlike her mother and sister, Parker didn't have a lot to keep her out of the house throughout the day. Most days, she stayed home while Sam cooked. She specifically asked which days Sam was going to be at the Rio, and then <i>conveniently</i> decided to go out those days. Without anything to distract her besides her usual routine of daytime tv and various social media feeds, Parker had grown quite accustomed to eating literally whenever and whatever she wanted. And since all she did was sleep and lay around all day, it was a wonder they hadn't had to roll her out of the house yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuckin' freeloader.\" Sam rolled her eyes, \"Pancakes it is, I guess...\"</span></div></div>",

Starr was one of Dr. McCarthy's most successful projects. Once a promising high school athlete, Starr had nearly quadrupled in size in the months since she began sampling products. She'd developed a very lovely double tiered belly, and her small breasts had become huge, flat, shapeless things. It provided helpful data in adipose development predictions. The fact that she came covered in tattoos, which became distorted and distended as even her arms formed rolls, folding over themselves, was a nice aesthetic plus. While physical growth was a byproduct of their business model, not a benchmark as far as Yeng's higher up's were concerned, things could be a little different in Dr. McCarthy's research unit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAdded to her tasks of soothing her stomach, she as trying to give Dr. McCarthy coherent answers and do some actual product feedback. \"It's like...it's not like I'm hungry, but I just have these weird cravings for things. I want to eat...I want to eat just the same thing, forever, sometimes, you know?\" She punctuated her answer with a wet belch, and then went back to focusing on more sour cream. Because she was so exhausted, and because she wouldn't stop eating to answer questions, she was making a mess of herself, smearing sour cream on her face and cleavage. It was hard to tell if she didn't notice, or didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo the project was going well. Dr Evie McCarthy picked up another gallon tub of sour cream and held it out for Starr, her long, elegant shapely limbs contrasted sharply with the pale and pondourously thick limbs of her test subject. They were opposites in every way, in fact, while she was a slender, disciplined professional, this girl was a pile of pudge with no self control.  Could the girl stop? Could she even slow down? \"And does that bother you?\" she asked, more for her own curiosity. She had plenty of time to get back to the marketing research.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really.\" Starr grunted. \"It's just kind of weird. And sometimes I get like, actually hungry when I have a craving...but I can't stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're hungry, you should eat,\" Evie deadpanned while, inwardly, she felt a schoolgirl giddiness. This was going so much than she dared hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sour cream was laced with a quasi-legal addictive substance. It was fairly standard practice. After all, sugar was addictive, and that's why all processed food in the US had some amount of sugar or corn syrup in. And since YS-423 was a homeopathic supplement, it fell into a legal limbo where there was no FDA oversight, technically allowing Yeng to use it as a sweetener as long as they were up front about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut on top of that, YS-423 did a number on the human metabolism, speeding (or \"aiding\") digestion, enhancing appetite, and numbing the stomach's nerve endings to diminish feelings of fullness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if I ate a real meal, I couldn't get my sour cream fix.\" Starr complained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose you can eat both,\" Evie mused. \"If you promise to finish the meal, we'll let you keep your sour cream while you eat it. All right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I just want to eat sour cream.\" She said, surprisingly sharply. She apparently had forgotten that she was supposed oto be testing what Dr. McCarthy told her to test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie made a note on her clipboard (\"subject grows uncooperative when faced with perceived loss of sour cream\") and put her hands sternly on her hips. \"Now, Starr, remember that you agreed to this testing. If you don't cooperate with me now, I will take the sour cream, and Yeng will eject you from this study with no compensation. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...OK.\" She grumbled, struggling and failing to cross her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie nodded and moved outside to have a robotic aide bring the girl a real meal, then sat back down to observe. Watching Starr eat was a fascinating experience. She barely seemed to notice the world around her until Evie came in to ask questions. Nothing else existed but that bucket of sour cream. Did she even know that she'd been eating sour cream almost nonstop for two and half weeks? Evie was already planning for ways to keep her around long after the study was over. After all, Marketing didn't care what she did as long as she got results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robot approached Starr with a thick, juicy hamburger that was almost as big as the dinner plate it sat on, and an equally sized portion of thick home fries. Both topped with a ridiculous amount of cheese, bacon, onions, and more sour cream, and the provided drink was a two-liter of Yeng Cola. Naturally, all of it was laced with YS-423. \t<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could finish her fun though, Dr. McCarthy's cellphone buzzed. She only used it for work, so she knew it was important. It was from...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Come out with me.\" Was the text message on McCarthy's phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcCarthy was half distracted by an article she was reading and, without bothering to actually check the time, sent back, \"I haven't missed lunch. It's only 11.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You missed it the last three days.\".\" McCarthy knew that Schwartz had voyeuristic habits that would have been considered, extremely unprofessional in a normal work environment. But this wasn't a normal work environment, and Schwartz, despite her habits, was still a close friend, and mostly just used it to give McCarthy little helping hints like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she missed lunch that much? Meh. \"All right. Where to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tacos or Chinese?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tacos. I've been looking at Chinese for three days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchwartz knew just where to go, and translated McCarthy's order for her, so that soon she was eating the most authentic fish tacos in Daven's Port wrapped in tinfoil with her best, and probably only friend. And of course, they were talking shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how's your Starr project coming along?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's gained another 50 pounds and started refusing foods other than sour cream again. I'm thinking of releasing her and seeing what happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she knew what happen. That was part of the fun. Starr would try to get her fix from regular sour cream and be completely unable, and eventually, she'd come crawling back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it kind of counterproductive if they stop eating other foods?\" Schwartz pointed out. She at least liked to pretend she was a responsible adult who wanted to help her employers make money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcCarthy waved her hand dismissively. \"The other subjects in the study behaved as expected.

I'm a little...between projects right now.\" Schwartz admitted, feeling embarrassed. \"It's like writers block.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really is,\" McCarthy sighed. \"I think that's why I'm toying with Starr so much lately. I love working for Yeng, but I haven't done anything just for me in ages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchwartz took a chug of water, and stared off into the sun thoughtfully. \"We've got to have some vacation time stored up right? I mean, when was the last time we took a day off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even remember.\" McCarthy glanced around at all the people. \"Where would you go if you went on vacation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I /went/ somewhere, probably back home.\" Schwartz shrugged. \"But that's not what I'm thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you thinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taking some time right around here, in Daven's Port. Doing what we enjoy for ourselves...or at least finding some inspiration. It's hard knowing how to trick consumers when you only have lab rats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, we could probably spin this as a new project and get funding for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably.\" Schwartz crumpled up the aluminum foil that was all that was left of her taco, tossed it in the trash, and wiped her mouth. \" So where do we start?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Third floor? Uh, Convenience Technologies?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sounded like he expected her to remember him, so she uttered a brief polite laugh, as though in recognition while she searched her memory. \u201cAh, yes, Louis. The...birthday party. Two weeks ago. You were...working on home hubs?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sounded please and relieved. \u201cThat\u2019s right! Yeah. God, it\u2019s really nice talking to you again. How have you been?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, for god\u2019s sake\u2026 \u201cBusy,\u201d she answered, smiling so hard that she was gritting her teeth in an effort to fooling her brain into thinking this was a pleasant interaction. It wasn\u2019t really working, but at least she kept her voice under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, she remembered Louis. Smart. Treated her like she was smart, too, which was a pleasant change from the other men she\u2019d met in his field. Spent the whole conversation not quite staring at her cleavage, but at least he was \u201cnot quite\u201d staring instead of openly staring. On the whole, could have been worse. And now, he was calling her work number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I swear to God, if he asks me for drinks\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill busy, in fact,\u201d she added quickly before he could do just that. \u201cI\u2019m with a subject. Do you need help with something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right! Uh...\u201d Well, at least he had the good graces to sound embarrassed. \u201cWell, our product is entering the initial testing phases, and we\u2019re sending a few units out to some select folk for feedback. I was wondering if you wanted to try one out. Might help with being busy...\u201d He was trying to sound tempting. Well, it did sound pretty tempting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. After that fiasco with Alexa and the dollhouse? And the follow-up fiasco with the news report about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Louis said firmly. And quickly. He really wanted to make this sale. \u201cOr at least, we will immediately rectify the situation if it tries. And of course, you\u2019d be well compensated for you time. All we ask is that you let us install the device, and then talk to it like it\u2019s a real person. Uh, a personal servant who will never complain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie sighed and rubbed the bridge of her nose. She should say no. At the very least, she didn\u2019t want to give Louis any ideas about further relationship potential. He clearly found her attractive (she knew that just by the tone of his voice) and might very well be using this test as an excuse to get closer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, she was curious what they\u2019d cooked up. Rumors had been circulating about the device for some months, stuff about holographic interfaces and artificial neural mapping and real conversation potential. And while she was reasonably certain similar conversations had gone around Google and Amazon\u2019s R&amp;D offices, she was getting excited for it in spite of herself. Plus, compensation was always good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d she said finally. \u201cBut I want to know what I\u2019m getting into. Have someone meet with me tomorrow to go over the manual and design specs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can absolutely do that!\u201d He was probably planning to do it himself. \u201cThanks, Doc. This really means  a lot to us down here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it does.\u201d She hung up before he could gush any further. He didn\u2019t call back, so that must have been the end of it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well, it was super advanced. Hyper advanced, even. Installation involved turning Evie\u2019s modest ranch-style home into a big Star Trek holodeck. There were so many cameras and sensors that it felt like a maximum security prison. Though she\u2019d put a moratorium on installing them in the bathroom. Oh, sure, they said no one was going to be watching, but she was savvy. She knew that kind of thing could get misused by the wrong people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t help that she couldn\u2019t see them unless she got really close. The installation team had really done a stand up job. They told her where every single camera, sensor, and projector was located, and she\u2019d already lost track of half of them. For all she knew, they\u2019d ignored her request and installed them in the bathroom anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t terribly comfortable with this, but she\u2019d agreed to it. So. No time like the present to hit the big red button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glowing, blue, almost hypnotic sphere appeared in the middle of her living room. It was astounding; there was no static, no projection lines, like when you looked up at a movie theater. It seemed absolutely real, like she could  reach out and touch it. It spoke to her in an electronic, implacable, impossible voice, and pulsed slightly with every word. \"Greetings. Please speak with me a while as I configure myself to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie squirmed and glanced around as though she might find an audience. She\u2019d owned and iPhone, and she always felt stupid talking to Siri. She felt stupid now talking to a glowing sphere. She wanted this technology so badly. Why did it have to be so embarrassing to interact with it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will we talk about?\" she forced herself to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you? And Who am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Dr. Evie McCarthy.\u201d Louis had warned her what to expect, so she wasn\u2019t flailing around on this point, at least. \"And your name is Hermia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hermia. Feminine form of Hermes. Should I present as female to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice adjusted, to a very generic women's voice. 'Would you like me to take on a human appearance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please provide parameters for ideal female appearance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scarlet Johansson,\" Evie said promptly. She'd already picked out an appearance, but as she took a breath to elaborate, her eyes landed on her copy of Fifth Element, and she suddenly had a better idea. \"Or wait...maybe Milla Jovovich.\" Was that a better idea? Maybe she should stick with what she had planned. Damn it, now, she was all indecisive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fascinating. Please continue,\u201d it encouraged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now I'm not sure,\" Evie admitted, sighing. \"I know I want a red head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" Hermia said happily. Her voice had changed again. Now, it was something between the two actress's voices. \"Can you suggest a fashion taste for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cyberpunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A novel choice. Do you have interest in cyberpunk outside of fashion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some. I liked the Matrix. I like science fiction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting. What is it you wish me to be? A friend? A servant? A mentor? A fantasy girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Servant,\" Evie answered, hesitating slightly. She hadn't expected to hear \"fantasy girlfriend\" and was now wondering if someone (Louis) was having her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sphere became a redhead dressed in a black tanktop and leather pants with red hair that came in a sharp wedge down the left side of her face and striking green eyes. She certainly resembled Scarlett Johansen and Milla Jovovich, but she didn't look like a lazy 50/50 pattern. She was her own person, like the two had a child. \"And remember, you can always change my appearance or parameters later,\" it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to know, but for now, I like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Should I address you as Dr. McCarthy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me Evie, please. I get enough Dr. McCarthy at work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. You sound like you could use some relaxation, Evie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was an understatement. There were cameras everywhere, and she felt like a zoo animal. Beta testing was nerve wracking. \"I could, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you sit down, and tell me how you like to relax?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie's eyes flicked toward the couch before she moved towards it and awkwardly sat down. \"I read,\" she answered. But since she really didn't want Yeng to have a record of her harlequin romance collection, she added, \"Or watch TV. I think that might be good tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you'd enjoy a beverage or snack while you do so?\" Hermia offered helpfully. As it moved, Evie could see the limitations of its 3D model. It looked like perfect, supple white flesh, but its motions were stiff, awkward...robotic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'll take beer and popcorn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled happily. \"I'll get that right away for you, Evie\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie turned on the TV and leaned back, trying to force herself to relax. She really did want to give this thing a chance. Current home hubs could only answer questions and shop, and if her experience with her iPhone was any indication, they would do both of those things whether you wanted them to or not. A holographic personal servant was leagues ahead, and Evie wanted one, damn it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hermia came back, she was carrying both the cold beer and hot popcorn in either 'hand'. That was impressive. Evie didn\u2019t realize their holographic technology had progressed that much. Maybe she\u2019d take some extra time with this thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie nodded acknowledgement and took both, setting the popcorn down next to her. She suddenly remembered she was still wearing her lab coat and shoes. She hadn't changed at all since getting home, just went straight to turning on Hermia. God, this whole situation had her flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem a little overdressed to relax. Would you like me to take your shoes of?\" Hermia offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you.\" Evie stretched out her feet for the hologram and, simultaneously, started trying to struggle out of her lab coat. It was harder than it needed to be since she was sitting on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can get that for you,\" it offered, bending down and taking her shoes off very, very carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Evie let it finish before she finished taking off her coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermia was nicely unobtrusive after that. It didn\u2019t speak unless spoken to, and it didn\u2019t complain when Evie asked for refills. Once she got used to the cameras, that weekend was, quite possibly, the most relaxing one she\u2019d had yet. On Sunday evening\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>No one in the Yeng R&amp;D department was particularly excited when it was announced that they\u2019d be getting a new intern. Even the manipulative Dr. Helen Schwartz and her sadistic sidekick Dr. Evie McCarthy weren\u2019t phased by the idea. The interns, they were all the same\u2014college undergrads with no real interest in the services that the Yeng Corporation provided, nor any higher purpose for being much other than another of their consumers somewhere down the line. They\u2019d come, they\u2019d go, and it had all become so painfully dull. Not everyone was a Piper Black, you know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs hum-drum as they could make it sound, Helen and Evie were hardly what you might call domesticated scientists. They\u2019d spend their days twisting and warping their colleagues, coworkers, and even superiors to fit their devilish desires. Helen, a master of psychology and the workings of the inner mind who loved to \u201cimprove\u201d upon her subjects, Evie, a passion for tweaking and testing the biology to satisfy her twisted taste for fear and fat. They were quite the pair; and unfortunately, this new intern didn\u2019t quite fit in.<br>\r\nShe was some rich girl, fresh from some pompous overstuffed preparatory school in the mountains and \u201cgetting life experience\u201d before she settled into what would surely be an equally unimaginative business major. Half the time they couldn\u2019t even be bothered to remember her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvie\u2026 <i>Sch\u00e4tzchen</i>\u2026 I\u2019m only going to ask you this once.\u201d Dr. Schwartz raised an eyebrow as she stood, hand on hip, in the middle of the doctor\u2019s lab. Her accent was thick and at times, quite intimidating. \u201cDid you try to drug me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany knew of Evie McCarthy\u2019s horrible habits when it came to the overweight. But very few, including Helen, knew just where that attitude came from. Evie delighted in teasing, torturing, and most importantly further fattening the already obese. Plenty of patients found themselves expanding, then being reprimanded to uncomfortable and creepy levels by the tall waifish doctor, but very few were aware that it was simply fuel to her fetish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would never do such a thing and you know it.\u201d Evie said without looking up from her microscope, \u201cI\u2019d be far too afraid of what happened if you found out it was me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell somebody has made a very misguided and unsuccessful attempt at slipping me the VX-32 serum.\u201d Helen held one well-padded arm in front of her, holding a pale blue file with the aforementioned labeling on it, \u201cAnd, if I am not mistaken, you are currently in charge of that particular appetite stimulant, ja?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJa.\u201d Evie in mimicry of Helen\u2019s accent as she slid out from underneath her desk, kicking off with her long black legs and halting in front of the chubby blue-haired doctor, \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t me. I respect you far too much to do something like that. When you finally let yourself blow up, I want it to be entirely your fault.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAch.\u201d Helen pinched the bridge of her nose, \u201cI swear, you can have such a one-track mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo if it wasn\u2019t Evie\u2026 who could it have been then? The number of people who had the clearance to enter both Helen\u2019s office and Evie\u2019s lab was incredibly slim. And the number of people who would even begin to know what they were looking for in Dr. McCarthy\u2019s lab put that number even lower. Not to mention the dangerously slim pickings of people who thought that crossing either of them was a good idea\u2026</span></div></div>",

Portly, with round welcoming features. However, when the need arose, she was capable of so very much more. The flames that flickered in her eyes shone brighter and burned hotter than hellfire, and with good reason. Helen was the best she was at what they did, and it might be time to work their way out of their little slump. A certain intern was in need of correction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are so very right.\u201d Helen said with a small, but horrifying smile, \u201cLet us instruct our young friend in such regards, yah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few weeks, Helen allowed herself to indulge. She was already a bit on the stocky side; her short stature and a taste for both German and Hispanic foods had left her at a pleasingly plump two hundred and thirty pounds before all this had started. However, using her vast control over her own mind, Helen made the necessary adjustments to her appetite. She could eat whatever she wanted (and in such quantities!), and she got to kick back a little to allow her newest project to do the heavy lifting. Admittedly, getting to kick her feet up and snack while bossing around her newest charge was quite enjoyable. Within that time, results were showing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I am such a terrible boss.\u201d Helen said in a put-on sort of voice. The kind she used when talking to children. It was especially German, playing up her foreign status, \u201cLazing around all day while I stuff <i>mein bauch</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chubby-chasing intern could only react inwardly as she watched the chubby woman stroke her bloated belly. Hannah Hammond had been subverting her boss\u2019s every attempt at exercise for the past few weeks\u2014she\u2019d barely let Dr. Schwartz lift a finger for herself, and it was finally coming full circle. Combined with the appetite stimulants she\u2019d been slipping into her coffee every morning and ensuring that every meal she gophered back to her office was full and rich in carbs, fats, and sugars, Hannah couldn\u2019t have been more satisfied with herself. Dr. Schwartz must have put on thirty pounds by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHannah?\u201d the tiny blue-haired woman purred, \u201cAre you listening?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Of course!\u201d Hannah snapped back to attention, her eyes diverting from the shy smile of pale blubber showing from underneath her blouse, \u201cIt\u2019s no trouble at all, Helen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDr. Schwartz.\u201d Helen corrected, \u201cBut aside from your familiarity, I am quite pleased with your internship so far. You have taken such a load off of mein shoulders\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah smiled, her tongue running along the inside of her teeth. She couldn\u2019t wait until Dr. Schwartz was as big as Polluck was back home. They had so much in common\u2014a little older, short, overworked. It was only a matter of time before the same strategy that pinned Polluck down behind her desk in blubber would do the same to the good doctor here. Hannah could just feel it. Today, Dr. Schwartz was cresting north of what had to have been two hundred and fifty pounds. By the end of her internship? Who knew how big that tiny little chair squasher could get?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is to say, I think you deserve a treat.\u201d Helen smiled insidiously, very mindful of Hannah\u2019s inner monologue that played plain as day across her face, \u201cYou are doing such a wonderful job, and I simply insist you order us something yummy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cU-Us?\u201d Hannah smiled, \u201cOf course! I\u2019ll just\u2026 you know, I\u2019ve got to\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAch, I insist. Take the night off!\u201d Helen\u2019s wolfish grin making Hannah feel the slightest bit uneasy, \u201cI won\u2019t take a bite if you don\u2019t enjoy it with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah gulped. But eventually, she complied.</span></div></div>",

Hannah\u2019s buttons were so easily pressed that it hardly took any effort at all to get her to compromise herself. All Helen had to do was lean back, untuck her growing tum, and complain about how full she was. Every time she came to work, Hannah was bombarded with subliminal imagery that picked at her fetish. Pick, pick, pick, that\u2019s all Helen had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her desk was a framed photograph of herself and Dr. McCarthy. Tilting it ever so slightly made it so that Hannah could see the contrast between the once merely chubby woman and the blue-haired gourmand that sat behind the desk. She was another twenty pounds heavier after only a short time, and the contrast between the two Schwartzes became more apparent by the day. In the frame, a merely chubby scientist, and behind the desk was a woman nearing three hundred pounds and getting closer by the day. Instead of keeping the jar of candies on her desk filled for her patients, Dr. Schwartz had started keeping it half-emptied, to imply that she\u2019d been snacking liberally of her own accord. She\u2019d waited before switching to larger sizes, simply so she could watch Hannah squirm as her swelling shape threatened to pop right out of her sweaters, blouses, and bottoms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite fun, to say the least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Helen made sure that the only release that Hannah could find, at least while on the clock, was through food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah\u2019s lunches with Dr. McCarthy had continued only because of Helen\u2019s instructions. It was imperative that the two of them remain on speaking terms. Hannah would require the kind of prodding that only Dr. McCarthy could give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Helen\u2019s getting kind\u2019ve fat these days.\u201d Evie purred, slinking next to the poor undersexed heiress, \u201cYou have anything to do with that?\u201d<br>\r\nHannah\u2019s heart nearly jumped right out of her chest. She\u2019d almost choked on her cookies\u2014crumbs spewed everywhere as she went into a loud coughing fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No!\u201d Hannah balked. Her whole life she\u2019d been doing this, and Dr. McCarthy had been the only one to call her out like that! \u201cWh-Why would I\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax. Personally? She\u2019s had it coming to her.\u201d Evie\u2019s pronounced features contrasted to the drawn nature of her cheeks and face made her somewhat uncomfortable to look at when she made evil faces like that, \u201cI think you\u2019re doing a great job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 you do?\u201d Hannah asked with a strange sense of hopefulness to her voice, \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 I\u2019m not in trouble?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrouble? Nooooo!\u201d Dr. McCarthy snickered evilly to herself. This poor girl had no idea how much trouble she was in for. \u201cIn fact, I think it\u2019s amazing. I can just see it now, can\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah gulped, her hands working in and out of her bag of cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod this was hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, don\u2019t play dumb. Helen\u2019s going to be a real whale at this rate. Sweaty, that belly of hers sagging everywhere, so fat she can\u2019t even make it down the hallways?\u201d Evie was immensely amused by the idea herself, \u201cSurrounded by all that jiggly fat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah had emptied her bag, been made aware of the burning sensation in her sex. Hannah needed release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou probably don\u2019t know this, but I design equipment for those fat hogs that let themselves get so morbidly obese that they can\u2019t walk.\u201d Dr. McCarthy readied the nail to drive Hannah home, \u201cAnd if you keep this up\u2026 who knows? Maybe we\u2019ll see Helen in\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019VE GOT TO GO NOW.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah rose suddenly, discarded packages of swallowed snacks falling to her feet as she hurried out of the lab. Towards the bathroom. Towards anywhere with some privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t forget, you\u2019re doing a great job!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Hannah had a comrade in arms in her war against Schwartz\u2019s waistline, she found herself going to Dr. McCarthy a lot more. She spent more time in the lab, even after hours, and liberally indulged her newfound compatriot in her desires. Finally, someone who understood her. Someone she could talk to about her desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026\u201d Hannah, encouraged by the familiarity between them, had taken to talking with Evie while mindlessly grazing on food from the snack machines. Today was no exception. \u201cI can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m doing enough. She\u2019s started to slow down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, keep it up.\u201d Evie steepled her fingers across her flat chest as she watched Hannah scarf down sour cream and onion chips, \u201cWe\u2019re just getting started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah nodded, her soft face creasing slightly at what would surely grow into a fine second chin. Between Doctors Schwartz and McCarthy, Hannah never wanted much for food. They kept her well-fed during her internship, but the long hours she\u2019d been putting in at the R&amp;D department meant that she hadn\u2019t had any time to tend to herself. All of her eggs were in the Schwartz basket for now, and it was so stressful. She just wasn\u2019t gaining fast enough! Hannah needed a release.<br>\r\nHelen and Evie had made sure that food was that release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, drink this.\u201d Dr. McCarthy pushed a small coffee cup and teabag towards the young intern, \u201cIt\u2019ll calm your nerves.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Would you be an absolute dear und help me find it?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah was a sweating, panting mess. She\u2019d just gotten back from delivering one of Schwartz\u2019s epic meals, carrying it all by herself up through the lobby and holding it all together for god knows how many floors on the elevator. Dr. Schwartz had kept her behind the desk so much lately that her legs weren\u2019t used to it anymore. Her chunky thighs pumped, struggling to support her bloating upper body as her tummy quaked with every step. The familiar smells had overwhelmed her\u2014she knew that all of this was for her boss, but she was so hungry\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHfff\u2026 okaaaay\u2026\u201d Hannah whined, her eyes bulging at the sight of Helen\u2019s bare naked belly showing for all to see. The lower three buttons had burst right out from her blouse, allowing that pale fleshy stomach to ooze out into her lap, spreading her thick thighs apart. Helen\u2019s unrestrained gut hung between her legs, pouring off of the seat of her office chair. Her double chin creased around her neck, her cheeks burying her features. Dr. Schwartz was becoming buried in that greedy, squishably soft fat\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAch, I know, I\u2019m turning into such a piglet.\u201d Dr. Schwartz cupped her stomach with two chubby hands, \u201cWhat is his name? Porky Pig.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYuh\u2026\u201d Hannah licked her lips, \u201cI\u2026 I have to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you must help me find my buttons!\u201d Dr. Schwartz cried in faux helplessness, giving a falsified but showy, jiggling struggle against her bulk only to remain seated in her chair, \u201cI can fix them if you help me find them, but you do not expect me to walk around with my belly hanging out all day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah\u2019s brain bluescreened. Food. Belly. Fat. Schwartz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I suppose you are right. We can look after lunch.\u201d Helen smiled devilishly as she kicked her chubby legs until she was back behind her desk, \u201cCome Hannah, eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah smacked her lips and lumbered over. Her loins aching at the sight of her boss\u2019s stomach sloshing freely in her lap. Forkful after forkful, Hannah could only stare at that stomach in silence. She barely noticed the satisfied smirk of a plan coming together on Helen\u2019s round face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Hannah\u2019s internship was over, her goal was completed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting behind her desk, Dr. Schwartz had nearly doubled her starting weight. She was a big blue-haired ball of belly. It hung low and slapped against her thighs whenever she waddled around her office, burdensomely big and fabulously fleshy. What\u2019s more, she had these chubby little appendages that were being buried from the top, her upperarms wobbled and sagged to bury her elbows, just as her knees were enveloped by the pillowy thigh fat a big round arsch that wobbled and weighed her down from behind. Everything about her had become soft, round, and jovial in appearance. Must have been the German in her. The glasses on her fat face pushed slightly into her round cheeks that rounded and met to melt into a waxing crescent double chin. The corners of her mouth, up until a few minutes ago, had born the breadth of her latest indulgence\u2014more Mexican food went into that tubby little scientist than one might have thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, Dr. Schwartz had gotten fat. Very, very fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut between the psychological manipulation, being caught between two experts in the field, Hannah had paid a very dear price for her meager goals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose you are wondering why I have called you here.\u201d Dr. Schwartz spoke in her normal voice, not the pandering one she\u2019d taken to dealing with Hannah since the discovery of her ambitions, \u201cYes, it is so that I may discuss your internship, but it is also moreso that I may discuss you. Hannah. And what you\u2019ve tried to do here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah Hammond, the woman who was once Hannah Hammond, had barely managed to keep ahold of herself throughout this internship. She\u2019d completely fallen apart at the stimulation provided by the devious duo of doctors, falling entirely to seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a wreck. Her hair was messy, cut into a more manageable length but still somehow unattractive and unkempt. Her clothes were illfitting, simply because she couldn\u2019t keep up with her size anymore. Angry red marks ran up and down her stomach, hips and thighs, evidence of her extreme and rapid expansion from Buttercombe Graduate to R&amp;D Plaything. Her face was always red now, and her synapses had been fried. Between the drugs that McCarthy had been slipping her to increase her appetite and libido and the sexual torture that Dr. Schwartz had been putting her through by pressing on her fetish with all of her weight, Hannah had cracked. She mumbled often, her penchant for creepy eye contact taken care of entirely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and Schwartz were almost the same size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHannah, are you aware that I am aware that you tried to drug me?\u201d Helen asked rhetorically, her plump fingers steepling on the desk in front of her, \u201cIt\u2019s true\u2014very early into your career here, you attempted to slip a very caustic and highly addictive substance from our lab, called VX-32, into my coffee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah\u2019s eyes widened and something between a half-hearted attempt at explaining and an incoherent mumble came out. Helen pressed onward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have done research on you, Fraulein. You\u2019ve left quite the trail of figures in your wake.\u201d Helen chuckled, grabbing a handful of her belly blubber and giving her gut a good shake, \u201cAnd I suppose that you intended to do the same to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah\u2019s gaze was everywhere, looking around the room like a mental patient. Maybe she\u2019d be one by the time this was over? Helen could only guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, despite evidence to the contrary, I want you to know that I\u2019ve done this to myself.\u201d Helen\u2019s expression darkened as her belly settled down, \u201cIndependently of you. You have had no more control over me since your internship began than a flea controls the dog he bleeds from.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only sound that Hannah made was her manic breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd do you want to know why I did this to myself, Fraulein?\u201d Helen cocked an eyebrow, \u201cBecause I am better than you at what it is you used to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a spoiled child with a need for control, playing Gott with persons because you believe yourself to be above them. Their wants, needs, emotions; they do not matter to you. The only thing that matters to you is that you remain in control.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Schwartz took a sip of her tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnd so, I have taken that control away from you.\u201d She said with the utmost gravitas to her voice, \u201cYou will no longer feel superior to anyone as you struggle with what it is that I have done to you. That being turned you into the very sort of person you so desperately crave control over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn short, and I suggest that you take these words to heart, do not fuck with me.\u201d </span></div></div>",

Not an inapt comparison, given the doctor\u2019s tall stature and gaunt physique. Her long legs took slow strides as her shoes clicked against the tile of her laboratory. She tapped at her pointed chin inquisitively as she examined her colleague, squirming in her seat like so much the bloated piglet she\u2019d allowed herself to become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can.\u201d Helen puffed, her jowls rippling as the crest of her chubby cheeks reddened, \u201cI simply don\u2019t want do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen had become enormous. Truly one of the largest women that Evie McCarthy had seen in all her adult life. And considering the sheer size of some of those cows, that was really saying something. Once merely a chubby little doctor with a sadistic streak, Helen had let herself go to the point of no return by now. As much as the tubby little tease liked to protest, no one got as fat as Helen Schwartz entirely on purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d Evie sneered, putting her hands on the back of the reinforced, custom-built chair that Helen was currently squatting in, \u201cI think, after all of those years blowing up interns into parade floats, you were really just working something out. Something deep and visceral\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie\u2019s breathing was almost as shallow as her partner\u2019s. The air hung thick with tension as Evie seethed between her teeth. Seeing Helen like this, finally after all of these years teasing her and egging her on. Helen had gone and gotten fatter than Evie could have ever possibly dreamed. It made her obsessively, incredibly hot. She was boiling over, just as Helen\u2019s fat gut had rolled over the arm-rests of her custom made Yeng recliner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you are projecting, Evie.\u201d Helen said in the sweetest tone, her puddle of a face rippling as she clicked her tongue, \u201cAre you going to tell me that you don\u2019t enjoy me at this size? Hmm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Schwartz spread her sausage fingers as far apart as they would go, battling against the bulkiness of her own body as she grabbed a handful of her stupendous stomach and sloshed its meaty mass to one side. From the crown of her swollen breasts to the lowest roll that hung heavily to her calves, Helen Schwartz\u2019s stomach swayed lazily like a tree in the wind. Her fat little face beamed as she watched Dr. McCarthy practically bite through her bottom lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou fucking cow.\u201d Evie said in a raspy voice, \u201cYou\u2019re an absolute blob, Helen. You do know that, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnd you say that like you don\u2019t adore me.\u201d The jumbo German scientist said in her slower, huskier voice, \u201cDo not lie to me Evie. If it were not me in this predicament, it would most assuredly be you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could almost see Dr. McCarthy\u2019s brain begin to spark at the instigation of that remark. Her issues were hers and hers alone, buried underneath years of repression and sadism. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2026 was an ugly thing to say. Implying that I\u2019d ever let myself become as morbidly massive as you have, Helen was\u2026 a low blow.\u201d Evie\u2019s unsettlingly wide grin returned to her face once more, more shaken than shattered by Dr. Schwartz\u2019s playful accusation, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever, I suppose that you\u2019re getting cocky as you get closer to the big 8-0-0. It\u2019s to be expected that your ego keeps track with that gut of yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is to be expected!\u201d Helen chirped happily, \u201cI am only matched in girth by the size of my big, beautiful brain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor now.\u201d Evie crossed her arms over her chest, standing over the blue-haired blob with a hungry expression on her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor now.\u201d Helen winked, hefting up an upper tier of her sagging stomach and letting it fall back into place with a hearty wet slap, \u201cI have so much more room to grow, Evie. Are you not enthralled by the idea of me becoming even larger than I am now? Hmm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m very, very enthralled by the idea of that.\u201d Evie licked her lips<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot as enthralled as I am by the idea of lunch.\u201d Helen purred as she began kneading her stomach, \u201cIf I am to reach 800 before my projected rate, I will require <i>all </i>of your attention, Evie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beached blob rose her eyebrows and began running her fat little hands up and down whatever surface area of her great stomach she could reach. It wasn\u2019t much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, be a good girl und go get me a stick of fried butter from the vendor on the pier. I have developed quite a taste for those.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This is an option reserved for exploring what the world might be like if Piper had always been fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCanonically, Piper used to be very heavy. A combination of good genes, a well-timed growth spurt, and a willingness to explore the surrounding Port helped slim her down from a two-hundred and fifty pound teenager into the fiesty, flashy firecracker that we all know and love. In the stories that follow this option, we're going to see what Piper would have been like if she'd never lost her \"puppy fat\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is somewhat different than your typical weight gain story route, because the character has <i>always</i> been overweight here. While she, and anyone else, can continue to gain weight, a lot of the fun is exploring how different (and conversely, how similar) the \"fat\" version of Piper's life is compared to the original.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe butterfly effect is strong here! Piper having never slimmed down might affect who she's friends with, or how people feel about her. This can include her family, her friends like Dakota and Zack, and even more auxillary characters that make up the corners of her life. The Pipers below are <i>not</i> simply fat versions of the original, rather, they're Pipers who for one reason or another, were never thin, buxom, and \"sexy\" to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeep that in mind, moving forward! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, before we begin, here are your options as to just how \"alternate\" you want this reality to be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Piper Black, Big Fat Friend\u2014</b><br>\r\n<div align=\"right\">For as long as she could remember, Piper has had a weight problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was always the heaviest among her friends, going back as far as Middle School. Her mother has always been supportive about her body-image, even if her stupid older sister teases her constantly about how big she is. But Harper\u2019s babying of her daughter has only facilitated her to keep growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper\u2019s a bit more insecure than you might remember her. Instead of going out and exploring Daven's Port, Piper finds herself much more at home behind her computer screen, casually browsing social media and watching TV. A frequent boredom/stress snacker, Piper is much more at home in baggy hoodies than she is in tight t-shirts. Since she\u2019s not as confident, she\u2019s also got a long history of one-way crushes. While not nearly as outgoing as her \"primary\" counterpart, this Piper is a bit more scholarly and level-headed, if somewhat sensitive about her weight. She\u2019s just a big ol\u2019 marshmallow in this reality, who would lose weight if it just weren\u2019t so hard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer best friends are Dakota Johnson, the new girl from Texas who offered to be her gym buddy, and Maggie Moreau, a fellow lazy (but skinny!) girl whose family\u2019s bakery Piper frequents. Her mortal enemy, Kara Cutter, still taunts her even after high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper\u2019s starting weight in this reality is two hundred and fifty pounds.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Piper Black, Extra-Large, Extra In-Charge\u2014</b><br>\r\n<div align=\"right\">Instead of being known for the bustiest women in town, the Black Family are some of the biggest girls around!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you know how easy it is to be fat and <i>stay</i> fat when you\u2019re poor? The Black Family does. Going back as far as their great grandmother, their whole family has always been comprised of total cows. Harper, Parker, and Piper Black are all grade-A heifers here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper\u2019s never thought much about diets or exercise, and why should she? Her mother has always been overly positive and all-too supportive about her \"full figure\"; Piper's mom practically did everything she could to keep her and her sister <i>very</i> well-fed. It ain\u2019t like she\u2019s got much of a choice in the matter, after all, might as well enjoy all of her extra-ness! Aside from being much more \"loud and proud\" about her size, the downside to such an enabling, spoiled upbringing is that Piper\u2019s boisterous personality is a bit more abrasive and one-sided\u2014she\u2019s got no tolerance for those skinny chicks who look down their noses at her and all her extra helpings!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer best friend is Madi Pines, a more shy and demure kind of fat girl who admires Piper\u2019s confidence. Recently she\u2019s been rubbing against the wrong way from Dakota Johnson, some skinny twig from Texas, and the two butt heads quite often around town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper\u2019s starting weight in this reality is over three hundred and fifty pounds.</div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You are not going to be happy until I'm mum bod-ed are you kid?\"<br>\r\nProbably not appeared to be the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did that go down?\" asked Darren from the other side of the table having just watched Piper practically inhale a tables worth of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gre...BUURP!...at\" belched Piper whilst rubbing her belly again which had now parted her camisole to fully expose her bump which glowed slightly in the kitchen light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think you'll get through the night now seeing as it's 3:41\" asked Darren, mentally working out how much more sleep he would get before leaving for work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, possibly\" Piper thought as she rubbed her belly.<br>\r\n'Damn that feels good' she mentally groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can get you something else if you want?\" offered Darren almost foolishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper's interest was piqued.<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been roped in now.<br>\r\n\"I guess we could do a drive through run if you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww baby, you don't have to, you're the best!\"<br>\r\nPiper got far too excited at the prospect of more food but she didn't particularly care.<br>\r\nA more aware individual would probably point out at this point that Piper's cravings were playing a significant part in her pregnancy gains, particularly on her lower half and around her bump for the more keen eyed, but that had long been justified as 'eating for two' or 'it'll go once I have the baby'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only she knew...</span></div></div>",
