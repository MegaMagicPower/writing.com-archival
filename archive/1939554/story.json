So when you wake up in an absurdly opulent bedroom that makes your original look like a box in an alleyway, you don't panic at all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHuh,\u201d you said.  \u201cI remember going to sleep in my regular bed...\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou stroke your chin thoughtfully.  \u201cI wonder what happened.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHrmrm...\u201d said a sleepy voice.  You look to the side... and gape.  It's only because of your tremendous self-control that you don't scream in startled fright at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWell, fright's the wrong word, as you're fond of the character in bed with you at the moment.  You just never expected to see her like this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt's Renamon, the famous fox Digimon.  Yellow fur, white middle, long, poofy fur collar, fluffy tail, purple leg marks, its all there.  Except in this instance, she's become incredibly fat.  Five-hundred pounds, if you had to guess.  Her belly was a vast, almost rounded mass of softness, a thick apron hanging down over her waist.  Her ass was big enough to fill a couch, and her chest now sported a pair of fat, heavy breasts below her fur collar.  Her arms and legs were thick with fat, her pudgy footpaws surrounded by thick ankles and her fingers thick and clumsy looking.  Finally, her face was chubby cheeked, giving her a very cute look.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou smiled a little.  This look actually wasn't unattractive for her.  Glancing around the apartment, you spot various pictures on the wall, each labeled with an event name.  'First Date' showed Renamon as you knew her from the show, only clad in an outfit similar to Rika's.  'Discovery of Mutal Desires' showed Renamon rubbing her belly as you fed her a huge, greasy-looking hamburger.  'Commitment' showed Renamon, fatter than she was in the last picture, as the two of you are entering a Tunnel of Love.  'Luck Be A Lady' showed the two of you posing with a Publisher's Clearing House crew, holding a large check.  'Marriage' was just that.  Renamon, much fatter than she was in the last picture, clad in a beautiful wedding gown, cuddling up to you happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou glance down at your finger, and see a silver ring on it.  \u201cHuh...\u201d you said quietly.  \u201cMarriage...\u201d Not entirely an unattractive concept, all things considered.  You looked up at the last picture, and saw Renamon, as fat as she was now, holding a pregnancy test and looking happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe test was positive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYour jaw drops, and you find yourself at a loss for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHmmm... Honey?\u201d Renamon said sleepily, starting to awaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t(Edited on 12/26/2016 by FFtheSnake)</span></div></div>",

That\u2019s not possible, in every sense of the word! You  pinch yourself as you hear the mattress creak next to you. You feel a sharp pain in your arm. This is not a dream. Unsure of what to do in this situation you just sit there up sitting upright  in the bed. Your eyes frantic trying to make sense of all this. You feel something heavy and soft touch your shoulder, you instinctively recoil at the touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, what\u2019s wrong? You look...scared.\u201d Turning you see a very fat and very concerned fox. Her chubby cheeks and triple chin jostled as she moved closer to you, her  pierceing sapphire eyes staring  into your own. That\u2019s when you felt something quite fluffy almost envelop your body. Looking down you notice that the white beanbag she calls a stomach is currently pressing against you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes trial upward to notice her wearing a purple bra. One which seems to have the symbol \u201cying\u201d on one breast and \u201cyang\u201d on the other. Her breasts stretching against the fabric tightly,  You can only guess that they are H-cup. A chubby barely contained 3 pawed hand suddenly clasps your jaw. Forcing you to look he dim the eyes. \u201cTell me what\u2019s bothering you, we don\u2019t keep things from each other, remember?\u201d Renamon asks her tone suddenly more stern, but having a trace of care in her soft tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then released her iron grip on your mouth, you rubbed your jaw, man that\u2019s a strong grip! Renamon watches as you rub sore face. Her facial features  going from \u201cattempting to look intimidating and kinda just coming off as adorable\u201d to \u201csad but with extra chins and fat cheeks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again you feel your personal space being violated, beaten, and left to die on the street corner as Renamon pulls you into a powerful hug. Your arousal mixing with confusion as You felt your head rest between what felt like two incredibly soft pillows that just so happened to mold to your head shape, due to  their almost gelatinous nature. Your upper and lower body are pushed into her lard factory of a stomach, your entire body sinking in as Renamon begins to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I got too heated, but I know something is bothering you, and you never take this long to answer me... Please honey, tell me what\u2019s hurting you.\u201d Renamon looked down at you with a visible pout and eyes which seemed to gleam with sadness. She had just given you the best damn puppy dog face you had ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour aroused, confused, and now are feeling kinda guilty for making someone who seems to care for you worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although you weren't the type to sleep in late to the point where it's already noon, you usually wake up at around 6 in the morning, sometimes even at 5 to 4 in the morning given the chance. However, you couldn't help but getting a feeling that this morning felt...different from the other times when you were the \"early bird\" in your family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Sun rose upon the horizon, you slowly began to show signs of life, stretching your arms out to the sides, yawning loudly from staying up until midnight. But then, when you tried to get up and out of your bed, you felt something holding you by your waist, pinning you down against your bed. If you had to guess the weight of whatever was pinning you to the bed, it had to weigh at least over several hundred pounds, or to be more specific, about 500 to 600 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to figure out what exactly was holding you down, you open your eyes, still drowsy from just waking up, and saw a large white lump with some blue in the mix. Still having a pair of sleepy eyes, you rubbed the sand out of your eyes, clearing your vision back to their normal working function, finally able to see what was pinning you to your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. My. God!\" You whispered, eyes wide open, as you just now realized who was actually pinning you to your own bed; it was none other than the energetically playful bluenette catgirl known throughout the world as Felicia from the Darkstalkers series! Out of all the characters that Capcom has made over the years, Felicia happened to be your favorite out of the bunch. It wasn't just that you always played as her whenever she's a playable character, whether said game was one of the Darkstalkers games or a Marvel vs. Capcom game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, you loved Felicia because of her character, personality, and backstory. This catwoman (not to be confused with DC Comics' titular character) had a very likeable personality. After all, Felicia was energetic, optimistic, and playful, as well as someone who enjoys singing, dancing, and making friends with people. She wasn't that much of a likeable because she wanted to rule the world. Instead, one of the reasons why she had this many fans (you included) was of her dream to have a peaceful coexistence between the humans, and her kind, the Darkstalkers. Not to mention she doesn't resort to fighting others unless she cannot avoid it. Overall, these qualities were what made Felicia both a very likeable character, and able to stand out among the other Darkstalkers, who are mostly anti-heroes at best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you knew that in the Darkstalkers games Felicia had alternate skins, the Felicia you were looking at was most definitely in her original form when she was first introduced; white fur and long flowing blue hair. However, even though your shock of realizing that you were sleeping in bed with your favorite catgirl, you began to notice that something was very different to the Felicia you were so used to seeing; she was much MUCH fatter than her videogame counterpart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her face, she had these chubby cheeks and a thick double chin, as Felicia rested her plump head against your stomach, almost as if you're some sort of human teddy near for her to sleep and cuddle with, just as you heard her purring as she slept. Her D-Cup breasts were now a pair of Double-F Cup breasts, as well as now having a fat apron belly, which reached halfway down the bluenette catgirl's fat jiggly thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you felt both her fatty breasts and apron belly smoosh themselves against your body, you noticed just how big Felicia's rear was underneath the bedsheets. Her waist and hips were about 4 to almost 4 and a half feet in diameter, as each buttcheek was about as big as a yogaball, with her long white cat tail hiding underneath the bedsheets. Other than having a pair of fatty thighs, shins cankles, and a pair of plump feline feet, Felicia also sported a pair of thick fatty arms, along with her large feline-like hands having a bit of flab on them as well, just as you felt the obese Felicia hug you a bit tighter, not wanting to let you go, despite feeling the tips of her sharp pink catgirl claws a bit.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And yet, despite being fully awake at this point, you couldn't help but feel rather cramped from Felicia hugging you so tightly like an organic teddy bear, as you thought to yourself, <i>\"Ngh!! Okay, I'm starting to fell REALLY cramped in here.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you liked being cuddled by your favorite Darkstalkers character, her newly corpulent form is certainly starting to become uncomfortable from all the slumbering squeezing she's doing. <i>\"Okay, okay. I gotta find a way to get free. Think (Name), think!\"</i> You contemplated, whilst you felt Felicia's meatier arms start to squeeze just a tad bit tighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was when you looked back up at Felicia's chubbier face and voluptuous cobalt blue mane that an idea soon sprang into your head. <i>\"Nnnnnngh! I just hope this works.\"</i> You thought, as you slowly wiggled one of your arms about in an effort to get them free for what you were about to do, which seemed to be working little by little. Eventually, after much physical attrition, you were able to get your left arm free from the flabby confines of Felicia's embrace, where you began to slowly reach for one of Felicia's snow white cat ears protruding from the top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"*sigh* Well...here goes nothing. I hope this works.\"</i> You mentally noted, as you curled your fingers behind Felicia's right cat ear, pressing against the back of the feline ear. From there, you carefully rubbed up and down the base of the cat ear, since from what you remember, cats liked to be scratched behind their ears. Hopefully, the same would apply to Felicia as well, since she's a catgirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, it just made her squeeze her meaty arms just a little tighter, but a few fleeting moments later, you began to hear what sounded like...purring? Yeah, it was most definitely purring, which seemed to originate from none other than Felicia herself, making her appear all the more adorable in your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after about five whole minutes of gently scratching behind her feline ears, Felicia soon but sluggishly began to stir from her hefty slumber, her white feline tail briefly twitching about underneath the bedsheets, while her feline ears flicked twice or thrice in rhythm with one another, which came to a head with Felicia finally awakening, as she groggily blinked more than thrice, thus revealing her beautifully radiant jade green eyes before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, as if on mere instinct, Felicia began to unfurl her thick bulky arms from your form, outstretching them whilst she let out a mix between an audible yawn and catgirl-like *Nyah!*, which wasn't out-of-place for someone like Felicia. Then, she slowly positioned herself into a semi-sitting position, her belly splayed out on the bedding, with her equally plump legs spread out to accommodate for her acquired girth, where she then momentarily ran her oversized paw-like fingers through her massive cobalt blue mane on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, such personal morning grooming came to a halt when she quickly noticed you beside her, to which a gleeful toothy smile appeared on her chubby face, to which (despite her now obviously increased size and weight) she swiftly leaped onto you whilst she gleefully yelped, \"Darling!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before you could even react, you soon found yourself in her embrace once more, only this time she was clearly on top of you, with her enormously fat buttocks sticking up in the air, with her feline tail swishing about with a sense of glee to it's movements. However, you could also now feel Felicia's hefty breasts and large apron belly, but you were still trying to wrap your brain around as to how the bluenette catgirl could still move so quickly despite her current size and heft.</span></div></div>",

However, it was what you saw laying in bed with you that got your attention. At first, it looked like a big orange lump covering itself up with your bedsheets. But then, you saw the orange lump move, as it shifted it's body to turn itself around on your bed, causing these creaking sounds from it's weight, indicating to you that it was really heavy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when your vision cleared up, you suddenly realized what, or rather who, you were actually sleeping in bed with; the one and only anthropomorphic vixen known as Inspector Carmelita Montonya Fox! Out of all of the video games you played, the Sly Cooper series happened to be your favorite franchise, and out of the large roster of characters in the Sly Cooper series, your favorite character was the very vixen you were sleeping with, despite the handful of actresses that were used to portray as her in each game installment. Overall, you basically had a giant crush on the bluenette vixen, and for you to see her right in front of you and not on a TV screen could only be summed up as a freaking dream come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, as the completely surprised reaction slowly died down, you began to notice one key difference to the original Carmelita Fox that you fantasized over; the Carmelita sleeping in front of you was much much fatter, compared to her Shock Pistol-wielding video game counterpart. She had these large G-Cup breasts, as these large mammaries of hers, nestled inside a massive blue bra. Below her breasts laid Carmelita's large apron belly, reaching halfway the bluenette vixen's thick juicy thighs, where they touched one another, along with having a pair of plump shins, cankles, and feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBalancing out her large fat melons, Carmelita also sported a fat waist, hips, and butt. Her hips were about 3 and a half to 4 feet in diameter, as each buttcheek was around the same size as a yogaball, where she wore these large blue silk panties, just as you saw Carmelita's notoriously long and fluffy orange fox tail stick out from underneath the bedsheets, subconsciously wagging from left to right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, after noticing her thick fatty arms with subtle hints of muscle underneath along with a pair of chubby hands and digits, your eyes moved to look at the fat Carmelita's head, which sported a pair of chubby facial cheeks and a double chin. However, you then noticed that slowly but surely, the obese Carmelita's lips began to curve into a smile. Other than her new fatty physique, you understood that you were definitely in the same bed as Carmelita, as you sat up a bit and pinched yourself hard to see if you were hallucinating, which proved to you that you definitely weren't seeing things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the situation before you definitely raised some questions; How did you end up sleeping in the same bed as Carmelita, and why was she so fat? Although, looking at her now, you had to admit that Carmelita did look very attractive with all of that fat on her. You weren't sure how much the bluenette vixen currently weighed, but if you had to guess, Carmelita had to be weighing around 500 to 600 pounds, judging from how much bulk she has on her frame right now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even though you wanted to stay in bed and wait until the obese Carmelita Fox wakes up herself, you were longing for some answers as to how this has happened and why. Sure, being with Carmelita herself in-person was the best thing you could ever asked for, but this was also a majorly drastic change in your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill wanting to get some answers, you decided to get up and explore your home, hoping to find something that could tell you what was going on here. However, from playing the Sly Cooper games, you understood very well that Carmelita was known to have a bit of a temper, especially when it came to the raccoon Master Thief known as Sly Cooper, so trying to give her a wake-up call isn't going to help whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in an attempt to not wake up the rotund sleeping vixen, you slowly and carefully moved out of bed, trying to be as silent as you possibly could. Surprisingly, it worked, despite a false alarm from the unconscious Inspector Fox when her left fox ear with the golden earring piercing subconsciously twitched once or twice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, your efforts to not wake up Carmelita were successful, as you slowly opened the door to exit the bedroom. However, when you turned around to look at Carmelita's sleeping form, you quickly noticed how different your bed was and no wonder why it didn't break from supporting the obese vixen's weight; the bed was now King-Sized, and it was heavily reinforced to support even a full grown African Elephant! You couldn't help but smirk a bit from seeing the fiery vixen that was Inspector Fox look so peaceful when she was sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back on topic, you went out of the bedroom, slowly closing the door halfway, just in case Carmelita ever woke up. Finally out of the bedroom and hearing range, you slowly looked around the area and noticed that you were in some sort of large penthouse. There was a large and spacious living room, complete with a large coffee table, a 6-seat couch, 3 wide recliners, and a huge Flatscreen TV, hanging on one of those large plexiglass windows that give someone a good view of the landscape, along with a large durable drawer with an electric fireplace below the Flatscreen TV, as well as your Playstation 4, Playstation 3, &amp; Xbox 360 gaming consoles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as for what said landscape was, you could only Sun it up in one word, as you said, \"Whoa.\" As you slowly approached the gigantic window looking at the snow-covered urban landscape, you instantly recognized the tall steel tower that was the Eiffel Tower, making you realize that you were currently living in Paris, France. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to the left, you noticed a large dining table with almost a dozen chairs, one of those chairs was large enough for someone of Carmelita's size, judging by it's size, how it was made out of metal, and was reinforced to hold both her and her weight. From there, you also noticed there was a kitchen behind the dining table, a big one at that. You saw that it had a 7-foot wide double-door oven/stove, a huge dishwasher, 2 big sinks, and 2 different fridges; one fridge for you and guests, and a gigantic stainless steel fridge, which you figured was for Carmelita. After all, a girl her size would definitely have an appetite. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>But when you turned around to look toward the right side of the vast penthouse interior, you quickly noticed something that got your attention; a large 7 foot tall plexiglass-coated display case. However, it wasn't the display case itself that interested you, but rather, it's contents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon approaching the display case, you got a better look at what it contained. On the bottom shelf, there wasn't anything placed there. But on the shelves above, it told a different story. Luckily, the display case doors were unlocked, as you opened both doors to get a closer look at the \"items of interest\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHung up on the top shelf in a rack was what appeared to be a giant spider leg. Knowing your knowledge about the Sly Cooper series, you were looking at one of the legs of the female KLAWW Gang Member &amp; former Interpol officer, the Contessa. However, looking at it further, you noticed that the Contessa's spider leg was somehow ripped and torn off in a violent fashion. But it was when you touched the dismembered leg of the Contessa that you realized what happened, as a flood of memories swept inside your head, causing you to grit your teeth from the mental pain, closing your eyes shut, and grabbing your head with one hand in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after recovering, you suddenly realized how and why you had one of the Contessa's legs in a display case; you were the one who dismembered that freaky villainess! And somehow, you were there, in Prague, around the same time as when Sly and his gang were there to steal the Clockwerk Eyes. Whatever you were now remembering, those memories were altered to coincide with that of the Sly Cooper universe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made you realize that whatever has happened to you before waking up today, it somehow fused the world you knew &amp; the world of the Sly Cooper series into one reality. </span></div></div>",

But as she walked toward you, Carmelita's body fat began to jiggle a bit with each step, causing her hips to sway from side to side a little. However, when she was at kissing distance with you, the rotund vixen hugged you tightly, pressing you into her fat apron belly, and lets out the famed French Kiss upon your lips, as you returned the kiss out of some sort of muscle memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, after around a long minute of French kissing, Carmelita stopped the intimate kiss, as she hugged you a bit tighter, showing you how strong she was despite all of that flab on her frame, causing you to accidentally get pressed into her massive cleavage before letting you go to speak with you. \"Merry Early Christmas, sweetie.\" She said to you, making you realize that you were in the middle of December, way before Christmas Day and Christmas Eve, which would explain why it was snowing in Paris. Plus, out of the corner of your eyes, you noticed an 8-foot tall Christmas tree, decorated with Christmas lights and various different ornaments hanging from the tree's branches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by the sound of her voice, you were definitely hearing the voice of Carmelita Fox from Sly 2: Band of Thieves, who was played by an actress named Al\u00e9sia Glidewell, which doesn't have that excessive accent from the first Sly Cooper game nor from Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves. It was then you noticed that Carmelita was wearing something on her hand that stuck out; a golden wedding ring, indicating that she was married to someone, just as you examined one of your hands to notice that you were also wearing the same type of ring that the obese vixen was wearing on her chubby ring finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, your mind started connecting the dots as you came to only one single conclusion as to why you and the obese version of your fictional crush had the same ring; You and Carmelita were a legitimate married couple!

After all, Carmelita wasn't just your favorite Sly Cooper character, you also had developed a crush on the vixen as the Sly Cooper series progressed. You weren't sure how this had happened to you or what caused the world you once knew to change, but you weren't complaining about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, (IYNH)...are you alright?\" Carmelita asked, showing some signs of concern as to why you weren't responding. However, from seeing how happy she was just moments ago and how pleasant her kiss was, you figured that you would return the favor, as you quickly wrapped your arms around Carmelita's thick neck, and planted your own French kiss directly on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, she was caught by surprise from your kiss. But a few seconds later, Carmelita closed her eyes out of being slightly aroused by your unexpected response. From there, after about a minute or two, you end the kiss with her, as Carmelita sat down on the large couch in the living room, spreading her bulky legs apart to accommodate for her massive furry stomach. \"Sorry about not saying anything to you earlier, honey. I was looking at some of our old 'trophies'.\" You answered, just as you then sat down to her right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you saw Carmelita leaned back a little, pressing herself against the uber-soft couch pillows, as the obese vixen let out a relieved sigh, like undoing a belt that was on too tight. But as she slowly rubbed her fat apron belly with her plump left hand, she moved her head a bit to look at you and said, \"I wouldn't call a dismembered leg a trophy, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. But the Contessa did deserve what was coming for her. After all, she had you restrained inside her castle and was using one of the Clockwerk Parts to re-wire your mind for her ends, along with playing on both sides of this deadly conflict, being both an Interpol asset and a secret member of the KLAWW Gang. So yeah, I guess you can say that the Contessa did deserve to have one of her legs dismembered. Erm, sorry about what I did back in Prague, Foxy. I was very worried about you.\" You replied, scratching the back of your head from the last sentence, almost as if you felt like you were on autopilot with the words you said to Carmelita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to what you said to her, Carmelita moved her plump right hand and grabbed your left hand in the process, squeezing it a bit out of reassurance, and answered, \"Well, I don't blame you for being worried about me, (IYNH).\" Shortly after speaking to you, Carmelita moved her hazel eyes in your direction, doing her best to reassure you, which was successful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut out of nowhere, you notice Carmelita lean back even more, almost as if something was kicking around inside of her stomach. Becoming concerned for the obese vixen, looked at Carmelita and asked, \"Hey, are you alright?\" \"Ooomph! *sigh* Yeah sweetie, I'm okay. You can say that this is one of the 'perks' you get when you're pregnant.\" Carmelita replied, just as you realized from her words that she wasn't just your wife; Carmelita was also bearing children. Your children! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving you some proof to her accusation, Carmelita, still having her chubby right hand on your left hand, moved your hand up along the side of her fat apron belly, feeling both your lover's soft orange fur and...</span></div></div>",

Then, she turned her head to look at you with her plump cheeks and fat double chin, as she asked, \"So, care to give your butterball of a wife a nice big breakfast to binge on? After all, you've got more than just my mouth to feed, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in response to what she said to you, you let out a smirk, as you spoke to Carmelita and answered, \"With pleasure, you fiery vixen. Just let me get myself dressed first. Besides, I just got up.\" Shortly after making a flirting comment toward her, Carmelita lets go of your left hand, as you got up and went back into the bedroom you exited out of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you grabbed a red T-shirt and dark gray sweatpants with a pair of socks, you noticed a full-length mirror hanging on a nearby wall.

Originally, you measured in at an average height of 5 feet 8 inches tall. But now, you were measuring at a staggering 6 feet in height. Then, you noticed how ripped your muscles were. Sure, they weren't exactly the type of super ripped muscles that competitive bodybuilders have, but they looked like the muscles an Olympic athlete and MMA Fighter would bear, just as you lifted the front of your shirt some, revealing a pair of Six-Pack Abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, despite being aware of some Tribal Tattoos on your right arm, you noticed another tattoo underneath your shirt, as you took off your red T-shirt to see what it looked like. From there, you looked back at your reflection to get a good look at what sort of tattoo you were bearing on your torso; A big black spider. It had a striking resemblance to the same spider logo that the Spider-Man villain known as Venom had on his body, only the logo was white, not black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you slowly turned around to have your back face the mirror a bit, seeing that it had the same design attached to the tattoo on your front.

Feeling a sense of deja vu from seeing the clawed hand, you then looked back at your reflection in the mirror, revealing a large white spider logo, the same one that Venom had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom seeing this, it made you quickly realize something; this wasn't just a tattoo, you were wearing the infamous Venom Symbiote on your body! After all, you learned about the symbiote from one of your comic book buddies. Sure, the symbiote was capable of enhancing one's abilities, but it also had a tendency to take over it's host, like a Zombie virus (only it wasn't a Zombie virus).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, for some unexplained reason, you were still in control of your own body instead of the symbiote trying to take control of you.

Just finding one of your fleece robes for you, that's all!\"  Shortly after getting fully dressed, you then approached Carmelita's closet to find a fleece robe for her to wear. After all, it was the middle of winter for crying out loud! The least you could do was just give her something to warm up, despite having her body coated in a few hundred pounds of fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you easily managed to find a large fleece robe for Carmelita. From looking at it, the robe was made with comfy red fleece. Red and blue, fitting for a member of law enforcement like the notorious Inspector Fox. Once you were finished, you took the robe from the rack, hoisted it over your shoulder, and headed out of the bedroom to meet up with your obese lover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you finally came into the main area of the penthouse, you began to notice Carmelita digging a little into that humongous fridge of hers, finding something to sate her appetite until you arrive, guzzling down on what appears to be a 3-gallon chocolate milkshake. But it wasn't until she moved her brown eyes and noticed you that she quickly stopped drinking to look at you, blushing a little in embarrassment, along with her fox ears drooping down to the sides a little and said, \"Erm.....Sorry. UURP!!\" In response to her unexpected belch, Carmelita quickly covered her plump snout with one free chubby paw-like hand, having this somewhat shocked expression on her face, as her chubby cheeks blushed even more, turning a beet red from her surprise belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, you were understanding as to why she couldn't wait for you to make breakfast. After all, she was pregnant with 3 to 4 kits, so of course she would get THIS hungry. Obviously seeing that she's waited long enough, you gently grabbed the large milkshake from Carmelita's furry hands and set it down on the kitchen counter, as you guided her toward her personal reinforced chair at the kitchen table while you spoke to her and replied, \"Well, I don't blame you for drinking a chocolate milkshake for breakfast. After all, I think your hungry belly was getting a wee bit impatient for some food.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after setting Carmelita down into her seat, you then proceeded to making her breakfast, as that muscle memory of yours came back once more, causing you to instinctively grab various different food ingredients, making whatever it was that the obese vixen was craving for breakfast.</span></div></div>",

Surprisingly, the chair she sat in was equipped with a reclining function to it's overall design, as the stuffed fox spread her thick legs some and leaned back in her chair to make more room for both her unborn kits and all of that food she had consumed, with you assisting her in the feeding process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* Now that feels soooo good. I don't think I can stand back up onto my feet all by myself, (Your name). *giggle*\" Carmelita said, her voice making her sound like she was in Heaven right now, while she turned her head a little to look at you from her right side, as she placed a left chubby paw-like hand on her taut pregnant abdomen and gently rubbed it in circles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you could see that this was sorta out-of-character in comparison to her portrayal in the Sly Cooper series, you could mostly understand why Carmelita did a 180 on itself. After all, she's pregnant for pete's sake! Besides, one of the side effects during pregnancies is having mood swings due to hormones fluctuating. And knowing Carmelita, she has some issues keeping her emotions under control, more specifically; that infamous temper of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn other words, you were walking through an emotional equivalent to a minefield, so you figured it would be best not to make her upset or angry at the slightest. However, there were still a few things that seemed to bother you about this \"Carmelita is pregnant\" situation, like how long has she been pregnant and when is she due? Or were the kids either human like you, or foxes like her, or a mix of both? Or are they boys, girls, or a mix between the two?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, um.....Carmelita, not to upset you or anything but.....do you mind if I ask you something?\" You asked, just as you pulled out a chair to sit alongside the rotund vixen, being cautious as to not make her mad. Fortunately, in response to your question, Carmelita simply looked at you, extending her chubby paw-like hand to touch one of your legs out of reassurance, looking at you and replied, \"Of course, sweetie. You can ask me anything you like. So, what is that you want to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you were relieved to hear Carmelita giving you permission to ask her, you had to choose your words wisely in figuring out some things. So , after taking a moment or two to think about your question, you decided to ask......</span></div></div>",

Looks like someone's being un nino travieso (a naughty boy) today.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, hearing Carmelita speaking in a mix between English and Spanish was certainly becoming a bit of a turn-on for you, just as you then heard yourself speak up and said, \"*chuckle* And I'm guessing you're feeling quite famished, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as if on a quirky cue, both you and Carmelita heard the now rotund vixen's firmly pronounced apron belly began to emit quite the beastly growl, akin to a spoiled pet demanding for a second course. Obviously, Carmelita instinctively blushed a beet red underneath her fiery orange fur, as she placed a plump paw-like right hand upon the main fold of her prominent double belly, looking at it with her golden hazel eyes while she spoke to her overly pampered organ and retorted, \"*sigh* ...About that time again, huh? Fine, might as well get you stuffed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Carmelita looked back at you, now bearing an affectionate yet almost pleading expression on her chubby vulpine face as she asked, \"...Any chance you can cook up something...<i>substantial</i>, sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*chuckle* For you, my big bluenette fox? Absolutely.\" You automatically said, as if your entire body was on autopilot, where you then promptly kissed the corpulent vixen on the lips, then proceeded towards the large Kitchen area, not paying attention to Carmelita's current choice of lingerie; A massive pair of blue silk bra and panties, which easily accentuated Carmelita's adipose-enlarged curves with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, once you were finally finished, you walked out of the Kitchen carrying...</span></div></div>",

Her wide fleshy belly and large breasts are slumped your way, slowly moving as she breathes deeply in her sleep. Her chubby face seems so peaceful and relaxed, with a slight smile crossing her muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seems so incredibly great to you, but also such a change.

The sparse light coming through the curtains doesn't leave you much to see by after having the light in the bathroom on, but your eyes quickly adjust. Your gaze is drawn to the bed, where it seems that Krystal had turned over, causing that noise. You notice the covers had been pulled down some, exposing a large portion of her fleshy back. Quietly opening the door, you silently pad back over to the bed. As you do so, you notice that the bed has been changed as well, being much wider, lower to the ground, and reinforced judging from the metal you can see underneath. Despite the larger size, you have just about as much room as you did before, with Krystal taking up most of the space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at the edge of the bed, you think for a moment, before pulling the covers open enough for you to slide in. You pause for a second, before moving up right against Krystal, feeling her warm flesh pressing against your body. Pulling the covers up around her a bit better, you nestle your head against the top of her shoulder. As you lay there up against her, you get a slightly sweet scent, and a small feeling of vertigo. Once it passes, you think to yourself that this feels right, like everything is as it should be. A small far off part of your brain keeps trying to remind you that everything seems to have changed overnight, as you drift off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

I thought you could use some more sleep, so I came out here to take care of myself.\" She motions to the food, as if it wasn't obvious what she meant. \"I know how much you like to help me, but I just couldn't wait any longer. You know I've been getting even hungrier because of these little guys.\" She says patting the side of her expansive gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little guys?\" You think to yourself, did she mean that she was pregnant? Another wave of vertigo quickly passes. \"Of course she meant that, I've known she's been pregnant with my children for some time,\" another thought forces it's way across your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything alright?\" She asks with some concern. \"I did hear you get up and rush to the bathroom last night, right?\"</span></div></div>",

Not too long ago, you had quite some success as a chef, after rising quickly through the ranks in the kitchen. Now you own your own restaurant, a decent sized place called the Den, why avoid your wolf and predatory heritage after all? You entered through the front door this time, just to check out the dining room. As you walk through, various staff setting up for the day give you variations on \u201cGood day, Chef Drakkar.\u201d You say response back to each as you help out where needed while on your trip back to the kitchen. There, the kitchen staff are hard at work on their preparations for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sous chef Korrinna, a tall slender raven, was already working on preparing the breads the Den would go through.

Joe is an older croc, longtime friend of yours, and is well on his way through building the various broths and stocks everyone would need for the day. After checking everyone\u2019s progress, you went to work on a huge red snapper, carefully removing scales and bones, and making quick work of getting the filets off in one piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought occurs to you, \u201cAnyone seen Scott?\u201d referring to the dishwasher who is missing from work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarious answers amounting to no are your response.

Your attempt to berate him for being late again dies in your throat, and in your startled state your knife nearly slices into your finger. Cursing under your breath, you are left staring at him, and shocked to find you looking at yourself, or at least your old human self!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the memories from your other life come crashing back, colliding with your new memories of this life.

Letting Geoff take over on the fish, you move to your office, shutting the door behind you. You can hear some quiet comments even through the door, though they were expressing worry about you. Leaning against the door, you try to wrap your head around the clashing memories. Even last night is mixed up; in one version you remember a wonderful night out with Krystal before going back home, while in the other\u2026you can only find disjointed and broken fragments that don\u2019t make much sense. Shaking your head does little to dispel the fog blanketing your mind as the various memories clash and vie for dominance. A knock at the door causes you to jump, though you are welcome for a brief distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you are sure that your heart resumes beating, you move away from the door, and call out in as steady a voice as you can manage, \u201cCome in.\u201d</span></div></div>",

However, you noticed something was off about her; the AK Girl sleeping next to you was MUCH fatter than her webcomic counterpart, as if she had willingly ingested several hundred pounds of caramel, appearing to weigh around 500 to almost 650 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer once firm athletic body was filled with a good respectable amount of fat, sporting a fat apron belly that reached almost down to her knees, sporting a pair of large yogaball-sized buttcheeks, obese thighs, shins &amp; cankles, and a fatty waist and hips that are 4 to 4 and a half feet wide in diameter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the upper half of her body, AK Girl was sporting a hefty set of Double-H cup breasts, along with pair of thick fatty arms and chubby paw-like hands &amp; fingers. Finally, her head was coated in fat, displaying a thick pair of chubby cheeks and a double chin. Overall, you could tell that the Vibes in front of you was definitely one fat foxy, currently wearing a large red silk bra and panties instead of her signature AK Girl costume.</span></div></div>",

You know, going out shopping in many of the stores that are having Christmas and Black Friday Sales, setting up Christmas decorations, picking out that one tree to put the presents under, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, you had a large family with many aunts, uncles, and cousins, you were still looking for that \"special someone\", to share your life with. But today felt...different, as you slowly woke up from your slumber, noticing that you weren't the only one in the same bed as you. <br>\r\n\"Huh? Why am I seeing things?\" You said to yourself, noticing the big lump of fur laying beside you, as you rubbed the sleep out of your eyes, clearing up your vision to see better. However, upon a second glance of the brown lump, you then realized who was actually sleeping in bed with you; it was the one and only anthropomorphic Collie from London known as Colleen, from the cartoon show Road Rovers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, unlike her cartoon counterpart, this version of Colleen that was sleeping beside you was much MUCH fatter than what you remembered from your childhood. On her face and head, Colleen had a round pair of plump facial cheeks and a thick double chin, along with a thick neck covered in fatty cellulite, as well as sporting a plump snout, and the hair on her head reaching down just above her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow her head, Colleen's body just screamed \"Fat Sumo Obese\". Her D-Cup breasts ballooned with fat until they were at an H-Cup, as they slowly moved with each sleeping breath. Her belly went from a flat furry stomach to a fat-coated apron belly, as the Cano-Sapien's stomach reached halfway down her thighs. Along with an obese belly and fatty breasts, Colleen had a pair of thick fatty arms and plump paw-like hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, one of the largest features of Colleen's obese body were her waist, hips, butt, and legs. Each buttcheek were as big as yogaballs, capable of jiggling with each step, with her waist and hips thickly coated with flab, measuring around 5 to almost 5 and a half feet in diameter. Finally, Colleen's legs were thick with a mixture of muscle and body fat, where they would touch one another when she waddled. Overall, this gave the obese Road Rover a prominent and blubbery pear shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, this was when you noticed that she wasn't wearing her signature Road Rovers armor. Instead, Colleen was currently wearing a very large pair of sky blue panties and bra, which stood out from the large Collie's signature fur pattern, along with a very large and loose white nightie. You know, the kind that a woman would wear as lingerie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you weren't how this happened, but...</span></div></div>",

For her to be in bed with you was a dream come true even if she was obese. As the kissing and hugging went on you began to like the feeling of her fat. The fact that she was on top of you made the feeling even better. It felt so spectacular that you felt yourself getting aroused and Colleen noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Getting excited again are we?\" she said as you nod your head in agreement, your face turning red.\"*giggle* No wonder you got me pregnant. You never want to stop having fun.\" You face went from arousal to shock as you heard her say the words you thought she said: you got me pregnant.

She looked so peaceful as you saw a smile upon her chubby muzzle. She then, as if on instinct, moved her hands towards her stomach. You smiled as the thought of you and Colleen becoming parents warmed your heart. You still wondered many things: How many was she carrying and were they humans or pups or anthro dogs. Just then you remembered making her breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk towards the kitchen you look at the walls to see pictures of you and Colleen together. One was of the two of you on a beach, while another showed the two of you at a soccer game at what appeared to be Wembley Stadium. As soon as you saw that picture you ran to a window to see that you were in London. The view was beautiful as you saw Big Ben and the rest of London. By the window was a picture with the words: The best day of our lives. It showed both you and Colleen at a wedding, only thing was it was your wedding. You were wearing a tuxedo while Colleen was wearing a beautiful white dress. Next to that picture was a picture of you and your friends at the after party, while another picture showed Colleen with her fellow rovers including the Master. After looking over the pictures you walked towards the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arrival you look in the refrigerator to see bacon, eggs, sausages and various other meats. Deciding to cook it all, with the intention of making Colleen fatter, you started to cook the food. Along with the food you made her multiple chocolate milkshakes. Once all the food was prepared you brought it all to Colleen, who was still asleep. Waking her up was easy, as you gave her a kiss on her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Why did you wake me up?\" she said in a playful tone. All you did was show her the food and she got up grabbing the food.\" You always know what to make for breakfast. You should consider opening a restaurant.\" she said as she started to devour her breakfast. As she ate and grew fuller you start to rub her belly. You looked at how happy she was as she continued to eat.\" I can't wait for all this to turn into fat. You know how much I love gaining weight. Almost as much as I love you.\" The two of you kissed as you said,\" I love you too. The feeling of your body, the way we make love, your the most beautiful girl in the world.

Along with that, you then noticed your plump fat-laden arms, covered in the same creamy yellow fur as the rest of your body, complete with slightly plump paw-like hands and fingers. Just below your womanly breasts, you then noticed your fat blubbery apron belly, jutting out from below your breasts and hindering you from seeing your legs and paw-like feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of your lower half, you then saw how fat your butt, hips, and waist now were. Sure, they weren't just as large as your upper half, but still, it was very noticeable even from a short distance away. Plus, you were wearing a matching set of pink panties, which stuck out just below your fluffy Golden Retriever tail, as the panties comfortably hugged your fat booty with ease. Your legs were just as fat as the rest of you, with your thighs being the fattest parts of your legs, as they pressed against one another, giving you a somewhat profound waddle in the process. Overall, your entire furry frame had developed a prominent apple shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you felt around your crotch area underneath your fat laden belly, only to realize that you're now physically a fat female furry. \"Oh.....O-Oh my.....\" You thought to yourself, causing you to blush out of sheer embarrassment.

But suddenly, you then heard several knocks from the closed door behind you, as you then heard Colleen speak to you with a sing-song tone in her voice as she asked, \"Hellooooo? Honey, are you still in there? Your big blubbery Colleen is getting hungry. And besides, I'm sure you're feeling quite famished too, my big fat Goldie. *giggle*\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, you couldn't help but blush profusely, due to Colleen calling you by such a flirtatious pet name, you thought to yourself and said, \"Maybe this won't be so bad after all.\" </span></div></div>",

However, that all cultivated with an accidental bumping of bellies between Colleen's and your own, which enticed quite the blushing contest as you felt the rotund Road Rover's pregnancy-swollen abdomen smooshed and pressed itself against your own less bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInternally, you felt like you wanted to shatter into a thousand bashful pieces from such explicitly erotic mannerisms, especially when said internal embarrassment involved the individual whom was basically your childhood crush. However, Colleen on the other hand, initially was embarrassed as well, but she soon shrugged it off with an honest giggle, which involuntarily made her adipose-filled form jiggle and wobble like overactive gelatin in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*giggle*</b> My, my! You're certainly chuffed for some belly-play, ain't ya Goldie?\" She chirped, to which she briefly flaunted her now exposed breasts to you, pressing them against one another to make them appear just a tad fuller. Of course, this undoubtedly made you a little flustered, along with feeling this gnawing moist yet warm feeling in your now established womanhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just as she unexpectedly pulled you in for a wet-nosed kiss, your fattened forms oozed and squished against one another, thus making the feeling of the anthro Collie's pregnant abdomen all the more prevalent and obvious to you. From there, Colleen cheekily gave you a flirtatious smack on your fat furry bum, which also elicited a unsuspecting <b>\"Yeep!!\"</b> in the process. Though, you figured by the flirty smack of your fattened ass, you should make a hearty breakfast post-haste, with not even thinking of getting a bra or panties on as you waddled out the double doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you didn't have eyes in the back of your head, you had a feeling that Colleen was liking the view of your cream-furred butt wobbling about whilst you lumbered about with a waddling gait, as her floofy Collie tail wagged to and fro with an almost palpable feeling of affectionate intimacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>=====</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, while Colleen tended to her own devices back in the bedroom, you aimlessly waddled your way down a wide hallway, unsure of your sense of direction in such an unfamiliar place.

And what you came upon next took you back in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of bearing witness to your old crummy one-bedroom apartment, it was now entirely replaced by what is essentially a $2,500 dollar apartment condo. In appearance, the entire complex had this spacious and roomy presence to it, with the most obvious spectacle being one of the main walls replaced by a massive sheet of plexiglass, giving a grand view of what you've soon came to the conclusion that you're looking at downtown London. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...I guess this does make a little bit of sense, I suppose.\"</i> You thought, making some semblance of sense, considering Colleen's well-established nationality, which seemed to be one of the crucial facts carried over from the cartoon series. However, your curiosity inevitably got the best of you, to which you proceeded to curiously explore your much fancier abode. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first <i>\"Room\"</i> (Or at least, what you could call a room due to the lack of walls separating them) you noticed was what you assumed to be the Living Room, judging from the comfy-looking Wayfair sectional sofa set and oaken coffee table, which sat opposite of a downright massive 120 inch Flatscreen TV, racked up against the wall, with a set of expensive video game consoles placed on a small entertainment centre, complete with a DVR set and Internet Router.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, much to your embarrassment, your flabby stomach swiftly made it's current mood known, as it began to growl loudly in gluttonous protest. Second verse same as the first, your chubby furry cheeks turned a crimson hue once more, to which you instinctively placed an unsure yet plump paw-like hand upon the furry globular sack that is your belly, unable to help but feel a cocktail of mixed emotions regarding your newfound gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*sigh*</b> ...I suppose I should get you thoroughly fed, huh?\" You said aloud, speaking to your furry apron of a stomach akin to an old friend or relative. And with that, previously noticing the large kitchenette to the left, you lumbered your way over towards the kitchen area, becoming just a little more accustomed to the waddling gait you're now sporting with each chubby footed step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering the open room, you easily became aware of the two behemoth refrigerators standing side-by-side with one another. To put it aptly, they appeared more akin to fridges you would find at a million-dollar bakery joint, as you soon noticed some distinguishing features adorned upon both appliances:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both had these names elegantly engraved on the front doors of both fridges, with the first fridge emblazoned with the word <i><b>\"GOLDIE\"</b></i> upon the door, while the second had the name <i><b>\"COLLEEN\"</b></i> was imprinted on the second refrigerator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, the metaphorical signs that you and the now obesely pregnant Colleen were in a strongly romantic yet suggestively erotic relationship became all the more prevalent to you with each passing second. Though, figuring that your growing and encroaching hunger would not patiently wait for you to search for some answers, you put such a personal mission on the back-burner for the time being, where you then toddled over towards the Goldie refrigerator, pulling the door open by it's stainless steel door handle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn turn, you soon glimpsed at a various assortments of calorie-filled sweets and cuisines, from juicy jelly-filled croissants and scones, to several bloated triple-layered cakes of varying flavors, frosting, and cream filling. You never had a sweet tooth yourself, but you could appreciate a fine slice of cake, as you felt yourself subconsciously lick your plump canine chops with a salivating tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as if your body went on autopilot, you began to greedily yet gently scoop up a substantial amount of sweets into your round doughy bingo-winged arms, which included a gargantuan squared-off triple-layer choco-strawberry cake, half a dozen cream &amp; jelly-filled croissants, and two dozen frosting-coated cinnamon rolls each the size of a man's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you carefully placed each of the calorie-rich sweets upon the massively sturdy steel table, setting the cake down first, then the croissants and cinnamon rolls shortly afterwards. However, you were so preoccupied with the sweets that you didn't notice a certain heavyset Road Rover sneakily (Or...about as sneaky as someone weighing over 500 pounds can be) waddled up to you, and with a surprisingly swift motion, she cheekily flopped herself onto you from behind, letting out a giddy war cry as she excitedly squealed, \"Bum Bump!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could even react, you soon felt Colleen quickly rammed herself into you belly-first, which in turn bumped and pressed itself against your cream-furred beachball-sized buttcheeks, with your Golden Retriever tail being inadvertently sandwiched between the two fattened body parts. Regardless, your eyes shot wide open, complete with a deeper crimson blush adorning your cheeks as you then felt Colleen coyly fondle with the uppermost curve of your pooching belly and undercarriage of your equally plump breasts, not unlike a few certain anime characters with some perverted tendencies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, you were a little taken aback at how Colleen was still able to perform such a feat at her current size and weight, as you then instinctively turned your head a little to gaze back at the fondling Cano-Sapien, to which you quickly stammered, \"O-Oh h-hi there, sweetie! I-I thought you were busy getting dressed?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And miss the chance to chat up <i>(flirt)</i> with my favorite girl whose britches are so podgy <i>(fat)</i> I can stack my novellas on 'em and they wouldn't fall off? Pfft! Not a chance, luv!\" She cheekily chirped, gleefully groping the underside of your fat boobs once more before letting you go to present herself. Curiously, you turned your hefty self around to face Colleen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once you got a good gander at the obese anthropomorphic Collie, you could clearly see that she was undoubtedly wearing...</span></div></div>",

Overall, whilst she performed a seductive twirl to show off her old uniform at her current size, you had this literal gut feeling that the layered outfit won't last another minute at this rate, judging from hearing all these brief sounds of <i><b>*groaning*</b></i> and <i><b>*creaking*</b></i> coming from the costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...honey? Are you sure that old thing still fits? It looks like it's gonna, erm...<i>burst</i>.\" You asked, easily voicing your concerns towards the heavyset Collie, to which she stopping flaunting her stuff to look at you, eyebrow raised, and then sharply quipped, \"What? Of course it still bloody fits, luv!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to demonstrate the suit's durability, she forcibly hopped up and down twice or thrice, which caused her entire blubber-filled physique to violently wobble, ripple, and jiggle like a can of soda being viciously shaken. From there, Colleen stopped hopping on the third jump, and surprisingly, despite tell-tale sounds coming from the stressed fabrics of the outfit, the Collie's old Road Rover uniform still held up quite well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! See? She still fits like a glove!\" Colleen exclaimed, feeling triumphant in proving otherwise. And in a form of rubbing it in, she gave both sides of her mammoth preggo belly a swiftly audible belly slap. However, it was the straw that broke the camel's back, as the suit finally gave way to Colleen's plentiful obesity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*RIP!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*RRIIIIPP!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*ZZZSHHRRIIIIPP!!!*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in a pseudo-domino effect, the fabric of the undersuit spontaneously gave way to numerous huge tears scattered across it's form, easily exposing all the fur and flab Colleen sported, followed closely by the cavalcade of snapping straps, which caused several large pieces of plated armor popping off and collapsing onto the tiled floor with a metallic <b>*Clang!!*</b>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the only section of body armor that still desperately clung onto Colleen's obesely rotund form was the too-small breastplate, and that was only putting it mildly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you found the sight before you rather comical, you were luckily able to stifle your laughter, to which your bright eyes looked over Colleen, who now bore a hilariously mortified expression upon her chubby canine face and snout, widened eyes and a deep crimson blush on her plump cheeks included.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww bollocks.\" Were the only words she could think of at the heat of the moment, to which her gaze refocused back onto you, where you now bore this smug smirk upon your plump canine face and snout, bingo-winged arms crossed as best as you could physically do given your abundant cleavage and abdomen, tail calmly wagging in a slow deliberate manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph! Okay, so I may have snuck in a few midnight sweets and gained tenner <i>(Ten pounds)</i>, big whoop!\" She huffed, violently tearing off what little straps remained on the little remaining pieces of armor that still clung onto her rotund features, where you then calmly reassured, \"It's not bad to try on some old things of your's, Colleen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*sigh*</b> I know, luv. I just felt a little...<i>nostalgic</i>.\" She sighed, only for her signature cheerful rapier-sharp wit to resurface, to which she snapped back at you and cheekily proclaimed, \"Though, don't think you're off the hook for the giggles moments ago!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, you felt a bit of a chill run down your fur-coated back, as Colleen cheekily waddled off toward a nearby pantry, only to soon return moments later, now carrying...</span></div></div>",

Though, after watching one too many anime, your mind's eye painted a clear enough picture as to what exactly the heavyset Road Rover had in store for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And besides, just because I'm the fatter one in our relationship and carrying our litter, that doesn't mean I'm not gonna let you off scot-free without stuffing that belly of yours to the brim.\" She chirped, her vocal tone had a bit of that signature English feistiness she's known for, all whilst she the nylon rope a snappy tug to emphasize what she was going to do with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, you instinctively gulped a big one down your throat in hesitation, and like guiding a lost puppy, Colleen motioned you towards one of the wider chairs, all whilst she quipped, \"Oh come now, Goldie! No need to lose your bottle <i>(nerve)</i> on me. After all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, she calmly sashayed her way around you, casually wrapping the nylon rope around your arms, restraining them to the back of the chair, securing it tightly with a rope knot suitable enough for the Royal Navy, giving it a tug or two to see if it was properly sturdy enough for what she was planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd whilst you couldn't help but become a bit flustered from all the erotic attention you were receiving, Colleen quickly returned to face you, now holding the dozen jelly-filled croissants in the thick meaty arms, to which she then leaned in close enough to whispered into your left floppy canine ear and hushly flirted, \"...We both know how arse over tit you can be when it comes to us fatsos. Right, luv?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So...I'm the reason why Colleen's so fat? But how come I'm so big as well?\"</i> You thought, obviously a little surprised at such a revelation, as you watched as the corpulent Collie gently placed each of the inflated croissants upon a large silver platter to use, obviously so she can use a free hand to shove those tasty treats down your gullet. From there, she looked back at you, pressing her larger belly against your own in an almost domineering fashion as she did so, to which she then calmly asked, \"...Now then, are you gonna behave like a good tubby pup and eat all your food?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly enough, despite your previous sexual preferences, you couldn't help but find the foreplay banter all the more kinky. And yet, since you were tied up at the moment, you decided to play it safe and go along with this fetish-fueled fantasy, as you then coyly opened your chubby canine mouth, akin to a gift horse. Upon seeing you submit, Colleen gave off a warm nurturely smile, to which she playfully patted your belly, as your stomach then pleaded with an audible growl whilst she chirped, \"Good girl! Now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then grabbed one of the bloated croissants with a plump forepaw, where she then calmly guided the edible towards your awaiting maw, adding up to the foreplay whilst she cheekily sung, \"...Don't forget to chew for Mama Colleen~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, you did as you were told, as you chowed down upon the stuffed croissant, your canine tongue soon tasting the sweetened jelly filling capsuled inside the French dessert. However, due to your tubby paws and bingo-winged arms currently restrained for the time being, the devouring of the croissant inevitably became messy, as a bit of apricot jelly oozed some down the sides of your snout, staining a little of your creamy yellow fur with each chomp on the croissant. Ultimately, despite the forced sloppy eating, you were able to swallow the chewed remains of the croissant, as it passed down your throat and landed inside the bowels of your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww! Who's a good pup? Who's a good chubby puppy~?\" She chirped, finding you rather adorable in your current restrained  state, as she playfully rubbed your flabby belly like a owner would with their pet dog. And yet, strangely enough, it was actually rather delightful and relaxing to experience at the same time, which caused you to compulsively wag your Golden Retreiver tail with gleeful enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the blissful euphoria dissipated once Colleen moved her paw-like hand back to continue the feeding session, which soon made you experience this lonely woeful feeling swelling up in your heart. In turn, you suddenly began to...well, whimper like an actual puppy, making this adorable whining noises in the process, pleading for more belly rubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Goldie. You'll get more rubs when you've eaten all your breakfast. Now, open wiiiide~!\" Colleen cooed, getting your undivided attention hook, line, and sinker, as she continued to feed you one inflated croissant at a time, resuming the cycle of eating, chewing, swallowing, and repeat. You weren't sure how long this went on for, but you could not deny how...<i>sensational</i> and <i>blissfully euphoric</i> it all felt, just as your furry belly began to slowly balloon outwards little by little, centimeter by centimeter with each chewed-up croissant making their home inside your stomach, giving off this slow enveloping feeling of warmth across your abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, by the time Colleen had finished with personally feeding you...</span></div></div>",

However, your plump bingo-winged arms were still bound behind the chair, whilst Colleen loaded the empty dishes from your feeding into the oversized dishwasher, all while she gluttonously nibbled on a plate full of glazed doughnuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, fortunately for you, Colleen wasn't known to have a truly sadistic streak, and after finishing off the last doughnut and licking the glazed icing from her plump pawed fingers, the heavyset anthropomorphic collie waddled up behind you and undid the pristine knot on the nylon rope, thus freeing your chubby cream furred arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, your first instinct for your liberated limbs was to try to ease the throbbing distended feeling your bloated taut stomach was giving off, rubbing the drum-tight lovehandles of your abdomen in slow circular motions, all whilst (much to your internal surprise) elicited a few femininely canine whimpers from just how slightly painful it was to have a tightly-packed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to help but find the sight before quite adorable (especially with puppy-like whimpers emanating from your canine snout), Colleen circled around you, where she then slowly pressed her flabby apron of a gut against your own distended abdomen as to avoid discomfort for you, to which she soon began to knead and rub the furry surface of your stomach as she coyly teased, \"Aww! Who's a cute tubby pupper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, despite all the flirty puppy-talk she was giving you, you were actually enjoying all the lovey-dovey attention Colleen was giving you, just as she then leaned in a little closer to then plant a chubby kiss upon your plump snout. In a brief fleeting glimpse, you can almost taste the scent of chocolate chip waffles upon her breath and tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou honestly wished that this moment could last for hours, as your stomach started to deflate as the sweets digested into squeezable blubber. After all, you had a sneaking suspicion that you'll probably need some bigger lingerie and clothes in due time, as you felt your already bulky buttcheeks dimpling just a little more with each passing minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, such erotic pleasure and romantic intimacy would have to be concluded for the time being, as both you and Colleen soon heard the distinctive sounds of...</span></div></div>",

So, out of mere curiosity from this impossible conundrum, you voluntarily decided to explore your home, to see if anything else had changed along with acquiring yourself an obese Colleen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, you quietly dismounted yourself from your bed, so as to awaken the slumbering anthropomorphic canine, who proceeded to unconsciously roll onto her voluminous backside, as her flabby apron belly slowly inflated and deflated with each slumbering breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you slowly tiptoe your way toward the door, which now appeared to be a wide pair of oak double doors. You slowly turned the doorknob and quietly exited the bedroom, cautiously closing the door behind you. Honestly, you'd thought she would wake up, since dogs are know to have sensitive hearing. Then again, Colleen might be a heavy sleeper, no pun intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you were out of earshot, you exhaled a deep breath and thought, <i>\"...Okay, this is...weird. How the hell did Colleen get here? She's supposed to be a cartoon character!\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, your thoughts soon continued, <i>\"Also, why is she so...FAT?!\"</i> Suffice to say, you were undoubtedly confused about this entire situation. I mean, sure Colleen was basically your childhood crush, despite being a fictional character, and you've seen many pictures of her on DeviantArt, but still...how the hell did she get so big? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, you knew you had to find some answers, as you then began to realize how different your entire home was now. Originally, you lived in a small but decent one-bedroom apartment, but now...now it looked more akin to a goddamn penthouse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Okay, this is...new.\"</i> You thought to yourself, being surprisingly calm about all of this, as you began to explore your new environs. First, you head into the kitchen area, which was now larger and more spacious, obviously to accommodate a certain obese anthropomorphic Collie, complete with an industrial-sized fridge and freezer combo, as well as a smaller refrigerator alongside it, which most likely belonged to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlongside that, there was a large dining area, complete with what appeared to be a downright massive reinforced chair big enough to hold two to three people at once, obviously meant for Colleen, given her currently established size and girth. From there, you then noticed the Living Room area, complete with a ruby red love seat, mahogany oak coffee table, 108 inch Flatscreen TV, video game console, and entertainment center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to your left from the Dining Room area, you noticed an outdoor terrace balcony area, blocked off by a set of pristine plexiglass windows and a wide plexiglass sliding door, just as the morning sun began to ascend upon a metropolis before you. It was there that you took notice of the elaborate yet stylized patio area, complete with a Jacuzzi tub large enough for Colleen to easily sit her fat self in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, it was certainly a place fit for a Triple-A film actor, not someone who is married to a fictional cartoon character from the 1990s. Overall, this felt really weird, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, your attention soon altered upon seeing what looked to be a bookcase stored with books on the lower half, and a set of framed photographs on the upper half. Becoming rather curious (as well as seeking definitive answers to what has transpired), you calmly approached the bookcase, looking at the photographs displayed within the ornate picture frames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, the first two photos were of you and your many relatives. However, upon looking at the third framed photo, you could clearly make out the distinguished appearances if the famed Road Rovers. From left to right, there stood, Hunter, the Golden Retriever from the U.S. Blitz, the Doberman from Germany. Exile, the Husky from Siberia. Shag, the Old English Sheepdog from Switzerland. And Muzzle, the berserk Rottweiler, who's always kept in a straitjacket and dog muzzle, due to his violent tendencies. And finally, stood you and Colleen, hands around each other's waists whilst facing the camera. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from the background, you and the Road Rovers seem to be outside of the Road Rovers' main headquarters in New Mexico. <i>\"Well... This certainly explains a few things.\"</i> You mentally noted, easily noticing yourself wearing some military body armor and holstering a M92F Beretta sidearm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, upon closer inspection of the photograph, you noticed something big and humanoid standing in the center behind Exile and Shag. It looked lanky yet nimble, as it was adorned with these sharp and angular pieces of white armor, bearing these glowing green eye-like optics below a large horned V-shaped golden headpiece, with a white faceplate and blood red chin-piece. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you initially didn't recognize what it was. However, you soon experienced these brief yet vivid flashbacks of a violent and bloody conflict, in which only a name repeated in your frontal lobe:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGundam. Lupus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt echoed in your head for what seemed like ages, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...My god. Th-That... That's a Gundam!\"</i> Your thoughts shrieked, upon realizing that the giant robot was some sort of Gundam from the Mobile Suit Gundam Franchise, looking eerily similar to Gundam Barbatos from Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans, but with some key differences. The V-shaped horns were somewhat longer in the photo, as the mech appeared to be kneeling in the picture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"B-But how?

And the intense ferocity on both sides. This...was a battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"(Name)!! Get your ass over here! Parvo's got the professor!!\"</i> A voice rang out from the comms system inside the massive behemoth you piloted, the Gundam Lupus, just as you swiftly maneuvered it with inhuman agility and ferocity, killing an equally large Cano-Mutant via impaling it's skull with a nanofiber blade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognized it he voice belonging to Blitz, the German Doberman, judging from his thick accent. \"I'm on it!\" You instinctively quipped, due to it being such a livid memory, as you felt Gundam Lupus sprinting at full speed, slaying multiple building-sized Cano-Mutants in the process. And yet, you were aware that these Cano-Mutants were sent by the dreaded General Parvo in a siege against the Road Rovers HQ. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, Parvo was hellbent on conquering the world. You and the Road Rovers were in his way of such heinous ambitions. Much to you being in the backseat iif this memory, your past self moved the terrifying Mobile Suit with such dexterity and lethality that it felt like riding a bike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you approached the center of the siege, you saw Colleen fighting against Parvo, who seemed to have his own Mobile Suit, which he called \"Gundam Felus\", since he was part-cat. <i>\"Let go of the Professor, you mangy furball!\"</i> Colleen yelled over the comms, trying to open the cockpit hatch to fight Parvo one-on-one, only to be violently swatted aside by the massive machine as Parvo sneered, <i>\"Pathetic bitch!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COLLEEN!!!\" You screamed, as Colleen violently smacked against the nearby wall, knocking her into a lifeless state. Surprisingly, you felt your blood boil with seething rage towards the madman, who cackled with glee over Colleen's unresponsive form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a surge of murderous intent, you violently throttled the controls at full speed, lunging at Parvo and Gundam Felus with such force whilst you roared, \"PARVOOOOOO!!!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You Insect!!\" He shouted, trying to surmount a counterattack, but he was too slow, as you unleashed Gundam Lupus's right clawed hand upon Gundam Felus's head, grabbing it and throwing the mechanized behemoth overhead and into a nearby wall! From there, you put the thrusters at max speed, ramming into Gundam Felus so hard that rock debris flew apart and Gundam Felus's armor getting dented and scratched up with each consecutive blow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, you felt like a berserker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate yet becoming terrified, Parvo summoned a few more Cano-Mutants as he yelled, \"Don't just stand there, you mangy mutts! KILL GUNDAM LUPUS!!!\" However, you soon noticed the three building-sized Cano-Mutants rushing toward you, where you instinctively tossed Parvo and Gundam Felus into his abominable creations, knocking them off their footing with such brute force! Then, you quickly pulled out the Bullhead Mace from it's sheath, blasting your thrusters on full capacity! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou readied your swing, and landed a mighty blow upon the first Cano-Mutant, caving in it's skull! From there, you swung around and bashed in the second Cano-Mutant in the arm, causing it to howl in extreme pain! And yet, whilst you brought the pain upon the bastards, Hunter and Exile, who managed to carry off Colleen to a safer location, noticed how Gundam Lupus's optics were now a bloody orange whilst in the midst of such carnage, which gave them great concern for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after killing the three Cano-Mutants, you slowly turned toward Parvo and Gundam Felus,  who merely stood there in fear. In anger, you violently tossed aside the Bullhead Mace, grabbed Gundam Felus by the throat, and you soon commanded Gundam Lupus to begin beating the living shit out of the opposing Mobile Suit, barely missing a beat with each violent punch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like it had gone on for hours. However, you soon stopped when Parvo opened the cockpit hatch, letting Professor Shepherd go, while Parvo fearfully pleaded, <i>\"Stop!! No more! Leave me be!\"</i> Shortly after letting the Professor escape from the two mechanized units, you soon lifted Gundam Felus above you and Gundam Lupus in a rather threatening stance and hissed, \"...If I EVER!! see you trying to take the professor, attempt to conquer the world, or even lay a single finger on Colleen...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you quickly yet violently pulled the Gundam Felus closer, your voice spewing and seething with venomous rage and growled, \"...I will make you regret ever becoming a villain. <b>DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME, YOU FELINE-LOVING PUNK!?!?!?!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Y-Y-Yes sir.\" Parvo whimpered, as if he just pissed himself in sheer fear. From there, just as he was about to run away, you quickly placed Gundam Felus over your head, then violently ripped the damaged machine in two with such abhorrent strength from the Gundam Lupus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, <i>\"pissed off\"</i> was putting it mildly for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that eventful memory reaching it's inevitable conclusion, your mind soon returned back to the present. You were reeling somewhat from the intense moment you've just witnessed. And yet, as you tried not to puke your own guts out from seeing such unfiltered violence, you soon questioned, <i>\"But...What happened to Colleen? Is...she alright?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, after recollecting yourself from the floor, you soon got back up noticed...</span></div></div>",

You had hit the machine\u2019s snooze button with the palm of your right hand. You leaned back to bed for five more minutes of extra sleep, but you noticed some drastic changes in your bedroom that woke you up in great concern.  When you went to bed last night, you had left you clothes on the floor, but now the floor is not only empty of those clothes but also vacuumed as well.  Your clothes were cleaned and all folded neatly and organized in your dresser drawers. Your office desk has been dusted and your bookshelf had its contents all alphabetized. You also saw that your bed had gotten a lot bigger overnight, it was once a single innerspring mattress but now a queen sized mattress of memory foam. Even worse, whoever or whatever did this somehow manage to install a large ensuite, with a toilet, bathtub, and shower, where one of the bedroom windows should be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As you wonder how could anything have possibly redid your bedroom without you knowing, you hear a giggling coming from a female voice outside the room.  However as you soon exit your bedroom you found who did this and you surprised as heck:  A lavender unicorn named Twilight Sparkle, from the My Little Pony Friendship is Magic animated television program, with very noticeable differences from the show.  First, she is able to stand and move upright with no complications. Secondly she now had a female humanoid body shape, her front legs are now arms with hands consisting of a thumb and four fingers each and the unicorn pony now had a pair of breasts in the position where human female breasts would normally be.  Third and most noticeable, was her very obese weight.   At 600 lbs., Twilight had an exercise ball sized belly apron that was smooth and orb like in appearance.  Her breasts had a terrific combination of jiggly-ness, perkiness, and squishiness to them even though Twilight\u2019s breasts were the size of medicine balls. Her butt was slightly smaller than her breasts but still swayed greatly along with her tail when she moved around.  Her hips were 4 and half feet wide and her arms and legs were very thick with fat. The Anthropomorphic Unicorn was wearing nothing but a lilac bra and matching panties, which only covered up her private parts. Even her unicorn horn on top of her mane seemed be to fatter as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGood morning sunshine.\u201d  She greeted as she pulled you into a big fat hug.

I made it myself.\u201d She said with the same excitement as her passion for books and learning, jumping up and down letting her flab jiggle in any which way.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She carried you out of the hallway and into your new kitchen.  The dining table was very large was filled with lots of food, all presented with five star restaurant quality.  French toast, waffles, blueberry pancakes, omelets, scrambled eggs, frittatas, biscuits and gravy, hash browns, breakfast potatoes, oatmeal, granolas, all kinds of breakfast cereals, cinnamon rolls, donuts, bear claws, Danishes, various slices of fresh fruit, glasses of fruit juices, and fresh milk.  From the look of the total quantity and the portion sizes of the food, you could roughly guess, that this meal was meant to serve 90 people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJust let me put on the finishing touches for a second.\u201d  Twilight said letting go of you and putting you into your seat, which was next to hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight activated her unicorn magic again, and this was much a better display of her mystical abilities.  Levitating a pile of sliced and buttered bread, she used a spell to manipulate the bread\u2019s temperature as a way of toasting it to a golden brown, melting the butter on top. Next Twilight Sparkle made Ice cubes by condensing moisture in the air, forming small cube shapes, freezing them and then dropped them gently into your juice glass.  She made a slight misjudgment in turning the magic off and accidently let the last ice block fall too quickly, splashing you in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhoops! Sorry about that.\u201d Twilight said, embarrassing herself over her magical mistake as she used a napkin and her chubby hand to wipe your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s all right.\u201d  You replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For all the grace and organization Twilight Sparkle put into making breakfast, she ate her large meal with none of that.  Twilight mixed cereals at random into a larger than normal bowl and poured the milk on with reckless abandon, was using her free hands to stuff herself full of pastries in between bites of whatever food her fork had skewered, and was gulping down cereal and milk, and juice like shot glasses. She wasn\u2019t a total slob however, she did clean her fattened muzzle from the occasional maple syrup, butter, and/or peanut butter and wiped the crumbs and syrup off of her giant breasts with a napkin, and she was incredibly fast and efficient in doing so.  All you had to eat was 2 waffles, an omelet, and milk before the anthro unicorn had finished everything, however that was best meal you had.  Twilight Sparkle had certainly put plenty of culinary effort and knowhow into making that meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHow was it honey?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI actually liked it, especially the milk.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThanks! It was \u2018locally\u2019 made.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat do you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your conversation got interrupted by phone ringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll get that!\u201d Twilight said, grabbing the phone with mystical telekinesis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHello? Oh hi! Yeah? Really? Today\u2019s going just as planned, my soul mate and I just got done with breakfast\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Unicorn was busy talking on the phone.  You could use the free time to look around your new house, or listen in to see Twilight\u2019s conversation might hold any clues to what\u2019s going on.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You decided to look around your new house, it would be rude to eavesdrop on someone\u2019s phone conversation after all, even if that someone was a 600 pound unicorn girl.  You told Twilight Sparkle you were going to wash your hands.  Twilight just nodded at you, giving approval.  You would have had walked out of kitchen if your new house wasn\u2019t open concept, the room was one big open space with three corners of the room were established as a kitchen/dining room, a living room, and a parlor and the walls being lined with bookshelves filled with all of the great works of fiction and nonfiction literature.  The room didn\u2019t match your old living space back in your old... well your memory about your old place seems to be a bit foggy at the moment.  The living room was also set up as a home theater.  The only things in the living room you could definitely remember was your video game consoles and the library of games neatly sorted in one of the bookshelves, Twilight must have been the one who had them organized, by system, by developer, by publisher, and by genre.  Twilight must seem to love organizing your property.   Your consoles were all hooked up to a 60 inch LCD HD television with an impossible amount of ports and such compared to most TV\u2019s.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You noticed down below the TV was an electric fireplace decorated by mason bricks, what seemed to be a nice looking throw rug placed onto the floor with care, a large light green sofa with 3 cushions and modified to fit Twilight Sparkle\u2019s hefty frame. The other bookshelves all had DVD\u2019s on them neatly organized to finest detail as well.  There were also a set of large surround sound speakers in the corners of the open floor. A coffee table was near the left end of the sofa, but unlike most coffee tables it was only slightly smaller than the dining table in kitchen.  An easy guess would be a \u201csmall\u201d snacking table for her.   There was also a shelf that housed a set of photographs, and they were wedding photos of you and Twilight Sparkle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight looked only around 500 lbs. in the first photo, but was wearing the most beautiful wedding dress.  The wedding dress was white with subtle blue\u2019s, gloves that went to the middle of her forearm, a wedding veil decorated with stars and crescents, puffy shoulders, a necklace decorated with Amethysts, Sapphires, and diamonds. The second was the unicorn anthro in that same wedding dress stuffing her face completely silly with wedding cake, and the third one was you and Twilight dancing in a waltz out on a marble balcony. These photos were certainly genuine and impossible to be doctored. You seem to remember that wedding well, right down to Belinda Carlisle\u2019s 1987 hit single \u201cHeaven is a Place on Earth\u201d being the official song of you two, but that didn\u2019t make any sense at all.  You knew Twilight Sparkle to be a fictional character, and yet she\u2019s real and super fat as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You then just decided to shake that thought out for the moment and just get back to looking around the place.  Your new house now has second floor staircase and obviously a second floor to go with it.  The kitchen Twilight Sparkle took you to have breakfast at was on the first floor, and usually the master bedroom would be on the second floor you thought, you were too busy being smothered in unicorn blubber to notice her taking you down the steps you thought.  You went up the stairs and back into the hallway.  The doors were labeled with what their respective functions were, the bathroom was labeled \u201cHall Bathroom\u201d for example.  There was one room with its door slightly ajar that had gotten you attention, \u201cNursery\u201d. Not only were you married to an ultra-fat Twilight Sparkle, the two of you were having kids.  The only thing you could see clearly in the room without opening the door was a positive pregnancy test.  The first thing that came into your mind after you got over the shock of parenthood was wondering whether or not this was Twilight\u2019s first pregnancy.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>However, just as you were about to cautiously enter the \"Nursery\", you abruptly heard a youthful female voice to your right as it said, \"Good Morning, Daddy!\" Of course, in response to such a voice, you swiftly turned your head in the direction of the voice's precise origin, which revealed to you something surprising: There was what appeared to be a young anthropomorphic Unicorn mare, standing in the middle of the hallway just a few feet away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, she was approximately 3 feet in height, around the same height as a 7 year old girl. However, she appeared to have some of the same physical traits as the anthropomorphic yet 600 pound obese Twilight Sparkle, including an anthropomorphic physique, light mauve fur, a small but somewhat pronounced Unicorn horn protruding from her forehead, and a lengthy but beautiful equine mane and tail, which had streaks of violet, light blue, and a single streak of dirty blonde. From there, upon closer inspection, you noticed that her eyes were two separate colors, with her left eye being a moderate violet tone, while her right eye had a jade green hue. Though as for clothing, the young anthro Unicorn made was currently wearing a pink nightgown upon her youthful petite frame, as she comfortably held a Wookie plushie in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind processed the very words she said to you, which ultimately confirmed what you were suspecting: This wasn't Twilight Sparkle's first pregnancy, for this young anthropomorphic Unicorn mare who stood before you was indeed the biological offspring of you and the obese anthro Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, as if it was instantaneous, you suddenly remembered the name of your Unicorn daughter, Dawn Sparkle, as you knelt down to her height, and calmly picked her up in your arms. From there, you automatically spoke to her with a paternal tone in your voice and said, \"Morning to you too, pumpkin. How did you sleep last night?\" \"Oh, pretty good. Where's Mommy?\" She asked, wanting to know where her mother, Twilight Sparkle, was currently located. \"Hmm, probably still talking on the phone, Dawn.\" You casually explained, as you carried your daughter with little effort whilst you made your way back downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as soon as you made it downstairs with your daughter Dawn Sparkle in your arms, you couldn't help but eavesdrop on her phone conversation, just as you then noticed that Twilight was now wearing a large purple turtleneck sweater, which clung snugly to her rotund form and left little to the imagination regarding how much adipose billowed on her anthropomorphic frame, where you then heard her speak into the cell phone and said, \"...Mm-hmm. Oh yeah! Yeah, I'm very grateful for you and Coco Pommel for making some bigger clothes for me, Rarity. After all, I'm not exactly going to be getting skinnier anytime soon, considering I'm already a good ways into my second pregnancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her already confirming to you that she was indeed speaking to Rarity, one of the Mane Six and the Element of Generosity bearer, Twilight continued to converse with her fashionista friend, just as the anthro Unicorn made placed a gentle but slightly plump hand around the undercarriage of her well-stuffed blubbery belly, giving it a light shake, causing it to jiggle lightly in response, feeling how pleasuring and euphoric it was to have a bloated pregnant belly stuffed with delicious food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh (Name)? Yes, yes! Of course he's treating me well, Rarity! I mean, he's basically been pampering and spoiling me like a queen ever since we've started dating many moons ago. In a good way, of course!\" Twilight replied, as she gently began to rub the side of her belly in slow but soft circles, thus allowing her stomach to have an easier time digesting all that food she devoured earlier. From there, as she listened to Rarity on the phone, Twilight spoke back toward her friend and answered, \"...Well, to be honest, Rarity, there IS a legitimate reason why I haven't slimmed down ever since I've dated (Name). And the truth is, well... I, um... I actually really like being this big and fat. Why? *nervous giggle* Well, truth be told, Rarity, (Name) happens to be what they call a \"Chubby Chaser\" here on Earth. It means he's into *ahem* \"larger\" girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was I surprised? Oh Sweet Celestia, I was! I mean, I honestly wasn't aware that there were those who like a mare with a lot of fat on her. Sure, I was reluctant at first to let myself go, but he was there to reassure me that I could stop at anytime I want, that he wasn't forcing me to get ridiculously fat whatsoever.\" Twilight explained, doing her best to reassure Rarity that she did this out of her love towards you, which made you feel a little warm on the inside. Although you couldn't quite hear what Rarity said to the obese anthro Unicorn, Twilight swiftly replied, \"How much do I weigh right now? Well, last time I checked, Rarity, I just passed the 600 pound mark. I mean, I'm so big now that I can't even see the scale's numbers past this blubbery belly of mine anymore. Fortunately, (Name) was there to give me an accurate reading on my exact weight. So yeah, I'm a REALLY big girl now by this point. *giggle*\"</span></div></div>",

It took Twilight 45 minutes in the kitchen to finish up cleaning the dishes of her gigantic breakfast, and you were looking over Dawn Sparkle as she watched some classic cartoons on the TV.

From there, you drove the SUV out of the driveway of your 3-story suburban home, heading down the very streets that led toward downtown Chicago, Illinois. Along the way to the grocery store, you spoke toward Twilight and said, \"So, um... How's Spike been doing?\" \"Oh, he and Rarity are doing pretty good from what she has told me over the phone. Though, I must admit, sweetie: I truthfully miss seeing him now that he has moved in with Rarity and Sweetie Belle when I left Equestria to stay with you.\" Twilight explained, with the subtle hints of feeling a little homesick, considering that from what you could gather, she voluntarily left Equestria to live with you on Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, attempting to divert onto a different topic, you decided to turn on the radio as you said, \"Well, um... Anyway, let's see what's playing right now.\" And within a few turns of the dial, you inadvertently stumbled upon a radio podcast, as the person on the radio spoke with an ecstatic attitude and said, \"Hey, welcome to Mane 99.8, Chicago's top radio show for all things Equestria! My name's Johnny \"Wings\" Angus, and today, dear listeners... We have a very special guest: Ladies and gents, give it up for the one, the only, DJ PON-3!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could listen to the podcast any further, you, Twilight, and Dawn had soon arrived at the recently built grocery store, known as \"Clydesdale's Supermarket For Equestrian Groceries\". From what you had learned so far, it seemed that you being married to an obese anthropomorphic Twilight Sparkle wasn't just an idle circumstance, as you could clearly see ordinary human beings interacting with anthropomorphic Ponies of various colors and body structures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is the place.\" Twilight said, as she then used her magic to pull out and unravel a scroll, which contained a large list of ingredients that needed to be gathered and cataloged. Or at least, that was Twilight's intellectual mentality, as she casually stepped out of the SUV and walked her way inside the grocery store, her padded billowing hips sashaying from left to right in an almost seductive manner underneath her red plaid skirt. From there, you and your daughter, Dawn Sparkle, soon followed suit, making sure that Twilight was looking where she was going. Suffice to say, you somehow knew that this might be a hectic shopping trip.</span></div></div>",

Overall, you could easily see that the obese anthropomorphic Twilight Sparkle (and potentially a few other Ponies) certainly have quite the appetite, as you calmly parked the SUV in the driveway. From there, Dawn swiftly exited out of the parked vehicle by herself, wearing a purple T-Shirt, blue shorts, and pink sandals, as she casually entered the spacious house, using the magic from her still developing Unicorn horn to turn the doorknob, then pushed the door open with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you and Twilight proceeded to carry in the groceries yourselves, with you carrying a total of 4 grocery bags in each hand. Twilight on the other hand, was hauling most of the grocery bags without breaking a sweat, carrying 3 bags in each hand, while using her magic to levitate the rest of the grocery bags with little to no effort, as you noticed how bright Twilight's Unicorn horn was currently glowing with a bright mauve aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all three of you were inside the large mansion-like house, Twilight gently lowered the levitated groceries onto the Island Table with relative ease, while you proceeded to place the grocery bags you were carrying alongside the rest of the groceries. \"Well, that was much easier than I thought, as expected.\" Twilight said, beaming a little with self-pride at her personal organization talents, which caused her blubbery pregnant belly to jiggle lightly along with her voluminous breasts. Moments later, Twilight soon pulled out another scroll from her bulbous bosom, then used her magic to levitate and unravel the scroll as she spoke to herself and said, \"Now then, let's see what needs to be made...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Apple Salad and Caramel Apples for Applejack... Apple Cider and Banana Bun Cake for Rainbow Dash... Lemon Cream Cake and Strawberry Lemonade for Fluttershy... Raspberry Jelly Cake and Hay Sandwich for Rarity... A Large Strawberry Shortcake and Chocolate Souffl\u00e9 for Pinkie Pie... And some Emeralds, Rubies, and a 9 Ounce Sirloin Steak for Spike... Yep, I think that's about it!\" Twilight said to herself, putting her photographic memory to full use, remembering what each of her 5 friends and Spike are going to be having for Lunch today. From there, Twilight soon began to work on preparing the lunch food, multitasking with a combination of Unicorn magic and good old fashioned homemade culinary cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering if she might need some assistance, you spoke toward Twilight and asked, \"Um, Twilight? Do you need any help with that?\" \"Oh this? Don't worry, sweetie. I can handle this. Plus, I've gotten MUCH better at cooking thanks to some pointers from Applejack and Pinkie Pie. And besides, don't you have a multiplayer session with your friends on Grand Theft Auto Online today? Something about doing a \"Doomsday Heist\"?\" Twilight answered, reassuring you that she can handle the cooking by herself, as well as reminding you that you have a date with your friends on Grand Theft Auto Online, especially since you and three of your buddies were planning on playing the brand new Doomsday Heist missions in GTA Online.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eventually, several hours had flown by, as you played Grand Theft Auto Online on your PlayStation 4, coordinating with your online buddies during one of the Setup missions for the Doomsday Heist mission series. Suffice to say, this online session was certainly going better than you previously expected, as you calmly maneuvered the Mobile Command Center vehicle along the highway with relative ease, while your 3 online buddies were currently inside the vehicle's massive trailer, aiming the vehicle's defenses against any oncoming pursuers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, moments after completing the Setup mission with a relatively high score, you suddenly heard the doorbell ring explicitly, which indicated that someone might be at the door. \"Hold on, I'm coming.\" Twilight said, who had finally finished making all of the required delicacies for her friends in such short time, as she casually waddled over toward the main double doors to greet whoever was at your doorstep. From there, upon opening both doors, there stood approximately 6 anthropomorphic Ponies of various physiques and a single adolescent anthropomorphic purple Dragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to seeing them, a cheerful smile appeared on Twilight's chubby equine snout, where she spoke toward them and ecstatically said, \"Girls!\" From there, despite her bulk and girth, Twilight swiftly wrapped her plump arms around what appeared to be an anthropomorphic version of Applejack, hugging one of her closest friends as she answered, \"Oh, it's so good to see you all again!\" \"Same 'ere, Twi.\" Applejack replied, as Twilight politely gestured her friends to come inside her home. It was there you then noticed how physically different each of the remaining members of the Mane Six were now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one to enter was Applejack, who was wearing a pair of denim overalls with a white T-Shirt underneath. In appearance, the cowgirl of a mare appeared to be just as fat as Twilight, complete with a massive apron belly jutting out from underneath her overalls due to consuming loads of Apple-flavored cuisines. However, her arms and hoofed legs told a different story, and instead of displaying equal amounts of adipose, there was a noticeably large amount of muscles on both sets of orange fur limbs, which should belong on a bodybuilder, but you figured those muscles were from Applejack bucking a lot of apple trees. On top of her burgeoning belly, Applejack sported a bountiful pair of Double E-Cup breasts underneath her large white T-Shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came Rainbow Dash, who was currently wearing a blue Gym tanktop and Gym Shorts, along with wearing a pair of black fingerless gloves. In appearance, she had a vastly more athletic physique than the obese Twilight Sparkle and the muscle-gut Applejack, complete with toned muscles and a rock solid pair of 8 pack abs underneath all that cyan fur. After that, Fluttershy walked inside, wearing a lemon yellow turtleneck sweater and blue jeans. In appearance, the timid yellow anthropomorphic Pegasus was certainly sporting a chubby physique, but she certainly wasn't as fat as Twilight and Applejack in terms of size and girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Rarity waltzed her way inside the house, who wore a tight form-fitting pair of designer jeans, a purple V-neck tanktop, and a white leather designer jacket. In appearance, Rarity proudly sported a slim but curvaceous hourglass figure, complete with a perky pair of Double D-Cup breasts. And last but not least, Pinkie Pie made her way in. Or rather, she waddled her way in, wearing a humongous pair of pink sweatpants and a massive light blue T-shirt. In appearance, she was certainly the fattest member of the Mane Six, appearing to be a little over a hundred pounds heavier than Twilight herself, complete with a big blubbery apron belly stuffed into the front of her sweatpants, which did little to conceal it's size and girth. Overall, you figured that Pinkie Pie might have been tasting her own sweets at Sugarcube Corner to grow to such a blubbery size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Spike followed closely behind Rarity, wearing olive green cargo pants and a T-Shirt with the Injustice 2 logo imprinted on the front. In appearance, Spike had the athletic physique of your average teenager who often goes to the Gym, complete with some toned muscles subtly hidden underneath his purple draconian scales. Overall, everyone had finally entered inside the spacious house with little difficulty.</span></div></div>",

Of course, shortly after exiting her bedroom, she soon became very aware of the rest of the Mane Six and Spike, which filled her with excessive amounts of youthful glee and excitement on her mauve equine snout. In response, she quickly ran toward her Aunts as she gleefully exclaimed, \"Auntie Applejack!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, both Applejack and the other members of the Mane Six (excluding the rotund Twilight Sparkle) soon heard Dawn's exuberant voice, thus prompting Applejack to turn her enlarged muscle-gut physique around to greet her niece, kneeling down on one knee and extending her muscular arms outwards to embrace the youthful and petite Dawn Sparkle with orange furry open arms, where she happily replied, \"Hey, there's my favorite niece! Come give yer Auntie Applejack a hug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, Dawn ran headlong towards the corpulent Applejack, colliding with her massive belly, as Applejack wrapped her muscular arms around your daughter in a familial embrace, nuzzling the petite anthro Unicorn girl against her bountiful bosom for a moment or two then spoke toward Dawn and queried, \"So... How's mah favorite niece doing? Make any new friends here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* Oh yeah, Auntie Applejack! I made a lot of new friends at the school I go to!\" Dawn eagerly chirped, just as Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Spike, and Rarity soon said their greetings toward the youthful and petite Dawn Sparkle, greeting her with the same familial embrace as Applejack had performed previously. After all, it appeared they came all the way from Equestria just to see Dawn, just as the elephantine Pinkie Pie unrealistically but swiftly pulled out a large box, which turned out to house...</span></div></div>",

It was larger, by 4 four layers higher and 5 feet forward in every direction.  The Mane Six were in awe (with the heavier ones having their mouths open) at the cake\u2019s size.   The adults\u2019 cake was the same composition and flavors as Dawn\u2019s cake. The moment Pinkie Pie had set the birthday cake down, Twilight had already began cutting with a levitated knife and serving her friends, portion sized directly related to each pony\u2019s physique. After the girls (Mostly Pinkie, Twilight, and Applejack) finished the cake, Presents were opened, and Dawn loved each gift The Mane Six had given.  Your unicorn daughter had received a new clothing line from Rarity, A basketball hoop from Rainbow Dash, from Fluttershy, An R.C Tractor from Applejack, and an Ice Cream maker kit from Pinkie Pie.

That must be them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you casually approached the double doors, opening them to reveal the presence of anthropomorphic versions of Twilight's parents, Twilight Velvet and Night Light, as well as Twilight's brother, Shining Armor, and his wife, Princess Cadance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, Twilight Velvet apoeared as an average anthropomorphic version of herself, as well as her husband, but Shining Armor had a slightly more muscular physique, most likely due to his military raining in the Royal Guard. Though Cadance on the other hand, she was just as large as Applejack!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unlike Applejack, Cadance's muscles weren't as pronounced as Applejack's,  as said muscles were coated in plentiful amounts of plump cellulite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, guys! Come on in, we were just getting started.\" You said, gesturing them to come inside, where you then looked back at the rotund Twilight and exclaimed, \"Oh Twilight~! Guess who's here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Twilight looked behind her, quickly becoming rather excited to see her parents, as well as her beloved B.B.B.F.F (Big Brother Best Friend Forever), along with someone who was like a sister to her, despite her substantially larger physique. And yet, despite the extra weight and heft she now beared, Twilight rushed up to Cadance, where both the lavender Anthro Unicorn and the mildly larger pink Alicorn proceeded to greet one another with their \"Secret Hoofshake\", as they simultaneously said, <i>\"Sunshine, sunshine. Ladybugs awake! Clap your hooves and do a little shake.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Cadance! It's so good to see you and Shiny again!\" Twilight retorted, lividly hugging Cadance, despite their extensive girths and burgeoning bellies. In response, Cadance responded in kind, hugging her \"little sister\" in the process as she replied, \"*giggle* Same here, Twily! Though I must say, you're certainly catching up with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this soon made you realize that Cadance was certainly much heavier and fatter than Twilight, judging from what the elephantine pink Alicorn had just retorted. Though, judging from her overall size, Cadance must be weighing at least 800 pounds, maybe a bit more than that. Who knows!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brief moment later, Twilight soon directed her attention upon her brother, quickly tackling him with childish glee, as she quipped, \"*childish giggle* And how's my most favorite B.B.B.F.F?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*chuckle* Well, I certainly didn't want to miss my niece's special day, that's for sure, Twily!\" Shining answered, where you soon notice Dawn rushing over to both her grandparents, as well as her Aunt and Uncle, showing childish glee and enthusiasm as she exclaimed, \"Grandma! Grandpa! Uncle Shining and Aunt Cadance!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heyyyy! There's my favorite ball of sunshine!\" Cadance chirped, quickly scooping the Human-Unicorn hybrid into her thick doughy arms, hugging her against the pink Alicorn's round paunch of a belly. Of course, Cadance soon let Dawn down to greet her uncle and grandparents.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Does everypony have their luggage ready?\" Twilight quipped, her burgeoning belly jiggling slightly from such a proclamation, using her own Unicorn magic to levitate a set of six large luggage bags, whilst she wore a matching pair of lilac bras and panties underneath a casual ensemble, including a massive pair of booty short-shorts and a large T-shirt with an image of Jem &amp; The Holograms emblazoned on the garment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming, Mommy!\" Dawn shouted, running down the stairs to greet her blubbery parent. You on the other hand, were certainly getting your daily workout, carrying both your own luggage and Dawn's luggage as well, slowly descending the staircase as to avoid losing your overall balance, where you then answered, \"<b>*grunt*</b> Yeah. Ready as I'll ever be, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*giggle*</b> Don't worry, (Name)! Let me help you with that.\" The corpulent anthro Unicorn chirped, to which she then promptly surrounded the luggage you were hauling in a mystical mauve aura, only for you to then feel the luggage bags magically lift themselves from your person and towards the hefty Twilight Sparkle and Dawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, it gave your muscles a cathartic sense of relief from the overall weight of all those bags. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you quickly took your place at their side, to which Twilight soon spoke up and elaborated, \"...Now then, I've been working on this spell for a while, so let's see if all that studying has paid off.

Instead of seeing just two anthropomorphic Unicorns, somehow, Twilight and Dawn became full-on Unicorns straight out of the famed cartoon series. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, you looked over Dawn Sparkle, who looked like a full-on Pony version of her usual self, with only her Hello Kitty T-Shirt being what remained of her outfit, as you soon noted how much you towered over your half-breed daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew! That worked a lot better than I expected!\" Twilight chirped, beaming with pride upon her successful application of what you assumed to be a Teleportation Spell of sorts. Of course, your eyes soon wandered from your child and onto what had become of the anthropomorphic Twilight Sparkle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, well... To sum up your initial reaction, it would be akin to something straight out of a Tex Avery cartoon, jaw on the floor and such. Upon looking at Twilight's current physical form, there were several things worth noting. First, she was practically the spitting image of Twilight Sparkle, as if she walked right out of the television screen and into the real world. Second (and the most obvious), was her overall size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, if memory served you, she said that she just passed the 600 pound mark back when she was talking with Rarity on the phone. And boy did she look like a Pony who weighed that much. Her body looked and felt somewhat akin to a mauve-colored water balloon, with Twilight Sparkle's chubby head, multi-colored tail, and hooves jutting out from such a bloated bulbous object, as such a physique only made Twilight's plumper face all the more obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/Rp3QuhKUuCs7k4kx8\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.app.goo.gl/Rp3QuhKUuCs7k4...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honesty, you weren't even sure if Twilight could actually move on her own four hooves by herself, as you can see that the bottoms of her hooves could barely touch the ground that her burgeoning abdomen was so easily making contact with. Of course, in response, the only words you could mutter at the moment were, \"...Wow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Is something wrong, honey?\" She asked, looking back at you, as her head only reached just around your upper pelvis region, but her back-fat jutted out barely above her head, emphasizing that whole <i>\"Water Balloon\"</i> comparison you've made in your mind's eye. In response to her question, you cleared your throat some and retorted, \"Nothing. It's just, um...Can you still walk in your, uh...current state?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Huh? What do you mean? Of course I can still--\" Twilight replied, her body motioning to your front, only to soon feel how much her violet hooves could barely get any traction with the ground to gain locomotion. Her eyes darted down upon the bloated corpulent mass that was her own body (Or at least, about as much as she could physically see for the time being), just as an instinctive beet red blush appeared upon Twilight's plump fuller cheeks, obviously out of not expecting a situation such as this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, out of curiosity, she placed an experimental poke and prod with her left forehoof, taking note of how much adipose is condensed from her 600 pound anthropomorphic form, and how it has effected her Equine form, instinctively uttering to herself as she said aloud, \"Oh... Wow, I, um... Well...This I certainly did not expect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to be alright, Mommy?\" Dawn asked, her concern making itself known to the two of you, considering her mother's heavyset predicament at the moment. Of course, her maternal side showing itself once more, Twilight looked back at her now Equine daughter, to which she then calmly reassured, \"...I'll be fine, my little Starlight. I'm just...Nnnh! Going to have a little trouble waddling about. That's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Twilight began to attempt to resolve the situation she unwittingly found herself in, her Unicorn horn still glowing from levitating everyone's luggage. First, she attempted to slowly rock herself forward, so her forehooves can gain a decent foothold on the ground beneath her, but it didn't seem to work out as she envisioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she tried the same method, but in the opposite direction, using her hind-hooves to propel herself forward, which made her posture look just a tad bit silly, especially with her spreading her forehooves out like a set of wings to balance herself. Though, it seemed that her equally rotund behind was now much heftier due to lacking a pair of breasts, as the cellulite-filled rear end of hers smooshed against the back of her hind-legs from such deliberate articulation of her hind limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was such an unintentionally comical display that both you and Dawn Sparkle had to stifle your laughter so Twilight can still concentrate. Ultimately, after several minutes of struggling with her almost immobile physique, Twilight...</span></div></div>",

And surprisingly, even for her, it didn't actually involve the use of any magic whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, as you and Dawn were personally witnessing first-hand (Or...first-hoof, in this case), all the now elephantine Unicorn mare had to do was physically shift her weight from side to side whilst she planteed one hoof in front of the other, akin to a tune from a certain Christmas-themed Rankin Bass movie involving Saint Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, you and your now Equine daughter calmly followed closely behind the rotund Unicorn matriarch of the family, obviously out of some reasonable concern that Twilight might accidentally lose her gelatinous balance and comically roll and stumble onto her equally chubby back should she even trip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, as the three of you unintentionally garnered some attention from some of the residents of Ponyville, some outright recognizing Twilight Sparkle right off the bat, the rather heavyset Unicorn mare was easily keeping her balance, multitasking with both lumbering about her old stomping grounds, as well as maintaining total concentration on using her magic to levitate the luggage floating around the three of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, you couldn't help but be mildly confused as to why you were still human in a place ran by creatures of the Equestrian kind, scratching the back of your head some whilst you questioned, \"Strange... How come I'm still Human? Shouldn't have I been turned into a Pony as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right? How come Dad is still human while I've turned into a Pony as well, Mommy?\" Dawn asked, obviously agreeing with you on such a question. Strangely enough, Twilight didn't seem to be breaking into a heaping pile of sweat as you would've expected, considering how much she weighs right now. In response to such doubts, Twilight soon spoke up and calmly explained in an almost geek-like manner as she theorized, \"...Good question indeed. Though, I believe it has something to do with the latent magical energies that all Unicorns, Pegasi, and Earth Ponies have here in Equestria. After all, why else would you still be Human, sweetie pie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo... What you're saying is that since our little girl is half-Equestrian, she's attuned to this place like you are? Hence why she's now a Pony here?\" You retorted, as if you can easily understand what Twilight was saying behind all the eloquent science garble. That is, if one can call Magic a type of scientific subject. Of course, Twilight easily nodded in confirmation, despite her now even more obvious double chin made itself more noticeable from such an act, to which she then continued, \"...Exactly. It only makes sense as to why you still retain a Human physique whilst me and Dawn are now more Equine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh. That explains a lot.\" Dawn chirped, now gaining clarity as to what her mother was saying. However, whilst you kept a casual pace with your wife and daughter, your eyes curiously wandered around, taking in every nook and cranny of Ponyville, as if like walking into a reconstructed village of Hogwarts at Universal Studios Resort. Suffice to say, the average My Little Pony fan would be losing it if they were in your shoes right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you couldn't help but notice how a handful of mares passerby were almost as fat as Twilight. Some were only mildly plump, others were noticeably fat, while a few were downright obese. Though, if anything that occurred at Dawn's birthday party would be similar, you had a feeling that Pinkie Pie would certainly win the County Fair Prize as the Fattest Pony in Ponyville, that's for sure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, speaking of things in Ponyville, another question soon arose, to which you looked back at the comically rotund Unicorn mare and curiously asked, \"...So, out of curiosity, what's our first stop here in Ponyville, Twilight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, with a chubby dimpled smile appearing upon her plump equine face and snout, Twilight eyed back you with quite the cheeky grin for a Pony weighing 600 pounds, as she then replied, \"<b>*giggle*</b> Funny you should ask, sweetie! I was actually thinking of us visiting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I've been hankering to try one of those new <i>\"Belly-Buster\"</i> Cakes Pinkie Pie was making.\" Twilight answered, her mind's eye already imagining how delectable said cake was going to be, which caused her to subconsciously lick her own lips in eager gluttonous anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, despite your unfamiliarity with the My Little Ponies series as a whole, you couldn't help but find Twilight's behavior in regards to food to be rather adorably cute, letting out a bit of a chuckle in the process as you retorted, \"<b>*chuckle*</b> Sounds like a plan. Though, we should first get our bags dropped off first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed. Thankfully, Spike and the others have been tending to my old home while I've been living with you on Earth, sweetie.\" She complied, leaving the scrumptious thought of binging on cake upon the backburner for the moment, as she lumbered in the direction of her former home: The Treehouse Library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>== 25 Minutes Later... ==</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, it didn't take long to reach the Treehouse Library and offload the luggage, as the three of you made your way over to Sugarcube Corner, with Twilight waddling her way over there just a smidge faster than previously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hmm... I guess she really is that hungry for sweets, then.\"</i> You thought, your eyes gazing directly at the jiggling wobbling mass of blubber and mauve fur that is Twilight Sparkle, while you and Dawn easily kept up with the elephantine Unicorn mare with little effort. Of course, as the famed bakery itself soon came into clear view, another thought crossed your mind, only mentally thinking, <i>\"...Y'know? I got a feeling we're going to be seeing Pinkie Pie again real soon.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, such curious thoughts soon took a backseat for the time being, as you, Twilight, and Dawn quickly approached the main entrance to the Sugarcube Corner bakery, with Twilight leading the charge. Once the three of you arrived, Twilight casually waddled towards a rather distinct Earth Pony mare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, she had a very light cerulean fur coat, accentuated by a light crimson mane and tail, which was also adorned with pale, light greyish crimson stripes, all whilst they were formed into an ice cream-like swirl. Currently, the mare was busy sprucing up the front of the shop a little, humming a brief tune to herself in the process, only to stop when she heard the distinct sound of Twilight's voice as she said, \"Hi, Mrs. Cake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing your rotund wife's voice, Mrs. Cake quickly spun around towards the voice's point of origin, only to soon become quite surprised, brilliant rose eyes widening quite substantially to show her initial reaction, only for a smile to soon follow afterwards. And then, in an almost swift motion, she wrapped her hooves around Twilight's larger form whilst she ecstatically exclaimed, \"Sweet Celestia! Twilight Sparkle, is that you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*giggle*</b> The one and only!\" She replied, soon feeling Mrs. Cake's forehooves barely wrap themselves around her substantially fatter form, which certainly caught her by surprise. Then, she soon ended the friendly embrace to take a gander at the much heftier Unicorn, astonished at how big she's gotten as the mare chirped, \"My goodness! Look at you... You're practically as big as Pinkie Pie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*giggle*</b> Close, but no cupcake. After all, I'm only a hundred pounds lighter than Pinkie, Mrs. Cake.\" Twilight replied, blushing a little from such a compliment. Then again, she figured that Mrs. Cake was more accustomed to seeing her at a smaller size, so it was only fair for Mrs. Cake's reaction to be so blatant. However, both mares had a good chuckle out of it soon afterwards, to which the cerulean mare then quipped, \"It's good to see you again, Twilight! I assume your stay in Human society is doing well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure is! In fact, I thought I'd bring my family here for a two week stay here in Equestria. You know? Have them see the old neighborhood?\" Twilight answered, to which she then...</span></div></div>",

So you're the one that Pinkie has been blathering on about! <b><i>*giggle*</i></b> Well, it is good to see that Twilight has found love, even if you aren't from around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to know, I suppose.\" You retorted, to which Mrs. Cake then casually trotted over towards Dawn, gawking at how adorable the young mare was, only chirping, \"Aww! You look so adorable, dearie! You certainly have your mother's eyes and mane, that's for sure! <i><b>*giggle*</b></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...Y-You really think so?\" The youthful mare sheepishly asked, to which the older Pony confirmed with a nod before diverting her attention back to the corpulent Twilight Sparkle upon hearing the massive mare's stomach growling in protest. In turn, a profuse blush formed on the overly heavyset Unicorn's chubby cheeks, especially given how much impulse control her expanded organ now had over Twilight's choice in foodstuffs nowadays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Mrs. Cake brushed it off with a light chuckle, easily telling if somepony was hungry when she saw them, responding with a simple gesture to follow her inside Sugarcube Corner whilst saying, \"Let's get inside. I'm sure a certain somepony must be quite famished by now after a long trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you watched as both Dawn and Twilight promptly followed behind Mrs. Cake inside the establishment, you stayed just behind the obese Unicorn mare in case her britches just happened to now be too fat for the doorframe. Sure, it looked as if she was going to get herself wedged in the doorway, but luckily it wasn't the case, as Twilight calmly waddled her way inside the bakery, with her blubber-filled haunches simply brushing against the wooden doorframe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as you maneuvered your way inside by kneeling down some through the doorway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SURPRIIIISE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of varying voices bellowed, which undoubtedly caught the three of you by surprise, only to soon realize whom was speaking:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining Mane Six, Spike, Shining Armor, Cadence, Twilight's parents, and almost a dozen other residents of Equestria. Hell, even Discord was present!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to top it all off, there was a large banner hanging from the ceiling, which boldly said <i><b>\"WELCOME HOME, TWILIGHT SPARKLE!!\"</b></i> in big bloated letters, as if to welcome back a beloved resident of Ponyville.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, aside from garnering a glimpse of an utterly massive cake off to the side, Twilight couldn't help but feel overwhelmingly grateful for her friends welcoming her back home, as she lumbered over to hug each of them, with Pinkie being the most difficult to properly hug due to her over-encumbering girth compared to Twilight. </span></div></div>",

This woke you up; with a yawn, you rose to greet this brand new day, only to notice something was off about your bedroom... check that, SEVERAL things were off about your bedroom. The first thing you noticed was that your bed's mattress was big enough to hold 3 people or more. This was strange, as you remember going to sleep on a twin size mattress; a mattress only big enough for one person. The second thing that seemed out of place was the size of your bedroom; it was huge! \"Why is my bedroom so big? I live alone in an apartment,\" you thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking that off, you looked around at what decorated your bedroom. Posters of your favorite bands dotted the walls:  Metallica; DragonForce; Poison; Def Leppard; Anthrax; Slayer; Megadeth; Slipknot; Black Sabbath; M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce; Mot\u00f6rhead; and quite a few others. You were starting to get really confused. Before you could ponder anymore, you heard very heavy footsteps drawing closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, look who's up,\" a cheerful voice said. You looked over at the door... and your jaw dropped when you saw who was standing in the door frame; Rainbow Dash from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic was standing there, smiling at you. She looked very different than you remembered. For one thing, she was standing on her hind legs. Secondly; she was incredibly obese! Her belly was as big as a beach ball; her breasts were as big as bowling balls, as were her ass cheeks; her hips were at least 4 feet wide; her legs and arms were as thick as tree trunks; overall, she had to weigh at least 500 pounds or more! Also, she had hands! What was an obese, anthropomorphic Rainbow Dash doing in your bedroom, and dressed in nothing but an extremely tight looking bra and pair of panties, no less?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What seems to be wrong, honey?\" She said with a notable worry in her voice. She walked over to you, her massive hips swaying side to side, her giant belly jiggling with every step - wait, \"honey\"? What did she mean by that? She wrapped her arms around you, pulling you into a big hug. She squeezed you against her massive body, nuzzling your cheek against hers. \"Come on, honey. It's your birthday today. And what kind of wife would I be if I didn't make you a great breakfast? Come on, let's go!\" She smiles and carries you away. This was getting weirder and weirder by the minute. What do you do next?</span></div></div>",

She could only remember up until her wedding photos that she had any semblance to he late slimness and regality, back when she, her wife, and husband could all fit together in frame, the newlywed mares smiling in the arms of the tall, lean man of their dreams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor dear, she surmised as she gazed down right in front of her, observing him as he peacefully slept right next to her, so much more content with the world than she was. Lean he still may have been, but only in her distant memories were the times where she didn't absolutely tower over him, currently looming past his height by an extra two feet, rapidly going on a third, and paired with a tremendous waistline but a single roll in her sleep from smothering three of him side by side, looking at him was similar to staring at a toothpick. One she didn't love any less, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but not even her love for him could compromise her from the fact that Vinyl was likely awake as well, and likely harping at the nearest burger joint for food if she hadn't cleared out the entire kitchen. Surmising over that thought with a grunt, Octavia rolled to move out of bed, a workout even when gravity was there to help her out. She was out of breath by the time she was seated at the edge of the mattress, the bed flexing dangerously close to the floor beneath the concentrated weight of her gargantuan asscheeks. Everything ached; if carrying her younger self's bust was a literal pain in the neck, than carrying a set of massive, bulbous jugs each larger than her plumpened head was only equitable to carrying two lead-filled backpacks on her shoulders. Topping it all off was trying to rise off the bed with her belly weighing her down, a yoga-ball like mass of fur and adipose that bulged off her torso with so much weight that it was a miracle she wasn't constantly smashing her face in from falling over, its globular shape occasionally shifted by a kick from her breed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and yet through it all, much like yesterday, the day before, and all those of the week before, the muscles hidden within her mammoth-sized thighs became just a little bit stronger, more accustomed to existing within such a massive host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to let another moment last between her and breakfast, Octavia gave one last look backwards and smiled upon the second to the loves of her lives, then trundled to the door, striding with as much class and revere as a waddling penguin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...wha...what the <b><i>FUCK?!</i></b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour tired voice makes a leap in volume as your eyes open to the colors of your surrounding, all shades of purple, black, and brown that you can't even remotely recall living around. Instantly awake, the details of the bedroom you're in all fall on your shoulders at once, going several seconds without air before remembering to breath, your lungs heaving in large, rugged movements. You'd never pegged yourself as the kind of guy to wake up in a stranger's bed, not even a women's, given the more girly decorations on the shelves and cabinets, but it's not even the alien nature of the room that disturbs you; it's the colors, all brilliant pastel shades and hues that merge with one another in ways that reality wouldn't allow, except only in the cartoons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, in your eyes' walk around the room, you gaze down at the heavy blanket laid on top of you, and, more importantly, what you're wearing. You couldn't even remember the last time you wore pajamas, and sure enough, you're dressed up in a plaid pair. In fact, upon tugging at the clothes to see if they're real, and not some hallucination, you're disturbed to see that even your body's changed; you weren't exactly the skinniest person, maybe not quite enough to be called \"chubby,\" but whatever pudge you may have possessed is completely gone, your stomach flattened out while a bony set of ribs protrude from your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing it all, and staring ahead, eyes defocusing and gazing out into some other plane of existence, you finally get the idea to shut your eyes and will it all away, to wake up so the softness underneath you is that of your bed, your <i>real </i>one back at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, upon flinging them open, you're greeted with as much of the same. Same for the second try. And the third. And the fourth.</span></div></div>",

All the while, your blinking is promoted into repeatedly clenching your eyes shut, seizing onto some vague, dwindling hope that when you\u2019d open them, she\u2019d disappear, and the world would come <i>slightly</i> closer to being as sane as you thought it was but a night ago, but no matter how hard you try to wish her away, the floorboards still creak beneath her immense weight, her muttered cursing still ringing in your ears as she briefly grapples with the door\u2019s width to squeeze her own through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking it as enough of a distraction to see your way out, despite having already being seen by her, you quietly tiptoe out the bedroom, eager to find a nice, quiet place somewhere to center your thoughts and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>WHAM!!!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m ho-ome!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but the cheeriness in the other voice fails to quell the belief that a wrecking ball\u2019d just been swung into the house. An embarrassingly high shriek escapes you, your feet unwillingly leaping a foot or two from the floor from the impact of <i>something</i> forcing its way into the living room, something, as far as you can define from the falling dust, white and massive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore lumbering footsteps enter the apartment, shaking all the furniture with shockwaves that multiply that of which \u2018Octavia\u2019 could produce; in walks a behemoth with the vaguest semblance to \u2018Vinyl,\u2019 featuring the same coat, mane, and equine-esque maw and ears to the pony in the photo, but while Octavia towered head and chest above her former self, Vinyl stand with a foot or so on top of <i>her</i>, and with no less than <i>five times</i> the other mare\u2019s weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrushing off the wreckage she\u2019d caused, her ham-leg arms cradling large purchases of junk food, fast food bags, and boxes of soda, Vinyl trundles along the room with a dizzied stride from the excess of blubber caked onto her joints, just short of some demeaning tuba music to compete the stereotype. The immense range of her hips makes it impossible for her to navigate the room without knocking things off their shelves or capsizing furniture as her steps cause her gargantuan buttocks to sway and slosh around with impressive reach, any gap shorter than ten feet impossible for her to move past without her ass compromising for space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost forget to be scared, easily entranced by the sight of all her blubber sloshing around; despite her height, at least Octavia was obese to a degree that you could see the world\u2019s fattest woman carry her dimensions, but this mare\u2019s stomach proceeds her entire body like a white boulder that towers over you, possessing enough plushness that it sags low enough to smother a sizeable length of the ground ahead of her, but is also fastened by a musculature underneath that forms its blubber into a tense sphere, likely owed to the other \u2018foals\u2019 Octavia had mentioned before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight is so entrancing that you don\u2019t even notice the closing distance between the two of you. Neither does she, her eyes un readable beneath the purple visors of her shades, but just when it seems like she\u2019s about to trudge past without acknowledging you, her arm hooks out and wraps around your torso, pulling you up against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, hon~\u201d She says sweetly, squeezing your body within her armpit whilst your head is caught against the underside of her very, very large breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey...Vinny...\u201d You nervously murmur. <i>Wait...Vinny?!</i> You internally realize. <i>Why did I call her Vinny?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl scoffs back. \u201cHate it when you call me that...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhem!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Vinyl\u2019s ear angles towards the bedroom, and waiting inside is Octavia, scantily clad in a pink night robe that, despite its mammoth proportions, is several sizes to small to clothe her behemothic frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe taps a hoof on the floor, scowling. \u201cJust because you\u2019re the bigger doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m any less hungry, you know!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I was the one with morning sickness when I woke up, I get first dibs.\u201d Vinyl reasons, her grip loosening enough that you can safely drop down on both legs. \u201cBesides, I saved you a couple of doughnuts!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoughnuts?!\u201d Octavia repeats. \u201cI can\u2019t eat doughnuts! I\u2019m already a whale off of eating salads!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh...that\u2019s...actually gonna work out, then.\u201d Vinyl uneasily continues, scratching at a sweaty neck. \u201c...I\u2019d actually got kicked out of the Burger hut, so we might not wanna go there anymore...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT?!\u201d Octavia bellows. \u201cYou\u2019d gotten us kicked out of someplace AGAIN?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl argues something back, Octavia retorting with something that spirals into a squabble beneath the two, but you don\u2019t really have the mind to really make out all the words going back and forth between them. The fact returns that you\u2019re in some alien world right now, trapped in a stranger\u2019s home, and you have the idea to treat their little argument as a distraction. You guide a foot backwards, sneaking for the door that Vinyl\u2019d entered through. Neither of them keep you from leaving as you plot to escape, make a run for it and get some damn answers as to what\u2019s going on...but just when you\u2019re about to grasp the doorknob and leap to freedom, a few patches of color off to the side catches your eye, prompting you to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s ink drawn around the wall, marked by dashes that progressively higher, akin to the kind a child would make on their doorframe to measure their height. Part of it is drawn in pink, and looking to the highest one, you can see Octavia\u2019s name, drawn in more professional handwriting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\"><div align=\"center\">Octavia<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8\u20199\u201d, 4,167 lb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonth 7</div></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and somewhere far above, you can see something scrawled in blue ink.

For those who don't know jack on what I'm talking about, Balto is an animated movie, made by Amblin Entertainment and Universal Pictures in 1995. The film is loosely based around a true story about the dog Balto (hence the movie's title) who helped save children from the infamous diphtheria epidemic in the 1925 serum rub to Nome, in which the antitoxin to the epidemic was transported from Anchorage, Alaska, to Nenana, Alaska by train, and finally to Nome via dog sled......minus the talking animals, of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, this interactive story choice isn't going to involve the titular character himself. Instead, this choice is all about Jenna and Aleu (or at least, the anthropomorphic versions of these two ladies). As for who they are, Jenna is basically Balto's \"mate\" in the movie, while Aleu is simply Balto's biological daughter who first appeared in the direct-to-video film, Balto II: Wolf Quest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow then, since we now know who we're dealing with here, who shall you choose?

However, upon further inspection, you soon realized that this wasn't just any ordinary lioness, but instead, it was none other than Nala from Walt Disney's The Lion King! Out of all the movies that Disney has produced throughout the decades, The Lion King was without a doubt your favorite, your favorite character in the movie (besides Timon and Pumbaa) was undoubtedly Simba's lover, Nala. Back when you were just a boy, you developed a somewhat huge crush on the female lioness, always wishing that Nala was actually real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, here she was, sleeping right next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, upon further inspection of the slumbering lioness, you began to notice something...strange about the slumbering Nala beside you. The first thing you obviously noticed on Nala was that instead of 4 paw-like digits that regular lions have, she currently had 3 paw-like fingers and a plump paw-like thumb, similar to a human hand. And it wasn't just on the forepaw she used to grab your left arm either, for it was also the same on her left forepaw as well! From there, just out of mere curiosity, you cautiously lift up the bedsheets on Nala's side of the bed with your free hand, which revealed to you what you had suspected: Instead of being a quadruped like in the movie, Nala was now an anthropomorphic lioness, along with a pair of cream fur digitgrade feline legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was there that you also noticed another certain detail: Nala was ludicrously fat. Her creamy feline face and snout had a thin layer of adipose on it, complete with a pair of slightly chubby cheeks, a thick double chin, and a plump neck. However, what stuck out the most on Nala's head was that some of the hair on the top of her head had grown out into a flowing mane, which looked extremely similar to Cressida's hairstyle from the movie, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as your eyes scrolled across her body, you noticed how rotund and corpulent yet voluptuous and curvaceous Nala's physique actually was. It was also there you noticed that Nala now sported a large billowing pair of F-Cup breasts, which were somewhat contained in a silk white bra, which happened to be covered up by a very large blue T-Shirt which had the words, \"I'm (Your Name)'s Feline Fatty!\" written on the front in big bloated letters. However, even with a T-Shirt at such a humongous size, it did little to conceal one of Nala's more \"prosperous\" assets: Her massive spare tire of an apron belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasily the size of a large couch cushion, Nala's blubbery girth was definitely and surely a sight to behold, as it splayed out and covered up a good sizable portion of Nala's lap and private area with relative ease. Looking further down, you easily noticed how large and thickly padded Nala's hips and butt were, which displayed a large stretchy pair of panties, as her hips noticeably billowed outwards to be nearly 4 and a half feet in diameter, while her blubbery derri\u00e8re was noticeably visible to you, as each buttcheek was about as wide as a regular pillow, while her lioness tail slowly swished from side to side subconsciously. Upon looking down at her digitgrade legs, you noticed how they were as thick as the rest of her, especially around her burgeoning and bulky cream fur thunder thighs and plump paw-like toes on her hindpaws. Finally, you looked back up toward Nala's arms, easily noticing how bulky and smothered with a fine layer of adipose they were. However, judging from how strong and tight her grip was on your left arm, you could tell that there was most likely a good amount of muscle hidden underneath all that blubber. Overall, if you had to wager a guess on her exact weight, you would had to guess that Nala had to at least weigh over 500 pounds, maybe 600 pounds given how much muscle she's got underneath all that body fat on her larger than plus-sized physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after taking it all in, you still couldn't believe that Nala was now legitimately and physically real, albeit an anthropomorphic version of her, but still her nonetheless. And yet, you couldn't help but ponder to yourself over a few questions, such as \"How is this even possible?\", \"Why is Nala now an anthro?\", and \"How come she's so fat?\" You know, THOSE kinds of questions. However, the more you looked at the rotund Nala, the more you couldn't help but find it very attractive on her.</span></div></div>",

At first, you were caught completely off-guard from such flirtatious and romantic advances upon you. However, shortly after receiving such romantic affections, you willingly decided to throw caution to the wind, as you soon began to kiss her back in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as her long feline tongue began to intermingle and intertwine with your own, Nala slowly yet calmly released her vice-like grip on your wrists, lustfully moving her thick meaty furry arms to comfortably wrap around your back, where she began to playfully smother you with her blubbery cream fur-covered spare tire of a belly and her billowing breasts, which caused her to emit these loud but pleasured purring noises, where you easily acknowledged that she was certainly enjoying such personal intimacy with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments after such affectionate intimacy between you and the corpulent anthropomorphic lioness, Nala calmly sat up on her knees, still straddling you with her bulky adipose-coated thighs and legs, allowing you to sit up as well, just as she held your hands with both of her plump paw-like feline hands. She looked at you with a sense of loving affection in her beautiful teal eyes and said, \"Merry Christmas, sweetie.\" \"Merry Christmas to you too, Nala.\" You replied, doing your best to blend in. After all, you were still confused as to how this was even possible in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, you couldn't help but feeling like this was a dream come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, Nala spoke to you once more and said, \"...I got a surprise for you.\" \"Oh? And what would said \"surprise\" be exactly, my not-so-little lioness?\" You asked, making a witty yet flirtatious remark toward the blubbery lioness, which made Nala blush a little in response. \"...I have been waiting for the right time to show you, (Name).\" Nala answered, where she then proceeded to gently yet calmly guide your hands toward both sides of her burgeoning blubbery abdomen. From there, unexpectedly, you began to feel these sudden bursts of what felt like something was kicking inside of her. Eventually but inevitably, the gears in your mind stirred, which soon led you to such a shocking revelation:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala...was undoubtedly pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you soon looked back up towards Nala, who was now bearing a gentle yet fanged motherly smile on her somewhat plump feline snout, where she then calmly spoke toward you with a sense of maternal joy in her voice and said, \"The doctor said that we're going to be having twins.\" In response to such news, you were undoubtedly taken completely by surprise. After all, you had just found out that Nala was legitimately pregnant with twins, and you were most likely the father of said twins. However, you mostly hid your shocked reaction, especially since this wasn't exactly the time to be freaking out in a very negative manner. And yet, as your mind slowly but surely coped with the realization and reality that you were now officially going to be a father, one singular question inadvertently popped into your subconscious:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas her daughter, Kiara, from The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride, already born into this world by now? Or was she not even born yet?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>However, just as you were about to find the strength to ask the corpulent anthropomorphic lioness sitting in front of you such a question, both you and Nala suddenly heard the double doors to your bedroom slowly but surely open, which was strange, since you clearly don't remember your house having a set of double doors to your room. Then again, that wasn't what was important at this moment, for it was what, or to be more specific, who, was standing in the middle of the opened doorway that garnered both your attention and Nala's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one who stood there in the open doorway was none other than Nala and Simba's biological daughter, Kiara. However, instead of being on all fours like she was in The Lion King 2, this version of Kiara was clearly standing upright on 2 legs and had an anthropomorphic physique just like her mother. Although, judging from her height and body mass, this was clearly Kiara as a Cub, as she stood approximately 3 feet in height, the actual height of an 8 years old human girl. From there, you noticed that the anthropomorphic Kiara was clearly wearing a pair of pink pajama pants and a white T-Shirt, as she yawned a little, rubbing the sleep from her eyes with her left arm and paw-like hand whilst she firmly held a large lion plushie in her furry right arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, you noticed that said plushie looked eerily similar to Simba, complete with a bright red mane. From there, in response to seeing her young cub, Nala then casually dismounted herself from the bed, where she then proceeded to approach Kiara, just as you noticed that Nala had a slight waddle and a seductive sway in her movement as she walked toward Kiara, knelt down, and then easily picked her up with her large arms. Then, she began to firmly hug Kiara, then spoke toward the young lioness cub with a motherly tone in her voice and said, \"Good morning, my little lioness.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*loud yawn* ...Good morning to you too, Mommy. And Merry Christmas.\" Kiara replied, where she then hugged her rotund mother, wrapping her arms around Nala's somewhat thick neck but not completely encased due to Nala's extra bulk. A moment or two later, Nala then spoke toward the still somewhat drowsy Kiara and said, \"I see you've stayed up last night so you could see Santa Claus, didn't you?\" Of course, Kiara groggily nodded her head in confirmation, where Nala then spoke toward her daughter once more and asked, \"Do you want to sleep in a little longer before we open presents, dearie?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously due to being a child, that somehow jolted Kiara wide awake when her mother said those words, causing the young anthro lioness to quickly answer, \"Nonono, I'm awake! I want to open presents!\" \"*giggle* That's what I thought, sweetie. Now, go say hi to your father, Kiara.\" Nala replied, as she gently let Kiara back down onto the floor. From there, Kiara approached you, where she then got up onto the bed and proceeded to embrace you in a loving hug. Of course, you hugged Kiara back as she said, \"Merry Christmas, Daddy.\" \"Merry Christmas to you too, my little lioness.\" You replied, just as she then severed the embrace and dismounted from the bed and headed out of the bedroom. \"We'll be with you in a minute, Kiara!\" Nala said, just as Kiara darted out of the room and towards most likely the Christmas tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Nala approached you and sat alongside you on the bed, noticing your odd behavior and asked, \"(Name) sweetie, are you feeling alright? You seem a little...off, today.\" \"Yeah, I, um... I'm fine, Nala. Just had a weird dream last night. Nothing more. You go on and be with Kiara, I'll catch up with you in a minute.\" You swiftly answered, trying to come up with a convincing excuse to hide your confusion about all of this. Fortunately for you, Nala seemed to have most likely bought that excuse, where she then leaned closer to you and planted a loving kiss upon your lips then flirtatiously said, \"...Alright, sweetie. But don't take too long.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, she stood up from the bed and walked toward the door with a seductive sway in her billowing fatty hips. However, before she stepped out of the doorway, Nala quickly turned to face you and seductively said, \"Don't take too long in there, sweetie. After all, I know how much you love this big body of mine.\" From there, she gave her large spare tire of a belly a few light pats, causing it to jiggle some in response, which seemed to turn you on a little, as your cheeks began to blush some in the process. Shortly after that, Nala stepped out of the bedroom and headed towards where Kiara was sitting by the presents around the Christmas tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were now alone in the bedroom, you soon got out of bed and headed towards the nearby adjacent bathroom. After all, you needed to find out what else has changed in this world. However, once you looked at your reflection in the mirror, you noticed that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once you finally gazed yourself in the mirror's reflection, you could clearly see that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...You were still one hundred percent human!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, you let out a deep sigh of relief, with a subconscious grin appearing on your lips, briefly chuckling to yourself in some semblance of self-relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"*sigh* ...Well, at least I'm still a bona fide human being.\"</i> You thought to yourself, easily seeing that you still retained the physique of an athletic young man. However, despite your relief, your mind soon refocused on your current surroundings. Initially, you thought it looked like a regular yet fancy-looking bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course, upon further inspection, you soon easily took heed of the bathroom's overall size. Off to one corner, there was a large industrial-sized shower stall, complete with plexiglass sliding doors, which had these innate African markings carved throughout the plexiglass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"*hmph* Seems fitting, considering where Nala came from.\"</i> You thought, seemingly okay with these changes, as you noticed how the entire room had this air of the Africa Savannah to the decor. But then, before you could contemplate further, you soon heard what sounded like Kiara as she exclaimed, \"Daddy! Are you coming out to open presents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, you loudly chirped, \"I'm just about done, sweetie! Gimme a sec!\" <i>\"...Okay, that was...weird. Why does this feel so normal for me?\"</i> You soon thought, as you began to exit the spacious bathroom, make your way through the bedroom, and finally passed through the large double doors leading out to the main area of what you assumed to be your apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, at least what you thought WAS your apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of a low price one-bedroom apartment, you walked into a penthouse condo fit for a freaking celebrity! Before you was a massive open area, with a Living Room on the right, an expansive Kitchen and Dining Room area to the left, complete with a massive industrial refrigerator, (most likely for Nala, considering her current size and weight). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to the furthest left corner, there stood some exercise equipment, complete with a huge bench press kit, dumbbells, and several other pieces of equipment. And before you stood a plexiglass window wall that was two stories tall, showing a snow-covered balcony and the city landscape of what could only surmise to be none other than New York City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, it was rather overwhelming, considering what world you've awoken to. However, your thoughts were focused elsewhere when you heard Nala's honeysweet voice speak toward you and said, \"Ah, there you are, darling! Kiara was wondering where you were. *giggle*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly turned toward the source of the voice, only to see the corpulent yet pregnant and anthropomorphic Nala sitting Indian style alongside an eager Kiara waiting to open her Christmas presents, as they sat beside the nine foot tall Christmas tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn order to avoid suspicion, you soon joined Kiara and Nala, where you noticed that Nala was now wearing a massive red yukata robe for modesty, since her daughter was present. \"...So, what did I miss, ladies?\" You quipped, as you sat next to the rotund Lioness who was essentially your childhood crush come to life, as Nala's chubby snout mildly contorted into a cheery fanged grin towards you, where she then chirped, \"*giggle* Not much, sweetie. Kiara was waiting until you came out before opening her presents.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, as if your body was on autopilot, you plucked out a wrapped present from the pile and presented it to Kiara, with a cheery curve on your lips, where Kiara eagerly yanked it out of your light grasp, tearing into the wrapping paper with her feline claws without damaging the gift underneath. Once the wrapping paper was strewn about, Kiara now held...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You open your eyes expecting to see the familiar confines of your cozy if not a little unkempt bedroom, alone, like you had been doing for quite some time now. However, this morning, all around you is black. Not like that the room was covered in shadows, or even like you had forgotten to open your eyelids when your body tricked you into thinking you did. This was not even a sort of darkness, this was empty. The shade of black overwhelming your line of sight was nothing that could be found in nature, more akin to the space between stars that you can see in the sky at night. Why are you here? Are you here at all? Or is that just the treachery of the void?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you finally detect another something in the black, a voice, with a deep, throaty rasp, characteristic of a chain smoker. It begins to talk in deep, grimy and guttural noises. \u201cThere is nothing, only warm and primordial blackness. Your conscience ferments in it, no larger than a single grain of malt. You don\u2019t have to do anything anymore.\u201d It pauses for its words to sink in. \u201cEver. Never.\u201d It continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever...ever?\u201d You respond inquisitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever, baby!\u201d It had been brought to your attention that you might just be dead. This is when you die, and you cease to exist. No afterlife. No feeling, no thought, no perception, no existence. Your existence and everything you simply disappeared like a popped soap bubble. You know nothing, you feel nothing, you \u2018are\u2019 nothing. You simply keep on not existing. \u201cAn inordinate amount of time passes, and it is utterly void of struggle. No ex-wives are contained within.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is great!\u201d You say though you don\u2019t know why you said it. Perhaps this voice was a higher authority that could let you back into the realm of reality if you got on its good terms. Or maybe you thought this was great. You didn't know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. It. Is.\u201d The voice says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha...what was that about an \u2018ex-\u2019 something?\u201d You raise another question. An awareness creeps up on you. A mass lies hidden in your dead angle, soaking in some lurid, acidic sauce. It\u2019s bloated and shameful, a ball of meat surrounding you. This is a terrible line of questioning and it will only lead to more awareness of the meat thing. You know somewhere in the back of your mind (you still have that?) that this thing you were dreading was you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you plunge back into the fathomless deep? No, you wanted to know about the ex-something. Again, the voice. \u201cEx-love, ex-tenderness, it is foolish of you to resurface to the loss. Not after all the damage you suffered to get here, some of it irreversible...stay! Sail with me through the abyss!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I want to get off, now.\u201d You decide. \u201cI like pain and burning light and wanting things from people who don't want to give them to me.\u201d Once again you had no idea why you said those words in that order but grimly resigned this was the meat thing you were trying to come back to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you?\u201d You had no idea. One half of your non-existence wanted to sail the inky blackness until forever ends, whilst the other half, the half that you don\u2019t think you like, wanted to get off. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t like it if I told you what was back they're. Why do you think you had to bludgeon yourself into oblivion?\u201d The voice sounds apprehensive and afraid now, you should ask what's out they're...wait, did you do this to yourself? You feel so infinitely small, but that's a step up from feeling like your nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere in the sore, bloated man-meat around you...a sensation! Like a fly to ointment, your conscience sticks to it. The limbed headed machine of pain and undignified suffering is firing up again. It wants to walk the desert. Are you ready for this? Yes, you are, and this is a thought you feel confident about. You don\u2019t want to go back to the formless, disembodied nothing. The stench of liquor rises from your mouth, and with it an ungodly headache. Who are you? What sort of creature does this to their mouth?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fiery streak penetrates your skull, trying to force your eyes open. It\u2019s a sound...a clarion from Hell. Somehow, you know what it is...the stomach of a hippopotamus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes expecting to see the familiar confines of your cozy if not a little unkempt bedroom, alone, like you had been doing for quite some time now. However, this morning, you had absolutely no idea who you were. You were naked and lying face down on the tiled floor of a room that could have been yours but didn't seem familiar. There was an empty bottle of vodka near the base of your head, you must have gotten drunk, you reasoned. The memories will come back soon, right? You stand up and notice a turned on reel-to-reel tape player on the dresser (your dresser?), rolling empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mirror hangs above the dresser. Your vision is foggy from liquor and sleep, you can only see the outline of a man in the glass. You suddenly realize you have no memory of the fate that awaits you, underneath the haze of your own eyes. Nothing? Really. All recollection of the person you were, the people in your life and even the world you\u2019re in has drowned in a sea of blood and alcohol. This was no mere night of drinking, this was a deluge of world-ending proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps you should touch your face first, make sure there's nothing wrong with it. You slowly reach your hand to the skin of your left cheek. There's something wrong with it. It\u2019s bloated and swollen, like an upholstery of alcohol just underneath your fingertips. Your nose feels like a small balloon in the middle of your face, and it hurts when you honk it. Is your tongue okay? It\u2019s not, it\u2019s like a snail wriggling through your fingers. You blink the haze away. Behold!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea what this thing in the mirror is. Why aren't your memories coming back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does come back is your sense of hearing. Somewhere inside your messed up brain something decides to unplug your ears and they were at once filled with the booming, thunderous noise of a stomach gurgling to life. You turn your head away from your reflection to follow the sound. You do a double-take on the origin of the cacophony as you steady your hand on the tape player for balance. What you saw on the bed...it had to be the most ridiculous thing you could never imagine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was from Gloria. Gloria the hippo, from the Madagascar movies. Out of all the things you could have remembered about yourself, like your name or how old you were, it was Gloria that took up your mind. A fictional anthropomorphic animal from the big screen, now no longer fictional on presumably your bed. And she was big. She was laying on her front, giving you a perfect view of a shelf with two massive, pinkish grey hippo ass cheeks, each wider than you were tall and swaying with every subtle motion of those hips wide enough to make a double doorway look small. All capped with a subtle, relatively tiny hippo tail right above that grand canyon of a crack. She was nude, which was appropriate, as there was no hope any article of clothing could ever fit her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo looked as big in the front as she did from the back, a pair of massive melon tits as wobbly as balloons, her belly aline round enough to outweigh you fourfold. She was tall, tall enough to obscure the bed she was sleeping on with all that flesh, the wooden frame barely able to keep up with all the pressure she forced upon it. Before you knew what you were doing you were walking up to this Goddess of Fertility and placed your hand on her exposed thigh and thick as a tree-trunk. It was soft. It was so freaking soft, your digits sunk into the warm, creamy flesh and it quivered like an ocean in a gentle wind. \u201cAh\u2026\u201d you let out a sigh. It\u2019s the first time you hear your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmph...~\" You hear a pleasured huff of greeting emanate from the hippo's head, a grin forming across her perfect, chubby cheeks. \"G' morning, hubby...\" She slurred tiredly, letting out a yawn as she woke up from her deep sleep. It felt so surreal to have her talking in front of you, to exist next to you, to feel her form bob up and down with every physical breath of air she took against your hand on her thigh. This should not be happening. Not because you don't want it, but because it's just not possible. Gloria does not exist. But here she is. Calling you her hubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHubby?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lardy idol of your fantasies chuckles as she blinks her eyes open, taking in your disheveled, admittedly funny looking form. You felt like you could fall into those eyes. What do you see in them, though?</span></div></div>",

No amount of wiggling your face and batting at your nose with a sleepily aimed hand will dispel the irritation. Soon enough, the tickling prompts a seemingly inevitable outcome; you sneezed, not very loudly, but certainly enough to cast you out of the last vestiges of sleep. You are sitting up in your bed, your mind still somewhat foggy from the last fragments of sleep slipping away, casting your bleary eyes around for the source of your nasal irritation. Finally your gaze settles on the likely culprit: the bundle of hair gracing the end of a tail that had gotten up into your face. The tail isn\u2019t yours though; it belongs to the person who also owns the multiple square feet of curvy body taking up a majority of the room in your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been spooned up against the rear of the obviously female figure, your face nestled in the pillow formed between her neck and shoulder, and your hips pressed into the soft gelatinous cheeks of her rump. Her tail seemed to have flicked up and ended up in your face, causing the events that led to you now being awake. Long auburn curls tumble across her upper body, nearly hiding the short blunted horns protruding from the top of her head, as well as the long floppy ears hanging behind her head. Beneath the sheet and covers, mountainous breasts protrude from her torso, pooling across the bed and over the edge, while her stomach is weightier but doesn\u2019t extend quite as far. Pulling the covers up a bit further to get a better view, you see that scrumptious rump is attached to wide fertile hips and cascade down into her long lovely and shapely legs. Her whole body is covered in a tiny almost invisible layer of incredibly soft fur; mostly a light brown but with much darker patches at the ends of her ears, and forming the appearance of gloves and socks on her hands and feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze trails back up across her body, your hand slipping across the silky hills and valleys of her body. A shift in the bed and a creaking noise causes you to look up faster and you find yourself looking into piercing green eyes staring back at you, sleep slowly fading away from their owner, the lovely and fattened Mora Lindas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, baby?\u201d she asks drowsily, blinking those luminous orbs several times to try and focus in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed gives another \u2013 slightly alarming \u2013 creak as she turns over, her blubbery bulk now flowing up to and partway over you as she reaches up to cup your face, before pulling you closer to give you a deep loving kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, please, tell me what\u2019s wrong,\u201d she asks a bit more imploringly after the kiss breaks, her eyes flitting this way and that as she looks you over.</span></div></div>",

Sorry about that, baby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer concerns diminished, you can see that she is already ready to return to sleep; her eyelids are drooping, and her supporting arm is starting to slip, bringing her lower and lower, closer to the bed. A yawn escapes her mouth as she drops down and her head lands on her pillow, her plush arm pushed out across your own pillow, and a soft snore coming forth as she drifts off to sleep again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStifling a yawn of your own, you adjust the covers and nuzzle your head down against her arm, pressing your face into the upper curve of her bountiful, pillowy breasts. You place one hand up against her cheek, lightly stroking it, feeling the give of the fat softening her formerly thin face, while the other reaches down and lovingly rubs across a small portion of the expanse of her belly. A contented smile is brought to your lips as your touch is rewarded with a small flurry of kicks and other motions: the lively actions of the children resting within Mora\u2019s fertile womb. Their movements soon die down, as does yours, as sleep pulls you back down into its embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you drift off, your eyes trace the soft curves of Mora\u2019s face in front of you, as well the back of your hand, covered in\u2026</span></div></div>",

You spied a beautiful woman across the room, nursing a drink and exchanging a few words with passersby, but little else. You tried not to stare, but you kept finding your eyes drawn back to her, her Rubenesque figure filling a slinky backless black dress. Making your way over to her, you introduced yourself, her to you, and made some small talk before inviting her to dance. She looked a little unsure of herself, her green eyes diming and downcast, but finally acquiesced. It took some time before she got into the swing of it, but before long the two of you became the center of attention, your combined movements becoming more steady and grandiose. As another song ended, Mora was left panting slightly, her bust quivering slightly visibly through the low-cut front, as the crowd around you broke into respectful applause. Sensing that Mora wasn\u2019t quite up to another dance, you led her off the dance floor and to a nearby table, pulling her chair out before bringing her another drink. With drink in hand, you and she talked some more. You found out about her work as an actress, though she hadn\u2019t been getting much or any work recently. In turn, you explained about your work, before the conversation continued to spin on. You noticed how she kept wistfully glancing at any food nearby. Offering to get something for her to eat prompted a thoughtful moment from the woman, a hand stealthily drifting down to her plump stomach, before she gave a forceful shake of her head accompanied with a similar declaration of no. You abandoned the attempt but filed it away for future reference. At the end of the night the two of you went your separate ways, but not before trading phone numbers and a wish for another meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wish was granted again and again before long, the dates starting out casual but quickly becoming more serious and romantic in nature. Each time you saw the lovely Mora, you noticed that she looked like she had put on a bit of weight, a few pounds here and there, but enough that you could perceive, especially as her clothes pulled a bit tighter around her body. You also noted how any time that she was offered food she would initially consider getting a larger item or amount before reconsidering and settling on something smaller unless you urged her to enjoy herself, to which she would only sometimes give in. With each instance, you were drawing conclusions, till you finally brought it up while on a date in a dark, quiet, and romantic restaurant, questioning her about it as softly as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her a long time to answer, a slightly pained expression on her face, as she told that she had always struggled with her appetite. She had been quite a heavy child, but had lost the weight during her teen years, though the she kept the enthusiasm for food that caused her weight during her earlier years. She had successfully fought against her stomach\u2019s urges until a couple of years before, when a combination of some bad relationships and work drying up had resulted in her overindulging and gaining more than a few pounds. It also seemed that her new weight proved quite resistant to any efforts to remove it, or she would yo-yo and end up even heavier than before. Your frequent gifts of candy \u2013 especially chocolates \u2013 as well as you persuading her to eat more when it succeeded had resulted in the most recent and heavier gains, and was proving even harder to lose. She then explained that she had really been enjoying all of the time that she was spending with you, and hoped that you hadn\u2019t lost too much attraction to her; she would try even harder to lose the weight if you would just give her the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a rather loud laugh \u2013 too loud in retrospect as you drew some irritated glances from other patrons \u2013 but had to quickly grab a hold of her hand to keep her from running off and explained that you weren\u2019t laughing at the idea of you finding her less attractive, completely the opposite in fact. The skepticism was plainly visible on her face as you continued and stated that her increasing weight was actually making her more attractive to you, in combination with her keen mind and loving spirit. You were able to mostly convince her that her disbelief was unfounded when you swept her back to your home and made passionate love to her all night long, each time pushing further and further, and causing her to succumb to earthshaking orgasms one after another. After a few hours of resting, you slipped away and gave her another cause to believe you when you gave her a huge homemade breakfast and proceeded to feed her every morsel till she was reduced to moaning and groaning with how overstuffed her stomach was, and yet the look in her eyes begged for the next bite to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that night, she started to give into the hunger she held within, at first hesitantly but eventually with growing zeal as she saw that you didn\u2019t leave her or express any disinterest. Liberated from her inhibitions and indulging as she had secretly dreamed, her weight soared, her body exploding through sizes at breakneck speed, much to your enjoyment. You received another pleasant surprise during this time as well: as her weight grew, so did her sexual appetite, often requesting your presence several times a day; she even started eating while having sex with you sometimes, combining two of her great pleasures into one glorious event that stoked her ardor further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a lovely period of time, you finally asked her to move in with you, figuring that she was spending so much time at your home, it would be logical for the situation to be made more permanent. She decided to toy with you, not being sure that she wanted to do it, and this and that, before finally giving a big melodramatic sigh and saying that she thought she could give it a trial shot, all the while with a big coy grin splitting her face and dimpling her pudgy cheeks. After fully moving in, her gains only increased, shooting up to and past the five hundred pound mark, and edging above five hundred and fifty and closing in on six hundred pounds of luscious fat with no sign of stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSleep slowly releases you, letting you come awake on your own, and your mind still bubbling with the memories your subconscious had pulled forth. As you lay there, you think about how you have been getting some subtle and some not-so-subtle questions of what your future together might hold, including hints of whether there might be a ring involved. While you never directly respond to her quizzes, that is all about to change with your planned proposal to her during your upcoming romantic getaway. Her feelings towards you give you cause to hope that she will do you the incredible honor of making you the happiest _____ in the world.</span></div></div>",

You rather enjoy the situation, but you also know from experience that Mora requires a lot of food and likes to have even more, so you regretfully have to extract yourself. It takes a while, but you eventually manage to lift enough of her blubbery form off of you that you can slip out from underneath. Your bovine lover just mutters slightly as her body oozes back down onto the bed. Now exposed to the air of your home without the covers or the warmth radiating off of Mora, you shiver slightly as the air conditioner blows out a steady stream of chilled air that settles on your scales. Shaking it off, you make your way through the bedroom, your eyes shifting this way and that as you take in the results of what transpired before going to bed. Clothes are scattered everywhere around the room; Mora\u2019s bra is even lazily circling around as it hangs from the ceiling fan where it had been flung during the course of your frenzied journey to the bed with Mora. You chuckle to yourself upon seeing that and as you remember pieces of what happened: the theater, dinner and dancing, dessert, and back home for a passionate night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping into the bathroom, you shut the door behind you with nary a click, though your toe claws lightly tap against the tiles.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your reflection shows you a familiar sight: that of your somewhat muscular but still quiet feminine form with its voluptuous and buxom curves. Scales that shine like polished onyx wrap around your body and the thick waves of your voluminous blood-red hair cascade down from your head across your shoulders and back. The sound of the bed creaking snaps your attention away from the mirror and spurs you on to getting moving for what you have to do today. It doesn\u2019t sound like Mora is awake yet, but you best be moving on in any case. You quickly set the shower to a nice warm spray, test the temperature on your arm first, and then hop in. At first, you just enjoy the sensations of the water flowing down across your curvy body, turning this way and that to have the flow hit all around your form. After a while though, you turn your attention towards cleaning up; soaping and rinsing your hair first, before moving onto the rest of your body. As you are just about finished, you notice a shift in the steam that is starting to build up in the air, as well as a slight floral scent, but don\u2019t pay much attention to either. Just then, you hear a loud grumble from behind you, and turn to find Mora trying to sneak up on you, rather successfully till her stomach rumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning,\u201d she says with a slightly embarrassed grin as she continues stepping into the shower, pressing her stomach against you as she does so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning to you too, this is a nice surprise though,\u201d you respond, one soapy hand reaching down to caress her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair is still sleep tousled, and her grin turns slightly more mischievous as she pushes a bit harder, pinning you between her bulk and the tile wall, before leaning in and giving a kiss, your tongues entwining again and again. Finally breaking the kiss, she leans back a bit, but still holds you in place with her stomach and breasts. Without a word, you slip down, the water flowing across your bodies making this an easier task. You leave a series of kisses as you go, till you slide beneath the swell of her stomach, now experiencing a waterfall from the shower steadily spraying water across the monumental curves over you. Moving in, you can feel the warmth blazing off of her as you tease her snatch with the end of your muzzle. She jumps in surprise and nearly suffocates you as she clamps those heavenly thighs around your head, leaving you pinned in soft darkness. Exhaling across her folds causes a shiver to pass through every inch of her body; the resulting jiggling doesn\u2019t get the chance to stop before you plunge your tongue in. Unable to reach around her girth to get to you, Mora settles for pushing on her stomach and wiggling her hips to push your muzzle even deeper. Despite the warm water continuing to flow across both of your bodies, you can already feel the heat radiating off of her loins, which only increases as you slowly rub your tongue across and deeper into her ever moistening nethers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour experienced tongue work soon has the bloated bovine moaning somewhat, softly at first but getting steadily louder. A few moments later, you can feel a new and different feeling steam of warmth dribbling down onto you from above, and without even looking you know that Mora must be tweaking those lovely turgid teats, letting loose with twin steams of her thick cream. Wiggling your tongue ever deeper, you can feel her muscles tensing up, squeezing her head tighter and tighter between her thighs. She bucks her hips, trying to get you to hurry things along a bit, and you decide you\u2019ve teased her enough for this time; finding just the right spot, you flick the twin tips of your tongue several times, and bring her to a shuddering orgasm. Mora lets loose with a strangled shout that blends into an animalistic moo, but you barely hear it because of the way that her legs clamp the tightest yet, and a torrent of her cum gushing for and drenching your face. You are forced to ride it out, her hips holding you fast, though you probably would have stuck around even if you weren\u2019t trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finally starts to simmer down, the grip relaxes enough that you can slip free. Retracing your path back up across her body, you finally come back to her face, still licking your muzzle clean of her juices. Mora leans back against the rear wall, her face ruddy, chest heaving from her heavy breathing, and legs rubbery and barely able to support her weight. You run your fingers through her water slicked hair, then lean in for a kiss, and get a contended smile from your bovine lover as you step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026you\u2026you\u2019re still <i>really</i> good at that, you know?\u201d she says with a little laugh \u2013 you also take notice how that little episode has intensified the southern drawl that she has  mostly gotten rid of \u2013  and lets you help steady her till she was ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you are sure that she can manage herself, you resume your own cleaning, as well as going over the spots that need some attention again now. You then turn your attention to Mora, taking your time and savoring the experience as you help her reach the spots that she has trouble with due to her increasing size. Her stomach lets out another hungry grumble, and she shoos you away, telling you to get started on breakfast. You are starting to feel hungry yourself, and you can imagine how the big beautiful and bountiful bovine must be feeling. After lingering a moment longer to make sure that she can finish up, you step out of the shower and do a quickie dry job, before moving along, knowing you can drip dry soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAS you leave the bathroom and then bedroom, you briefly stretch your wings out behind you, enjoying the feeling before retracting them again. Your feet softly pad across the plush carpet as you move through your luxurious home, and you make note of having to refill some of the candy dishes scattered about. As you head towards the kitchen, you wonder whether you should make up the usual amount of food for the two of you, or make even more than usual for Mora.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decide to put your culinary skills through their paces and make up plenty of extra food for Mora, all the better to put some more delicious fat on her body as well. As you enter the kitchen, you crack your knuckles before getting to work. As you proceed at light speed preparing a veritable feast for Mora, your mind drifts back to an event months ago, when Mora discovered her pregnancy as well as a rare but very thrilling ability.<br>\r\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u00e2 \u20ac\u201c\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u00e2\u20ac \u201c\u2013<br>\r\nIt all started a few months into your relationship together and just shortly after you had convinced her that you didn\u2019t mind her weight in the least. The two of you enjoyed a night out on the town; dinner and dancing mostly, but Mora convinced you to stop in a bar for a drink. More than a few too many drinks later, you didn\u2019t remember much of what happened next, only broken flashes and hazy memories. From what you could piece together, a suave gentleman managed to charm the both of you\u2014though considering that both of you were at the giggly wobbly phase, most anything likely would have been charming. He must have invited the two of you back to his place because the next thing you remember is a rather swank bedroom while he thrust into Mora while putting his tongue hard at work on you. Come the next morning, Mora and you came to, realizing a portion of what had happened the night before. The two of you also realized how her chubby stomach was very bloated and even somewhat moving around; it didn\u2019t take long to realize that your lovely cow had actually swallowed the burly rabbit whole. Any attempts to free the rather unfortunate man from his fleshy prison proved futile, but truth be told, neither of you were trying too hard to do so, the thought of Mora actually swallowing a person whole proved to be quite stimulating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you then retired to your former host\u2019s bathroom and proceeded to make use of his facilities since he wasn\u2019t going to be using them now. Making love in his relatively small shower was incredible, and even more so when the rabbit started struggling around more and more, pressing out at the hide holding him tight. After several loud and messy climaxes, two of you lay in the bottom of the tub, water splashing across your exhausted but contented bodies. As you were drying off afterwards, Mora realized that her \u201cpassenger\u201d had stopped moving around and nothing seemed to be changing that; he was now just a mass to be turned into nutrients for her growing body. It all worked out anyways, the rabbit happened to be a person who never stuck around too long, always taking off at the drop of a hat, so his sudden disappearance didn\u2019t attract much attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you thought that the only result from that one night stand had been finding out a new kink that the two of you occasionally indulged in, but a bit over a month later Mora found out that the rabbit had been fruitful, quite fruitful indeed. It wasn\u2019t quite what either of you were expecting, but you both warmed to the idea of bringing new life into the world; what it had been doing to your lovely bovine was quite a bonus though. Since that time though, no word had been spoken of about the father and what happened to him, except when Mora whispered it breathlessly in your ear knowing what it would do to you. You also made some quiet inquiries and eventually made contact with a few other voraphiles to help indulge this newfound fetish, usually involving someone willing to be consumed, but sometimes Mora just had to someone a little more unwilling, and that just fine for you too.<br>\r\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u00e2 \u20ac\u201c\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u00e2\u20ac \u201c\u2013<br>\r\nThe sound of the shower turning off spurs you back to the present, and the mounds of food you have been preparing. You know that it will take Mora a while to even get partially dry, but with the huge amounts of food you have, you really have to be moving it along. Taking several trips, the dining room table is soon completely covered in platters and bowls of hot, steamy, and calorie laden food, with about another half remaining hot and ready in the kitchen, there just simply wasn\u2019t enough room on the table for all of it. As you put down the last load and wiped up a little mess, you hear the creaking of a floorboard as well as a hungry roar. Turning around, you are greeted by Mora\u2019s smiling face; she almost snuck up on you again, only to be undone by her stomach just as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarn it, my stomach just won\u2019t let me sneak up on you,\u201d she said with a grin dimpling her round cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ponderously walked up to you, you can see those lovely eyes dashing this way and that, taking in all of the food lying out on the table. Your own eyes are more drawn to the glistening flesh that she has left just as bare as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting on an outwardly nonchalant air, you remark, \u201cThere\u2019s more waiting in the kitchen too.\u201d Her mouth gapes as she looks around the corner and sees the platters still waiting to be eaten. She blinks and seems to be trying to get her words in order, but you go ahead and say, \u201cIt is a special occasion after all: one year ago today we had our first date.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see that see thinks about it for a moment, before getting an embarrassed look on her face, \u201cYou went through all this trouble, and I didn\u2019t even do anything for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, but you did, you said yes back then, and you have brought me quite a bit of joy since then. But I think it might be best if we get eating, we don\u2019t want it all getting cold after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods and makes her way towards her seat, but you dash around her and pull it out for her. Her grin gets even wider before she settles her bulk down in the chair, which creaks and groans loudly despite being especially reinforced. It looks like you will have to be looking into getting a new one for when this one gives way. After pushing her in, you go to your own seat and quickly grab everything you want, knowing that Mora almost certainly won\u2019t give you any space to get anything once she gets started. As you finish, you give her a little nod and in response she quickly digs in, her stomach letting out a little appreciative grumble as the first pieces drop into her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly finish off your own, thinking that the hash browns could use a bit more salt and pepper for the next time, but the bacon provides an excellent crunch as typical. As you nibble on your last piece of bacon, Mora flashes you a quick smile and mumbles about the food being great as usual before returning to the long process of eating every scrap. After you toss the last nibble of bacon into your mouth, you clear away the already cleaned plates \u2013 marveling while you do so about how spotlessly Mora leaves the plates \u2013 and replace them with some of the remaining food. Then you give Mora a kiss atop her head before heading to the bedroom to get dressed. Normally, you would remain and assist your bovine lover and feed her, but unfortunately you can\u2019t do that today, other plans have to be followed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There are a few more things you have to pick up for your vacation with Mora today; it is nothing too major, just the two of you taking a trip up the coast to a secluded beach, but even the thought of Mora packed into a teeny little two-piece bikini is enough to make your knees go a bit wobbly. Shaking your head, you delve into your shared closet\u2014though Mora has been taking up more and more room as of late, though more though the amount needed to wrap about her body, rather than number of pieces. She has grown fond of holding onto some of the clothes that she outgrows, mostly so that she can give you a bit of a show by slipping into something that barely fit her fifty or more pounds and a large portion of her pregnancy ago and bursting out of it after a bit of feeding. Again you have to shake your head, more vigorously this time, to try and keep your mind on task. You manage to keep your focus long enough to grab a t-shirt with gaps for your wings to fit through and a pair of hip-hugging jeans similarly made to handle your tail. After slipping on a pair of shoes made for your reptilian feet, you head back towards the front of your home. Taking a brief detour, you find Mora still mowing through the piles of food you made for her, though at a somewhat slower pace now as the shear amount of food she is shoving into her maw is catching up to her. You give her another kiss \u2013 this time on the cheek \u2013 and playfully grab a roll of fat from those resting atop her rotund thigh. She gives a little giggle as you wave goodbye to her before departing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you only a short time to head into downtown and the store there. Once there, you quickly move through the store picking up some things that you forgot to get before today, as well as a few things that were best to get this late anyways, and check them off a mental list as you go. You make sure to grab a few tubes of sunscreen, as well as a couple cans of bug spray. You also stop off to get some snacks for the trip up, then turn around and grab a couple more boxes of doughnuts in addition the couple you already grabbed, a grin curling the edges of your mouth. With that done, you go about handling a few other last minute tasks: filling up the gas in your car, checking out your post office box and making sure about the hold on mail while you are there, and so on. Soon enough, you are pulling back up the driveway of your spacious home; all told, it took you about an hour to do everything, so Mora likely should be done with breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr at least the first part of it,\u201d you muse as you steal a glance at the twin boxes of doughnuts you got for right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you thought, Mora is just finishing off her meal, her breathing a bit slower and heavier as she drums her fingers on her nicely bloated gut. You can also see her children are very active now, their movement stretching and warping her stomach in all directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuppressing a small burp, she then speaks up, her voice a bit softer than usual, \u201cExcellent as always, dear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her a little nod before plopping the boxes of doughnuts before her, clearing away some of the plates at the same time. She starts to voice a protest, but you silence her by shoving a chocolate glazed into her mouth. You can see it in her eyes: she wants you to feed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got enough time for you to finish these, then you can recover a bit, and we can be off,\u201d you say as you chase the first with a powdered sugar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snuggle up against her, the chair groaning even louder as you do so, and stuff a raspberry filled doughnut into her mouth, smearing a bit of the filling on her cheeks. Next follows a chocolate filled, and after that comes several sugar glazed doughnuts, and you start to lose track as you feed her more and more, your fingers and Mora\u2019s mouth getting progressively dirtier as you go. You can feel her stomach expanding and tightening with each little chunk of fried dough, your free hand roaming the fleshy expanse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarvelous job, my love, just one more left,\u201d you say quietly, nuzzling into her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you tease her with the last glazed doughnut, her eyes are almost as glazed as the pastry in your hand. She lets out a little belch and lunges slightly, taking a huge bite followed by another and one more till she has gulped it all down. You aren\u2019t finished with her just yet though. You wipe up all of the smeared sugary goo surrounding her mouth with your similarly soiled hand, and then hold it right in front of her plump lips. She can already tell from the look on your face what you expect her to do, and \u2013 though it take her a few moments before she attempts it \u2013 proceeds to do so: locking her lips around your fingers and makes a rather noisy job of licking and sucking your fingers clean. After you pull your fingers free with a rather noticeable pop, she lets out another belch, louder this time. You run your fingers through her hair, savoring the scent that drifts through your nose, as well as enjoying the contented look on Mora\u2019s face. Giving her another kiss, you slip off of her, letting her digest her meal while you tend to the dishes and other detritus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you are finishing with the dishes, you hear Mora\u2019s chair creaking loudly again, then her huffing as she steadies herself. Still drying off one of the dishes, you wander out to see Mora leaning against the table, cradling her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOof, you really like stuffing me, don\u2019t you?\u201d she says, and gets only a toothy smile from you. \u201cYou should just be glad that I like it just as much. I\u2019m going to go watch some TV for a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wave her off before turning your attention back to the dishes. Finishing that, you join her on the couch, watching some vapid daytime talk show, your hands slowly rubbing and massaging her bloated belly. After a bit more than hour of this, you remark at the time and mention that the two of you should be off. You assist her in standing and watch the twin mounds of her massive rear bobbing around as she waddles back to the bedroom. After taking a few more things out to the car, you head back to the bedroom yourself, and lean in the doorframe enjoying the show of her still struggling to clothe herself. Several discarded pieces litter the bed, all looking like she has tried and failed to put them on. Currently, her arms are somewhat packed into the sleeves of a shirt that she is straining to fit across the vast udders that are her fleshy breasts. With much groaning \u2013 and a bit of moaning \u2013 she manages that, but next comes her stomach, an even more insurmountable challenge when combined with her breasts taking up so much room in her shirt. You try not to, but can\u2019t avoid letting out an approving whistle and a laugh as you watch the spectacle of Mora pushing and pulling, both on the shirt and her own fatty flesh, trying in seemingly vain to fit the first over the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whirls around, \u201cWell, are you going to help me or just watch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatching it was so much fun though, but I suppose I must help you, we\u2019ll likely never get going otherwise. We probably should be going clothes shopping for you again when we get back though,\u201d you respond as you walk up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods in agreement while you assist her with her shirt. You take your time, drawing it out as much as you can, your hands freely roaming her body, pinching and caressing as you and she finally make headway and got the shirt partway across her stomach. Next comes her pants, an especially stretchy pair of jeans that still probably aren\u2019t up to the task. Your estimation proves true as you and she can get them up partway, but just can\u2019t handle the girth of her hips and butt. Looking up from your position, kneeling on the floor in front of her, you can almost see the top curl of her hair, the rest of your view eclipsed by her stomach and breasts looming over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting to be quite a fatty, you know that, Mora my dear,\u201d you amusedly say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought that wasn\u2019t a bad thing,\u201d she responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are correct; I was just stating an undeniable fact. Now let\u2019s see what else might work for this,\u201d you say as you walk around behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrouching down, you grab firmly on both sides of the pants. She starts to ask what you are planning, but gets cuts off as you lift and pull with all of your might. She yelps as you lift her several inches off of the ground, suspending her from her hips. You strain and then agonizingly slowly, her fat creeps into the tight confines. Panting, you finally let her back down onto the floor, the unfortunate garment stretched drum-tight around her and it is obviously impossible to even think about doing up the zipper or button, but they aren\u2019t going to be falling down anytime soon. Getting them off will be another fun challenge as well. Mora thanks you, while expressing some mock outrage at you surprising her like that, before getting one last thing: a gold link bracelet that you bought for her as a present some months back and that fits snuggly around her wrist, though you have added a number of links to keep it fitting so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then grab the pair of already prepared suitcases and lead Mora outside, locking the door behind the two of you. After loading up the suitcases, you then help Mora into the car. Even with the seat already as far back as it can go, you notice that the furthermost edge of her stomach is just barely brushing the dashboard, and you remarked to her that if her weight continues it\u2019s climbing, she won\u2019t be able to fit in your car much longer. As expected, this actually causes some excitement for her, as well as her saying that you might have to be looking into getting a new vehicle. You agree with this as you check that everything you need is in the car before pulling out and heading away for what is likely to be a very enjoyable weekend.</span></div></div>",

Along with that, people started to take down their Thanksgiving decorations in exchange for Christmas decorations, like setting up the Christmas Tree, decorating it with lights, ornaments, and other accessories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, you had a large extensive family with parents, grandparents, siblings, aunts, uncles, and cousins, but you were still looking for that \"special someone\" to spend the rest of your life with. But today however, things felt....different, as you slowly arose from your slumber, where you unexpectedly felt something big and furry sleeping right next to you in the same bed. \"Huh? That's weird... I don't remember this being here.\" You thought to yourself, noticing how soft the big lump of fur was. However, upon turning your head to your left, it was there you realized that it wasn't some big lump of fur, but the body of an anthropomorphic tigress. More specifically, you recognized it as Kess from the webcomic series, The Draconia Chronicles!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, you were quite surprised to see Kess right in front of you, since you basically had a romantic crush on the tigress ever since you started watching the Draconia Chronicles webcomic. However, moments after taking in the realization you were in bed with a sleeping Kess, you then noticed one very obvious detail about the bandana-wearing tigress: She had the physique of a morbidly obese woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, Kess was laying on her side, which gave you a better look of her bulky physique. Her face had these plump facial cheeks, complete with a slightly chubby snout and a small but noticeable double chin. Her breasts looked to be a Double-F Cup, as Kess's furry breasts were cradled inside a sky blue lace bra, leaning against a fat furry apron belly, which covered a bit of her lap in the process. On the lower half of her body, Kess had a large pair of hips, waist, and buttcheeks, making her require two chairs to sit in, one for each of her blubbery buttcheeks. Aside from her bra, Kess was also wearing a matching set of sky blue panties, which felt comfortably snug, as if the lacy undergarment was hugging her rotund furry rear, while still leaving ample room for her feline tail. And like the rest of her body, Kess's leg's were just as fat, as her bulky thighs rubbed and smooshed against one another underneath the bedsheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, judging from how much weight was distributed throughout her frame, you had to speculate that Kess must to have weighed at least 500 to 600 pounds in total. However, you couldn't help but like she looks more attractive with all that body fat on her.</span></div></div>",

However, you couldn't help but enjoy the romantic kiss given to you, especially since you were sharing a kiss with your favorite character from Draconia Chronicles.....albeit an obese version of said character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, there were still some questions left unanswered to you, like how was Kess real?

From there, she severed the kiss, looking at you with her blue-green eyes and said, \"Oh honey, you still have such a damn good kiss. *giggle*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, she was referring to when the two you kissed, as she then kneeled upward, still sitting on top of you, pinning you to the bed with her girth and bulk. While she gently caressed her fat-laden belly with her plump paw-like hands and fingers, Kess looked down at you and asked, \"Guess what day it is?\" \"Umm.....Black Friday?\" You guessed, since you were completely unsure as to what the corpulent tigress was talking about. Plus, you were currently blushing due to how sexually appealing Kess looked as an obese tigress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response however, Kess then pressed her full weight on you, making you grunt a little due to the overall weight forced down upon you, as Kess then spoke up and replied, \"Wrong! Today's our very first anniversary, sweetie!\" \".....Anniversary?\" You asked, a little confused about what sort of anniversary the large tigress was talking about. But then, out of confusion herself, Kess tilted her head to the right a little, raising an eyebrow at you and asked, \"Honey, are.....are you feeling alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, in an attempt to make things less complicated, you then spoke toward Kess and answered, \"I'm fine, Kess. I'm still trying to wake up a little. So, can you please remind what sort of anniversary we're celebrating?\" From there, Kess sat back up, still straddling your legs with her fat bulky thighs and legs, as she then looked back at you with a reassured look on her face and explained, \"Oh! Well, since you asked nicely, I'll tell you. Today is our Mating Anniversary: the day we've been bounded together as soulmates, as lovers.....as husband....and wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing such news left you in both surprise and shock, which you've successfully hid those reactions well from Kess, where she then showed you a large golden bracelet with rubies and emeralds embedded into the bracelet, which she showed on her plump left wrist, while showing off a loving smirk on her plump feline snout. In turn, this made you come to a certain realization: Kess was talking about her wedding anniversary with you, which meant that you're legitimately married to the rotund tigress!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure how to react to such life-changing news. After all, you don't exactly remember ever marrying Kess whatsoever, as you then looked toward your right arm and found the same exact bracelet around your wrist as well. Due to the somewhat lack of information on this sort of thing from the Draconia Chronicles webcomic, you could only speculate that the bracelets were the Tiger equivalent to a pair of wedding rings.</span></div></div>",

At first, you were somewhat confused as to why she would do that. But suddenly, you felt several kicks from inside Kess's large abdomen, which could mean only one thing, just as Kess continued and answered, \"....We're finally going to have cubs of our own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing what Kess had said confirmed your suspicions: Kess wasn't just fat and married to you, she was also pregnant with a set of cubs on the way! And yet, why couldn't you remember all of this? However, that was a question saved for another time, as you then heard Kess's stomach growling with a loud roar, causing the rotund tigress to blush some, as she then spoke to you and said, \"Well, speaking of our cubs, sounds like they're making their momma hungry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Kess slowly got off of you, as she then looked at you and said, \"I'll just take a quick shower, dear. Think you can handle making breakfast?\" \"I guess.\" You replied, just as Kess waddled off toward the bathroom, her hips swaying some in the process, along with giving you a good look at that fat furry rear of hers. Left with no say in the matter, you figured you better make her breakfast. However, due to her current physique, you figured Kess might have a bigger appetite, especially since you now just found out that she's pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, you couldn't but asking yourself: How come I don't remember any of this? While she was taking her shower, you figured that you might as well look around some, maybe you'll find some answers about what's going on.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deciding to seek out those answers yourself, you carefully ventured out of the bedroom, and into what appeared to be your new Penthouse. In all honesty, you were completely caught by surprise from such an abrupt revelation. \"Wow...\" You thought to yourself, amazed at how spacious the Penthouse actually was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was there you noticed a wide bookshelf to your left, which displayed a numerous amount of framed photos upon each of the upper shelves. In turn, this inadvertently piqued your curiosity some, as you cautiously approached the bookshelf, taking a closer look at the photos in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first photo you examined was a group photo, which showed you and Kess in the center, standing alongside the legendary Tigress warrior Scyde, as well as several other Tigresses. However, there were a noticeable handful of differences: For one, you were wearing what appeared to be a tactical Kevlar vest whilst holding a G36 assault rifle. Second, Kess was as skinny as she was in the webcomic. And third, the background appeared to be the Dragon Kingdom capital, only it looked to be somewhat in ruins, as if a grand battle took place there. Judging from the expressions on both your face, Kess's feline face, and the others, it looked as if the Tigers had finally won their war against the Dragons, especially since you were standing on the lifeless corpse of the Lightning Dragoness, Elektra, who had a longsword stabbed through her skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next photo you examined was what appeared to be Kess chowing down on a humongous hamburger, devouring it with a gluttonous gusto. Judging from her physical appearance within the photograph, Kess appeared to have packed on the pounds somewhat, complete with a small but noticeable potbelly underneath a blue T-Shirt. However, the background appeared to be that of a fast food restaurant. You could only guess that this took place some time after the first photo, which would explain why Kess had gained some weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after that, you proceeded toward the next photo in line, which now showed Kess at her current weight and girth, wearing what appeared to be a purple silk bellydancing outfit, swaying her padded hips from side to side with the rhythm of the music. Needless to say, she looked like she was having a grand old time in the photograph. Overall, suffice to say, there was a well-established relationship between you and the obese Kess, where you then noticed a gun cabinet nearby, which housed the exact same G36 assault rifle that you were holding in the first photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, looking to your right toward the Kitchen, you then noticed a wrapped present laying on top of the Kitchen counter. \"Hmm... I wonder who that present's for?\" You thought to yourself, as you then approached the Kitchen, curious to know who gave them something like this. Upon further examination, you discovered a letter placed on the present, which read: \" To Kess &amp; (Name), From Princess Kiriad\". That name definitely rang a bell in your mind, recognizing who Kiriad was: The leader of the Tigers, and a member of their kingdom's royalty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecoming a bit more curious, you opened the envelope to read the letter itself, which read: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear (Name),<br>\r\nWe've never had the chance to properly thank you for your aid against Queen Oscura and her cohorts, but... Thank you, for aiding me and my people in our darkest hour. Though, from what I have recently heard from both Kilani, Scyde, and a few others, it seems that Kess grown quite a lot from her time with you as her mate. I understand that she has, um... \"Packed on the pounds\" as you Humans would say. However, I also happen to be well aware that Kess is experiencing the gift of Fertility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, what I'm saying is that I don't disapprove of this romantic intimacy between you and Kess. In fact, I greatly encourage it. To elaborate, when a Tigress becomes fertile, they are required to consume approximately twice to possibly thrice their body weight, to both accommodate their fertility and to strengthen their cubs upon birth. After all, I'm sure you are already aware of Kess's gluttonous eating habits by now. Also, a fair warning, (Name): Due to Kess now bearing your cubs, she will most likely be more...territorial, always keeping you by her side, so I recommend you don't bring any Human women into your home whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSincerely,<br>\r\nPrincess Kiriad\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough what the letter said did contain some useful information regarding Kess and her pregnancy, it did explain somewhat why Kess was currently in such a corpulent physique, as you then decided to...</span></div></div>",

So eventually, you decided to present Kiriad's wrapped gift to Kess. After all, this was HER gift, as you then grabbed the present and carried it into the bedroom with you, where Kess just got finished in the shower, as she dried off her wet soggy fur with a towel or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she obviously noticed that you didn't make breakfast yet, which left her with a confused expression on her plump feline face and snout, where she then spoke toward you and asked, \"...Sweetie, why haven't you made breakfast yet?\" \"Well, it's because I just found this on our kitchen countertop. It's from Princess Kiriad.\" You swiftly answered, which left Kess with a surprised expression. In response, despite her rotund bulk and girth, Kess swiftly swiped the present from you as she excitedly yelped, \"A-A present from Princess Kiriad?! Gimme that!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Kess soon began to rip apart the present's wrapping paper with ease, using her feline claws to cut open the wrapping paper with little to no effort. Within a matter of seconds, the corpulent digress managed to free her gift from it's wrapping paper confines, and judging from the expression on Kess's plump face and snout, she was certainly ecstatic about what Princess Kiriad had given her: A large bellydancer top and skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, the outfit was definitely made for someone of Kess's current size and bulk, as it was made out of purple silk with gold accents and linings. The bellydancer top criss-crossed in an X pattern, which easily showed off the wearer's voluminous breasts, while putting her furry apron belly on full display. Meanwhile, the bellydancer skirt was obviously designed in a loincloth fashion, easily showing off her thick padded hips, thighs, and legs to any passerby. Overall, Kess was undoubtedly excited to receive such a gaudy yet noticeably expensive article of clothing from Princess Kiriad, as Kess held up both the top and skirt with her plump paw-like hands, where she gleefully twirled around a few times while she excitedly exclaimed, \"By the Gods, this outfit is absolutely perfect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*chuckle* Glad you like it, honey.\" You said, crossing your arms in the process, relieved to see that Kess was enjoying her gift from Princess Kiriad herself. But then, Kess stopped twirling to face you, where she proudly answered, \"Like it?! I love it, (Name)!! After all, you and Kiriad are already aware of how much I enjoy bellydancing.\" From there, you managed to find out that Kess was really into bellydancing, which seemed a little reasonable, considering how big she is now. Plus, it did explain a little why there was a picture of her in a bellydancer outfit earlier. After all, maybe she has an established career as a plus-sized bellydancer or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as you were about to ask her, you suddenly heard...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>February. Best known throughout the world as \"The Month of Love and Romance\", people are expected to confess their feelings towards the ones they fondly love. Though for you however, you were in for quite a big surprise...no pun intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, you were expecting to wake up in your own bed, within your suburban home in Washington DC. However, when you slowly but surely awoke from your slumber, you felt yourself being gently pressed against an unknown object. Upon contact, the object felt bulky yet soft, pleasantly warm, and fuzzy to the touch. But once you fully regained consciousness, you suddenly felt the large bulge of light brown fuzz turn over on the large bed, giving you a shocking revelation: You were sleeping with Vanilla the Rabbit from Sonic the Hedgehog!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of all the female characters you've like in the Sonic The Hedgehog franchise, you always preferred the voluptuous mother of Cream the Rabbit, Vanilla the Rabbit. After all, despite that she was a mother, you've always had a gigantic crush on Vanilla, which lasted and persevered throughout your childhood. And yet, here she was: Vanilla the Rabbit, sleeping soundly in bed with you and you alone! At first, you thought your eyes were merely playing tricks with your perception. However, upon clearing your vision, you came to realize something was indeed off about Vanilla: She was incredibly obese! Or rather, to be more specific, approximately 590 pounds of fat underneath all that short light brown fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, Vanilla had a prominent apron belly, which stuck out almost 3 feet from her body, as her flabby abdomen was able to easily conceal her female crotch with little difficulty. Looking both upward and downward, you could easily see that despite the excessive amounts of blubber on her frame, Vanilla still retained a curvaceous figure, as her breasts were still perky and full, which were now a Triple F-Cup, judging from the overall size of her magenta silk bra. Meanwhile, on the other end of the physical spectrum, Vanilla's waist, hips, and butt were as equally as large, with hips that were 3 and a half feet in diameter, while each buttcheek was as large as yoga balls, as her puffy white rabbit tail nestled comfortably just above her enlarged gluteus maximus. And speaking of her limbs, Vanilla sported a pair of thick fat-laden arms and legs, as Vanilla displayed a thick pair of thunder thighs underneath the bedsheets. Though, as for her arms, despite being coated in fat, you could feel the subtle hints of muscle underneath all those layers of fat, which honestly surprised you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, you gazed toward Vanilla's head, which still looked about the same as you remembered, with the exceptions being that Vanilla now sported a pair of plump facial cheeks and a thick double chin. Overall, Vanilla had this rotund but curvaceous physique, which you had to admit it made her look quite...attractive.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>But then, just as you were about to dismount from your bed, Vanilla began to stir, as she opened her hazel eyes, gazing upon you with a pleasant smile on her cherubic lapine face. From there, despite her obvious bulk and girth, Vanilla swiftly wrapped her thick arms around you, pulling you towards her in a plush loving embrace. \"*giggle* Good morning, sweetie!\" She said, where she then promptly delivered a long but passionate kiss upon your lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you were in complete shock from such a turn of events. However, said shock soon melted away into pure pleasure and heavenly bliss. After all, you were physically kissing Vanilla the Rabbit herself! Sure, she was an incredibly obese version of the character you were fondly in love with. But still, this was still THE Vanilla the Rabbit you were kissing here! So, of course you weren't complaining about this whatsoever. And yet, this still raised a few questions in your mind, like: How was Vanilla the Rabbit here in reality? Why was she so fat? And was there anything else that felt different?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, those questions would have to wait for now, as you felt the rotund Vanilla sever the kiss, only to swiftly hug you even tighter, causing you to be smooshed against her large voluminous breasts, which you weren't exactly complaining about at the slightest. Moments later, Vanilla eased up on her strong loving embrace, looking at you with her hazel eyes in a lovey-dovey manner, where she then spoke toward you and asked, \"Did you sleep well, my love?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Pretty good, I guess.\" You answered, trying to play along as if this was normal for you, despite the situation being on the opposite end of the spectrum. However, despite your best efforts, Vanilla could easily see right through you, as she spoke to you with a concerned tone and said, \"...Is everything alright, (Name)?\" In an effort to cover up your confusion, you decided to tell her about a \"nightmare\" you had, as you looked at the corpulent lapine and replied, \"...Well, yes and no, Vanilla dear. I, uh...I had a nightmare last night.\" \"Oh? And what was this nightmare of yours like, sweetie?\" Vanilla asked, wanting to help you overcome such hardship, as you spoke toward the obese rabbit woman and explained, \"...Well, you see, in my dream, I...I was living a normal life, but...in that dream, you were nothing but a fictional character.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Vanilla became somewhat shocked at such a nightmare, where she began to comfort you in her padded embrace as she said, \" Aww, honey. That's horrible! ...It must have truly been a nightmare for you.\" \"Yeah... I'm just glad it was only a nightmare, Vanilla.\" You replied, where you then delivered another kiss upon Vanilla's slightly plump lips, then spoke to her once more and said,  \"I'm not sure what I would've done if you didn't exist in my life.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, just as things were about to get risqu\u00e9 between you and the rotund Vanilla, Vanilla's large flabby stomach began to growl loudly, demanding to be fed. In response, Vanilla let out a giggle, gently patting her blubbery abdomen in the process, causing it to jiggle slightly with each gentle smack from her plump left paw-like hand. \"*giggle* It sounds like our bundle of joy is getting hungry.\" She said, confirming something shocking to you: Vanilla was legitimately pregnant. With your child! But then, just as you were thinking if Vanilla was pregnant with Cream or not, you suddenly heard one of the double doors to your bedroom open, revealing to you a drowsy Cream the Rabbit, who was currently wearing an orange nightgown, holding a Chao plushie in one hand while rubbing the sleep out of her eyes with the other, thus confirming that Cream was actually having a little brother or sister on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to seeing a drowsy Cream, Vanilla slowly dismounted from the reinforced Queen-Sized bed, waddling over toward Cream to greet her daughter a good morning. From there, Cream easily noticed her mother, prompting her to hug her mother's flabby apron belly, snuggling it as if Vanilla was a giant stuffed animal as Cream said, \"*yawn* Good morning, Mommy!\" \"*giggle* Good morning, my beloved little Cream. Did you sleep well?\" Vanilla asked, hugging her daughter in a pleasantly warm maternal embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while Vanilla was preoccupied with Cream, you noticed something odd: Apparently, Vanilla wasn't wearing any panties! She was going commando! But, it was there you then noticed that Vanilla had an orange Mawashi hung up on a coat rack, which only indicated an obvious fact: Somehow, Vanilla had become a Sumo Wrestler! Although this did explain why Vanilla was much stronger than you originally remembered and she was fat in the first place, this still left you somewhat confused at why Vanilla was a Sumo Wrestler. After all, the last time you checked, Sumo Wrestling was a male-exclusive sport in Japan, even though there are female Sumo Wrestling Leagues outside of Japan.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Now, Cream: Why don't you head out into the Living Room and watch some cartoons while I get dressed. Okay?\" Vanilla asked, requesting her daughter to give her some necessary privacy. In response, Cream nodded in agreement towards her mother, as she displayed a gentle smile on her young lapine face and replied, \"Okay, Mommy!\" From there, Cream skipped her way out of your bedroom and into the Living Room, where you then closed the doors behind her, giving Vanilla some privacy in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two of you were given some privacy, Vanilla waddled toward the coat rack where her orange Mawashi was hanging, as she then grabbed it off of the coat rack, as she then grabbed it off of the coat rack with a plump right paw-like hand. However, before she was about to put on the cloth undergarment, Vanilla turned herself around to gaze at you, displaying a gentle flirtatious smile upon her plump lapine face, where she spoke toward you and asked, \"(Name), would you like to help me get dressed into my Mawashi?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, in response to such a request, you inadvertently began to blush some, obviously due to it being such an erotic request coming from Vanilla the Rabbit, who is the least likely female Sonic character to ask something so lewd. Then again, you didn't expect Vanilla to be a fat Sumo Wrestler along with being pregnant with your child, so your expectations were now considerably lowered by this point. Though, speaking of the rotund rabbit, Vanilla giggled some at your bashfulness, finding it to be quite adorable coming from you, as you then steeled your nerves some and answered, \"Oh, um... O-Of course, sweetie.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww! Thank you! You're such a sweetheart, (Name)!\" Vanilla replied, where she then hand you her orange Mawashi, which you could clearly see that it was considerably large enough to fit around Vanilla's waist, hips, and butt. Once you held the orange Mawashi, you stretched it out so Vanilla could insert her thick furry legs into the Mawashi's leg-holes. First, Vanilla inserted her left leg in the Mawashi left leg-hole, and then her right leg into the other leg-hole. \"So, um... How did you become a Sumo Wrestler anyway, Vanilla?\" You asked, trying to get a decent explanation as to how and why Vanilla the Rabbit became a Sumo-Sized version of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh, that's right! *giggle* I must've forgotten to tell you all about my promotion to Yokozuna, darling! I'm sorry for not telling you sooner, sweetie. It must have slipped my mind!\" Vanilla answered, confirming that she was promoted to the rank of Yokozuna, which happens to be the highest rank a Sumo Wrestler can obtain. After all, the title of Yokozuna means \"Grand Champion\", and can only be obtained when a Sumo Wrestler under the title of \u014dzeki either wins the championship for two consecutive tournaments or an \"equivalent performance\" in order to be considered for promotion to the title of Yokozuna. And judging from the somewhat gleeful expression on Vanilla's cherubic lapine face, it seems that she most certainly received the rank of Yokozuna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you slowly pulled the orange Mawashi up the corpulent rabbit's thick fat-laden legs and towards her wide hips and blubbery rear end, you spoke toward Vanilla and asked, \"Wait, Yokozuna? That's the highest rank a Sumo Wrestler could obtain! How did you even get that title anyhow?\" Obviously noticing your curiosity, Vanilla let out a feminine giggle, which caused her large apron belly and butt to jiggle some due to her giggle fit. From there,Vanilla began to speak toward you and said, \"*giggle* Funny you should ask, dearie. Do you still remember the brother of your college roommate and best friend, Ichigo Gasai?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo Gasai. Now that was an individual you weren't going to forget anytime soon. From what you remember, Ichigo Gasai was both your roommate and best friend from your college days at the University of Phoenix in Phoenix, Arizona. He was a foreign exchange student from Kyoto, Japan, who's father and 3 uncles were professional Sumo Wrestlers, so it was basically an honored tradition in his family. Heck, even his slightly younger brother, Yamato Gasai, was undergoing training at a Sumo Training Stable, or heya as they're called in Japan, to become a professional Sumo Wrestler like his father and 3 uncles. So, in response to her question, you spoke toward Vanilla as you secured the orange Mawashi around her thick padded hips and waist, where it hugged the bottom portion of Vanilla's flabby belly and said, \"...Well, now that I think about it, yeah. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* Well, Ichigo's father, Gorumaki Gasai, was remarkably impressed by my skills and me being the reigning champion of the Meiji Sumo League Tournament for 3 consecutive seasons. Apparently, he happens to be a high-ranking Yokozuna with a powerful reputation as one of the strongest and most influential members of the Sumo Wrestling community.\" Vanilla answered, giving you a decent explanation as to how she received the rank of Yokozuna, despite being a woman, just as Vanilla waddled over to the nearby closet and pulled out a short orange tank top with the picture of a carrot printed onto the fabric. From there, as she equipped the large tank top onto her large blubbery frame, Vanilla continued talking and explained, \"Anyway, shortly after I won my 3rd consecutive Meiji Sumo Tournament, he greeted me in the stadium lobby, where he and a member of the Sumo Association Board of Directors formally offered me the title of Yokozuna! ...Of course, I would have to participate in the inaugural ceremonial ring entry ceremony held at Meiji Shrine in Shibuya, Tokyo a few days from now. And well... I want you and Cream to attend the ceremony. You know, to give me some bolstered encouragement and support.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honesty, what Vanilla had just explained to you was quite the news indeed. After all, becoming Yokozuna was quite a high honor, especially since Vanilla was becoming probably the first female Yokozuna in Sumo Wrestling history. And yet, you could sense some form of nervousness and hesitation in Vanilla's hazel eyes. After all, the ceremonial ring entry ceremony was a HUGE deal in the world of Sumo Wrestling, so the fear and hesitation were soundly profound.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although you were relatively new to the centuries-old customs and traditions of Sumo, you could still understand the nervousness and hesitation that Vanilla was experiencing. After all, the ceremonial ring entry ceremony was considered a very big deal in the Sumo Wrestling community. In other words, Vanilla's current sense of hesitation was very understandable at this point. So, in response toward Vanilla's hesitation, you gently grasped Vanilla's plump paw-like hands, where you then spoke towards the rotund lapine and said, \"Vanilla, look at me. I know that this whole ceremony is a major deal in your line of work, but... You need to calm down a little first. Remember: Deep breaths, Vanilla. Deep breaths.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wait a minute: Why am I reassuring her?\" You thought to yourself, quickly realizing that you were somewhat on auto-pilot for a moment there. From there, the bulky Vanilla began to take several deep breaths, inhaling and exhaling deeply for a moment or two. Obviously, it must be some sort off stress reliever for the corpulent lapine woman, which seemed to be noticeably effective on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Feel better?\" You asked, just as Vanilla exhaled another deep breath, where she looked at you with a reassured smile and replied, \"...Very much. Thank you, sweetie.\" \"Anytime.\" You answered, as you subconsciously administered a tender kiss upon her plump lips. Moments later, you severed the kiss as Vanilla spoke toward you and said, \"I'm so sorry, (Name). It's just that ever since I became pregnant with my second child, I became a bit more...moody than usual.\" \"...Wait a second: Second child? Pregnant? Vanilla's pregnant?!\" You thought to yourself, coming to quite a shocking revelation: Vanilla was actually pregnant with a child. Your child!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough this was quite shocking news indeed, you attempted to keep yourself calm and collected as if this was a normal occurrence, despite what you've awoken to was anything but normal. And yet, this felt like a dream come true to you, as you then spoke toward the obese rabbit and asked, \"Vanilla? Aren't you worried about harming the baby?\" In response, Vanilla slowly gazed down at her large flabby abdomen, gently placing a plump left paw-like hand upon her apron belly, feeling the light kicks of your child inside her flabby abdomen, displaying a maternal smile on her plump lapine face and snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after that, Vanilla began to speak toward you and explained, \"...Do not worry, dearie. Mr. Gasai completely understood me carrying our bundle of joy. After all, once I've completed the ring entry ceremony and have been officially proclaimed Yokozuna, Mr. Gasai has allowed me to take a long enough vacation from participating in any upcoming Sumo Tournaments until I have fully recovered from giving birth to our child. *giggle* And besides, I won't be going into labor until 3 weeks from now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from the information she had revealed to you, Vanilla was pretty far along into her pregnancy, especially if she could feel her baby kicking underneath all that blubber on her thick physical frame. </span></div></div>",

Although she was blushing slight from such an abrupt intervention, Vanilla still retained her calm but caring composure, just as she gave her blubbery abdomen a few light pats while she said, \"*giggle*...Well, it seems like a certain someone is feeling quite famished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, the rotund lapine woman calmly waddled away from you, approaching the ornate  spacious closet, displaying a sexy sway in her hips with each step forward. Once she was thoroughly searching through her closet for a suitable set of clothing, you slowly walked toward the double doors leading out of the Bedroom, where you spoke toward Vanilla and said, \"I, um... I guess I'll be making breakfast then.\" \"Of course, I'll leave you to it, my love. And don't forget: You're feeding breakfast for two! *giggle*\" Vanilla answered, speaking her last sentence with a sing-song tone, just as the obese rabbit pulled out a cherry blossom pink silk Yukata, which had these white floral printings on both the back and short sleeves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Vanilla was equipping the Yukata, you opened one of the doors and walked out into something you didn't expect: Your new home. Instead of a 1-Story house in the suburban outskirts of Washington DC, your home was now a Two-Story Penthouse Condo, as you were standing on a wide balcony hallway, which seemed to be reinforced to handle almost an absurd amount of weight. From there, as you slowly walked down the wide walkway, you noticed how different and spacious everything was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a large kitchen layout, complete with a massive Industrial-sized refrigerator, a wide stove and oven set, and a microwave the size of a small coffee table. Alongside the custom kitchen, there was a long hardwood reinforced dining table, where there were also several wide reinforced chairs, obviously meant for Vanilla and possibly other guests as large or larger than her. However, approximately 10 feet away from the large kitchen and dining table, there appeared to be a well-equipped and well-maintained Training Center, but the only difference being that the equipment was specifically targeted for Sumo Wrestlers in mind. After all, there was a Wrestling Ring, or \"dohy\u014d\" as it was called, in the middle of the Training Center. However, instead of a traditional wrestling ring, which would be made of rice-straw bales on top of a platform made of clay mixed with sand, the wrestling ring was just a massive gymnasium mat with white tape that formed a circle that was 14.9 feet in diameter, complete with a red punching bag attached to a metal stand, which was obviously used as practice. Alongside that, there was this rack of numerous dumbbells, each in varied weights, from 20 pounds to a whopping 60 pounds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as you calmly descended down the flight of reinforced stairs, it was there you noticed a vast spacious Living Room, complete with an absurdly massive 120 inch Flatscreen TV, a large elongated L-shaped couch that could easily fit someone that would weigh 4,000 pounds, and a wide but sturdy coffee table. Aside from those noticeable details, you could easily see Cream sitting on the couch alongside her playful Chao, Cheese, as they were currently preoccupied with watching some cartoons, while you went into the kitchen and automatically made breakfast.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fast forward to almost an entire hour later, and you were finished making breakfast for Vanilla, which had a considerably massive amount of food on the table. And weirdly enough, it felt like you were completely on auto-pilot while you were making breakfast, considering that Vanilla's portion of breakfast was more than enough to feed an entire family of 7 people, which included a stack of 7 Belgian Blueberry Waffles, a large stack of 10 Pancakes covered with a hefty coating of Maple Syrup, a 10 inch wide bowl full of Ramen Noodles, and an enormous mug full of Chocolate Milk Milkshake. Overall, you could clearly see that your beloved Vanilla had quite the appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as you were drinking a cool swig of Orange Juice, revealing that your new home was currently located within the Akihabara Ward of Tokyo, Japan, which you could easily recognize from all of the neon light signs and colorful buildings in the distance. And judging from how high you were, your Penthouse Condo must be at least 14 Stories (140 feet) above street level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Gotta admit: This place looks quite beautiful from up here.\" You thought to yourself, taking another swig of Orange Juice in the process. However, it was then you heard the noticeable paw padded footsteps of the rotund Vanilla the Rabbit, as the Sumo-Sized lapine waddled her way down the flight of stairs, currently wearing the pink floral silk Yukata in a open unbuttoned fashion, which easily placed her large furry breasts and voluminous belly on full display. Upon noticing her mother coming down the stairs, Cream promptly dismounted herself from the couch, walked over toward Vanilla, and then hugged her mother's flabby abdomen as she gleefully said, \"Good morning, Mommy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* Good morning to you too, my dear Cream.\" Vanilla replied, as she rubbed the top of her daughter's head with a plump paw-like hand in a loving maternal manner. But then, Vanilla sniffed the air a little, picking up the sweet scent and aroma of a well-made breakfast, which caused her to lick her plump lips some in a sense of blissful delight. From there, Vanilla began to waddle her way toward the Dining Table, lightly rubbing her blubbery stomach with eager anticipation, as she then sat herself down in one of the wide reinforced chairs, where she spoke toward you and said, \"My, my, it seems that you've outdone yourself once again, my favorite Shefu (Chef). *giggle*\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*chuckle* What can I say? I aim to please, my dear Vanilla.\" You replied, as you then promptly delivered a tender kiss upon Vanilla's lips. From there, like a gluttonous beast, Vanilla began to voraciously devour the food in front of her, aiming for each course of food individually. First, she went after the stack of Belgian Blueberry Waffles, using a fork utensil to devour a decent amount of waffles per minute, savoring the taste of said waffles within her lapine mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had finished off the large stack of Belgian Blueberry Waffles, Vanilla went straight for the stack of syrup-coated Pancakes, not forgetting to use a fork and knife to devour the doughy flapjacks, along with tasting the Maple Syrup coating such Pancakes. But then, when she was halfway through the large stack of Pancakes, Vanilla altered her course, where she began to take a large swig from the mug full of Chocolate Milk Milkshake, savoring each gulp of chocolate goodness. </span></div></div>",

Were there other Sonic characters besides Vanilla and Cream here in the real world? How and why was Vanilla so fat? You know, THOSE kinds of questions! Nonetheless, you had to find out the answers to those questions yourself, and what better way than to ask the Sumo-Sized Vanilla the Rabbit herself. So, in an attempt not to arouse suspicion from the gorging lapine, you spoke toward Vanilla and asked, \"Say, Vanilla... Can I ask you something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Of course, Sweetie! You can ask me anything. So... What is it that you wanted to ask me? Vanilla replied, slurping a decent amount of Ramen Noodles into her hungry maw prior to speaking to you.

If you need help remembering, I can certainly help you on that part.\" Then, before she gave her explanation, Vanilla began to take a long sip from the mug full of Chocolate Milk Milkshake, which filled up her flabby belly some more with the cool thick brown liquid in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, in response to your question, Vanilla said that...</span></div></div>",

But while Sonic, Knuckles, Princess Sally, and many others fought valiantly against Robotnik's mechanized forces, Tails had developed a machine that could allow us to travel to other dimensions. With no other choice, we retreated through the portal, unaware that we would inevitably travel to your world, the planet Earth.\" Vanilla explained, as she was comforting Cream throughout her explanation to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the name Knothole Village became easily recognizable to you, as it was the safe haven used in the Sonic The Hedgehog (AKA Sonic SatAM) cartoon series. And yet, you distinctly remember that Vanilla, Cream, and Cheese weren't even created yet until the early 2000s, which you could only guess that the world that Vanilla came from was a hybridization between Sonic SatAM and the anime Sonic X. From there, Vanilla continued her explanation to you as she said, \"When Cream and I entered the portal, we got separated along the way to Earth. But when I landed in San Francisco... That was when I first met you, sweetie. You nursed me back to health and reunited me with my beloved Cream. And yet, you decided to help us fight against Robotnik, but before that final battle... You proposed to me, asked for my hand in marriage, in sickness and in health, till death do we part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you were very fortunate for such a clear explanation coming from the rotund lapine, you still had one more question still gnawing at you: How and why did Vanilla get so fat and bulky in the first place? So, in an attempt to receive such an answer from the obese rabbit, you spoke toward Vanilla and asked, \"Thanks, Vanilla. I appreciate the explanation. But still... Not to offend you, but... How did you become so, um...rotund? And why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh? You're wondering why I got so fat in the first place? *giggle* Oh, sweetie! You know I don't mind if you call me a Butterball. And besides...\" Vanilla replied, as she gave her flabby abdomen a few playful pats with a chubby paw-like hand, which obviously made you blush somewhat, especially since you were finding Vanilla to be very attractive with all that blubber and girth on her physique. Then, Vanilla finished her sentence and said, \"...I really like being at this size. After all, Cream seems to enjoy hugging my big belly quite often. Plus, you can give out the best belly rubs a girl like me can enjoy. *giggle*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Though, as for why I decided to get this big, well... Let's just say that a few months before you proposed to me, I discovered that you were quite the avid Fat Admirer. That you happened to be into women who are 500 to 600 pounds of obesity. *giggle* Oh, you were so adorably embarrassed when I found your FA Magazines underneath your bed. Anyway, since you were into those kinds of women, I decided to put some meat on my bones and bulk up... For your sake, of course.\" Vanilla explained, where she briefly took a short break, chowing down on the remaining Belgian Blueberry Waffles, then proceeded to guzzle down the remains of the Chocolate Milk Milkshake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Vanilla continued her explanation to you and explained, \"...Though, as for why I decided to become a Sumo Wrestler... It started when we were on our honeymoon in Tokyo, where you could say that I was \"inspired\" to become Japan's First Female Sumo Wrestler. Ever since I was publicly announced to become the first Female Yokozuna, I guess you could say that I inadvertently inspired an entirely new generation of Sumo Wrestlers, almost all of them being women.\"</span></div></div>",

The birds were singing outside your window and the sky never looked better; as you slowly come to. You lay there for a while enjoying the relative quiet, smiling a bit from the birds\u2019 singing.  Opening your eyes, you slowly lift yourself out of your bed, stretching your arms and letting out a long yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaaaah! Mmm\u2026 Slept so well last night,\u201d you mumble happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scratch your chest and smack your lips, looking around your room\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait\u2026 Something doesn\u2019t look right here\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, you realise that something is wrong. The room is different from what you knew, looking like an apartment in New York. The bedroom is simple, with a shelf full of books, as well as a TV with three different game stations and a DVD player attached to it, adorned with posters of female pop singers, films, and video games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you slowly continued to investigate the strange changes in the room, you soon saw a large lump taking up a large portion of your bed underneath your blanket. Then, you realize said lump is moving, breathing is more accurate. As you take a closer look, you can see that it's a person\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god\u2026 What sweet horror awaits me there,\u201d you nervously whispered to yourself. You carefully approach the blanket and slowly pull to reveal\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone other than the beautiful Interpol agent martial artist from China, Chun-Li, from the Street Fighter franchise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face immediately goes blank at what was revealed in front of you. The Street Fighter franchise was one of your favourite games of all time, and you certainly enjoyed playing games because not only were they fun, but, you had a humongous crush on the Chinese martial artist. And here she was, sleeping right next to you in your bed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow in\u2026 What in the-?!\u201d you stuttered, bewildered in all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, upon further inspection of the slumbering woman beside you, you couldn't help but notice one glaring difference: This version of Chun-Li was undoubtedly extremely overweight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChun-Li had a tremendous, flabby gut that hangs down over her wide, fleshy hips and extends out at least three feet. Her blubbery rump was large and as soft as a couch cushion; giving her a distinguished waddle when she walks. Her already thick legs were now ridiculously thicker than ever with fat, most likely rub together as she walks around. Her arms were thick and flabby, as were her breasts, large and massive as you imagined them to be at least Double F-Cup big, which looked to be barely contained in her huge blue bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t want to check if she was wearing a matching blue panty to go along with that bra, as you gently pull the blanket back over her.</div></span></div></div>",

One: Wait until the obese Chun Li finally awoken from her slumber. Or two: Quietly exit the bedroom and see if anything else in your home had been altered as well. Though, from your perspective, it would seem that the latter option was looking more and more plausible by the minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, you soon promptly (and quietly) made your way toward the doors leading out of the bedroom. Originally, they were once a single door, but with this drastic change of reality, it was altered into a wide set of double doors. Carefully, like something straight out of a certain horror movie that involved noise, you slowly turned the doorknobs at a snail's pace, momentarily looking back towards the bed where the rotund Street Fighter was sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a way, you couldn't help but blush at the sight, finding the now obese Chun Li to be quite adorable at her current size and weight, to which you gently walked out the opened doors and quietly closed them behind you, just to let her have some well-earned beauty sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, once you were outside of the room, you soon gained a true glimpse of what has become of your crummy one-person apartment suite.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Christmas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMostly known for it's festive yuletide celebrations and annual gift giving, most people would say that it is the most wonderful time of the year. Although you were known to be somewhat of a heavy sleeper by either your extended family or your closest friends, what you were about to wake up to was certainly qualified as a \"life-changer\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all started when you woke up around 9:00 am as usual. You casually stretched your arms outwards and emitted a loud yawn in the process, where you the proceeded to rub the sleep out of your eyes. However, when you lowered your left arm and hand onto the bed, instead of it landing on the bed mattress, your hand pressed against something very cushiony. \"...Huh? That's...weird.\" You thought to yourself, thinking you were probably pressing your hand against one of your pillows. But then, just as you were about to get out of bed to take a shower, you suddenly felt something padded and heavy violently pull you back down onto the bed. Obviously caught completely off-guard, you quickly investigated who or what exactly pulled you back into bed, as you turn your head to the left, only to see an unexpected surprise:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one who pulled you back into bed was, in fact, none other than the vengeful yet sadistic Tae Kwon Do martial artist from South Korea, Juri Han, from the Street Fighter franchise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of all the female Street Fighter characters that were on the roster, you always have heavily gravitated towards the vengeful but sadistic South Korean Juri Han. Why? Well, for one, you always found her to be a much more compelling character than the more heroic characters such as Chun-Li, Cammy, or Sakura. After all, who doesn't love an anti-heroine? And yet, despite being a more recent character added to the Street Fighter roster, you inevitably had developed a humongous crush on the Tae Kwon Do martial artist from South Korea. But here she was, sleeping right next to you in your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, upon further inspection of the slumbering woman beside you, you couldn't help but notice one glaring difference: This version of Juri Han was undoubtedly yet incredibly fat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, she didn't have her black hair styled into her iconic two horn-like bangs at the top of her head, which definitely made sleeping a lot easier for her. However, looking just below her head of hair, you could easily see how thick and chubby her face and neck were, as Juri now sported a puffy pair of chubby cherubic cheeks, along with a noticeably pronounced and blubbery double chin, complete with a bulky fatty neck. Looking ever downward, you noticed how big, large, and bulbous her breasts were now, easily a solid but undoubtedly huge Double F-Cup, which looked to be barely confined in a massive purple bra, as such bulky fat-laden mammaries laid leisurely against Juri Han's most prominent and fattest physical feature so far: Her blubbery spare tire that was her belly. Easily the size of a 16 year old teenager balled up into a fetal position, Juri's belly jutted outwards a decent 2 feet in thickness with a billowing pair of love handles and a easily noticeable muffintop, as her fat-laden abdomen behaved similarly to an adipose-coated apron, which splayed out over her private area and lap some, just as you noticed it being confined a little by an utterly massive but somewhat skimpy pair of purple panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you looked at Juri's second most prominent features: Her shockingly huge hips, butt, and legs. Easily 4 and a half feet in diameter, Juri's hips jutted outwards a good deal, as each of her blubbery buttcheeks were the same size and bulk as a couch cushion, which seemed to be swallowing up her purple panties little by little. Though as for her legs, Juri's thighs were easily the thickest parts of her burgeoning legs, as they now dwarfed even Chun-Li's world famous \"Thunder Thighs\" by a margin in terms of thickness, bulk, and sheer size. After all, each thigh had to be around 2 and a half feet in diameter if you had to wager a guess. Looking down toward the lower parts of her legs, they were easily just as bulky and fat, including a pair chubby feet wrapped in a pair of black Tae Kwon Do foot wrappings, which did little to conceal her plump toes and heels. Finally, you looked back up towards her arms, which appeared to be almost as thick and full of fatty adipose as her legs, complete with a set of pillowy doughy arms and chubby hands and fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, judging from how swift and violent her arm had moved earlier, you could only guess that there was most likely a good amount of muscle hidden underneath all that jiggly flab. Overall, if you had to estimate a guess as to how much Juri currently weighed, you had to estimate that she must have weighed around 500 to 600 pounds respectively. Yet still, this indeed raised many questions as to what exactly was going on here, so you decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>However, just as you cautiously lifted her thick blubbery arm off of you so you cloud get out of bed, Juri suddenly began to awaken from her slumber, looking right at you with a purple right eye and a turquoise left eye, which so happened to be her signature Feng Shui Engine. And yet, despite her overall weight and bulk, she moved with such shocking speed for someone of her girth, almost as if the excessive amounts of body fat didn't slow her down whatsoever, as she firmly clasped her plump hands around both of your wrists whilst she used her billowing fatty legs to straddle your legs, thus restraining you and holding you at her mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, she looked directly at you with quite the seductive grin on her cherubic face, which had a few hidden undertones of sadism behind such a flirtatious smile. Her eyes looking directly at your own as she playfully and teasingly said, \"Morning, lover boy!\" Then, she something completely unexpected coming from her: She leaned in closer to your face, and kissed you. On the lips. In all honesty, you weren't exactly expecting this to happen, given how notorious Juri Han was for being somewhat of a sadist. And yet, here she was, administering some French kissing upon your very lips, as she raised her ginormous fatty butt high into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInevitably, you couldn't help but return the favor, as you began to kiss her back, both your tongue and Juri's tongue intermingling and intertwining with one another in sexual pleasure. In response, you heard Juri yelp out a loud sexual moan, which made her shake her enormous blubbery ass from side to side with a sense of ecstatic joy, causing such a massive derri\u00e8re to jiggle and wobble wildly from such sexually-driven movement. Suffice to say, she was certainly enjoying this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, moments after giving such pleasuring romantic kisses, Juri then calmly but casually severed the French kissing, her obese body still shaking a little with sexual ecstasy, as she longingly stared at you, still retaining a firm enough grasp on your wrists with her chubby hands, then spoke toward you and said, \"Had fun last night, my little boy toy?\" Of course, you instinctively nodded your head in confirmation, obviously due to the fact that you legitimately don't remember having sex with an obese and corpulent Juri Han last night. \"Oh? Not so talkative today, are you (Name)?\" She curiously asked, undoubtedly noticing your silence, so you quickly came up with the best excuse you could come up with in such a short amount of time and answered, \"Oh! Um... Sorry 'bout that, Juri. I think I must've banged the back of my head last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you poor boy. Here, let me give you a big fat kiss.\" Juri replied, saying something almost completely out of character for someone like her, where she then administered a gentle loving kiss upon your forehead with her plump lips. Needless to say, this was something you completely and wholeheartedly did not expect coming from the vengeful yet sadistic Juri Han. After all, she would more likely sit on her your face with her utterly massive and fatty gluteus maximus than give you a tender loving kiss on the forehead. Shortly after kissing you on the forehead, Juri calmly spoke toward you with a loving tone in her voice and asked, \"Better?\" \"Better. Thanks, Juri!\" You replied, which seemed to have greatly reassure the blubbery South Korean woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, she calmly sat back up, slowly releasing her plump hands from your wrists, as said chubby hands soon found themselves cradling Juri's billowing flabby apron of a belly, all whist she still straddled your legs with her own. \"*giggle* Anytime, love. After all, what would I do if my most favorite chef was having a damn headache?\" She seductively answered, voluntarily making her enormous belly jiggle some with her tubby hands and digits, obviously finding loads of enjoyment out of having such a profoundly obese yet curvaceous physique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, out of nowhere, you suddenly heard this loud growling noise, which emanated from none other than Juri's own blubbery belly, as it began to excessively demand for food and sustenance. Of course, you could obviously see that Juri herself was giggling some from her stomach's explicit yet nonverbal demands, where she gently rubbed the sides of her billowing stomach and said, \"And speaking of food, it sounds like Mama Bear needs to feed her Cubs.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, just as Juri slowly but surely dismounted her hefty self off of you and the bed, you suddenly realized a shocking revelation: Juri wasn't just profoundly obese, she was, without a shred of doubt, pregnant! You could only wager a guess that she was pregnant with your kids, as you noticed Juri calmly but slowly walked toward the adjacent bathroom, noticing that she had a slight waddle in her step due to her own profound obesity. However, just as she was about to step inside the wide doorway to the bathroom, Juri looked back at you with a flirtatious and seductive but mildly irritated expression on her chubby face and said, \"...Well? Are you simply going to just sit there and stare at this fat pillowy ass of mine, or are you going to make me breakfast?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she pressed a right chubby hand against her blubbery right buttcheek in a seductive manner, you figured it would be best not to get on her bad side right now, especially if she is more than hungry enough to eat a full grown pig whole. So, you quickly dismounted yourself from the bed and rushed out of the bedroom to get started on cooking Juri a substantial breakfast for an individual of her size and girth. \"Hmm, that's what I thought, my little sexy chef.\" Juri smugly said to herself, as she then proceeded inside the spacious bathroom to get herself a nice warm shower.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile, from your side of the perspective, you swiftly exited the bedroom to make a substantial yet excessive amount of food for the corpulent Juri Han. However, instead of expecting to see you modest but familiar 2-bedroom apartment, you walked into what could only be described as a spacious 5-Star Penthouse! \"...What. The. Hell?!\" You thought to yourself, rendered completely in shock and awe in reaction to such a drastic yet unanticipated change in environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you regained your composure and picked up your metaphorically dropped jaw from the floor, you slowly and deliberately wandered around your lavish new penthouse, just to see what it had to offer and what has changed. In appearance, there were multiple rooms that adjacent to one another, unhindered from any signs of a single wall whatsoever. To your right upon entering the main area, there was a spacious Living Room, adorned with Birch hardwood flooring, as a metallic coffee table sat in front of a humongous leather couch, which you could only assumed to be heavily reinforced to support the blubbery weight of a certain obese martial artist from South Korea. From there, you also noticed a large entertainment center positioned opposite of the massive couch and coffee table, complete with a 120 inch Flatscreen TV, a PlayStation 4 Pro console, and a vast library of PS4 games placed in plexiglass cabinets nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully moving forward from the Living Room, you then noticed what appeared to be a custom-built personal Gymnasium approximately 18 feet away from the adjacent Living Room. As you approached closer to the open Gymnasium, you noticed how much Gym equipment there was and how neatly organized it was, ranging from 30 to 40 to even 50 pound dumbbells, a titanium-reinforced Salmon Ladder, to several pieces of equipment related to martial arts, including a man-sized punching bag held in place by a titanium post. Obviously, you soon realized that this was all of Juri's Gym equipment, which would explain to you how she still retained her physical strength, even with all of that excessive body mass on her. After all, you still distinctly remember how strong and vice-like her grip was on your wrists from earlier, even with such chubby hands and somewhat fattened fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, to your left, you then approached a welcoming yet spacious Kitchen slash Dining Room area. There were metal cabinets lined up along the wall, designed with a contemporary motif and style. Also, there appeared to be a large metallic sink the size of a small bathtub along the countertop, complete with a large set of stainless steel faucets perched just above the edge of the enormous sink. Opposite of the countertop, there was a large oval hardwood table, which seemed to have been reinforced to dandle the enormous amounts of food placed on it's surface, just you then noticed several chairs placed around the table , including one that was utterly massive in size and heavily reinforced to compensate for someone who was undoubtedly morbidly obese. However, what stuck out the most for you involving the Kitchen was that there were approximately not one, not two, but THREE refrigerators! The gray fridge to the right had your initials imprinted on the doors of the fridge, which obviously meant that this was your personal refrigerator. But the two larger adjacent black refrigerators on the other hand however, told a different story. Instead of initials, both of the black fridges had these humongous purple spider emblems emblazoned on their fronts. You had an instinctive gut feeling that those two massive refrigerators were undoubtedly Juri's, given from both the South Korean's rotund size and girth, as well as the fact that Juri's insignia happened to be none other than a spider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, your new penthouse was definitely a sight to behold, as you looked out of the plexiglass windows, only to see a splendid view of a snowy Times Square, which indicated that you were most definitely in New York City. But then, before you could even take in the grandiose sight before you, you suddenly heard Juri's voice, who was still currently in the bathroom, as she spoke toward you with a seductive but mildly annoyed sing-song tone and exclaimed, \"(Name)~! Why aren't I smelling the sexy aroma of foooood?! You better be working on making me my breakfast, you beautiful bastard! Unless you want to receive my big fatty ass and thunder thighs for Christmas presents!?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously having a feeling that getting sat on by a blubbery obese Juri Han seemed like a bad idea in and of itself, you quickly hauled ass and went to work on making a humongous Christmas breakfast for the obese and rotund Juri, almost as if you were on autopilot.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>But whilst you were swiftly prepping an excessively large slew of delicious high-calorie delicacies for the obese rotund South Korean, your entire body seemed to have shifted into autopilot, as you began to experience several livid memories in vivid detail. It was almost as if reality itself was giving you a long heavily descriptive recap as to what exactly had transpired between you and Juri that led you to her current state of size and girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first memory started during what appeared to be Juri's Arcade Mode Ending, since Juri happened to be dressed up in her signature outfit from Street Fighter IV. Upon further examination of the memory, both you and Juri stood over the beaten and battered bodies of the antagonistic M. Bison and Seth, the two head honchos of the mysterious and enigmatic Shadaloo organization. Struggling with all of the remaining strength he could still muster in his broken form, Seth looked up at Juri and said, \"*wheeze* Are you...satisfied?\" Judging from her appearance and physique shown in the dimly lit room, Juri was currently at her original size when she first debuted in Street Fighter IV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you looked at her, she displayed a curious look on her slender face, tilting her head slightly to the right, just as Seth looked up at Juri with a spiteful expression on his pale bald face and blank eyes as he growled, \"You witch... I knew all along that you had no intention of following my orders. I was well aware of your impending betrayal.\" \"Ha ha! You're giving yourself way too much credit, Seth.\" Juri sarcastically quipped, placing a fingerless gloved hand on her hip. However, what deviated this memory from Juri's Arcade Ending in Street Fighter IV besides you being there, was the brief moment where Juri looked at you with a flirtatious look in her eyes for a second or two before returning her gaze towards the crippled Seth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*bloody cough* You... You think you've won, but I will eventually regain my strength. *bloody cough* And when I do, *bloody cough* I will make you both wish I have given you a swift clean death! *bloody cough and wheeze*\" Seth yelled, speaking through the artificial blood slowly foaming inside his own mouth. Obviously, the words he just said definitely weren't in Juri's Arcade Ending, just as both you and Juri seemed completely unfazed by such death threats coming from the bloodied and beaten Shadaloo leader, where Juri then spoke toward Seth with a sadistic yet satisfied tone in her voice and replied, \"Ha ha! Is that the best threat you could come up with, Sethie? A slow, agonizing death and the promise of personal retribution?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though it was merely a memory, you couldn't help but admire Juri's wholehearted yet tenacious sense of bravery and courage against such death threats, which undoubtedly explained why you like her so much: Juri Han simply doesn't give a damn about people threatening her, for she simply just laughs at death itself. From there, it was there you heard yourself spoke toward Seth, your arms crossed in a smug fashion as you explained, \"And besides, Seth: Defeating you was merely nothing but an added bonus for us. Juri and I wanted to just simply pit you and your fellow dumbass, M. Bison, against each other while we took over.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Face it, Sethie: You might claim yourself to be a god among men with that fancy Tanden Engine of yours...\" Juri smugly quipped, where she then casually leaned down to whisper into Seth's left ear and sadistically retorted, \"...You're merely nothing but a spare body - a change of clothes in Bison's wardrobe.\" Once she leaned back upright alongside you, the expression on Seth's pale bald face transitioned from painfully frustrated to downright enraged, as he began to his raise his bruised left arm upwards, gritting and snarling his teeth as he roared, \"You'll... PAAAAAYY!!!!\" Despite his outrage, Seth's threatening words fell on deaf ears, as both you and Juri simultaneously delivered a swift punting kick towards the crippled Seth, violently knocking him onto his back and incapacitating him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sayonara, Seth!\" You exclaimed, where both you and Juri simultaneously delivered a pair of powerful Axe Heel kicks down upon Seth's body, with your Axe kick slamming into Seth's neck, outright devastating his throat and fatally severing both his neck and upper spine in two. On the other hand, Juri had downright obliterated Seth's Tanden Engine, which was located at his abdomen, as you witnessed as Seth's main source of physical power had caved in upon impact with Juri's Axe Kick. In the end though, the simultaneous attack from both you and Juri was undoubtedly fatal, as Seth's body laid there lifeless on the cold metal floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*satisfied sigh* Goddamn, that felt soooo f*cking satisfying!\" Juri explicitly said, as she pulled her right foot out of what little remained of Seth's Tanden Engine, loudly expressing her vengeful satisfaction towards snuffing the life of one of the two leaders responsible for the death of her parents, as well as damaging her left eye when she was little. \"Well, I'm glad to see you satisfied, my dear Juri.\" You replied, feeling glad to see Juri so definitively satisfied in killing one of the two leaders of Shadaloo. From there, you witnessed as Juri then turned to face you, where she then wrapped her lithe arms around you, looking at you with a relieved but flirtatious expression on her slender face and answered, \"*giggle* You and me both, lover boy.\" Seconds later, both you and Juri then began to kiss one another, tongues intertwining and dancing with one another in passionate and sexual romance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, you and Juri reluctantly severed the passionate love-making between the two of you, as you both then focused on the current matter at hand: What to do with the incapacitated leader of Shadaloo, M. Bison. As both you and Juri calmly approached the unconscious M.Bison, Juri spoke toward you and asked, \"So, (Name), any ideas on what we should do with the sleeping Bison here?\" \"...Well, it was a major pain in the ass, but I managed to convince that Interpol Inspector, Chun-Li, that if we brought M. Bison to her in handcuffs, she'll stop attempting to arrest us like criminals and leave us be.\" You explained, as you then placed M. Bison's wrists in a very sturdy but special pair of handcuffs, which were designed to negate M. Bison's devastating powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh! Well look at you, you have this all planned out, don't you lover boy?\" Juri replied, obviously somewhat impressed by your planning at this point. \"What can I say, Juri? I want us to have a life together, no longer on the run from the likes of Shadaloo and S.I.N, no longer having to look over our shoulders every time we go out in public.\" You answered, as you and Juri heaved M. Bison's unconscious form onto a nearby gurney for easier transportation, as you and Juri wheeled out M. Bison past dozens of unconscious Shadaloo soldiers, where Juri then spoke toward you with an unexpectedly honest tone of voice and replied, \"*sigh* I guess you're right, (Name). Then again, now that we're no longer on the run, I guess I'll need to find myself a new hobby other than beating up Shadaloo goons. And I'm sure you know what I mean by \"hobby\", lover boy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as she gave you a flirtatious wink at you, you soon realize what Juri meant by \"hobby\", just as this memory ended and a new one began, which essentially came in the form of...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Moments later, you were now transitioned into another memory, which revealed that you and Juri were now currently inside a fancy restaurant, known as \"McAngus's Buffet &amp; Grille\". From what you could from your environment, this had to have taken place some time after you and Juri Han delivered an incapacitated M. Bison to Inspector Chun-Li and Interpol on a silver platter, pun intended of course. However, other than the restaurant itself, the only other distinguishing factor presented before you was, in fact, Juri Han herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn physical appearance, gone was her original yet highly athletic size and physique, for she appeared to have put on a decent amount of weight and fat on her formerly lithe form, undoubtedly indicating that a few months have passed since delivering M. Bison to Interpol in handcuffs. Her face, once tight and slender, had healthily rounded out, complete with somewhat fuller facial cheeks, as well as developing the beginnings of a double chin. Below her neck, Juri's breasts had noticeably grown in both size and volume, billowing from a modest Double C-Cup to a bulbous Triple D-Cup, as such mammaries heaved and jiggled lightly in a slightly strained bra, hidden underneath a purple dress tanktop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, said formal tanktop did little to even conceal Juri's largest physical feature: Her blubbery potbelly and muffintop. Once bearing nothing but chiseled abdominal muscle, it was nowadays coated in nothing but raw unadulterated adipose, as it pooched outwards by a good foot and a half in thickness, whilst it began to droop over her lap little by little with each delicious but high-calorie delicacy the South Korean thruster down her eager, voracious, and gluttonous gullet. Her arms, once filled to the brim with lithe but powerful muscles, now said muscles were well hidden under a thin layer of adipose, as Juri used them to grab handful after handful of chicken wings and drumsticks smothered in spicy barbecue sauce. After all, knowing her, she personally preferred to have her food being very spicy in both taste and flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking below her still-growing belly behind the table, Juri was currently wearing a large yet noticeably snug pair of white sweatpants, which did little to conceal her soccer ball-sized buttcheeks and developing thunder thighs. Her hips were easily just as fat as the rest of her, as they jutted outwards in an estimated 2 and a half feet in diameter. Overall, judging from her physical appearance and current body mass within the memory, you could see that Juri wasn't exactly at the gargantuan size she was today, but she was certainly almost at the halfway point, taking a guess that she had to be at least 250 to 300 pounds in weight, as you continued to witness her vicious and relentless assault upon the torso-sized platter of spicy chicken wings and drumsticks whilst you slowly ate what appeared to be an 8 ounce Sirloin Steak cooked to a fine and chewy Medium Rare, as well as drinking an ice cold glass of Sprite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, whilst you watched Juri devouring handful after handful of fried spicy poultry limbs, you noticed how several nearby restaurant attendees and staff couldn't help themselves but stare at the bewildering sight that was the overweight Juri Han, most gawking with utter disbelief at how her plump stomach wasn't bursting at this point with all that food, some attempting and failing to ignore the gluttonous spectacle before them, and others filming Juri's relentless binging with their smartphones and posting it on either Facebook, Twitter, or even YouTube. Suffice to say, Juri's newly formed and developing gluttony was certainly garnering a lot of attention, some good, some bad, but overall mixed and divided in opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the unnecessary amounts of attention from the nearby restaurant patrons, you looked at Juri as she casually swigged down all of the chewed up meat still remaining within her mouth with a extra large glass mug of Coca-Cola, where you then calmly spoke toward her and said, \"Um, Juri? Not to get on your bad side or anything, but... Would you mind if you toned it down some on the way you're eating? Some of the people here think you're acting more like a slobby pig than a person.\" Of course, in response to your suggestion, Juri soon finished drinking a good portion of Coca-Cola, as she firmly slammed the mug onto the table surface with an audible thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, she wiped some of the spicy barbecue sauce from her slightly chubby face with a plump arm, giving you a smug yet flirtatious grin on her lips and sarcastically remarked, \"Aww, what's the matter, lover boy? Not a fan of me being a piggy? After all, you absolutely crave women like me with a big fat belly on them.\" Obviously, she made a rather valid point, as Juri then swiftly grabbed the sides of her plump potbelly with both hands, and began to jiggle it wildly in an attempt to entice you, despite the fact that it was still currently digesting all of those chewed up wings and drumsticks she had recently devoured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it did make you blush some, but it wasn't enough to make you incredibly lustful, as you then spoke toward Juri and answered, \"I'm not trying to discourage you from getting any fatter, sweetie. I'm just reminding you to behave a little more while we're in public. After all, the last time you behaved this, we both got kicked out of that Chinese Buffet restaurant, So Ming's, in Chinatown. Remember?\" In response to what you said, Juri uncharacteristically shuddered a little from remembering such a precarious moment, especially since she went a little too overboard on stuffing herself to nearly bursting, which resulted in her unintentionally vomiting on a few customers due to her regurgitating some of the food in order to properly digest her stomach's contents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah, good point.\" Juri reluctantly replied, where she then exhaled an audible burp to release some gas built up in her stomach before resuming her gluttonous assault on the spicy wings and drumsticks with ravenous gusto. However, you soon looked down into your pocket and pulled out a small box, where you opened it up to reveal an engagement ring, which made you soon realize that this was the memory where you were going to ask for Juri's hand in marriage! From there, you began to calmly speak toward Juri and said, \"Juri... We've been through a lot of shit this past year, some good, some bad, and we have been through thick and thin against both Shadaloo and S.I.N wherever we went, from Paris to Osaka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecoming somewhat confused as to what you were talking about, Juri had instantly ceased on her ravenous binging, looking at you with a confused expression on her mildly chubby face, swallowing what remained of the wings or drumsticks she was devouring, where she then spoke toward you with a questioning tone of voice and said, \"...(Name)? What the hell are you blathering on about? You're not exactly the type who contemplates on past events.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My point is, Juri... Is that I had to build up the courage to give you this.\" You answered, where you then placed the ring box on the table in front of Juri, revealing quite the beautiful purple double diamond ring to her. Of course, Juri was completely taken by surprise from such a bold yet unexpected move from you, her mind processing what just happened, as you then continued to speak to the chubby Juri and said, \"I know that this has to be the most overrated thing I can pull out of my ass, but... I love you, Juri. I've loved you from the moment I laid my eyes on you. We've been used as pawns by M. Bison and Seth until we've beaten them and freed ourselves, and I want to spend the rest of my days with you. And you alone. Juri Han... Will you marry me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Juri was rendered speechless from such a revelation, her sadistic mind not prepared for such a life-changing proposal. However, slowly but surely, that cold steel heart of hers began to melt away, tears welling up in her mismatched eyes, all of those happy memories of being close to someone she cared about, resurfacing in her subconscious, which all climaxed into a certain fluid form of movement: Juri lunged at you, wrapping her plump arms around you, where she then planted her slightly chubby face into your chest, weeping out mixed emotions of joy and sorrow. She weeped for the sorrow of losing her parents, since was unable to properly mourn them when she was young. And yet, she was crying tears of raw joy for finding love with you, knowing that she can now move on with her life. In the end though, she uttered, \"Yes... *sob* Yes, I'll marry you, you beautiful son of a bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after that, you soon found yourself in another memory, which presented itself in the form of...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next memory you began to experience was of you inside of what appeared to be a church of sorts. However, judging from the varied amounts of Bhuddist symbolism scattered around the spacious yet religious interior, you had to wager a guess that you were most likely in a South Korean church. But on the other hand, you looked down and saw that you were currently wearing a fancy black tuxedo with a red dress shirt and a black tie, as you stood by the altar alongside a South Korean priest, as well as some of your best friends standing beside you as your Best Men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you soon inevitably realized that this was undoubtedly the day of you and Juri's wedding, as one of your friends, Colton Hayes, spoke into your ear and whispered, \"You feeling nervous, (Name)?\" \"...Kind of. Then again, I've been looking forward to this moment for a long time, Colton.\" You whispered back, just as some of Juri's relatives took their seats on the right side of the lane, while your own family and relatives sat in the row of seats on the left side of the lane. And speaking of individuals on the right side of the lane, you couldn't help but notice something particularly unexpected: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere stood the two least likely individuals to attend Juri's wedding, given the inhospitable relationship between them and Juri Han: Chun-Li and Cammy. In appearance, both women were wearing what appeared to be bridesmaid gowns, with Chun-Li wearing a blue bridesmaid gown, while Cammy wore a green and brown camo bridesmaid gown. Overall, you were definitely not expecting those two to even attend Juri's own wedding as her bridesmaids, given the tumultuous and somewhat complicated history between the three of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before you could even contemplate any further, the room suddenly echoed with the organ pianist playing \"Here Comes The Bride\", which caused everyone in the church interior, including you, to turn their collective heads toward the main church doors. From there, they slowly but surely opened, as three Flower Girls appeared in a single file line, tossing petals of Cherry Blossoms along both sides whilst they walked down the aisle. But following just a few yards away from the Flower Girls, was none other than the rotund bride herself, Juri Han. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, she was now currently the same size and girth as she is in present day, wearing what appeared to be an utterly massive light purple kimono with a white sash tied around her wide burgeoning waist, with her black hair all fancied up in a womanly top knot, as she casually waddled down the aisle, bearing an embarrassed blush on her plump cheeks, given how \"Dolled Up\" she was now. However, due to both of her parents being long past deceased, she had her slightly younger sister, Ming Han, walk her down the aisle in place of her late parents. Fortunately, despite the immense amount of weight she now bore underneath the regal mauve kimono, Juri still kept a decent enough stride toward the wedding altar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she made it to the altar, the organist ceased playing the massive instrument, where both you and Juri faced one another, just as the South Korean priest began to address the masses gathered in the church and said, \"...Ladies and Gentlemen! We are gathered here to celebrate the loving and cherished union between these two individuals. One, an American. The other, one of the many daughters of our beloved South Korea. If there is anyone who is willing to openly oppose such a wondrous union between these two star-crossed lovers, Please, Speak now! Or forever hold your peace.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there was not a single individual who spoke openly against the marriage between you and Juri, as a few moments later, the priest had you and Juri extend out your left arms, as you gently grabbed Juri's plump left hand. From there, the priest carefully and deliberately wrapped a lengthy white silk cloth around both your arm and Juri's chubby arm, as the silk cloth symbolized the bonds of marriage, where the priest kept the cloth wrapped tightly around both arms, then spoke toward you and asked, \"(Full Name), do you willingly and wholeheartedly take Juri Han as your loving wedded wife? In sickness and in health, for better or worse, till death do you part?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do.\" You firmly answered, not wavering from what you already know and feel: That you love Juri Han. From there, the priest then turned his head to look at the obese Juri Han and said, \"And you, Juri Han... Do you willingly and wholeheartedly take (Full Name) as your loving wedded husband? In sickness and in health, for better or worse, till death do you part?\" \"Hmph! You know the answer by now, Priest: I. Do.\" Juri casually remarked, despite her chubby round cheeks telling a different story, using her smug demeanor like a flawed mask to hide and conceal her true emotions brandished on her cherubic cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, the priest then placed a pair of wedding rings on both you and Juri's left ring fingers, even though Juri required a slightly larger ring to fit on her slightly plump fingers. \"Now, by the grace and powers of both the heavens and the earth, I formally pronounce you husband and wife.\" The priest declared, where he then loosened the silk cloth and seamlessly pulled it of of you and Juri's arms, which made both you and Juri smile as the priest then said, \"You may now kiss the bride.\" Of course, Juri was eagerly waiting to get to the best part, where despite the ludicrous amounts of cellulite she had willingly packed onto her physique, she was surprisingly still as strong or potentially stronger than ever, as Juri swiftly pulled you in for that passionate kiss with her chubby arms with a shocking amount of ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, once more, you found yourself experiencing another memory of you and Juri, which came in the form of...</span></div></div>",

While your mind was off reminiscing past events, your body was hard at work preparing probably the most mouth-watering breakfast anyone has ever laid their eyes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwelve fluffy pancakes covered heavily in maple syrup, dozen fried eggs, several strips of delicious looking bacon, strawberries and blueberries covered in cream and a nice big glass of what seemed to be a chocolate milkshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa\u2026\u201d You whispered softly in awe. \u201cI made all of this?\u201d Juri wasn't kidding about you being her top chef. You weren't quite sure where this extraordinary skill came from, whether from this reality or something you were never aware in your previous life, but before you continue wandering on this-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh (Name)! Breakfast better be ready or else~!\u201d Juri shouted from the bedroom, as you heard some heavy thuds approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a confident smile at your work and reply, \u201cTrust me, it's ready!

Her purple dudou, (with no spider attachment), could barely contain her massive bosom being rather tight around her top, her voluminous apron sized belly was on full display as it jiggled against her thick legs with each step and her off-white coloured sweatpants were hugging her legs closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a moment to admire how she looked, somehow Juri looked even more stunning than she did before in bed. Plus, seeing all that weight of hers filling in all the right places was definitely making you feel aroused at her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, where's breakfast?\u201d Juri asked, licking her plump licks with her tongue in a sly mischievous manner.</div></span></div></div>",

Well look at you, lover boy: Being a gentleman for a big girl like me.\" In response to your compassionate act of chivalry, Juri firmly planted a kiss upon your lips, where she then sat down in the reinforced chair, which made it emit a mild creaking noise in response to Juri's massive frame, who seemed to be relishing in her blubbery size and girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, due to her enormous stature, Juri nowadays had to spread her thick padded legs outwards some to accommodate for her blubbery paunch of a belly, where you then gently pushed her chair a little closer to the table while still allowing her belly some room to grow and expand as she ate. From there, you walked over to a chair positioned a little to her right, as you took a plate full of omelets and a few strips of bacon as your breakfast, thus leaving the rest of the food to be voraciously devoured by the quarter-ton Juri Han. Once she took the first bite into a stack of pancakes, Juri had this ecstatic yet sexually pleasured expression on her chubby face, letting out an audible sexual moan in the process, where she then began her assault upon the metropolis of breakfast food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you became somewhat familiar with Juri's relentless binging thanks to you experiencing those vivid memories of her, it was still quite a shocking spectacle to witness such a gluttonous rampage first-hand, as you calmly cut up one of the omelets and ate one of the pieces, your eyes still vividly trained on the corpulent Juri Han and her gluttonous devouring of food. Suffice to say, this was certainly a sight you had to become accustomed to every day, just as Juri momentarily stopped her assault on the food metropolis, only to guzzle down a good portion of the chocolate milkshake, swigging all of that chewed up delicacies down her gullet and into her waiting stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she soon but inevitably became aware of you staring at her slowly expanding spare tire of an apron belly, prompting her to lay the 1 gallon mug full of chocolate milkshake back down onto the table with an audible clack. From there, she looked at you with a sly mischievous smirk on her cherubic face, her mismatched eyes trained on you, where she then began to grope and jiggle her large belly with her plump hands in an enticing manner, while she spoke toward you with a flirtatious yet mischievous tone in her voice and said, \"Ooh? Does somebody like what he sees?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for Juri, the self groping and jiggling of her own flabby paunch was certainly enticing a response from you, causing your chiseled cheeks to blush a crimson hue, along with your manhood pressing against your pants, where Juri then swiftly grabbed you by your left arm, pressing your hand against the side of her flabby apron belly, just as you then felt one or two kicks from inside the obese South Korean's abdomen, which undoubtedly confirmed the legitimacy of Juri Han being pregnant. Moments later, Juri snapped you out of your sexually driven daze, where she then spoke toward you with a flirtatious and seductive tone of voice as she retorted, \"...Well, don't just stand there gawking at this big fat belly of mine, (Name): Feed me like we're in a goddamn porno!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from her words, she seemed to be the slightly more dominant individual in this relationship, as you willing did what she asked of you and began to personally feed her yourself, keeping yourself at a moderate enough pace to allow Juri to properly devour each and every delicious morsel of food that came within close proximity of her hungry maw. First came the pancakes, as Juri gluttonously devoured bite after bite of maple syrup-coated flapjacks with voracious yet greedy gusto, demolishing the tall flapjack skyscrapers with little to no effort, not even breaking a single drop of sweat on her brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the two dozen fried eggs, which didn't even put up much resistance against the blubbery Juri Han, as you casually fed her morsel after morsel of fried eggs at a relatively steady pace. Last and certainly not the least, came the large strips of greasy bacon, just as Juri utterly devastated the grilled meaty delicacies, while you easily hand fed her such edibles. Finally, when it was all said and done, Juri had completely annihilated the edible metropolis laid out before her, which resulted in her being...</span></div></div>",

How she was able to eat a large meal in such a short time and how delightful she looked, it was a clear insight that she was done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was true\u2026 partially, because soon as you were about to walk towards the sink with the dirty dishes\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, (Name),\u201d Juri spoke out suddenly, \u201cWhat\u2019s for dessert?

Plus, the way she ate breakfast was absolutely wonderful from your perspective. Placing the gathered dirty plates by the sink, you wander over towards the fridge to see what was available for dessert inside. Luckily you quickly found a huge looking chocolate cake that was layered with thick frosting and white sprinkles on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on lover boy! I haven\u2019t got all day!\u201d Juri commanded impatiently from her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManaging to heave the cake out of the fridge with your strength, you carefully carry the dessert towards the table, where Juri just took one look at it and was already drooling with glee from the sight of the sugary treat. You place the cake in front of her and said with happiness, \u201cHere you go, babe, dig in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her plump lips, Juri couldn\u2019t wait to dig into the cake when she suddenly stopped in her tracks and turned back at you with that charming seductive grin of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 anything wrong?\u201d you asked in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a moment hesitation, Juri grabs your arms and shoves them deep into the cake, your hands buried deep within the cold frosty bread, catching you by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said feed me like we\u2019re in a porno, so, let\u2019s gooo~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching on to what she meant, you immediately agree to her sweet gesture/demand and start hand feeding her big chunks of the cake with your cake covered hands.

You're one hell of a Chef, (Name). After all, who else would've been so willing and charismatic enough to fatten me up like a f*cking prized pig?\" Juri quipped, easily relishing in how bloated and utterly stuffed she had now become, displaying a pleasured grin on her plump face, whilst letting out a sadistic giggle in the process. Of course, she couldn't help but pull you in for another kiss, where you then spoke to her and said, \"...Well, as much as I really want to continue making out with you, Juri, I need to get myself washed up. After all, my family's coming over to visit us for Christmas.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, as much as she wanted to continue making passionate, sexually charged love with you right here and now, Juri had little choice but to comply with you regarding today's festivities, huffing out a reluctant sigh and crossing her plump but concealed muscular arms as she replied, \"...Alright, fine! You make a good point. Might as well wash off some of this cake batter and frosting off of me then.\" Now in agreement, you strolled off toward the bathroom, while Juri groggily stood up onto her two plump feet and began to lightly wash her skin clean of any remaining cake stains with a wet dishrag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, once you entered into your bedroom, you noticed how much it has changed as well, complete with a massively reinforced King-sized bed, with a large Flatscreen TV mounted on a wall opposite of the humongous bed. From there, you approached the bathroom, which was considerably as large as an apartment, complete with a sheerly massive jacuzzi hot tub and a shower stall the size of two SUVs parked side by side, as two large shower faucet heads jutted out on opposite sides of the spacious stall. Suffice to say, this had to be quite the expensive penthouse.

Your arms were beefy, your once flat belly was stacked with a killer six-pack, you had strong thick thighs and legs. You were the very definition of a male bodybuilder. You leaned in closer to the sink and kept staring back at your own reflection; amazed how you only noticed this now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow the hell did I not see this?\u201d you whispered softly, as you flexed your arms and moved your fingers about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, you remembered in one of your new memories, how you and Juri managed to defeat Seth with a very powerful ax-kick. Slowly starting to understand how all of this was made possible, you couldn\u2019t help but chuckle evilly from recollecting that moment. Seth was a real pain to deal with whenever you were playing Street Fighter IV.  How fast his reaction and inputs were, how many times you had to continue after he stomped you badly. It ruined your fun and especially when you were playing as Juri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemorizing all her inputs and tricks, in awe of her strong kicks and how her body moved in the game, only to be beaten by a cheating CPU. Always did sadden you when you saw Juri in stress during the continue screens. It kinda made you feel like you let her down by such humiliating defeats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was truly satisfying to him defeated afterward though. And the fact you beat him in person with your favourite fighter and now wife; it was like you had won the lottery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...\u201d As you snapped back to reality. \u201cDoes that mean I also know Tae Kwon Do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you backed away from the mirror to see if you could, there was one last thing you wanted to check on your changed body. Grinning goofily, you pull out your pants to take a peak down to see your groin, only to make your eyes widen at what you saw\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHOLY SHIT!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!

The top of your head is now covered in curly, platinum blonde hair that flows down in waves behind you. Fat cheeks, a pair of plump lips, and a set of chins similar to your wife's define your feminine face. Your gaze doesn't stay long on your face, however as you can't help but ogle your supersized sweater puppies.  As a former man, you don't really know much about cup sizes but you can tell that your rack is larger than your wife's by a decent amount.  They were spilling over, and under, the cups of a massive purple bra. Your head throbs painfully as you suddenly remember that its not your bra but Juri's. The odd memory flashes in your mind, you see your GG cup tits swaying freely atop your upper belly fold, bingo wings quivering slightly, as you dug through your dresser for a clean bra. Your search was futile and did little more than work you up into a hunger. After grabbing a quick, but sizeable, snack you just sucked up your pride and forced your obviously fatter tits into one of Juri's 'just in case' bra. She started to buy a few pairs of larger lingerie and clothing after you both married. A way to keep her clothed as she waited for the inevitable new orders of clothes to arrive. You make a mental note to start doing the same as you let your eyes wander to the pale folds of blubber that shelved your womanly mounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour belly was just a little smaller than Juri's and was shaped into more of a double belly shape than your pregnant wife's low hanging, and pregnancy, distorted spare tire. The lower fold of its expanse hung maybe a quarter of the way down your thighs, just covering your womanhood, while your wife's hung mid-thigh level easily. Gone was any trace of a  life dedicated to fitness. Another throb of your head bringing memories of how you, a spy in the service of Bison, had never had to exercise much to keep your trim physique. The throbbing bringing memories of a much thinner, feminine you next to Juri through all the key moments of your relationship with her. You slowly recalled how fat you were getting alongside your wife. Juri always a bit heavier, a bit fatter, as you recall how you were sporting the first wedding dress that Juri had picked out after she had outgrown it. The throbbing subsiding as your mind accepted its new reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your body a little to give yourself a better view of what you already know is your second best feature. A glimpse of dark black fabric, not much in width,  cutting into a pair of widely flared, cellulite filled hips whose flare was a bit more pronounced than Juri's. They wrapped seamlessly into the cellulite depressed ass cheeks that appeared a good inch or two thicker than your wife's bench straining cheeks. Your panties were engulfed deep in your butt crack leaving only a black triangle visible at the top of your lower back.  Your legs were every bit as wide as your lover's and every bit as fat. Obviously, you were slightly more of an hourglass kinda gal. You playfully slap one of your ass cheeks and watch it wobble. Your reverie breaking only when you hear Juri calling out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't get stuck again did you, (name)? I told you those last 30 lbs went to that fat ass of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A tingling feels your head for a few seconds as you hear Juri sigh quite loudly from the kitchen. You are at a lost for words as you hear loud thudding from the kitchen to the bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm ripped!\" You thought to yourself, taken aback a little by how muscular you now were, complete with ripped bulging biceps, pectoral muscles, and an impressive pair of 8-pack abs. Suffice to say, you certainly didn't expect to wake up today to see yourself ripped with muscles, that's for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, upon further inspection, you soon discovered what appeared to be some sort of bar code tattoo located on your right shoulder. Upon closer examination, you could easily read out the identification code on the bar code tattoo: PDS - 0217. Although you were completely unsure where exactly you got this type of tattoo from, but in the back of your mind, it seemed strangely...familiar to you. But suddenly, once you began physically touch the bar code tattoo, you began to reel back some in a sense of mental pain, almost as if you were experiencing a mental relapse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you soon began to experience some new memories once again. Only this time however, these new sets of memories appeared to be more...malicious, excruciating, and painful than you previously expected, as you began to vividly experience what appeared to be you being experimented on when you were just 15 years of age, with M. Bison himself witnessing the experiment performed on you, whilst you watched as your body was injected with some form of dark essence by several needles across your body, which were wielded by a few scientists in while Shadaloo hazmat suits and oxygen masks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, once the painful memory subsided, your sight soon returned to present day, only to come upon a startling revelation standing before you in your reflection: You possessed one of the most dangerous Powers in the entire Street Fighter franchise, known only as... The Satsui no Hado. The \"Surge of Murderous Intent\". This was the exact same dark power that turns Street Fighter poster boy, Ryu, into a darker, more violent version of himself known as \"Evil Ryu\". It was a form of ki based around Man's evil nature, and grants the user greatly increased speed, power, and sheer ferocity, and grants the user access to the most fatal Ansatsuken technique, known only as \"The Raging Demon\", which is notoriously used by none other than Akuma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you looked at your reflection in the mirror, you noticed that your hair had turned a bloody red, your eyes a malevolent purple hue with black sclera, and your canine teeth becoming akin to fangs, all whilst your body was surrounded in a bloody red fiery aura. All of the classic tell-tale signs of someone who can use the dark and deadly Satsui no Hado. However, a few moments later, you soon realize what the most recent memory you had just experienced was all about: M. Bison had experimented on you in an attempt to successfully fuse the power of the Satsui no Hado to a test subject, weaponizing them and turning the person into a living destructive weapon!</span></div></div>",

Cracking one eye open, you looked over for the clock on your bedside table. It wasn\u2019t there, and you briefly thought about having to get a new one if it broken when you knocked it off the table.

For the most part your view of the outside consisted of a lovely shot of the brick wall across the alleyway, though rarely you could get a brief shot of the sun reelecting off of a window a few floors above your own. Now though, the view wasn\u2019t anything really spectacular, but it was certainly better than what you had before. Your eye next caught on an odd furry lump; was that a partially burned beaver sitting on a skateboard?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMornin\u2019 puddin\u2019, I was starting ta wonder if you were going to sleep the whole day away,\u201d a feminine voice called out, breaking you out of your thoughts about the room and the beaver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned; you had gone to sleep alone, you were sure of that, so who\u2026Your wild wondering was cut off as you turned to look. It had to be a dream, but pinching yourself didn\u2019t seem to dispel what you were seeing. There was a woman standing in the door to what seemed to be the bathroom. Part of your mind was stuck on her odd appearance: her skin was pale, unnaturally pale, and her hair was split down the middle, one half a deep blue while the other was a vibrant red. Her blue eyes twinkled while her plump pink lips were curled in a grin. It could only be\u2026but it couldn\u2019t, but there she was: Harleen Quinzel aka Harley Quinn, looking like she stepped right out of the pages of a comic book. Well not quite, there was one small difference: namely that the Harley Quinn standing in the doorway looked to be tipping the scales somewhere past five hundred pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was clad in only a relatively tiny towel that did little to hide almost any of her body. Her hair was damp and clung around her rounded face and neck. The thick collar of fat surrounding her neck flowed into curved shoulders that arched into flabby arms that pooled together at the slightest bend. Her already substantial breasts had ballooned out into twin blimps that rested atop her enormous gut. That stomach was a great pale fleshy blob that extended out well beyond her reach and sagged under its own weight. It reached almost halfway to her knees, though even with that obstruction you could tell that her hips and thighs were wide enough that you couldn\u2019t wrap your arms around one and meet on the other side. The formerly pert and shapely rump she possessed had blown up into what had to be chair crushing girth; you could easily see a portion of it despite the fact that she was facing towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a laugh breaking the trance she had you under, though you couldn\u2019t help staring, she was utterly beautiful in your opinion. \u201cGood ta see that I can still knock ya dead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to the bed, her elephantine form jiggling and wobbling with each step, and stopped right next to you. She leaned down \u2013 partially burying you in her warm flesh \u2013and gave you a kiss; while you were distracted she slipped a hand beneath the covers.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>However, just as things between you and the substantially larger Harley Quinn become more sexually intimate, you both suddenly heard a nearby voice, which spoke with a masculine yet sarcastic tone as the voice quipped, \"I hate to ruin such intimacy, toots, but shouldn't we get the plot going?\" Of course, you looked around the spacious room briefly, only to realize that there wasn't anyone else in the room besides you and Harley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...That is, until you noticed Harley looking at the partially burnt beaver with an annoyed expression on her somewhat plump face as she retorted, \"D'aw, Shattup, Bernie! (Name) an' I are busy 'ere!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you soon inevitably realize two things: One, you could now hear the partially burnt beaver talking, despite it being an inanimate object. And two, you must be in Harley Quinn's apartment building on Coney Island in New York City! Suffice to say, you definitely were quite surprised as a result, just as Harley noticed your startled expression, where she began to snap the fingers on her left hand to get your attention, looking at you with a concerned expression on her face as she asked, \"...'Elloooo! Earth ta (Name)! Ya feelin' alright? Ya seem a little...off t'day.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, you soon quickly recovered, where you swiftly spoke toward the rotund Harley to avoid suspicion, rubbing the back of your head as you answered, \"Oh! Um...sorry about that, Harley. Been having a bad dream recently.\" \"Bad dreams, huh? ...Well, I guess dat 'splains why ya seem outta whack t'day, sweetie.\" Harley replied, slowly positioning herself on the bed to sit beside you, which caused the bed to groan and creak a little from Harley's corpulence. From there, Harley spoke toward you with a coy tone as she quipped, \"...Aw come on, (Name), you can tell me. Afta all, I'm one hella psychologist. So, what seems ta be ailin' ya?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you tried to come up with a convincing excuse. However, as if by instinct, you suddenly spoke toward Harley and said, \"So, um...I assume you still remember your ex-boyfriend, the Joker?\" Of course, in response to such a question, Harley displayed this frustrated look upon her unnaturally pale face, angrily huffing out a breath as she retorted, \"Oh please! Don't remind me of Mistah J. ...Wait a sec, this 'bout when he captured ya an' tortured you just ta get me back, isn't it puddin'?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you didn't respond back to her. But suddenly, you soon felt this gnawing sensation in the back of your memory, causing you to momentarily experience these vivid flashbacks for a second or two, which showed you being tortured by the Joker himself and a few of his goons before, oddly enough, Batman and Harley Quinn crashed through the roof to stop the Joker and rescue you. From there, you soon looked back at the rotund Harley Quinn and explained, \"*sigh*...Yeah. I, um...I think I might be suffering from some form of PTSD or something, Harl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's not ya fault he went after ya, (Name). *sigh* But still, can't believe I had ta rely on B-Man's help in savin' your ass.\" Harley said, placing both her hands upon her adipose padded hips in mild frustration, especially since you had to guess that Harley Quinn must have been extremely reluctant to ask Batman of all people to help her rescue you, especially when you are well aware of the history between the Dark Knight and Harley's affiliation with the Clown Prince of Crime and his schemes. Overall, it was certainly understandable, as you soon placed a hand on Harley's left hand and replied, \"Hey, don't blame yourself for me getting captured, Harley. It was my choice to fall in love with you, and I'm certainly not regretting my choice. Not one little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, in response to your words, Harley displayed a reassured smirk on her plump pink lips, where she then administered a tender kiss upon your lips then answered, \"...Ya know how ta cheer me up, don't ya, puddin'? *giggle*\" \"What can I say, Harley? You certainly know how to make things interesting in our daily lives...even if they're a little bombastic.\" You replied, kissing Harley on the lips once more. However, much to your intrigue, Bernie the partially burnt beaver spoke once more and sarcastically remarked, \"Hey! As much as I want to see you two doing it, shouldn't you guys be getting dressed by now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...D'oh fine! Ya win this round, Bernie!\" Harley reluctantly complied, as she heaved herself off the side of the bed with surprisingly little to no effort considering her current size and girth, just as you pulled the covers off and swiftly dismounted yourself from the bed. From there, Harley casually waddled her way toward the elongated drawers, her enlarged derriere rippling and jiggling mildly with each sashaying step she made. Meanwhile, as you carefully made your way through some of the minor junk laying around the bedroom, you calmly entered the bathroom to get yourself freshened up for the day.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>However, upon looking into the full body bathroom mirror, you gazed upon your masculine male figure, taking in every sculpted part of your chiseled athletic physique. Currently, you stood at a prominent 6 feet in height, as your left hand sifted through your short dirty blonde hair, while you thoroughly examined yourself in the process. However, you noticed some differences on your physique, clearly now aware of the black eye around your right eye, as well as what appeared to be a vertical scar running down the side of your abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from what you had subconsciously told the bulky Harley Quinn, you could only surmise that these injuries you've received were most likely from when you were captured and tortured by the Joker himself. However, upon carefully touching the abdomen scar, you suddenly began to experience these vivid memories...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---- Sionis Steel Mill, Gotham City / Six Months Ago ----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of steel being smelted, the smell of blood in the air, and the sight of the Clown Prince of Crime smacking you senselessly with a bloodied crowbar. Such memories were something one doesn't so easily forget, as Joker reluctantly ceased his assault upon you, as you were currently tied down to a metal chair with duct tape wrapped around your wrists and ankles, with your face a little bloody from taking a few blows to the head by a maniac wielding a crowbar, as the Joker violently threw the crowbar against the concrete floor with an audible CLANG! out of frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, you spat out a bit of blood from your mouth, where you then looked back at the Joker with an aggressively determined scowl on your face and said, \"...Really? Is that the best you can do, Joker? Beat me up with the same crowbar you killed one of the Robins with? And here I thought you were clever- UNGH!!\" But as you were about to finish that statement, one of Joker's goons quickly went up to you and punched you square in the jaw, not taking any insults about his boss from you, as he growled, \"Nobody talks back to Joker! NOBODY!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, unexpectedly, Joker pulled out his signature revolver, aimed at the thug, and shot him in the head with zero hesitation, shocking his other henchmen in the process, where the Clown Prince of Crime yelled, \"...How many times do I have to tell you boys? THIS INSIGNIFICANT PIECE OF SHIT IS MINE!! Now unless any of you want to join Cox here in a dirt nap, STAY OUTTA MY GODDAMN WAY!!!\" From there, Joker began to madly sift through the numerous makeshift torture devices he had lying on the table nearby, where you then spoke toward him with a serious tone in your voice and said, \"...You know, now I see why Harley left Gotham in the first place: To get away from you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Joker lashed out, swiftly throwing a butterfly knife at you, but you quickly tilted your head to avoid it, causing the knife blade to firmly plant itself in the metal chair, especially since Joker wasn't taking it too kindly with your bravado. However, he looked at you with that iconic devilish grin of his as he chirped, \"Oh (Name), you should really keep that fat mouth of yours shut. It'll get you into trouble.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think your charismatic threats can scare me, then you're only kidding yourself, Joker. Face it, Clown Boy: You don't truly have feelings for Harley like I do. In fact, you only seem to have your eyes only on the goddamn Batman! Should I keep going, or would you rather put a bullet in my skull?\" You retorted, displaying a smug shit-eating grin on your bloodied face. Of course, that back-talk struck the Joker's last nerve, as he swiftly responded by violently stabbing you in the abdomen, causing you to yell out in pain, as he slowly dragged the blade downwards, cutting open your side some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now THAT'S. Not. Funny!! You think you can have your way with my Harley, but she'll always come crawling back to me.\" Joker replied, as if he knew that Harley Quinn will come back to him like it always has been with the two of them. Of course, you spoke toward Joker, trying your best to ignore the throbbing pain some as you retorted, \"...Maybe what you say is true, but nothing will change my mind about how I feel about her, even if you dunk me in a pool of acid, or feed me to your pet hyenas. So, go ahead! Do your worst, Joker!! I'VE GOT NO FUCKING REGRETS!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, just as Joker was about to finish you off, you both suddenly heard the sound of glass breaking, then the sound of someone getting knocked unconscious, where you both then heard one or two of the thugs scream, \"It's the Bat! HE'S HERE!!\" \"Well, what are you waiting for, April Fool's Day?! STOP HIM!!\" Joker yelled, as most of the thugs began to rush toward Batman, only for the Dark Knight to counter, punch, and jab at the oncoming thugs with ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as the Joker's thugs kept Batman preoccupied, Joker was about to finish you off by slitting your throat, but was suddenly knocked down by Robin, who then knocked the Clown Prince of Crime out cold with his retractable staff. From there, Robin got and proceeded to cut the duct tape restraining you with his Wing-Ding as he asked, \"You okay there?\" \"*grunt* Besides from being tortured by your boss's archenemy, yeah, things are quite freaking peachy!\" You sarcastically remarked, as Robin soon helped you up onto your feet, while you attempted to hold your abdomen together to prevent your organs from spilling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you managed to make it through one of the hallways of the Sionis Steel Mill, you began to notice the numerous unconscious Joker thugs lying around as you both pass by them, where you then spoke toward Robin and asked, \"So... I'm guessing Harley sought you and Batman out in order to find me, didn't she?\" \"...Pretty much. He was reluctant to help her out at first, considering-\" Robin answered, just as you promptly retorted, \"Her criminal past and affiliation with the Joker? ...Yeah, that's understandable. But, I can assure you, Robin: She's a changed individual...Well, somewhat changed, but she isn't trying to hook back up with Joker. After all, I've been living with her on Coney Island for a few months now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, as Robin helped to carry you toward the Sionis Steel Mill main entrance, you both could hear the distinct sounds of Harley Quinn beating the crap out of some Joker thugs with a mixture of acrobatic kicks and flips, as well as using her trademark wooden mallet, where she finished off the final thug as you spoke out toward her as you exclaimed, \"Harley!!\" \"(Name)!!\" Harley exclaimed, where she rushed over to hug you, only to see you in such an injured state, as Robin spoke out toward her and explained, \"Don't worry. Oracle managed to call in an ambulance before we got here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, you heard the sounds of police and ambulance sirens just outside the main gates, where you exhaled a deep breath and said, \"*long sigh* We definitely owe you and Batman a lot for doing this.\" Shortly after that, you soon began to lose consciousness due to losing a bit of blood from enduring such torture, just as you soon felt Robin and Harley quickly rushing you into the ambulance.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>However, instead of expecting to be back in the lofty apartment building on Coney Island, you soon open your eyes to find yourself on a hospital bed,with two GCPD police officers standing just outside the room, guarding it like a pair of watch dogs. Slowly looking to your left, you noticed that Harley Quinn was sleeping beside you, sitting in a hospital chair she pulled up right next to you, using her arms as a makeshift headrest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon closer inspection, instead of seeing Harley Quinn as the five hundred pound plus-sized woman she has become, she was currently as lithe as she was in the comics, which meant that you were still experiencing a flashback or two. Eventually, you soon witnessed someone successfully passed by the police officers, thus entering the hospital room. In appearance, he was a male in his mid to late fifties, complete with a full head of short gray hair, and a prominent gray moustache. He wore a pair of glasses, as well as a business suit and a beige overcoat. Judging from his appearance alone, this individual undoubtedly had to be Police Commissioner Jim Gordon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you're awake, kid.\" He said, speaking with a scruffy rugged voice, probably gained from a combination of years of active police duty and extensive smoking. Of course, in response to such a surprising visit from Gotham's Police Commissioner, you slowly leaned against the pillows some so you could look at him, where you then spoke toward him and queried, \"I guess. So, what do I owe the pleasure for a visit from the great Commissioner Gordon?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Batman overheard what you said to the Joker while he had you strapped down. Gotta admit though, I'm impressed. Wish we had more people like you in the force.\" Gordon answered, obviously somewhat impressed by your bravado against the Joker, even though the Clown Prince of Crime had you duct taped to a metal chai, torturing you for several hours nonstop. So, you soon spoke toward the Police Commissioner and said, \"Thanks...I think. So, um, out of curiosity...How did Harley managed to get Batman's help anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...She snuck up onto the roof of GCPD and spray painted the Bat Signal red.\" Commissioner Gordon bluntly answered, which surprised you a little at how gutsy Harley had to be in getting help from the one person she would least likely seek aid from, as you then retorted, \"Oh! Well...When you put it like that, Commissioner, I guess that's certainly one way to get the Batman's attention. But still, why didn't seek out someone else like her friends Ivy or Catwoman?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Look, I don't know what goes on in that girl's head, but I do know that she seemed really desperate to seek out HIS help.\" Gordon explained, obviously referring to Batman, where he then continued speaking as he elaborated, \"And besides, Poison Ivy was currently locked up in Arkham Asylum, while we're unsure of Catwoman's whereabouts.\" \"In other words, Harley didn't have time to break into Arkham or seek out Catwoman.\" You retorted, piecing together what had transpired while you were tortured by the Joker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" Gordon answered, where you soon looked back at the sleeping Harley Quinn, then looked back toward Commissioner Gordon, where you then spoke toward him and asked, \"So...I'm guessing that you're going to be hauling Harley off to Arkham Asylum, aren't you? Even though she helped in stopping the Joker and rescued me?\" Of course, you couldn't help but feel a twinge of sadness and frustration, especially since that even though Harley deliberately went through so much to help free you from her ex-boyfriend, it was most likely that she was going to have to pay for her previous crimes when she worked as the Joker's right hand woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, instead of hearing a solid yes from him, Commissioner Gordon then bluntly explained, \"...Fortunately for her, and much to my surprise, no.\" Of course, such a revelation undoubtedly surprised you, but also gave you some relief, as you then looked at Gordon and asked, \"Really?! But...But how?\" \"...I didn't make the call. It came from the m mayor's office. Guess you and Quinn have some friends in high places.\" Gordon explained, which surprised you some, especially since someone high up convinced the mayor to not have Harley arrested and sent off to Arkham. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh*...Anyway, here's hoping that I don't regret not having Quinn in handcuffs.\" Gordon said, bidding you farewell, as he stepped out of the hospital room, probably because he has to be somewhere else at the moment. From there, you looked at the unconscious Harley, gently stroking her blue and red hair in the process.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>But then, your vision began to abruptly change once more. At first, you thought you were going to be experiencing another flashback. However, your vision soon cleared up, as you were now back in the bathroom of Harley Quinn's lofty apartment building on Coney Island. Of course, you shrugged off the experience as you thought, \"...Well, I guess that explains the histoory between me and Harley a little.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh (Name)~! Are ya comin' out yet or not?\" Harley asked, speaking with a minor sing-song tone in her voice. And judging from how loud her voice was, she must've been outside of the bedroom, probably watching some television to preoccupy herself. \"...Just a minute, Harl! I was checking how my scar is doing!\" You quickly retorted, attempting to make up a convincing excuse for such procrastination. From there, you quickly brushed your teeth, then shaved yourself somewhat, and finally sifted through the drawers for some suitable clothes, settling for some stonewashed jeans, white socks, and a blue t-shirt with the Assassin's Creed logo on the front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished up with dressing yourself, you swiftly exited out of the bedroom, as you soon noticed how spacious yet assorted the entire apartment was. In the kitchen area, there appeared to be a massive industrial-sized refrigerator and freezer off to the side, as well as an enormous stove and oven set fit for a family of 6 to 8 people. \"Geez, no wonder why Harley's so big and fat if she has a fridge of this size.\" You thought to yourself, as you came across a mahogany wooden table, complete with metal chairs, especially one made for someone of Harley's current size and girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross from the Kitchen area, there appeared to be some exercise equipment, most likely for you no doubt if you were this muscular and ripped. And off to one corner, there laid a full body mannequin equipped with what appeared to be a Pilot outfit from the video game Titanfall, complete with functioning jetpack and a metallic locker that had the word \"WEAPONS\" labeled on it in big bold letters. Plus, off to the side of the weapons locker, there laid Harley Quinn's trademark yet oversized wooden mallet, ready to be wielded when needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, off to another corner, you could see a grassy area with several full grown trees sprouting from the floor, along with a couple of dogs, cats, and birds gathered around that area, going about their daily pet lives, whether it was gnawing on a chew toy, playing with a ball of yarn, or grooming themselves. \"Oh... So that explains all those noises I've been hearing from earlier.\" You thought, now realizing what those strange sounds were when you woke up today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, looking to your right, you soon noticed a large media entertainment center, complete with a 108 inch Flatscreen TV, a DVR box, an Internet router, and your PlayStation 4 console. And there, sitting comfortably on a large L-Shaped couch, sat the corpulent Harley Quinn herself. Judging from her current attire, she had her red and blue hair styled into her iconic pigtails, as she wore an ensemble of clothes that matched her hair. On her thick padded legs, Harley was wearing a pair of thigh-high socks, with a blue sock on her left leg, and a red sock on her right leg, as the leg fat on her unnaturally pale thighs oozed a little out of such garments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking upwards, Harley was now wearing a massive red and blue vertical striped sleeveless dress, which did little to conceal her enormity and girth, as her splayed out some over her padded lap some. However, you could only guess that she was most likely wearing red and blue checkered panties as well, given her harlequin style when it came to her choice of clothes. Overall, she certainly seemed quite attractive in your eyes, even if she now weighed around five hundred pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, as you became distracted at Harley's beautifully rotund form, Harley soon noticed you, curving her plump pink lips into a seductive yet playfully coy grin as she quipped, \"Like what ya see, puddin'?\" But just as she said those words, Harley began to gently play a little with her bleach white apron belly, causing you to blush profusely once you snapped out of your allured daze. Of course, couldn't help but have a hearty chuckle from your mild embarrassment, which caused her voluminous Double F-Cup breasts jiggled some from such swift movements. But suddenly, she then swiftly grabbed your hands and yanked you toward her with surprising speed and agility despite her current size and girth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, this caused you to collide into her soft burgeoning form, which you couldn't help but finding it to be oddly relaxing and surprisingly comfortable as well. But then, you soon felt Harley's pillowy arms wrap themselves around you, as if she was embracing you, despite your head clearly pressed against her enlarged cleavage. Moments later, you gently pressed against her large belly, looking up toward Harley's somewhat cherubic face,  as she looked at you with her bright blue eyes and chirped, \"...Feelin' bettah, puddin'?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*chuckle* Yeah, I feel a lot better with you around. Thanks, Harley!\" You retorted, feeling surprisingly rejuvenated on an emotional level, especially considering the established relationship between you and the substantially larger Harley Quinn. From there, Harley swiftly pulled you in for a passionate kiss, then gleefully replied, \"*giggle* No prob, (Name)!\" Moments later, you and Harley continued the passionate intimate kissing, as your hand subconsciously wandered down toward one of Harley's profound love handles, gently squeezing it and jiggling it mildly, which seemed to arouse Harley as she flirtatiously chirped, \"Oooh! Someone's bein' a naughty boy~ Mama spank!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, with a surprising amount of speed and flexibility despite her current size, Harley soon rose up from the couch, flipped you around towards the couch, and pressed you against the furniture, flirtatiously smooshing you against the couch with her unnaturally pale flabby body. Suffice to say, the two of you were certainly enjoying each other's company. But then, just as things were about to become more intimate between you and the corpulent Harley Quinn, something abruptly interrupted the two of you, which came in the form of...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>But then, just as things were about to become more intimate between you and the corpulent Harley Quinn, something abruptly interrupted the two of you, which came in the form of Harley's own cell phone going off, as it vibrated on the coffee table while it played \"Hit and Run\" by \"LOLO\" as her ringtone. Of course, Harley displayed an obvious pouty lip in some semblance of frustration, where she slowly got off of you as she muttered, \"*growl* Alright, who's da wise guy that's got da nerve to interrupt me and my puddin'?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, once she picked up the studded cell phone and looked at the caller ID within her slightly chubby left hand, Harley's expression almost instantaneously shifted from psychotically pissed, to gleefully enthusiastic in a heartbeat, as she quickly realized who was calling her, as she excitedly exclaimed, \"Holy Plant-olee! It's Ivy!\" Of course, due to your knowledge of Harley Quinn, you obviously figured out that Pamela Isley (better known as \"Poison Ivy\") was in fact the one who was calling Harley at this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Harley quickly swiped the phone's touchscreen to accept Ivy's call with a red fingernail index finger, where she then swiftly placed the cell phone against her unnaturally pale right ear, as she then spoke into the cell phone and quipped, \"Hey there, Ivy! How's my favorite flower child?\" Of course, you couldn't fully make out what Ivy was saying to Harley on the phone, as the substantially larger Harley Quinn eagerly spoke toward her friend and retorted, \"Oh me? Nothin' much, Red. Was 'bout ta get all Snu-Snu on (Name) 'fore ya called. Why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, you knew what Harley meant by \"Snu-Snu\", as the rotund clown girl placed a slightly plump left hand upon her burgeoning hips and voluminous butt, as the unnaturally pale hand sank a little into her already established flab in response. \"Ya need a place ta stay fer a while? No probs, Ivy! Yer always welcome to stay 'ere on Coney Island! Who knows? Maybe you'll wanna move in with us! *giggle*\" Harley chirped, easily becoming ecstatic on the prospect of her best friend Poison Ivy living with the two of you on Coney Island. And yet, even you were a little intrigued on the idea of having Poison Ivy living with you and Harley for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, you weren't exactly sure of the status of the relationship between you and Poison Ivy was like, considering how protective she was of Harley in the comics, especially since Ivy has always been there for Harley when Joker kicks the clown girl out from time to time. Then again, you obviously weren't the Joker, considering that he was the one who gave you that scar on the side of your chiseled abdomen in the first place. And speaking of you, Harley momentarily looked back at you then spoke into her phone and said, \"Oh, ya mean how (Name)'s been treatin' lil' ol' me? He isn't treatin' me like Mistah J had, if that's what yer thinkin', Red. In fact, he's been pamperin' me like royalty!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Though, now that I think 'bout it, I may 'ave put on some of that \"Baby Weight\" eva since we just found out that I'm preggers.\" Harley chirped, her slightly chubby left hand now cradling the undercarriage of her flabby belly, feeling it's doughy softness in the process, along with displaying a noticeable blush on her unnaturally pale yet somewhat cherubic face. Of course, you were legitimately surprised to such a revelation, especially since you honestly didn't expect Harley Quinn to say such a thing, becoming pregnant and all that jazz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, nuff 'bout me! What 'bout you, Red? When are ya goin' ta arrive in Manhattan?\" Harley asked, curious to know how long it will be until her friend Poison Ivy would inevitably arrive at Coney Island. Of course, Harley soon heard Ivy's answer over the phone, repeating what her botanist friend had said and retorted, \"...Uh-huh. Okie-Dokie, Red! We'll see ya in a few hours. I'll be sure ta tell Big Tony ta expect ya. Kay, see ya when ya get 'ere, Ivy! Buh-Bye~!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Harley soon ended the call between her and Ivy, where she then turned around to face you, where she displayed quite the coy and mischievous grin on her plump pink lips, as she then spoke toward you, placing both of her mildly plump hands upon her burgeoning hips as she spoke with a gleeful sing-song tone in her voice as she chirped, \"Guess who's goin' ta be livin' with us, puddin'~?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judging from how excited you are, Harl, I'm gonna guess it's Ivy, isn't it?\" You playfully asked, just as Harley firmly nodded her head in complete confirmation to such a guess. From there, just as you and Harley were about to continue the intimacy, Harley's blubbery stomach began to growl excessively, demanding to be fed immediately. Of course, this made the substantially larger Harley Quinn blush some in embarrassment coming from her own stomach, as she then quipped, \"*giggle* And speakin' of preggers, sounds like the twins want their mama ta feed 'em. Think you can handle makin' breakfast, puddin'?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, sweetie. What do you have in mind?\" You queried, as you soon dismounted yourself from the L-Shaped couch and walked into the Kitchen area of the apartment. Of course, Harley somewhat long and hard about what she wanted to eat for breakfast. Eventually, Harley soon made up her mind as she then answered, \"Hmm... Now dat I think 'bout it, I'm certainly in da mood fer some...\"</span></div></div>",

Eventually, Harley soon made up her mind as she then answered, \"Hmm... Now dat I think 'bout it, I'm certainly in da mood fer some Chili Dog Waffles. Afta all, ya know how ta make a mean Dog, puddin'! *giggle*\" At first, you were legitimately surprised to such an odd choice for breakfast. But then again, this was Harley Quinn you were dealing with here, so of course there was going to be some semblance of abnormality when it involved her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo inevitably, you complied with Harley's distinct breakfast order, as you spoke toward her while you went into the Kitchen area of the lofty apartment and retorted, \"*chuckle* Alright, Harl! One big stack of Chili Dog Waffles coming right up!\" Of course, as you went into the Kitchen area, your mind suddenly realized something as you thought, \"...Wait a minute... I DON'T EVEN KNOW TO MAKE SOMETHING LIKE THIS!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as if guided by instinct and muscle memory, you suddenly began to grab several things from both the fridge and several kitchen cabinets, which included two boxes of regular Eggo Waffles, Hotdogs and Hotdog Buns, and Chili Sauce. Suffice to say, you personally felt relieved from such an unexpected action, as you thought to yourself and subconsciously said, \"Well... That was definitely...unexpected. But hey, I'm certainly not complaining, especially if this came from parts of my life with Harley Quinn that I was unaware of.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost an hour later, after instinctively cooking and preparing the unusual cuisine, you were finally finished making what only Gordon Ramsey himself would describe as \"Culinary Chaos\": The Chili Dog Waffles, as they were built like a sandwich, with the Eggo Waffles acting as sandwich buns, while the chili dogs were smooshed in between the two waffles.  However, due to Harley's established weight and girth, you only assumed that one dish of Chili Dog Waffles probably wasn't going to satiate the rotund clown girl's increased appetite, so you decided to make a few more stacks of Chili Dog Waffles just in case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, as you placed the Chili Dog Waffles on the Kitchen table, you spoke up toward Harley and said, \"Harley, breakfast is served!\" Of course, Harley heard you loud and clear, where she soon stood up from the couch and began to approach the Kitchen table. However, despite now weighing in at little over five hundred pounds, Harley surprisingly was able to pull off two full cartwheels along her way over toward  the table, where she momentarily celebrated such a minor accomplishment as she excitedly quipped, \"Hell yeah! Still got it in spades!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after that, Harley casually but slightly waddled her way toward the Kitchen table, her burgeoning hips sashaying from left to right with each step she made. Being the gentleman you were, you chivalrously pulled out the large reinforced chair for Harley to sit in, where she looked at you with a flirtatious grin on her plump pink lips while she casually sat down and chirped, \"D'aw! Aren't ya such a gentleman t'day, puddin'!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, you soon gave her a beer mug full of Orange Juice, just as you then got yourself a cup of Orange Juice and a bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, sitting beside the substantially larger Harley Quinn and cautiously queried, \"So, Harley... How were you still able to do those Cartwheels anyway?\" After holding and biting into the Chili Dog Waffles like a Burger King Whopper, Harley chewed up and swallowed the bite-sized chunk of Chili Dog Waffles before speaking to you and explained, \"...Oh dat? Don't ya remember, (Name)? Ivy gave me some special fruit she made to keep mah muscles active, jus' in case anymore of those pea-brain assassins are still afta dat bounty I subconsciously put on m'self when I was sleepwalkin'.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um... Yeah, sorry about that. It kinda slipped my mind there. My bad!\" You replied, attempting to tell a convincing excuse for not knowing about such information. Of course, what Harley just told you definitely made sense, considering that Poison Ivy was also the one who gave Harley Quinn the immunity to numerous poisons and toxins in the comics, especially since Poison Ivy was also known to sometimes secrete these toxic pheromones that can kill a person if they got too close to her. Fortunately, Harley was very forgiving for your unintentional ignorance, as she then continued eating the Chili Dog Waffles before her, speaking toward you at times with a mouth full of food as she answered, \"Vat's e'kay, puddin! *gulp* Afta all, it's not really dat important anyway.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An' b'sides, t'be honest, sweetie... *gently pats her belly* Ah actually kinda like bein' this big! *giggles* Ah mean, yer hella lot more fun in bed when I got this fat. Plus, ya did say ta me dat yer into bigger chicks afta we got back from Gotham when you were...taken, by Mistah J.\" Harley explained, revealing to you that, in fact, you were the one who made Harley pack on the pounds in the first place. At first, you were mentally surprised by such a revelation. But then again, you definitely couldn't help but find Harley more attractive in her current size and girth, just as you witnessed Harley taking another large bite out of the Chili Dog Waffles with gluttonous ferocity and gusto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, both in an attempt to divert the conversation onto a different topic as well as sating your curiosity, you spoke toward the corpulent Harley Quinn and asked, \"...So, out of curiosity, Harley: What were you and Ivy talking about over the phone? I mean, I heard you mentioning me a little to her, but... What exactly did she say?\" Eventually, after finishing off the first stack of Chili Dog Waffles, licking her unnaturally pale fingers clean of any residue chili sauce, Harley then calmly spoke toward you, displaying a somewhat gleeful smirk on her plump pink lips as she retorted, \"...Well, now dat I think 'bout it,  puddin'... Yeah, we were talkin' 'bout ya a little. In fact...\"</span></div></div>",

Y'know, with us bein' together.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you easily understood Ivy's reasons and concerns in regards to the substantially larger Harley Quinn having a new lover, especially just after leaving the abusive relationship between her and the Joker, as you calmly spoke toward the rotund clown girl and said, \"So... I'm guessing that Ivy still doesn't fully trust me as your lover, doesn't she?\"  \"...What? No! Of course she trusts ya, (Name)! It's jus' dat...she's, um...lookin' out fer me, dat's all, puddin'. I mean, ya prov'd ta her dat yer not like Mistah J in every way, dat's fer damn sure!\" Harley quickly retorted, reassuring you that Ivy does in fact trust you with having a relationship with Harley Quinn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, that's good to hear, Harl. So, I'm guessing that Ivy staying with us isn't just her way to keep on us, right?\" You asked, curious to know why Ivy needed a place to stay anyway, just as Harley swallowed another bite of another stack of Chili Dog Waffles and explained, \"Oh dat? Well... From what I 'eard on da news, things're heatin' up over in Gotham. Turns out dat da city got itself some new so-called superheroes named Gotham and Gotham Girl. An' they're like ripoffs of Superman and Supergirl.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, those two? ...Well, I guess that is a good reason for Ivy to leave Gotham, especially if the city got itself it's own version of the Man of Steel and Girl of Steel.\" You replied, drinking some of your Orange Juice shortly after saying those words. Plus, it soon made you realize something: You were undoubtedly now in the DC Rebirth Universe! Of course, in response to your reply, Harley chugged down the mug full of Orange Juice in one long swig, then slammed the mug against the table, where she then spoke toward you and retorted, \"*swallowing gulp* I know, right? Ah mean, first Ivy an' I always had ta deal with B-man, now we got these two super-powered do-gooders in tights flyin' 'round Gotham? Geez Louise, puddin'! Glad we're not livin' in Gotham these days, am I right? *hearty laugh*\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, you could easily see that the corpulent Harley Quinn was certainly enjoying the conversation between you and her, as she voraciously devoured every scrap of the remaining Chili Dog Waffles. And eventually, almost an entire hour later, Harley managed to fully consume all of the Chili Dog Waffles with gluttonous ferocity and gusto, where she lightly drummed her unnaturally pale fingers across her flabby yet completely stuffed belly, clearly enjoying the feeling of being stuffed to the gills. But then, out of nowhere, Harley suddenly and unexpectedly exhaled quite a loud belch from her lips, which made somewhat cherubic cheeks to blush profusely from such an unexpected yet unintentional outburst, where she looked at you with her blue eyes and quipped, \"*giggle* Whoops! Must've ate too much!\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eventually, after several long hours of traversing from Gotham City to New York City by Greyhound Bus, Dr. Pamela Isley, better known as the alluring human-plant hybrid Poison Ivy,  had finally reached her intended destination: The apartment complex on Coney Island. She stepped off the bus, wearing a beige overcoat over her black and green unitard outfit. Of course, knowing Poison Ivy, she blew a seductive kiss towards the bus driver, who happened to have been seduced due to the pheromones her body secretes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, the bus driver subconsciously slammed down on the gas pedal, quickly accelerating the Greyhound Bus past the usual speed limit around Coney Island. Ivy, of course, casually but calmly sashayed her way toward the main entrance to the building, where a familiar individual stood by the door taking a smoke from a cigarette. In appearance, he was about half the height of Ivy herself, but he was built like an athlete, wearing a black leather jacket, brown shirt, pair of jeans, and a solid pair of rugged leather boots, as his black hair dangled just around the nape of his neck. This was none other than \"Big Tony\", one of the residents on Coney Island, as well as the owner of a... \"unique\" business, per say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tony.\" Ivy quipped, greeting the dwarf of a man with a gentle smirk on her ruby red lips. Of course, Tony easily noticed the red-haired botanist, smirking as well as he retorted, \"Well, if it isn't the landlady's favorite gal! Ivy, right?\" \"Good to see that you remember me, Tony. I take it that Harley is still inside?\" Ivy queried, asking him if Harley was still in the apartment building or not. Obviously, Big Tony firmly nodded in confirmation towards the human-plant hybrid, where he then spoke toward her and explained, \"Oh yeah, the boss lady is still up there with (Name). Though if you ask me, they're certainly enjoying each other's company.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* Of course they are. Anyway, tell Goat-Boy and the others I said hello.\" Ivy retorted, where she then promptly walked inside the apartment building, just as Tony briefly waved his right hand as he quipped, \"Can do, Red.\" From there, Ivy proceeded to climb up several flights of stairs towards the lofty apartment where you and the corpulent Harley Quinn were residing in. Of course, upon reaching the double doors that led inside the apartment condo, Ivy could easily hear the distinct chatter between you and the substantially larger Harley Quinn, along with hearing what sounded like gunfire and explosions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that there was another group of contract killers after that bounty on Harley's head, Ivy instinctively pulled out a few plant seeds, growing them at a rapid pace, using the enhanced vines to pry open the door with ease. Of course, both you and Harley easily heard and noticed what was going on at the door, just as Ivy came rushing in as she exclaimed, \"HOW DARE YOU LAY Your... Wait, what's going on?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Red, you're 'ere!\" Harley excitedly chirped, blitzing her botanist friend with surprising speed and agility despite her current size and girth, causing Ivy to be swiftly pinned to the floor by the heftier Harley Quinn. Of course, Ivy couldn't exactly say no to being greeted by her favorite Gotham City Siren in such a provocative yet erotic manner, just as Harley planted an excited kiss upon Ivy's ruby red lips, then spoke toward the female human-plant hybrid and gleefullyquipped, \"So... How was da ride over 'ere, Red?\" \"...A little dull for my tastes, darling. Now, if you don't mind, would you please be a dear and get off me?\" Ivy politely answered, asking if Harley could get off of the human-plant hybrid, especially since the clown girl was now considerably bigger than she was when she met you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops! My bad, Red!\" Harley retorted, quickly performing a perfect backflip despite her increased weight and girth, as she easily dismounted hersrrlf off of Ivy with little to no effort. From there, Ivy quickly stood back up onto her own two feet, courtesy of some minor assistance from her plants. In appearance, her physique was still the same as it was in the comics, which was a complete contrast to the substantially larger Harley Quinn, where you then proceeded to greet Ivy as you said, \"Hey, Ivy! It's been a while since we last saw one another.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I suppose you're correct on that, (Name).\" Ivy replied, where she then turned her head and noticed what was displayed on the Flatscreen TV, her mind putting two and two together as she asked, \"So... I assume all of that noise I've just heard was YOUR doing, (Name)?\" \"...Yeah, sorry about that, Ivy. Turns out Harley really wanted me to play Far Cry 5 with her on my PlayStation 4.\" You answered, scratching the back of your head out of mild embarrassment for Ivy's understandable reaction. After all, Harley still has that bounty on her head, so of course Ivy's reaction was understandable considering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Ivy then calmly spoke toward the corpulent Harley Quinn and queried, \"So, Harley... What do you have in mind for us today?\" Of course, Harley already had something in mind, as she sported an obviously gleeful grin upon her plump pink lips and somewhat cherubic unnaturally pale face, where she then spoke toward you and Ivy as she gleefully chirped...</span></div></div>",

Sure, going to watch that kind of thing could be fun. And yeah, it does get pretty rough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley giggles and kisses your cheek. \"No, silly. I'm thinkin' of us actually competin'. Well, me and Ivy anyways. I know you ain't the most graceful on your feet, puddin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's already got a pair of extra wide roller blades slung over her shoulders, and she starts gathering more stuff. She tosses a few things at Ivy, who holds her pair of skates out before her as if it were a disgusting bug. \"You can't be serious,\" Ivy says. \"Darling, I love spending time with you, but a roller derby? How...quaint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley's ample rear shakes a little as she finishes grabbing the last of her things. \"Well, you don't have ta if you don't wanna. You can just watch. I know how you like to watch,\" she says with a seductive wink. \"But it's more than just skatin'. It's a real fight, to the death! Anyways, ya skate, you find weapons in the rink, and you beat each other to a pulp. Fun, right? Da best part: no rules!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp, not wanting to spoil her fun, but also not wanting to get into more danger than you need to. \"You, uh, sure about that?\" you ask. \"I mean, should you be doing that kind of stuff, you know, in your condition?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, despite the fact that she has displayed her agility time and time again, you still find it hard to believe that she'd even be up to such a feat at her size. That, and the fact that you've just been hit with the revelation of being a father has you kind of on edge about the idea. You still need to ask her about that, without seeming like too much of an idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't you worry about dat, puddin'. Those fruit's Ivy's been givin' me do the trick, and you know no one's faster than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy rolls her eyes. \"Well, like you just said, it isn't really about speed. I'm going to have to agree with (Y/N); are you really sure we should just go jumping headlong into danger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's your sense of adventure, Red?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Left it back at Arkham, darling. All I'm saying is can't we just go to watch the entertainment, and not be a part of the act?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley huffs and places her hands on her soft hips. \"Well, I'm goin', and the rest of ya pussies can stay here for all I care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou intervene before she can get too mad. After all, you hate to see her when she's angry with you. \"No, I'll go, and I'll support you, babe,\" you say, rubbing small circles on her belly to sooth her. \"I'm just worried is all. I care about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seems to ease her and she giggles, kissing you. \"Aw, thanks, puddin'. But you don't got nothin' to worry about. This is me we're talkin' about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you look to Ivy. She crosses her arms, and sighs. \"Alright, I'll go. Someone's got to babysit the two of you, it seems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*   *   *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive at what at first seemed like such a hole-in-the-wall place. It was a rather run-down building that wasn't much to look at on the inside. Of course, you realize, that kind of was the purpose. After all, no one wants the wrong people sniffing around a place like this. Harley seemed to know guy at the door, and you wonder how often she's been coming to this place before suggesting it to you. The doorman easily lets the three of you in, and you're hit with a barrage of sensory experiences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's somewhat dark, to create an intense mood as colored lights swirl around the rink. People are everywhere, all jockeying for a good place to watch all the main action. You push your way through the crowd, and finally get a spot near the edge of the rink, just in time to see two girls duking it out. One's swinging some kind of blade at the other, who's nimbly skating around the attacks, swinging what looks like some kind of mace over her head. This doesn't last long before second girl pummels the other with the mace, knocking her out in a bloody mess. You wince a little, worrying what Harley has managed to get herself into this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazin', isn't it?\" Harley says, nudging you. \"I'm goin' to go get ready. Wish me luck, puddin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wish as much luck as humanly possible. This is insane, you keep telling yourself. Not that everything else up to this point hasn't been a little off to you, but this has you worried. Ivy doesn't look to pleased to be here either. \"Because I wanted to spend my evening crowded up against a bunch of manhandlers with such...'wonderful' odors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle. \"Yeah, not exactly smelling like a rose here is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shoots you a look. \"You get one plant pun, lover boy, just one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stiffen. \"You know, you can trust me with her. I love Harley more than anything. I would never do anything wrong to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That remains to be seen. Look, you seem like a nice kid, but...Harley's my friend, perhaps my only friend. I'm always going to be looking out for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. \"I get that, but you know, ease up a little. She's a big girl now. I mean, uh...\" You didn't mean to say it like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" she says. \"Although, you are going to have to explain to me what happened there.\" She was referring to Harley's increased size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few memories start to flood back to you, and you're about to begin telling her, when the announcer's voice booms out. \"Alright, ladies and gentlemen. Have we got a show for you! Tonight, we've got the one, the only, Harley Quinn here tonight to face off in the arena. And, her opponent's going to be...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Guadalupe Gonzales, the fastest girl on the rink, earning herself the name Speedy Gonzales.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the ring is this short, skinny, Hispanic girl who clearly knows how to cater to the crowds. She's already taking what looks like a victory lap before the match, waving to the crowds, and throwing a few flirtatious winks to the men in the audience. Her dark hair falls to her shoulders and whips around with the slightest turn of her head. But the one thing you notice above all others is that the announcer is right: she is fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's incredibly quick on her feet, easily turning and maneuvering around on her skates. She's definitely going to have the jump on speed over Harley, which does worry you a little. For as agile as your girlfriend is at her size, she's nowhere close to how fast this girl can move. You just hope that Harley knows what she's doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe announcer continues. \"Alright, you two know how this works. We're giving you ten minutes in the rink. You can find and grab any weapons you see on the rink, but also watch out for a few traps of our own. And finally, there are no rules. You come out of the rink alive, you win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp at that thought. \"C'mon, Harley,\" you mutter to yourself. \"You'd better make it out alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over at Ivy, who has a look of worry of her own. Harley may have changed her ways, and she may have decided to settle down, but that didn't change her erratic choices to live a life of danger when she could. You just wish she wasn't killing you one grey hair at a time with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls roll up to the starting line, waiting for the timer to start. Harley has a big grin on her face. No matter what she puts herself through, she always makes it her first priority to have fun. Gonzales has only a look of determination. This is going to be one for the books, you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buzzer goes off and both girls take off around the rink, Gonzales already halfway around before Harley can really get going. In the grand scheme of things, this isn't a race, so that's not a problem. Harley just have to be more skilled with a weapon. You just hope Gonzales doesn't get the jump on her with a weapon of her own. You scan your eyes around the rink to see what's out there. There's really a little bit of everything, no shortage of weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley's already got her eye on a big sledge hammer. It's not her usual mallet, but it's big, heavy, and unorthodox, like her. Once she has her mind set to something, that's what she's going to do. She starts picking up the pace, her enormous form swaying and jiggling as she gathers speed. Her pudgy arm is already outstretched for the large hammer when she jumps. A small series of blades had popped out of the floor, nearly knocking her off balance. Thankfully, she saw it coming. That must be one of the traps the announcer mentioned. Still, that means she missed her opportunity to grab the sledge hammer. She'll have to get it on her next go around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Speedy Gonzales has already grabbed a couple of blades of her own, and she was skating even faster to get close to Harley. You hold your breath, hoping she's got a plan for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGonzales comes up from behind and tries to take a swing at Harley. She only nicks the side of her wide shorts before Harley turns around on her. \"Damn it! You ruined my outfit!\" she cries. \"Oh, you're gonna pay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gets ahead of her for a little, getting ready to make her second pass for the hammer. She's able to grab it. Good, you think, at least she's armed and she has a chance. You look up at the clock. Only two minutes have passed. According to Harley, things really get going only in the last few minutes of the round. \"Come on, babe! You got this!\" you shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley maneuver's herself around, already getting ready for Gonzales to come at her again. She parries the swing of her blades again, and tries to get a few blows in herself, but the hammer is too slow moving of a weapon, and someone like Gonzales moves too fast for her to get any attacks in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, Harley just resorts to trying to push the smaller girl over, hoping that will give her an advantage. Gonzales isn't just fast: she's strong too. She's able to withstand your titanic girlfriend's force, and even tries to push her back. You can see that something's about to give in Harley's ankles as her bottom shakes and quivers from the force. \"Get out of there!\" you holler. \"Get around her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy touches your shoulder. \"Calm down, lover boy. She's got this.\" You can tell that her voice is quivering. She's not so sure herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley breaks away from the stalemate, and tries to circle around to come up from behind, and have a little inertia of her own to fight back. But, Gonzales is hot on her tail, and you're not sure if she'll able to get ahead of her. However, a little hope comes your way. Another of the rink's traps, a swinging club, comes within inches of hitting Gonzales in the head. She dodges it, but it definitely slows her down. The two are now on opposite sides of the rink. You look at the clock. It's halfway through the round.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It doesn't take long for Gonzales to catch up to Harley, and of course, what you feared is about to happen. Harley is a much bigger target than her opponent. She manages to take a few more swings, forcing your girlfriend to really work at it to maneuver away from her, and it's starting to really slow her down. So far, it looks like a game of cat and mouse, where Harley is, in this case, and incredibly big mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she gets in a few blocks with her hammer, which at least keeps the smaller girl at bay. But, it's only doing so much. After all, Harley can't have much of an offensive game with this girl coming at her every five seconds. At least, she's still in this, and more importantly, still alive. But with the clock ticking, something's got to give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was something incredibly unexpected...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley pushes Gonzales back a few feet with her momentum, giving her a slight break to plan her next move. But, as time gets closer, the girl's gotten more brazen. She goes into a full-speed throttle attack. Harley braces and is able to block the brunt of the attack, but she is pushed backwards, and Gonzales is able to nick the skin on the side of your girlfriend's pale belly. You're about ready to go climbing over the railing to go rescue her, but you know you have to trust that she knows what she's doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it seems that she does, or at least she had a plan before luck helped her out. She turns around and starts skating with as much speed as she can muster. Even for her athletic abilities, this is starting to wear her down. But you can tell what she's trying to do. Harley may sometimes be a little off, but she's smarter than people give her credit for. She's timed how the rink's traps work and when they go off. She's purposefully trying to lure Gonzales into one of those.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt just might be crazy enough to work. The smaller girl continues to skate at full speed, trying to ram Harley with everything she has, and by the look in her eyes, it looks like she intends for it to be a bloodbath. But all the while, she's not paying attention to the rest of the rink: only Harley. And you notice that your girlfriend skates over the row of blades before they rise, and for the briefest second, it does trip Gonzales up. She's not as injured as the audience would have hoped, but she certainly takes a spill, and tumbles over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's lying in a heap, which gives Harley the perfect opportunity to strike, but just as she can get her mass turned around, the girl is up and racing towards her again, fire in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looks like Harley is hoping to pull the same trick again. Maybe she didn't notice that it was done on purpose. You cross your fingers, hoping for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that's not even remotely close to what happens. Harley's still trying to get her speed going, and the girl's already gaining on her, blade drawn, ready to go for an outright plunge into Harley's back. You can't watch, yet at the same time, you can't look away either. Harley sees this attack coming, and tries to do her best. She swings down the hammer near Gonzales' feet, and sure enough, that does knock her down yet again. But this time, when she falls, she knocks Harley's feet out from under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis proves to be the fatal error, in more ways than one. For one, you're worried about Harley. A fall is one thing, but in her condition, you're concerned. Second, there's still the matter of weapons that each girl has in their hands. This could get ugly. Thankfully, none of these things become the problem: it's the fact that Gonzales, in her fall, slides right underneath the falling Harley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat follows is a bloody, spectacular mess. All five-hundred-plus pounds of Harley come falling down upon Gonzales' head as your girlfriend lands on her cushy rump. At her size and momentum, this is almost as if Harley had swung her sledgehammer down upon the girl's head. You hear a sickening crack, followed by a pop. Bloody, mushy residue is spread all over that rink floor, and unfortunately, you just happened to be in the area of the audience that was the splash zone. A few bits of brain pelt your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, everyone is silent. Yeah, death happens in the arena, according to Harley, but this is certainly something unprecedented. It's certainly a lot gorier than they had expected. This really doesn't matter to you as you slide under the guard rail to go help Harley to her feet. But, as she stands up, the crowd roars in approval. Not only did she win, she gave them one of the best shows of the night. Harley smiles and takes a little bow, twirling her hair, and giving a good show, not really noticing the bloody remnants of her opponents on the seat of her pants. You roll your eyes. Never a dull moment with this one.</span></div></div>",

Pipsqueak didn't stand a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes and continue helping her clean up. \"Yeah, well, you certainly know how to try and kill me one grey hair at a time. You had me worried there for a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns around and wraps you up in a huge, squishy hug. \"Aw, you worried about me, puddin'? That's so sweet of ya. But you know you never have to worry. I know how to take care of myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" you say, trying to get a breath of air in, \"but sometimes we live a really dangerous life. It's hard not to worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as we got each other, we'll make it through whatever is thrown at us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but love her hope and enthusiasm. True, you guys have been through a lot, but somehow, you do come out okay, you know. You can't imagine facing these kinds of dangers and this life with anyone else. \"Of course,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy walks in to check on you two. She mockingly has her hands over her eyes. \"I'm not disturbing you two am I?\" she asks. \"I don't think I need vulgar images burned into my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley laughs. \"No, nothin' steamy yet.\" Then she leans close to your ear and murmurs. \"That's for when we get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of,\" you say. \"We really ought to get back home before we cause more collateral damage around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy makes a disgusted face. \"Given the intelligence level of the crowds here, I don't think they would mind. You're rather a fan favorite with them tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley giggles. \"What can I say? I always know how to entertain a crowd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, one more wave to your adoring fans,\" you say, \"and then we're out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pouts. \"Aw, we can't stick around for one more round?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kiss her cheek. \"Maybe next week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe beams. \"You mean it? We can come back? You're not gonna be a worry-wort are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise. And yes, we can come back. It's scary, to be sure, but fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you leave without much fuss, though the crowds are still singing Harley's praises for her amazing win. Some things never cease to surprise you. Going back out into the crisp night air, you're glad to finally have enough quiet to actually hear your thoughts again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, not long after getting outside, you hear a familiar sound. Harley's stomach starts to growl. \"Well, Skate Club certainly works up an appetite. I'm starvin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh. \"Well, that can easily be fixed.\" You point over across the street. \"There's some food trucks over there. I could use a little something myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gets Harley excited and she eagerly waddles over. You and Ivy follow close behind. Ivy seems to have resigned herself to this idea with a mildly grudging look. Harley easily spots a burger truck and sets to ordering as many delicious things as she can think of. She leaves the stand with about four burgers, two foot-long hotdogs, a large order of fries, and a steaming pile of onion rings. That's your Harley, you think. She's never been afraid to get what she wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember that that was exactly how she was when you two first met. You had just arrived in New York to visit an old friend. You got off the bus in a rather unsavory neighborhood. Not more than five minutes into walking towards your destination, you're blindsided by a mugger who pushed you into an alley. You knew he had messed with the wrong guy, and you were about to pull your own knife out of your coat when the guy is knocked flat to the ground by an oversized hammer. You looked up, and there she was: lithe and beautiful as ever. You knew who she was from the moment you saw her, so you were definitely surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a few more swings at the mugger, and he eventually ran off. You could only sit there, staring at her. \"Don't get used to it,\" she said in her Brooklyn accent. \"I ain't no hero or nothin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I buy you a drink?\" you asked before she can say anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"Why do you think I saved your sorry ass? I'm a girl who knows what she wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think fondly on those memories as you sit on a bench with her, enjoying your food. You wonder how you got so lucky. And it's even better now, especially since there's more of her to love, and more of a view for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know better, but to Ivy's surprise, Harley manages to finish the small mountain of food, patting her stuffed gut. \"That hit the spot,\" she says. \"But, now I want to get back to the apartment. You and I still have some unfinished business to do.\" She throws an arm around your shoulder with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the prospect of  more time for fooling around, you eagerly help her to her feet and the three of you make it back to the apartment. However, upon arrival...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Silence is broken the minute you open the door to the apartment. You hear the rapid fire of guns, at least three you think, one of them semi-automatic. You grab Harley's wrist and dive down for cover behind the couch. Ivy crouches behind the partially opened door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're still trying to discern the source of the sounds to know where they're at. You're almost inclined to say that they're waiting in the next building over, but Harley knows better. \"Two in the kitchen and one in the bedroom,\" she says. \"These guys are chumps if they think three was gonna be enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harley, wait,\" you say. \"You don't even have any of your weapons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta do somethin',\" she says with a pleading look. \"They messed with the wrong girl this time. This time, they're on my turf. I gots homefield advantage, puddin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can raise any objections, she kisses you on the cheek and stands up. \"Alright, ya bunch of under-bellied worms!\" she shouts. \"You asked for it. Here comes the mayhem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's something you haven't seen since the early days when you two were dating. Harley had been known to go through bouts of psychotic break-infused bursts of strength back when she was a villain...back when she used to date the Joker. This was the stuff of legends, and you knew a few former thugs who still had nightmares after having been on the receiving end of one of these attacks. However, ever since she had started dating you, those situations had become less and less frequent. Still, that hadn't changed the fact that you had seen them before, and they still did happen. It was probably some sort of residual effect from some of the weird shit Joker used to do to her. But now, you have to admit, it did come in handy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever happened during these things, Harley reached levels of speed, strength, and acrobatic skill you didn't think was possible for a human being. In a series of several cartwheels, she bounces into the bedroom and snaps the neck of the shooter in there with almost no effort. That's the most chilling part of these experiences: she can kill so effortlessly, and sometimes without even knowing she had done it. When you've asked her what these experiences are like, she describes it as some kind of high; senses heightened, and all that stuff. At the same time, she describes it like being in a dream, and she doesn't always have a grasp on reality during those sorts of things. When she comes out of it, she would tell you, it's like waking up in the wrong bed. She has no memory of where she was or what she had done for several minutes after. That's what scares you the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow in the bedroom, she's able to get a hold of her famous baseball bat. She comes tearing out of the room, blood-lust in her eyes. She runs for the first attacker in the kitchen. She throws her legs around his neck and pulls herself over his head. Before she can even get a swing in, her immense body weight causes his body to collapse, and you can hear several sickening snaps where his back breaks in several places. She gets a creepy gleam in her eye as she looks at her last opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, she had been dodging bullets like they were just part of the air around her. And the last shooter is in the middle of reloading his magazine when she sets her sights on him. You can read that look. That's the look of a cornered animal. He frantically tries to finish reloading, his hands shaking, but he's no match. She already lays into him with the baseball bat, striking his skull over and over again. You can hear each bloody crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe drops to the floor as Harley keeps swinging at him, and at last, her rage dissipates. She falls to her knees on the floor, gasping for breath. These episodes usually leave her pretty winded. You run to her and cradle her head in your arms, whispering words of comfort and telling her it's alright. She doesn't say anything, but you know those words will register with her eventually, and she'll be back to her old self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I guess the hit's still on,\" you say to no one in particular. \"God, these guys just never give up.\" You had just gotten the place cleaned up after their last attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third shooter suddenly stirs and starts crawling across the kitchen floor. He's easily stopped as a stray vine, courtesy of Ivy wraps around his throat and strangles the last bit of life out of him. \"Knowing a group like this, they probably won't stop until they finish the job,\" she says, sitting beside the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long do you two think you can keep this game of cat and mouse up, you wonder. This certainly isn't something you want to face for the rest of your lives. True, you know you and Harley can handle it, but what about the children? You look to Harley, who seems to be somewhat recovering. \"So, what are we going to do about this?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's still sitting there, rocking while holding her knees. You aren't sure if she's fully aware yet. These bouts take their time on her. Still, she's able to murmur one thing. </span></div></div>",

Let me handle these assassins.\" You said, calling Harley by her real name to emphasize how serious you were in your decision, especially since you didn't want to see Harley try and get herself killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, despite her reasonable protests, Harley reluctantly had to agree with you and Ivy, where Harley exhaled a deep frustrated sigh in response, just as you and Ivy gently sat her fattened rump down upon the large leathery couch, with Ivy sitting alongside the rotund clown girl, as Harley then spoke toward you and replied, \"*long sigh* ...Alright fine, puddin'. As much as I friggin' hate ta be sidelined, I'll sit out on this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not goin' ta ignore what just happen'd. Those Brooklyn Assassins Guild bastards aren't gettin' away with this.\" Harley growled, obviously wanting to make those assassins pay for coming after her, despite \"convincing\" them not to come after her anymore for that bounty on her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, Harl... Which is why I'm going over to their hideout and give them a few reasons not to take up that bounty on your head.\" You said, where you walked over toward the Pilot outfit from Titanfall, which was propped up by a mannequin, just as Ivy curiously queried, \"...And just how do you plan on doing that, (Name)?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you carefully pulled the jumpsuit, jetpack, helmet, and other essentials of the outfit off of the mannequin, slowly putting on the outfit in the process. First the gray jumpsuit, then the armored greaves, then the gauntlets, and the titanium tri-weave vest, which had Harley Quinn's trademark four red diamonds displayed front and center. However, it was also where the body armor was the strongest and the most reinforced, allowing you to shrug off small caliber bullets and even shotgun rounds with relative ease. Finally, there was the helmet. The helmet was made from titanium, with the visor made from plexiglass, laced with the most advanced communication and surveillance technology, complete with infrared, night-vision, and blacklight visions respectively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to them as (Name), Ivy...\" You quipped, as you then firmly placed the helmet upon your head, then turned on the voice modifier within your helmet, causing your voice to sound deeper and gravelly, as you then spoke back and continued, \"...I am going after the Brooklyn Assassins Guild as the vigilante Crosshairs.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Looks good on you, puddin'.\" Harley retorted, complimenting you in your new ensemble, just as you strapped on the handgun holsters to your thighs, then holstered an M92F handgun in each holster, then holstered a semi-automatic SCAR-H assault rifle along the left side of your back, adjacent to the compact yet highly versatile jetpack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe SCAR-H assault rifle was highly customized with an ACOG scope, tri-laser sight, hair trigger, and vertical foregrip. Overall, it was your preferred weapon of choice back when you were in the Navy SEALs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, just as you were about to leave toward the apartment building rooftop, Harley picked up her cell phone, dialing in a certain phone number as she spoke to you and said, \"I might be apartment-bound, puddin', but I'm not lettin' ya go there alone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coach? Yeah, it's me. Listen, we've got problems. Turns out dat hit on me is still in effect. Apparently, those Brooklyn Assassin whackjobs still want my head on a silva platta fer hella lotta cash. Fortunately fer us, that vigilante Crosshairs wants ta help get rid a' these meatheads fer us. Any a' da Harleys available?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, Harley heard what Coach had said over the phone, where she then said, \"...Mm-Hmm. Alright... Okay. Yeah, that'll do nicely, Coach. Make sure Bolly Quinn and Harvey Quinn're lock'd an' load'd when he gets there. Me? I'm still sore from fightin' at Skate Club t'night. Give the others my regards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Harley ended the call between her and Coach, who oversees the tenant building where the Gang of Harleys currently live in. Then, you heard Harley speak toward you and answered, \"Coach managed ta get some of da Harleys ta help ya out. You'll be workin' with Bolly Quinn an' Harvey Quinn this time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Harley.\" You replied, with the voice modifier distorting your real voice some. From there, you exited the apartment condo that you and Harley live in, rushing up the stairs and onto the roof with ease. From there, upon reaching the rooftop of the apartment building, you sprinted toward the edge of the building, then leaped off the edge, getting as much momentum as you possibly could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow normally, this would be a definitive way to get someone injured or killed. However, you were given a compact but powerful state of the art jetpack, which gave you increased momentum to reach the next building from across the street with relative ease, where you then diverolled onto the other rooftop to lessen the impact of the landing. Seconds later, you continued sprinting across the rooftops, using a mixture of parkour free-running and the jetpack for easier traversal.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>But whilst you swiftly traversed from rooftop to rooftop towards the apartment building where the Gang of Harleys reside, you subconsciously began to reminisce about how you first became the vigilante known as Crosshairs. And it all started with a certain Dark Knight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-- Gotham General Hospital, Gotham City --<br>\r\n-- Six Months Ago --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after Commissioner Gordon had calmly left the hospital room you were currently residing in, you slowly began to gently stroke the sleeping Harley Quinn's red and black hair, obviously out of comfort toward the clown girl. However, moments later, you suddenly heard your smartphone ringing, which stirred you from your current activity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, in an attempt to silence the smartphone to allow Harley to get some rest, you slowly grabbed the smartphone, where you looked at the Caller ID to see who was calling you, only for it to come up as \"Caller ID: Unknown\", which made you even more suspicious over who was calling you at this time of night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft with little to no alternative, you pressed the \"Accept Call\" button, then placed the smartphone against your right ear, spoke into it and cautiously said, \"...Hello? Who is this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Who do think it is, Lieutenant Commander (First Name and Last Name)?\" A voice rang out on the phone. Judging from the voice's sound and tone, it was undeniably deep and masculine in texture, obviously to disguise the real identity of the person you were speaking to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of suspicion, you made an estimated guess as to who it could be, as you calmly retorted, \"...Judging from your voice, I'm guessing that I am talking to the one and only Batman.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brief moment or two of silence passed by, where you then spoke toward him on your smartphone and asked, \"So... Why are you talking to me, Dark Knight? Are you here for me, or for Harley?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both. I've already been informed of your relationship with Dr. Quinzel over the past 2 months, ever since she left Gotham to live in Brooklyn.\" He bluntly answered, being rather straightforward with you on such information, confirming that he has secretly been keeping tabs on Harley ever since she left Gotham City,  especially since Harley was a known accomplice of the Joker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this undoubtedly made you suspicious of who you were speaking to, your brow furrowed in a cautious manner, as you then carefully spoke toward Batman and queried, \"So where are you now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...It doesn't matter. What's important now is the status quo regarding Dr. Quinzel, Lieutenant Commander.\" Batman flatly answered, his semi-gravelly voice not changing a single octave in tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you obviously knew what he meant regarding what to do with Harley, as you then spoke toward him and retorted, \"So, what? You plan to lock up Harley in Arkham Asylum or Blackgate? Even after she went through all that trouble just to rescue me from her psychotic ex-boyfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Normally, yes, considering her affiliation with the Joker and her past crimes as Harley Quinn. However, against my better judgement... I am considering letting her walk. For now.\" He bluntly explained, which easily surprised you, consider from the stuff you've heard about Batman being a stern but stubborn individual when it came to delivering justice upon the criminals of Gotham.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing there's a catch, isn't there?\" You queried, figuring that Batman wasn't going to let Harley walk free without a price, where he then promptly answered, \"...In a manner of speaking.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* Alright, so what can I do for you?\" You queried, wondering what exactly did Batman had in mind. However, you soon found out what he had in mind, as he then bluntly explained, \"...I plan on creating a network of vigilantes that can operate outside of Gotham, and I want you to become one of this network's first wave of vigilantes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you want me to work for you?! I thought you had those other crime-fighters in your supposed \"Bat Family\", like Robin and that Nightwing guy in Bl\u00fcdhaven, or even Batwoman and Batgirl. Why me?\" You asked, obviously taken aback some by such a bold proposal coming from the World's Greatest Detective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, despite your surprised tone, the Batman wasn't so easily wavered by such doubts, as he then spoke toward you and flatly explained, \"...You were awarded a Purple Heart for your services in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as a Silver Star in Operation: Neptune Spear during your time with Navy SEALs Team Six. That, and you managed to keep Quinn in line.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing such reasons from the Caped Crusader, you began to contemplate on your decision. At first, you wanted to decline Batman's offer. However, every now and then, you'd often miss the adrenaline-induced excitement that came from fighting against multiple enemies. Eventually, you inevitably came to a final decision as you then answered, \"...Fine. I accept your offer, Dark Knight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-- Brooklyn District --<br>\r\n-- New York, New York --<br>\r\n-- Present Day --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after reminiscing about you ended up becoming a part of Batman's network of vigilantes, you inevitably made it to the Gand of Harleys apartment building, using the compact yet highly versatile jetpack to catapult up the side of the building until you landed on the rooftop with relative ease.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once you firmly landed upon the rooftop of the apartment building, you were soon greeted by a familiar individual, where she spoke toward you and remarked, \"For a guy who's new here, you certainly know how to make an entrance.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, in response to the voice you've just heard, you calmly stood upright from your dramatic superhero landing pose, where you soon gazed upon who spoke to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, she was a young red-haired woman in her mid 20s, complete with a petite body type. She wore a yellow T-shirt, olive drab green shorts, and a pair of gray tennis shoes, along with a pair of black sunglasses adorned upon her face. However, unlike you and Harley, the woman was undoubtedly paraplegic, as she calmly approached you in her wheelchair. Overall, this was none other than Holly Hamden, better known as \"Coach\", Harley Quinn's personally appointed overseer of the Gang of Harleys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, you calmly approached the paraplegic Coach, speaking toward her with a somewhat distorted voice due to the helmet's voice modifier as you queried, \"Are Bolly Quinn and Harvey Quinn ready?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Pretty much. They're itchin' for a fight, that's for damn sure.\" Coach answered, as you calmly followed her inside the apartment building, passing by some of the other Gang of Harleys members, just as Coach then asked, \"How's the boss doin'?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...She's holding up, considering that she just killed her would-be assassins.\" You explained, just as both you and Coach had inevitably arrived at the Locker Room, where you saw both Bolly Quinn and Harvey Quinn gearing up with a few firearms and some melee weapons, such as a bloodied baseball bat for Bolly Quinn, and a pair of spiky brass knuckles for Harvey Quinn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, Bolly Quinn was a woman of Asian Indian descent, while Harvey Quinn was a Caucasian man. Both individuals wore mostly similar attire to your beloved Harley Quinn, only instead of their outfit colors being the same as their boss, Bolly Quinn's outfit was colored orange and black, while Harvey Quinn's outfit was green and black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, both Bolly and Harvey soon took notice of you, as Bolly Quinn looked at you, propping her bloodied baseball bat against her right shoulder, where she approached both you and Coach as she quipped, \"Yo, Coach! Who's the tin man in the military getup?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This \"Tin Man\" just so happened to be sent here by your boss.\" You retorted, getting right in Bolly's face in a passive-aggressive manner, obviously not amused by Bolly Quinn's questionable remark. However, just as the tension was about to boil over, Harvey Quinn soon stepped in and quickly retorted, \"Easy, Bolly Quinn!  That's that vigilante dude, Crosshairs. Y'know, the guy who took out Blockbuster's gun smugglin' operation here in Brooklyn?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Bolly Quinn's eyes sifted up and down to get a better look at you, where she then spoke toward you and sarcastically retorted, \"Hmph. And here I thought you'd look...scarier. For a badass.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get that a lot. So, Coach tell you what we're gonna be doing tonight?\" You said, where Harvey Quinn then quickly replied, \"Yeah. The boss has some problems with these Brooklyn Assassins Guild mooks, and we're supposed to take 'em out fer good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Exactly. C'mon, we've got work to do.\" You retorted, where you then headed back up toward the apartment building rooftop, where you then dove off the rooftop, using the compact jetpack to slow down your descent and glide toward one of the nearby rooftops with ease. Of course, both Bolly Quinn and Harvey Quinn had to go the opposite route, using the newly acquired Harley Van to traverse the urban streets of Brooklyn, despite easily violating the city speed limits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, you managed to keep up with the Harley Van, where you subconsciously thought to yourself as you thought, \"Okay... Note to self: Need to get myself my own set of wheels.\" Eventually, after traversing across twenty blocks of rooftops, you, Bolly, and Harvey managed to rendezvous at the new hideout for the Brooklyn Assassins Guild, which happened to be...</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile, on the streets below, Bolly Quinn and Harvey Quinn were currently inside the Harley Van, waiting for the right time to storm inside the building, hoping to avenge the rotund Harley Quinn for the failed assassination attempt on her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, after seeing two biker thugs enter inside the Knife's Twist, you placed your left index and middle finger against the Comms button on your helmet, which was wirelessly connected to the two-way radio inside the Harley Van, where you then spoke toward both Bolly Quinn and Harvey Quinn and said, \"It looks like the Knife's Twist got itself a full house tonight. I'll go in from the back. Bolly, Harvey, you two take the front door.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it. We'll wait fer yer signal.\" Harvey retorted, where you then used your compact jetpack to swiftly traverse onto the rooftop of the Knife's Twist bar, where you landed as silently as possible to avert arousing suspicion. Of course, the rooftop was guarded by a sniper, so you cautiously snuck up behind the sniper, where you swiftly pulled him back and quickly snapped his neck like a twig, killing him instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you stealthily entered the building via doorway on the roof, where you slowly made your way down the stairs, easily sticking to the shadows to avoid detection. Eventually, you made your way near a balcony overlooking the main lobby of the Knife's Twist, staying behind an alcove due to noticing how many Brooklyn Assassins Guild members that were currently present in the bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you had to make an estimated guess, there would have to be at least 60 individuals before you. Of course, you had a few options to deal with these mooks. First, you could stay hidden and eavesdrop on their conversation, since this looks like they're here for some sort of meeting. On the other hand, you could just launch a preemptive strike against the Brooklyn Assassins Guild, getting the jump on them. Inevitably, you had to make a decision...and soon.</span></div></div>",

After all, it might potentially lead you to whoever took up that bounty on Harley's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you tapped the Comms button on your helmet, contacting Harley as you said, \"Crosshairs to Harley. Do you copy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- Harley Quinn's Apartment ---<br>\r\n-- Coney Island, New York City --<br>\r\n-- 10 Seconds Earlier --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back at the apartment, Harley and Ivy were currently painting each other's fingernails, with Ivy having her nails painted a rich shade of green, while Harley's nails were painted a combination of red and black. Of course, since you were out going after whoever placed that hit on her, Harley might as well have some downtime with her favorite gal-pal, Pamela Isley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Crosshairs to Harley. Do you copy?\" A voice rang up on her tablet, as she instantly recognized that it was you. From there, Ivy promptly picked up the tablet due to the fingernail polish on Harley's nails were still drying, placing it in front of the substantially larger clown girl, where Harley then spoke into the tablet and replied, \"Yeah, I can 'ear ya, (Name). Did ya find those bastards?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm currently inside that rundown bar, The Knife's Twist. It looks like a bunch of these Brooklyn Assassins Guild punks are waiting for someone important.\" You calmly whispered, attempting to stay inconspicuous and incognito from a little over two dozen professional killers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as Harley was about to answer back, you soon witnessed someone distinct approach the rundown patched up stage. You quickly switched the Comms function in your helmet from auditory to visual, as you carefully poked your head out from behind cover, all focused upon the distinguished individual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, the individual was undoubtedly male, who wore a black ski mask to cover up his identity. He wore a white sweatshirt hoodie underneath a puffy blue vest. Also, he wore military boots and grey cargo pants. Suffice to say, the man certainly had acquired tastes when it came to fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Harley and Ivy saw this new individual upon the tablet screen, both becoming surprised, instantly recognizing who this guy was with, as you heard Ivy then said, \"Say, that man looks like he's a member of -\" \"Blubberpot's crew? *hmph* I figur'd as much, Red.\" Harley huffed, obviously sounding rather pissed off from such an unwanted revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you soon realize who the rotund Harley Quinn was referring to: Oswald Chesterfield Cobblepot, better known throughout the rest of the Gotham City underworld...as \"The Penguin\". The reason why he was called by such a name was due to the man's short stature and bulbous physique, along with a prominent hooked nose, which merely imitated the look of a Penguin's beak. However, from what Harley had previously told you about him during some of those long dating sessions with her, Cobblepot was much more threatening than his nickname would have you and many others would believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from his eccentric love for birds and umbrellas, the Penguin was anything but a joke. Cobblepot was an eccentric criminal mastermind, using his popular Iceberg Lounge nightclub as a front for numerous illegal activities, such as supplying Gotham's criminals with illegal firearms, as well as gathering information in the criminal underworld. A real bonafide \"Gentleman of Crime\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, from what Harley had told you on several occasions when she mentioned the Penguin, Cobblepot wasn't exactly on good terms with both her and her now ex-boyfriend, The Joker. In fact, Penguin had a deep hatred toward both of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what your memories of you and Harley had shown (Back when Harley was halfway to weighing 500 pounds), this whole hatred thing began on the opening night for the Iceberg Lounge. Oswald felt proud to have finally gained respect, so he invited the Joker and Harley Quinn and offered them a free drink. However, when a waitress arrived, she tripped and accidentally spilled the drink on the Joker. In response, this led to Joker spraying acid on the woman's face with his flower, which then led to Joker and Harley trashing the club and fleeing into the night. Enraged at Joker for ruining his party, killing his waitress, and tarnishing his reputation, Penguin developed a deep hatred of both Joker and Harley Quinn, and the rest was history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Harley called Penguin \"Blubberpot\" just to insult him, even though she's now sporting some blubber of her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still... Why would Penguin send one of his men all the way out to New York?\" You queried, where Harley soon quipped, \"I...don't know, sweetie. But I got a feelin' dat he ain't 'ere fer the scenery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you continued eavesdropping on the meeting, only to soon find out that...</span></div></div>",

You are gathered here today because my boss, Mr. Cobblepot, is generous enough to allow you to retain control of your businesses, and he wants to extend you an offer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. What kind of offer?\" One of the Brooklyn Assassins queried, his appearance akin to that of a stereotypical biker gang member. Obviously, you could see that there were some who seem skeptical of the Penguin's intentions. However, the Penguin thug soon retorted, \"...The kind of offer you simply can't refuse. Any more stupid questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room went silent for a brief moment, with the Penguin thug then began to speak as he explained, \"Now then, Mr. Cobblepot's plans for this city are two-fold.

And the reward, whether she's brought in dead or alive, will be approximately 5 million dollars. However, there's a bonus of nine hundred thousand dollars if she's brought to Mr. Cobblepot alive, as well as a discount on any weapons bought within 2 years.\" The Penguin thug elaborated, which seemed to sit very nicely with the various Brooklyn Assassins Guild members, each of them nodding to each other in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the sounds of things, this was not good at all whatsoever for you and the substantially larger Harley Quinn, as it sounded like the Penguin was keen on expanding his operations, as well as getting revenge on Harley for what she and the Joker had done many moons ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your mind, you knew you had to do something quick, right here, right now.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From the sounds of things, this was not good at all whatsoever for you and the substantially larger Harley Quinn, as it sounded like the Penguin was keen on expanding his operations, as well as getting revenge on Harley for what she and the Joker had done many moons ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your mind, you knew you had to do something quick, right here, right now. Inevitably, after a brief contemplation, you decided to go with the loud approach, as you then radioed in to Harvey and Bolly Quinn and said, \"...You get all that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Sounds like the boss is in deep shit if we don't do something fast.\" Bolly Quinn replied, as Harvey Quinn then butted in and retorted, \"So... Got any ideas?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you soon said, \"...Ram the van through the front door. We're going in loud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With pleasure.\" Bolly Quinn answered, as you then heard the muffled sounds of the Gang of Harleys van blitzing into the front of the building, causing brick and mortar to blast apart in an explosive manner as the van plowed it's way through the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this soon got the attention of both the Penguin thug and the several dozen Brooklyn Assassins Guild members, who were caught by surprise, with several of them exclaiming, \"WHAT THE HELL!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to interrupt your party, boys! But our boss sends her regards.\" Bolly Quinn quipped, where she laid in on the nearest assassin with a spiked baseball bat, with Harvey Quinn following in suit, armed with a SPAS-12 shotgun. In turn, the Penguin thug then shouted, \"Don't just stand there! Kill them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as the Brooklyn Assassins Guild members began to open fire upon the two Gang of Harleys members, you unholstered your dual handguns and remarked, \"Time I got myself involved.\" From there, you corkscrew flipped from your hiding spot, firing some well-placed shots upon several assassins before landing to continuing the fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit!! It's Crosshairs!! SHOOT HIM!!!\" A Brooklyn Assassins Guild member shouted, where you then quickly stood up, pointing your pistols at two Assassins Guild members, speaking to the through your augmented voice and remarked, \"Sorry, boys. Party's over! Put down the guns, or things will get ugly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw this asshole! Get him!!\" Another Brooklyn Assassins Guild member exclaimed, rallying his comrades to attack you. But of course, you instinctively bobbed and weaved through their attacks with several flips and spins, much to your subconscious's surprise, firing off several vital shots at some of the assailants, with Bolly and Harvey Quinn joining you in the assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, this was gonna be a long fight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-- 8 Minutes Later... --</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, you, Bolly, and Harvey Quinn managed to incapacitate and restrain most of the Brooklyn Assassins Guild members, except for those who were dealt with fatal injuries. Of course, you were in the middle of interrogating the Penguin thug, where you then said, \"...Then give the Penguin a message for me: Tell him if he attempts to take the lives of Harley Quinn and any of the denizens of Coney Island, losing some business partners will be the least of his worries.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, you violently knocked the Penguin thug unconscious with a nasty pistol whip to the right temple. \"*sigh* ...Well, that could've gotten worse.\" You said, holstering your handguns in the side holsters, as Bolly Quinn wiped the sweat from her brow and retorted, \"I'll say. Who were they even talking about, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds to me like the Brooklyn Assassins Guild was in a partnership with  none other than Oswald Cobblepot.\" You answered, which seemed to confuse the two members of the Gang of Harleys, as Harvey Quinn cocked an eyebrow and asked, \"...Who the hell is Oswald Cobblepot?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oswald Cobblepot is one of Gotham City's most prolific crime lords. Though, he is commonly referred to as \"The Penguin\", due to his physical appearance. Judging from the bounty he has on your boss's head, it sounds like he and Harley Quinn have some bad blood between each other.\" You explained, which made Bolly and Harvey Quinn realize that Penguin might be making a move against their rotund boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course, before you could divulge any further, the three of you soon heard the distant sounds of police sirens, which seemed to be approaching the Knife's Twist. With little to no choice, the three of you escaped the area, with Bolly and Harvey Quinn escaping in the van, whilst you quickly jettisoned onto the nearby rooftops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, after getting some distance from the Knife's Twist bar,  you decided to call Harley, just to see if she was alright while you were away, as you tapped the Comm button on the side of your helmet and said, \"...Everything alright on your end, Harley?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*relieved sigh* It's 'bout time! Ya had me worried, puddin'.\" Harley quipped, her voice having a subtle concerned tone, in which you replied, \"I know. But still, at least we now know who is taking up that bounty on your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, get yer sexy ass back over 'ere, puddin. I think ye deserve a break.\" Harley retorted, which you mildly chuckled in response and replied, \"On my way, honey.\" And with that, you resumed your way across the rooftops towards the apartment complex on Coney Island, back to Harley. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A thin sheet of rain started to fall as you continued your rooftop run, making your footing a bit more treacherous. The sound of sirens was soon lost behind you in the cacophony of the still bustling city streets. Before long, your destination was in sight, the bright lights of the rides and attractions acting like a beacon in the night. That \u2013 as well as the thought of Harley\u2019s smiling cherubic face \u2013 spurred you on and you made the last series of jumps to land on the apartment building\u2019s roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome commotion from down below made you pause and look back over the edge. You could hear loud voices coming from down below, but couldn\u2019t make out the words. You were starting to get a bit concerned, but then a woman came dashing out into the rain. Even from your vantage point, you could tell that her jaw was set and her fists were balled. Following in her wake, you saw Mason run after her. The woman wasn\u2019t willing to listen to him though, and shoved him back and yelled for him to leave her alone. She took off and soon vanished around a corner, leaving Mason standing in the rain. You felt for the ex-con, but you had another matter to deal with, namely a girlfriend that tended to have a short temper and even short patience. A short jaunt down the elevator and you stepped back into your apartment, water dripping from your armor as you slid the helmet off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarley, I\u2019m back,\u201d you called, looking around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no sign of your girthy girlfriend though. As quietly as you could, you sat your helmet down and slid one of the pistols free. There was no further sign of combat; in fact some of what had happened before had been cleaned up while you were gone. You weren\u2019t taking a chance though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking your way through the room, you tried to keep your head on a swivel. The muted creak of a floorboard was all you heard. Before you could react, a weight slammed into your back almost knocking you to the floor. You tried to bring your pistol to bear but a familiar laugh made you stop. Twisting around in her grasp, you came face to face with Harley. She had a wide grin on her face even as she looked down at the handgun in your grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t scare ya too much, did I, puddin\u2019?\u201d she asked as she nuzzled your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, you admitted that with the goons you had fought off here and then taking the fight to them, you were just being cautious when you didn\u2019t see her right away. This brought a more satisfied smile to her rounded face and she gave you a quick peck before stepping back. Now with a bit of space, you saw that she had changed into a silky sheer babydoll that would have been a small tent for almost anyone else. On her fleshy form though, it could barely wrap around her and exposed a large crescent of her gut below the hem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t tear your eyes off of her, but a thought still wormed into your head, \u201cWhere\u2019s Ivy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, ain\u2019t I \u2018nuff for ya, baby?\u201d she asked putting on puppy dog eyes and a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a grimace cross your face for a moment till you saw the twinkle in Harley\u2019s eyes as well. Rather than say anything in response though, you instead stepped closer to her and pulled her into a lip crushing kiss. You could feel her heartbeat pounding against you even through your armor, as well as the heat washing off of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally stepped back, panting for breath, you said huskily, \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to get interrupted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, so that\u2019s your game?\u201d Harley asked, batting her eyelashes. \u201cWell, ya don\u2019t have worry ta about that, Red said somethin\u2019 about needing ta make a quick trip ta the park uptown. She said she\u2019d give a call before dropping in again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, you dropped your weapons to the ground and started to tear sections of the armor off, while Harley looked on with her smile back in place.</span></div></div>",

From there, you slowly turned to your right, taking in the full view of an aptly slumbering Harley Quinn, who was currently wearing only her patchworked red and black bra and panties, her signature pigtails undone, leaving her somewhat lengthy mesmerized in a tangled amalgamation of ruby red and deep cobalt blue, all whilst her rotund body laid on it's left side in a semi-fetal position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you couldn't help but find it quite adorable the way Harley was currently slumbering. However, as you slowly and quietly dismounted from the luxurious bed, you soon heard Harley mumbling in her sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Nngh... Com'back 'ere, Mistah J... *groan* Ah got an ass spanking with ya...name on it... *murmur*\"</i> She mumbled in her sleep, just as Harley turned onto her back, her bulky bulbous derriere firmly pressing against the soft velvet mattress. Suffice to say, you were hoping that Harley was beating the snot out of the Joker in La-La Land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, after getting a shower and proper grooming, you exited the bedroom in some sweatpants and a God of War III T-Shirt, giving Harley some more beauty sleep, whilst you prepared a substantial breakfast for her by the time she awakens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, whilst you were mixing the pancake batter, you heard the muffled sounds of footprints approaching from behind you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sense of hearing was undoubtedly more acute than you remember, as you were able to easily tell that it wasn't Harley. After all, each footstep sounded much lighter than one can expect from someone weighing a little over five hundred pounds. So, you wagered a guess and subconsciously quipped, \"Morning, Ivy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Yawn* Well, at least I'm not the only one awake.\" She retorted, thus confirming that it was indeed Ivy. From there, as you poured the pancake batter into the large frying pan, you spoke toward Ivy and asked, \"...So, I take it that your trip uptown was pleasant?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...As much as one would expect, (Name).\" Ivy calmly replied, as she sat herself on one of the bar stools, taking a swig from a glass of premium organic Orange Juice. Judging from her tone, it seemed as if something was bothering her. So, in response, you turned around to face the redhead and said, \"...Well, it sounds like <b>something</b> seems to be bothering you, Red. What seems to be the problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...During my trip to Central Park, the plants confessed a disturbing truth to me. They've conversed with their siblings in Gotham, and have revealed a, um... <b>concerning</b> revelation.\" Ivy explained, which strangely made you concerned as well. After all, back when Harley first introduced you to Ivy, Harley explained how Ivy can talk to plants like how Aquaman can communicate with marine life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Or at least, that's what these \"False\" memories that go with this reality have shown you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, something in your gut told you that Ivy was trying to tell you something, as your eyebrows furrowed in suspicion and questioned, \"...Why do I get this gnawing feeling that you know something, Ivy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm afraid so, (Name). Last night, the plants warned me that that annoying little bastard Cobblepot is going to retaliate against what happened yesterday.\" She explained, which quickly made you all the more concerned when Ivy confessed such a thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I thought I made it loud and clear for him to not hunt down Harley.\" You retorted, in which Ivy looked at you with a rhetoric yet stern expression on her flawless face and answered, \"Heh. If you knew him as much as Harley and I, you should know that the Penguin is far too stubborn to back down, especially if he's being threatened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, after pacing back and forth in great concern, you soon lashed out, as you punched the Kitchen counter top and roared, \"FUCK!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what did you expect, lover boy? Cobblepot isn't some two-bit thug from the Bronx. After all, there's a reason why he's been called \"The Gentleman of Crime\".\" Ivy retorted, obviously having a mildly smug \"I told you so\" expression on her face, as if she was expecting this. Then again, both she and Harley have dealt with the likes of Penguin on numerous occasions, so of course she would've had an inkling on what Cobblepot's next move would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after calming yourself down, you sifted through your short hair and then asked, \"*sigh* ...Okay, so he isn't backing off. What do we do now?\" \"...Well, all I can say for sure that the borough is going to get a nasty wake-up call when Penguin arrives with a small army.\" Ivy explained, knowing with certainty that Penguin's gonna be on the warpath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you got a feeling that it was going to get bloody.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sho... <b>*yawn*</b> What's shakin', Red?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*sigh*</b>...Hate to be a bearer of bad new, Harleen, but... It seems Penguin wants payback for what went down yesterday.\" Ivy hesitantly explained, not exactly the type to be a downer for the pale-skinned quarter-ton clown girl that is Harley Quinn, especially in life-threatening situations such as the conspiracy they've unwittingly found themselves in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, much to you and Ivy's surprise, Harley was...actually pretty calm about this, as she kinked her neck with a muffled <b>*Pop!*</b> in response, to which she then performed a few leg stretches, which left little to the imagination in regards to the overall circumference of her thunder thighs, to which she then replied by saying, \"Psshh! Yeah, so what? It's not like we haven't gone thru worse, right Red?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harley, this is serious. We're talking about how one of your ex-boyfriend's worst enemies is now gunning for our goddamn heads.\" You interjected, adjusting your voice to not sound too aggressive while also staying firm, as the corpulent Clown Princess of Crime then stood back up to do several arm stretches (Or at least, about as much she can physically do at her current size and girth), arching her back, which made her black and red babydoll tee ride up her hefty gut just an inch or three, exposing just a little more chalk white belly flesh for any and all onlookers to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, one thing's for sure; You were certainly starting to enjoy seeing this newer, fatter Harley Quinn before you, where you felt a small but prominent bulge spring up a tad in your pants, but that was a mildly noticeable feeling at the moment, as Harley soon lumbered over toward you, her partially exposed apron of a stomach casually brushing up against your form with surprisingly little effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Harley gave you a quick but compassionate peck on the lips in reassurance and then retorted, \"...I'm well aware of dat, (Name). Stupid Blubberpot was gonna come afta me, anyway. But y'know what? I'm done runnin'.\" She reached into the fridge and cooked up a large chili-dog submarine sandwich, taking a greasy bite out the messy cuisine, where she then spoke, cheeks still packed full of food, and continued, \"Ah made a shitload of mishtakesh vhen I wash wit' Mishtah J, <b>*Nom!* *Chew* *Chew*</b> -- But if Blubberpot wantsh ta throwdown -- <b>*Chew* *Gulp!*</b> -- Ah'll be happy to oblige!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you completely understand what she was going to do with this whole Penguin debacle, you still questioned, \"...Okay, I understand your intentions, Harley, but...If Penguin <i>does</i> come knocking, you got a plan to deal with him and his goons? I mean, sure you got me, Ivy, your Gang of Harleys Big Tony, and the other tenants, but...Will that even be enough?\" In response to your question, Harley swiftly finished off the chili-dog sub she was wolfing down on, wiped a bit of the residue chili from her mouth with a meaty arm, and casually waddled over to you. From there, as if to assert some form of mild seduction over you, she firmly pressed her flabby bulge of a abdomen against your flat-toned abs, which also caused her voluminous breasts to smoosh against your pectoral muscles as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you were backed up against the kitchen island, so you were essentially between a fat pregnant rock and a hard place, as Harley placed her hands upon her wide burgeoning hips with a huffed grinning expression, then finally answered, \"...Don't worry so much, Puddin'. Y'know I always got plans for those bozos an' their nosy boss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An' besides...\" She quipped, administering a firm yet sexy slap of the hand upon her chair-crushing behind, which caused the adipose on her ballooned posterior to jiggle and wobble some like a bowl of gelatin, obviously to get you a little heated under the collar. And then, she soon continued, \"...I might weigh as much as two prized piggies at a Country Fair, but I can sure crush 'em like anvils!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, you figured she would make an explicit comparison to a Looney Tunes cartoon, since she behaved like someone who's nuts over such unrealistic shenanigans. And with a coy yet reassuring pat on your cheek, Harley then quickly turned her hefty self around with a turn of a chubby heel, then happily trotted off back towards the bedroom, with a heavy yet playful skip in her lumbering step, which confused Ivy a little, as she cocked an eyebrow whilst placing her hands on her hips and asking, \"...And what exactly do you plan to do in the meantime, Harl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomentarily, just as her body was just in the doorway, Harley gazed back at you and Ivy with her blue eyes and a calm smile on her cherubic face as she simply retorted, \"Goin' t'my day job, of course! Sy's gonna wonda how I'm doin'.\" And with that, she casually waddled back into the bedroom, disappearing from view. Of course, your brain once more had to fill you in on who your 500+ pound eccentric girlfriend was referring to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man that Harley was referring to was an old guy named Sylvester Borgman, otherwise known as <i>\"Sy Borgman\"</i>. Apparently, he was some sort of Soviet super-spy during the Cold War, complete with an impressive set of cyborg prosthetics from such a bygone era. Now, as to how this relates to Harley, she was working as a psychiatrist at the Free Spirit Assisted Living Home where Borgman lives with the other elderly folks, and he <i>\"hired\"</i> her for his final mission -- To kill the eight Russian spies who left him bound to a wheelchair in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Author Note: Yeah, it's a little weird. Don't worry, you'll get used to it.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, he's been one of Harley's many new allies during her tenure as the wacky landlady of an apartment complex on Coney Island, as you then returned to shortly thereafter the brief mental recap. Of course, this left you questioning a little as to how Harley could maintain having a working job as a psychiatrist despite her...<i>previous career</i>, you could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, just as you were able to concoct a reasonable response given your girlfriend's distinct appearance, Harley then waddled out of the bedroom, looking drastically different than earlier. Aside from the enlarged business attire and labcoat that would e more akin to a small tent on a regular-sized person,the first thing you clearly noticed about Harley was undoubtedly her skin tone. Instead of a bleached chalk white like you're used to, Harley was somehow able to disguise her bleached skin to make it appear as if she has a normal Caucasian skin tone, most likely from applying some substantial amount of facial makeup on her face, hands, neck, and any exposed skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd second, instead of her zany matching color palette of permanently dyed red and blue hair, Harley now sported a set of golden blonde hair, neatly formed up into a business hair bun. Obviously, you figured she was most likely wearing a custom-made wig or something similar. Yet, despite her formal-looking attire, you can easily tell how she tucked her belly into her business skirt a little, which gave off a slight bulge along the hem of her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as straightened out her eyeglasses, Harley then twirled in place some to give you and Ivy a good look at her in such a disguise, then cheekily asked, \"...Well, how do I look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Was all you could mutter, obviously astonished at how she looked, as if she never became the Joker's henchwoman prior. From there, Harley let out quite a chuckle at your reaction, to which she then calmly lumbered up to you, wrapped her meaty arms around your shoulders, and seductively whispered in your ear and quipped, \"...Glad I can still knock ya flat, Puddin'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Harley then swiftly grabbed her purse and briefcase for today's appointments at the Living Home, blowing you a kiss as she lumbered out the door, heading towards her workplace as if it was an everyday recurrence. Suffice to say, you felt rather speechless in a sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Ivy managed to snap you out of it with a quick flick of a vine from a nearby flower pot, where you instinctively blinked twice to thrice, then turned back to Ivy and said, \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, considering you were ogling at my best friend for a bit too long for my liking.\" Ivy flatly retorted, to which she then began to tend to her <i>\"Children\"</i> currently living in the apartment condo with you and the hefty Harley, which felt like the least weirdest thing you've seen this week ironically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, with more than enough free time on your hands, you ultimately decided to...</span></div></div>",

One of these days I might just shoot you on accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh! Well, you're certainly too high-strung for your own good, that's for sure.\" He rebutted, cleaning his hands a little, just as Goatboy then loaded up another pair of garbage bags onto the catapult's metallic bucket. From there, as if on muscle memory, you bumped fists with the little person, as if it was a normal occurrence for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what you remember via reading a few Harley Quinn comics, Big Tony is one of the apartment's more prominent residents, alongside the aforementioned Goatboy, as well as Madame Macabre, who owns a wax museum comprised of various killers and murderers, including one of Harley's ex-boyfriend, the Joker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nickname itself was supposed to be ironic, considering Tony's short but muscular physique. However, he's known to be a close friend of Harley when she moved in as the new apartment landlady. In fact, Big Tony was the owner of a sideshow cabaret of sorts, to which Harley would sometimes perform on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, he's really good with firearms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... What brings the Lardlady's boy-toy up here, anyway?\" Goatboy sarcastically retorted, obviously making a <i>\"small\"</i> jab towards Harley's fattened waistline, finally loading up the last bag of garbage onto the catapult. Obviously, you gave a bit of a evil eye at the sideshow oddity, who shrunk back slightly, especially since you were still packing heat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you soon replied, \"...Came up here to find out what was making all that noise. Nothing more.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. You were curious, eh?\" Big Tony grinned, putting his hands in the pockets of his leather jacket, to which he then explained, \"Sorry 'bout that. We had a bit of a mess last night downstairs, so we're usin' this bad boy here to get rid of it all.\" He then motioned towards the scrappy catapult, giving it a firm pat once or twice to emphasize it's sturdiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She a beaut, isn't she? 'Boss came up with it when we had a garbage problem many moons ago. We call it...The Scatapult!\" He rebutted, akin to a car collector with his favorite exotic vehicle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Scatapult... ...Well, that explains a lot. This probably must be one of Harley's ideas.\"</i> You thought briefly, gaining clarity to the metaphorical elephant in the room, just in time to witness Goatboy violently pull back an adjacent lever towards him, which caused the Scatapult to launch it's stench-ridden cargo with a violent upward swing, thus sending it flying at one of many unsuspecting targets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Which just so happened to be an office building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flung bags of garbage splattered all over the pristine windows of the aforementioned building, to which Goatboy and Big Tony had quite a laugh at what the occupants' reactions upon seeing flying garbage, though you eventually joined in upon imagining the looks on the office workers' faces on such a outlandish and absurd concept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can certainly see why Harley came up with this crazy idea.\" You quipped, to which Big Tony and the sideshow oddity that was Goatboy settled down somewhat, as the duo then repeated the process once more via retracting the Scatapult back to a prepped position. But then, whilst he assisted the human-goat hybrid in loading up another batch of garbage bags, Big Tony continued speaking with you and asked, \"...Speakin' of ladies, how's our favorite Fat Clown Lady doin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, it was a slight non-threatening jest on the behalf of Harley's now-established weight and girth, which would've probably be akin to a compliment for someone like Harley Quinn. Shortly after exhaling a breath, you soon spoke to Tony and elaborated, \"...She's doing...okay, per say. Though...I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, Tony; I'm honestly worried about her at times. I mean, I know she can handle herself just fine, but...We just found out that the Penguin is now gunning for her head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I heard about him. Some weird eccentric crime boss from Gotham's underworld who's obsessed with umbrellas.\" Big Tony rebutted, briefly smoking a cigarette, inhaling it once then puffing out some smoke in the process. From there, the diminutive badass then looked back at you and calmly retorted, \"...However, I've known Harley long enough to know that she's one tough bitch. A fat one for sure, but still tough nonetheless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with another puff of smoke, Tony soon brought up a rather unexpected question in your opinion and bluntly stated, \"...And speakin' of Heavy Harley, when are you gonna pop her the question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honesty, you didn't expect him to bring up such an important topic like marriage. Then again, you have been thinking about such a thing from time to time, considering how close you've gotten with the rotund clown girl. Inevitably, you then spoke to the shorter man, scratching the back of your head some, and eventually answered, \"Honestly, Tony...\"</span></div></div>",

From there, shortly after puffing out smoke from his mouth, the shorter man looked back at you and questioned, \"...How so, kid?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*sigh*</b> Look, we're not talking about some girl I've found on some cruddy dating site, Tony. We're talking about Harley motherfucking Quinn here!\" You flatly retorted, to which you momentarily ceased to calm your nerves then continued, \"I mean...Sure she's a bonafide badass in her own right, but...at times, I feel like I'm only kidding myself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, it felt as if you were talking to a psychologist instead of a tough-as-nails individual like Big Tony.  Yet ironically, you felt like you could confide in him, despite initially being a fictional character, where you soon elaborated, \"...I'm just...honestly not sure if I should pop the question to her, considering what she went through with the Joker, having a relationship with Ivy, and god-knows-what-else she might've not told me yet before I met her. Plus...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as if on some emotional impulse, you began to fidget a little with your fingers for a minute or two, then promptly explained, \"...I don't...<b>*sigh*</b>...I don't really want to feel like I'm anchoring her down when all is said and done.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. ...You really thought a lot about it, haven't you kid?\" He calmly quipped, calling you <i>\"kid\"</i> due to the age difference between you and him, as the two of you watched as Goatboy pulled the lever once more, sending another pile of trash bags flying at some unsuspecting individuals. In turn, Tony continued to smoke his cigarette, breathing out another cloud of smoke with a single breath, then proceeded to respond in an understanding manner whilst he retorted, \"...And I get what you're sayin', too. After all, I've known a few ex-girlfriends who'd say the same thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt as if Tony was putting up a jest with that quote, as he then flicked the used-up cigarette onto the floor, calmly stamping out the stick of nicotine to put it out. And with that, the diminutive man then put his hands in the pockets of his leather jacket, breathing out another puff of smoke in the process when he then continued, \"...But Heavy Harley, on the other hand... (Name), I've seen a good number of weird shit in my life, and she's definitely that, but in a good way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the height difference between you and him, Big Tony gave you a reassuring butt pat, since he could barely reach your shoulders without something to stand on, as he then said, \"...Kid, you and the big clown have a lot more chemistry together than what I had at your age, even if your tastes in the ladies are...unorthodox at best. But hey, the world's a weird place, whether you're in Coney Island, Gotham, Keystone, or Metropolis! The important thing is...is that you make the best of all the craziness. Don't give a damn about what the other jackasses care about. Capiche?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom hearing what he said to you with such sage-like wisdom, you eventually nodded back in agreement with the shorter man, as an upward curve appeared upon your lips in the process. Afterwards, you confidently bumped fists with the leather jacket-wearing pygmy as you quipped, \"Thanks for the talk, Tony! I owe you one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--Just promise me you'll ask her when you get the chance, kid.\" He interjected, responding in kind, to which you then took off downstairs, saying your goodbyes to them for the time being. You felt as if a great weight was seemingly lifted from your shoulders, as you calmly traversed down the stairs, returning towards Harley's apartment with a seemingly confident stride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully, if the stars were aligned just right, there might be hope for what awaited for you and Harley in the near future, even if it will get somewhat chaotic. </span></div></div>",

To what end? You weren't entirely sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalmly, you picked up one of the several photos strewn about the place, which showcased you and a somewhat thinner Harley Quinn than the one you've grown accustomed to. Looking at the photo, she appeared to be approximately half the size of the currently obese Harley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, as if a light bulb cartoonishly appeared above you akin to an episode of Looney Tunes, you then came to a rather savory conclusion, as you then yelled out to Ivy and hollered, \"...I'm heading out for a while. Can you hold down the fort, Red?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, no response. But then, the door to her private greenhouse opened via a vine in the shape of a man's hand opened the door, to which you soon heard Ivy reply, \"...It's fine. Where are you even going anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, a cheeky grin appeared on your face, to which you cryptically answered, \"...I think it's about time I paid a visit to the doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>== Free Spirit Assisted Living Home ==</b><br>\r\n<b>== Brooklyn Borough ==<br>\r\n==New York City, New York ==</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay, then! Your weekly medical prescription should be in order, Mrs. Savoy.\" Harley said, fully donned in her normal-looking disguise of an office ensemble, lab jacket, as well as her self-applied disguise, where she filled out the necessary paperwork for one of her more elderly patients, a Mrs. Eleanor Savoy, who immigrated from Eastern Europe during the end of the Great Depression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you, Doctor Quinzel! This place is rather fortunate to have someone such as yourself.\" The elderly matriarch complimented, to which an almost rosy blush flustered upon the rotund psychiatrist in a bashful manner, to which Harleen sheepishly rebutted, \"Oh, please, Mrs. Savoy! You're embarrassing me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, child! After all, you're quite a beautiful young lady as is!\" She interjected, the old woman still retaining some old-fashioned values on what made a woman beautiful in the eyes of a man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Heh. Well, I know a certain someone who would agree with you.\"</i> She mentally noted, letting her inner personal thoughts circulate temporarily, as she closed the folders containing Mrs. Savoy's files, standing up from the groaning chair to take her leave as she asked, \"So, same time next week, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As always, Doctor. It was so wonderful to see you again.\" Eleanor chirped, waving an aged wrinkled hand towards the pudgy psychiatrist, with Harleen waving back in kind whilst she scooted and squeezed through the doorway, triple-checking nothing got caught in the door frame in the transition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was a good distance from the old lady's personal quarters, Harleen letting out a huff of relief, which made her prominent gut press slightly against the hem of her business skirt, creating the illusion of a double-folded belly. \"<b>*huff*</b> Whew! I never thought she'd stop. But still, at least she's so earnest.\" She hushed to herself, letting her real accent slip just a tad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she caught her breath again, Harley reaffirmed herself back into her \"Harleen\" persona for the time being, for she still had a few more appointments for the day before she could head back and get into some more <i>\"Fun Clothes\"</i> as she'd love to plainly put it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a forward waddling trot, Harleen traversed her way through the clean halls of the living home, carefully looking through her appointment papers as to who she'll be checking on, humming a short tune to herself as she flipped through sheet after sheet of documented dossiers, thinking to herself as she elaborated, \"Okay, let's see... Mr. Karkov is complaining about his back pain meditation...again. ..Then, there's sweet little Agnes Jewell...She's due for a medication refill. And finally..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter flipping through several documented files, Harleen stopped sifting through the folders upon seeing a certain dossier, to which a dimpled curve appeared on her chubby cheeks as she continued, \"...We have you, Sy. <b>*giggle*</b> Can't wait to see that old geezer again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Harleen unintentionally let her clown-like enthusiasm seep out a little, where she gave out a little skip in her waddling step, despite she was still wearing a pair of expensive custom-fit heeled shoes due to how plump her feet had gotten by now.</span></div></div>",

Doctor Quinzel, please come to the Reception Desk.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice rang out over the building's intercom, to which made Harleen rather curious, as she cocked a quizzical yet confused blonde eyebrow in response to the P.A System's statement, where a thought sprang up in her mind that followed, <i>\"Hmm... Wonder what this is about.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting her curiosity get the best of her, she then proceeded to waddle her way towards the front reception desk, not realizing who would be there to personally greet her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back at the Front Reception Room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat in one of the several couches residing within the waiting area, now wearing one of the living home's Visitor Passes around your neck, hands clasped together in a patient stance. For the first time since you've <i>arrived</i> here, your thoughts have shown surprising amounts of clarity, despite who your girlfriend is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, said silence was soon disrupted, coming in the form of your vibrating smartphone. Instinctively, you pulled the compact cellular device from your left pocket, only to see a notification from an unknown messenger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"<b>*sigh*</b>...I got a hunch I probably know who's texting me.\"</i> You thought to yourself, to which you then tapped a thumb upon the notification, sending you to the text message itself, as you read the following:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"CH, it's me. I take it that you're already well-established in NYC?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a sigh, you instinctively figured that it was probably a certain Dark Knight giving you this message, considering that the text was most likely heavily encrypted to avoid unwanted eavesdropping. Figuring you might as well respond back, you soon tapped away on the phone's touch keyboard in rapid succession with the following message:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"...I'm fine, if that's what you're saying, DK. However, HQ and I have a big problem right now.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brief second or two later, the unknown caller retorted:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"...How so?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling mildly annoyed, you decided to spell it out to him, as you angrily texted:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"C-O-B-B-L-E-P-O-T. You know? Little guy, beaked nose, has bad blood between J and HQ. Any of THAT ring a bell?!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment, no response. But not a few seconds afterwards, you swiftly received the proceeding text:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Yes. I'm aware of who you speak of. What have you found?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a sarcastically smug curve of your lips, obviously not a little amused with Penguin threatening Harley. In turn, you confessed:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Turns out he still wants HQ's head on a spike, so he's sending some of his men and some local thugs after her. Not sure when they'll strike next, but he's planning on expanding his business into NYC. That's all I know so far.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, you then received a single text that ultimately stated:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Keep me posted.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the archived text messages were abruptly wiped from your phone, as if they ceased to exist. In response, you let out a mild huff of frustration, especially with how...<i>secretive</i>, communication was with Gotham's most notorious vigilante. Then again, it was given that this would be how you communicate with Him, which strangely didn't seem to bother you as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad time, huh?\" A voice rang out, which you soon found it came from the male orderly, some guy named Javier, based on the ID Tag clipped onto his shirt. Of course, you readjusted your demeanor and swiftly answered, \"...Not exactly. Just a co-worker with some annoying tendencies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh! Yeah, I know how you feel.\" He retorted, to where he then soon noticed the Visitor Pass dangling from your neck, as he then casually asked, \"...Expecting to see someone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Um...yeah. My girlfriend works here. Her name's Harleen,\" You answered, trying to keep a somewhat low profile, only for the orderly quickly realize who you were referring to and reply, \"Wait... You mean Doctor Quinzel? I honestly didn't know she even have a boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*chuckle*</b> Yep, guilty as charged.\" You casually quipped, which resulted in you receiving a pat on the back by the living home employee as he chirped, \"Congrats to you, buddy! She may be a tub of lard, but Dr. Quinzel's a real sweetheart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, the man parted ways with you, beginning to make his rounds within the facility, just in time for the aforementioned Doctor Quinzel to pass by him whilst he went through the double doors in the opposite direction. Luckily, she didn't initially notice you when she went through the doors, making a lumbering bee-line towards the Reception Desk, speaking toward the receptionist as she asked, \"...What is it, Julie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you swiftly approached her from behind, calmly wrapping your arms around Harley's fattened waistline, which barely connected to each other due to your disguised girlfriend's widened physique. In turn, this caused a small \"Eep!\" yelp of surprise to erupt from her ruby red lips, almost dropping the minuscule stack of folders she was carrying in her thick chubby arms in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she soon returned to a calmer composure upon realizing who was hugging her, a plump dimpled smile soon appeared upon her fuller face, her head tilted downwards slightly, to which her chin was slightly pressing against the plump fold around her neck that was her double chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, she mustered up enough resolve to speak to you and coyly asked, \"...Sweetie? What are you doing here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I thought I'd pay my cute bundle of fun a visit. Is that so wrong?\" You coyly flirted, which brought about a rosy blush from the blubbery blonde's fuller cheeks, still bearing a coy curve upon her lips. Of course, the receptionist, Julie, was certainly having quite a chuckle from Harleen's expense, doing her best to stifle such chuckling with a gesture of her hand, yet obviously just aware of Dr. Quinzel's relationship with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'l uh...I-I'll leave you two alone.\" Julie quipped, to which the receptionist returned to work, whilst Harleen then turned her hefty self around, holding your hands within her own plump pair, to which she then calmly guided you...</span></div></div>",

And with that, you had the entire room to yourselves, as Harleen let out an audible sigh of relief in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, with an erotic twinkle in her blue eyes, Harleen quickly took off her faux eyeglasses, tossing them aside onto the nearby therapy recliner, along with unbuttoning her work shirt and business jacket whilst she approached you with a flirtatious waddle in her step, casually discarding her red heeled shoes for a more relaxed stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she undid the final button on her work shirt, her bleach white paunch of a belly oozed a little from their modest confines, as you can see a definitive border between Harleen's normal Caucasian skin, and Harley's unnaturally distinctive skin tone. Upon looking at her fuller face, Harleen gently discarded the neatly ordered wig, thus revealing her odd yet suitably patterned red and blue hair,  as a cheeky dimpled smile formed on the woman's chubby face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that point on, you knew that Harleen Quinzel was gone for now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And the lovably zany Harley Quinn has come out to play!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, unexpectedly, Harley casually pushed you off your footing and onto the carpet floor, to which she then nonchalantly undo her skirt belt and discarded the metaphorical representation of order off to the side, easily showing off her ginormous pair of off-colored black and red silk panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd despite her overall weight, Harley swiftly proceeded to sit on top of you, thus pinning you the carpeted floor whilst she straddled you with her bulbous meaty thunder thighs, almost akin to a harlequin-themed dominatrix in a office ensemble. Suffice to say, you were strangely getting rather turned-on by Harley's actions in the past few seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after such erotic behavior, Harley then leaned downwards to plant a passionate kiss upon your lips, which caused her to lift the massive behemoths that were her buttcheeks up into the air some, where she then placed her plump hands upon your torso, gleaming at you with a pair of bedroom eyes, along with her true voice and accent returning, as she curiously asked, \"<b>*giggle*</b> So...What can Doc Quinn do fer ya, sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*chuckle*</b> I don't know, Doctor. Maybe I've been feeling a little lonely.\" You jokingly retorted, bearing some semblance of role-play with the blubbery clown girl. In response, she wrapped her thick meaty arms around you in a cushioned embrace, said arms still bound in the business attire from before, to which she whimsically quipped, \"<b>*giggle*</b> Well, you came to the right place!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, it was back and forth between the two of you, exchanging loving kisses with one another, rolling around on the floor in an almost playful disheveled mess. You wish this moment could last the entire day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, like an alarm, Harley's office telephone started ringing like a madman, abruptly interrupting the two of you from such affectionate intimacy. Huffing in mild annoyance, Harley quickly dismounted from her current position with you, waddling back towards her desk to answer whoever was calling her at such an inopportune moment, to where she let out a deep breath, then changed her voice back to Harleen once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the phone, she put it against her left ear and mouth, then politely questioned, \"Hello, this is Doctor Harleen Quinzel. How may I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your peak physical condition in this world, you couldn't quite make out who your girlfriend was conversing with over the phone. Though, judging from the subtle tweaks and changes in Harley's facial expressions, it was clearly something that's garnered her undivided attention, as you can hear Harley answer, \"Yes... ...Uh-Huh... Yes, I can meet you there... ...I understand. See you then,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once was all said and done, Harley then calmly ended the phone call, putting the antique telephone back into it's neutral stance, huffing out a deep sigh in response, to which you stood back up, looking at the corpulent yet disguised Clown Princess of Crime with a worried expression on your face and asked, \"...What's wrong? Did something happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, she didn't respond. But a few short seconds later, Harley looked back at you, now bearing...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If you can guess by the title of this chapter, we're having a cameo/crossover with two characters from renowned DA Artist, Dr-Black-Jack. If you're interested, please check out his gallery on DeviantArt (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/dr-black-jack\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.deviantart.com/dr-black-jack...</a>) Anyway, let's get started!]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon looking back towards her, you could clearly see that Harley now bore a rather confused expression on her plump face, to which you then quickly asked, \"...You alright, Harl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*sigh*</b>...Okay, well...you're not gonna believe this, but...\" She began, returning to her regular Harley voice once more. In response, you then gently took hold of her right hand, squeezing it just a tad to reassure her, which seemed to be rather effective on her behalf, as you calmly retorted, \"...It's okay. You can tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, sweetie. Well... <b>*chuckle*</b> ...I think we might've gotten a new Doc. You know...\" She replied, chuckling somewhat as she motioned her free hand towards the bulging blubbery expanse that is her abdomen, accompanied by quite a rosy blush upon her slightly rounder cheeks, as well as an upward curve of her lips. Meanwhile, on your end of the situation, you were...actually surprised to hear this news, to which you then mildly exclaimed, \"Harley... That's excellent news!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as one question was answered, another one arose, where you soon looked back upon the obese Harley and then curiously asked, \"...So, um... ...Who were you talking to on the phone, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially, the porcine clown girl didn't answer right away, subconsciously stroking the soft smooth orb that was her stomach in an absentminded manner with a free hand. Of course, you easily forgave her for such mannerisms, considering it's probably the pregnancy messing with her own hormones, to which you easily snapped her out of it with just a few sharp snaps of your fingers, only for Harley to blink several in a confused manner as she stammered, \"Huh...Wha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you hear what I said, Harley?\" You asked worryingly, to which she compensated by responding&lt; \"Yeah, I 'eard ya, (Name)! I was just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe briefly thought back, only to quickly reassert her focus once more as she interjected, \"A-Anyway... Turns out doctor from Japan's int'rested in me. Hell, she asked me by name, no less!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Japan? Well, that's...unexpected.\" You retorted, being honestly surprised at such news, wondering who'd pull the strings to get Harley that sort of professional help, let alone from a place on the other side of the world. However, you quickly redirected back onto the subject at hand, as you then spoke once more and said, \"...Anyway, you were saying, Harley?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..Well, she traveled all the way 'ere t'do some med-eval on me. From what I 'eard about her, she's supposed t'be some sort of...<i>Weight Gain Doctor</i>, you can say?\" She explained, which certainly took you by surprise when you heard the words <i>\"Weight Gain\"</i> and <i>\"Doctor\"</i> in the exact same sentence. Of course, the corpulent clown then promptly continued, \"...I think 'er name is Dr. Miharu-something. Y'know, me, I'm not much inta the small details.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured as much. So, did this doctor say where she wanted to meet us?\" You interjected, as Harley then calmly (albeit slowly) stood up, proceeding to quickly gather some of her discarded garments strewn across the floor, re-equipping them along with buttoning up her work shirt, and putting her blonde wig back on, to which she replied, \"--Over at the Brookdale University Hospital in Brooklyn. Y'know the place, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I believe so. Here, let me help you with that.\" You retorted, promptly assisting the heavyset harlequin with getting some of her clothes back on. Though, something told you that today was going to be...<i>hectic</i>, in a sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>== Brookdale University Hospital ==<br>\r\n== Brooklyn Borough, New York City ==</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*sigh*</b> &lt;You would think the most famous city in America would give the hospitals outside of Manhattan Island proper funding to work with.&gt;\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice flatly stated, speaking in the native Japanese dialect, which originated from a certain individual who stood out substantially in the sterile halls of the hospital. In appearance, she wore an orange-yellow turtleneck sweater, which did little to conceal the woman's burgeoning 300+ pound frame, with her lab coat only exaggerating such proportions. Her pants strained a little from attempting to contain her bulging thighs, calves, and buttocks, as well as her sandal-like heels exposing her feet to the elements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a waving gesture of her equally plump yet uncannily human prosthetic left arm and hand, she sifted through her semi-messy mid-length brown mane of hair, only for her assistant, who carried her fair share of obesity, waddled up behind her superior and retorted, \"&lt;Well, at least some of the food here is decently edible and rich in calories, Miharu-san.&gt;\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, the heavyset nurse promptly handed over a set of files toward her equally rotund colleague.

If you're interested in the exploits of Dr. Miharu Endo and Nurse Takumi Hara, go check out Dr-Black-Jack on his DeviantArt page! (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/dr-black-jack\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.deviantart.com/dr-black-jack...</a>) Anywho, back to our scheduled programming!]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say that her latest patient was...<i>\"unique\"</i> would certainly be an understatement back in her native country, that's for certain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she explicitly absorbed every word and syllable within the confines of the folders she held in her grasp, Miharu then flipped over the folder to the front cover, reading a set of bold and prominent words engraved upon the folder:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>[Classified]<br>\r\n[Elizabeth Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane]</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Miharu herself wasn't too intrigued by the goings-on within the notorious Gotham City, let alone the tall tales of a dark vigilante the local Gothamites call \"The Batman\". However, she has heard numerous speculative rumors from her fellow doctors in regards to the Elizabeth Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane, or simply <i>\"Arkham Asylum\"</i> as crudely abbreviated as it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as to how exactly the rotund Japanese doctor managed to acquire such confidential information... One can only speculate at the moment. Out of a mix of curiosity and concern, her equally obese nurse spoke up toward her and questioned, \"&lt;...Doctor...A-Are you certain about this, regarding our choice of patient?&gt;\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a slow turn of her semi-plump head, Miharu looked back towards her assistant, a raised quizzical eyebrow aimed at the porcine pink-haired nurse, keenly noticing Takumi's apprehensive doubts in regards to tending to their newest patient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"&lt;...I'm well aware you have certain...<i>\"inclinations\"</i>, regarding who we have an appointment with, but-- &gt;\" She explained, only for the heavyset nurse to interject as she soon questioned, \"&lt;Why are we helping someone like Her? She...Sh-She's a criminal! A really bad one, Doctor!&gt;\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*sigh*</b> &lt;...Regardless of their life choices, Nurse Hara, a patient is still a patient.&gt;\" Miharu bluntly elaborated, placing her plump prosthetic limb upon Takumi's shoulder to ease the rotund nurse, especially since the patient they would be tending to was of some renown. Afterwards, the two overweight medical professionals lumbered their way inside the Brookdale University Hospital, to which the blubbery brunette flatly continued in their native dialect and retorted, \"&lt;...After all, we're here at the behest of Dr. Pamela Isley to diagnose her...<i>\"friend\"</i>, and we should not be quite judgmental in our profession.&gt;\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"&lt;Maybe...<b>*sigh*</b>...But still, she's a criminal, Doctor!&gt;\" Takumi stated, doing her best to keep pace with her equally overweight medical superior, only for Miharu to retort back whilst keeping a well-paced waddling stride as she replied, \"&lt;A patient is still a patient, Takumi. Whether they be rich or poor, upstanding citizen or known criminal, a patient is still a patient either way.&gt;\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"&lt;...Though, if you seem so determined to crave such answers, I would recommend taking such questions up with our patient when she arrives, Nurse Hara.&gt;\" The brunette elaborated, to which the pink-haired woman then meekly answered, \"&lt;I...I will keep that in mind, Doctor.&gt;\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as Miharu reopened the folder to observe it's contents once more, her eyes gazed upon a distinct picture of Harley Quinn, her oversized mallet slung over her shoulder in a rather confident pose, despite the skimpy red and black clothes saying otherwise, to which the near quarter-ton physician mentally mused, <i>\"&lt;...Well then, Ms. Quinzel... Let us hope you are willing to make it to your appointment.&gt;\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back outside on the streets of Brooklyn, the two of you were calmly striding towards the Brookdale University Hospital, clearly walking side-by-side with the substantially heftier Harley, who still wore her Dr. Quinzel disguise, due to not having enough time to head back to Coney Island for a quick change of clothes and makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from the odd stare from any passerby, the trek to Brookdale was rather...surprisingly uneventful, to say the least. Harley, on the other hand, was casually humming a little tune to herself, obviously in quite a peppy mood today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, someone seems to be in a good mood today.\" You stated, to which the rotund disguised clown girl couldn't help but wholeheartedly agree with that statement, giggling back as she replied, \"<b>*giggle*</b> What can I say, sweetie? I'm honestly rather excited!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, Harl. <b>*sigh*</b> ...I'm sorry. I'm just a little on edge from what Penguin's trying to do, y'know?\" You blatantly confessed, only to then feel Harley's softened from press against you, with her plump hands resting upon her titanic hips, as you accidentally bumped into such a cushioned exterior. From there, Harley looked back upon you and calmly retorted, \"...I know, Puddin'. However, I ain't lettin' Blubberpot ruin my time wit' ya. An' besides...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a simple but pleasing gesture of performing a light pat of her bulging belly to emphasize her...well, <i>SIZE</i>, Harley proved her point to you whilst she continued, \"...If stupid Blubberpot plans on ruinin' my fun, you can bet I'm sittin' my big fat ass on him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, you thought that it sounded more erotic than what she was getting at, as the two of you then continued trekking toward the University Hospital. Hopefully, with some luck, there wouldn't be any of Penguin's thugs waiting there to rough things up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>== 5 Minutes Later... ==</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you and Harley had finally reached the Brookdale University Hospital. Of course, after making it to the Reception Desk, you were pointed towards a nearby Waiting Room just a few doors to the left. Though, despite her clearly abundant and corpulent physique, Harley was able to fit her hefty self into one of the couches in the room, with it's frame groaning somewhat due to her not-so-subtle quarter-ton form, with you sitting in an adjacent chair next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, she was harmlessly reading through some Victoria's Secret magazine donated to the hospital for use by the waiting room occupants. Obviously, you figured she was probably thinking up some way to fit into some sexy plus-sized lingerie to garner your affections, which wouldn't seem so bad in earnest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, with a sudden turn of the office doorknob, you witnessed as one of the local nurses appeared to announce, \"Harleen Quinzel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's us!\" She mildly exclaimed, almost instantly shooting up from the love-seat she was sitting in, as she then waddled her way toward the nurse, with you following suit as well. Though, you were certain to make sure that Harley was able to fit through the doorway, so the likelihood of her unwittingly getting wedged was minimum at best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, the two of you were personally escorted to a decently-sized doctor's office, undoubtedly one big enough for Harley's current size standards. A few moments of waiting passed by until the door opened once more to reveal...</span></div></div>",

(<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/dr-black-jack\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.deviantart.com/dr-black-jack...</a>) Anywho, back to the show!]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter much waiting for the assistance of these supposed medical professionals, such patience had finally paid off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door leading into the doctor's office slowly opened to reveal a rather rotund nurse before you and the somewhat heftier Harley. Of course, you can easily see how...<i>revealing</i> the heavyset woman's attire was, especially since your girlfriend was rather renowned for consistently wearing skimpy outfits, which were only made all the more revealing by Harley's now established heft and girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnywho, you noticed how the pink-haired nurse waddled inside, making sure her 300+ pound frame had passed through the doorway as to avoid getting herself wedged in the doorframe. Surprising, considering that you noted how the nurse was actually the thinner one in the room compared to the 500 pound pregnant Harley Quinn. However, once the hefty woman was fully inside the room, she and Harley soon found themselves facing one another in an awkward stare-off, akin to two complete strangers meeting for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, this led to the woman speaking, her voice having a rather substantial British accent to it despite her contradicting physical traits as she blurted, \"...You're, um...b-bigger than I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh...yeah! You too!\" Harley retorted, speaking in her Harleen accent, bearing a rather noticeable blush underneath the applied makeup she used prior to disguise her unnaturally pale bleach white skin, with her blue eyes looking off to the side as well. Of course, as the porcine nurse promptly obtained the necessary doctoral utensils, you looked upon her and quizzically asked, \"So...I'm guessing you're this Dr. Miharu person we're supposed to be meeting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if you said something offensive, Takumi promptly turned her hefty self around (Or...at least, about as fast as her body would allow.), now bearing a rather confused expression upon her round face, only to then raise her hands before her in a negative waving gesture as she shyly stammered, \"...What? No! Nononono! I'm not Dr. Endo! I...I-I'm her nurse, T-Takumi Hara!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nurse, huh? Never seen an overweight nurse before till now, that's for sure.\" You jokingly quipped, much to Takumi's initial embarrassment, only for the heavyset nurse named Takumi Hara to meekly retort, \"It...I-It's a side-effect from working with Dr. Endo. N-Nothing to be too worried about!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, you can easily somewhat tell that Takumi seemed a little...<i>\"hesitant\"</i>, considering her display of demeanor for the time being. From there, the pink-haired nurse promptly began to use a stethoscope to examine your girlfriend's heartbeat, only uttering the words, \"Deep breaths, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInhale, count to three...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhale, count to three...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInhale, count to three...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhale, count to three...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a surprisingly steady process for Harley, considering she was known for the opposite, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a bit of Harley's makeup-covered skin around her cleavage area got smeared upon the stethoscope's flat disk used for inspecting one's vitals, which soon exposed just a smidge of Harley's signature yet unnatural skin pigmentation. Luckily, the overweight nurse didn't initially notice the exposed skin, but she was soon aware of the smeared makeup on the flat disk, using a sanitation wipe to clean it off. From there, she soon answered, \"...Well, your heart rate and BPM are...surprisingly healthy, despite your body mass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's actually good. So, when will she get here?\" Harley asked, wondering when the aforementioned Doctor Miharu Endo would inevitably arrive for her appointment. Obviously, you can tell that Takumi had a distinctly British-like accent when speaking, despite her name sounding very Japanese. But whilst Takumi continued the basic medical evaluation upon Harley, you soon heard Takumi speak up and hesitantly reply, \"Oh! Um...I-I'm sure she will enter soon enough. After all, I...I've worked with her for quite a while now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...She sounds like an interesting person.\" You responded, obviously noting Takumi's shyness towards Harley in particular. However, speaking of the aforementioned physician, the office door soon opened wide, to which an equally heavyset woman lumbered inside. Unlike the nurse, Takumi, this woman was noticeably different, both in physical appearance and outfit, wearing an orange-yellow turtleneck sweater underneath a large lab-coat, wearing a set of black cargo pants and, oddly enough, a pair of black strap-on sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after entering the room and closing the door behind her, she soon spoke toward Harleen with a rather flatly blunt tone and asked, \"...Dr. Harleen Quinzel, I presume?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's me. I'm guessing you're Dr. Miharu Endo?\" She retorted, asking a question as well in her Harleen accent. In response, the woman nodded in confirmation, gently placing a small stack of folders upon the nearby countertop, where Miharu then promptly sat herself down in a rather small metal stool, to which her burgeoning buttocks oozed a little out of the armless furniture. However, what came out of her mouth next was unexpected, as Miharu then flatly said, \"...Let's get down to business. ...I know you're Harley Quinn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like time had just froze for a few seconds, as Takumi swiftly looked at her superior and yelped, \"Doctor!! That was uncalled for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" -Wait a minute! How the hell do you even know who I was anyway?!\" Harley exclaimed, pulling off her blonde wig as if the jig was up, with you being equally as confused, as her true accent slipped out some on accident. Of course, you chimed in as well, intent on getting some answers as you questioned, \"Yeah, like she said! What are you, Psychic or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, with a simple series of gestures, Miharu grabbed one of the folders, opened it up before the two of you, thus revealing Harley's entire psychological profile that came straight from Arkham Asylum akin to a children's book, to which the rotund brunette then promptly (albeit flatly) elaborated, \"...It doesn't take someone with a PhD doctorate to figure out that Harleen Quinzel and the criminal known as Harley Quinn are one and the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honesty, this...actually surprised you a little. After all, you assumed the whole world kinda knew that Harley Quinn is Harleen Quinzel, considering it seemed like common knowledge. And yet, this rotund Japanese doctor just flat-out said so to your faces. And in an almost uncanny nonchalant demeanor, no less!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in an attempt to recover herself from such a shocked stupor (along with getting some definitive answers), Harley moved her blue eyes to gaze upon the heavyset medical duo and forcibly asked...</span></div></div>",

(<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/dr-black-jack\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.deviantart.com/dr-black-jack...</a>) Anyway, let's get back to it!]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say that you and the hefty Harley Quinn were initially dumbfounded as to how the woman before you was so nonchalant about the fact that she was fully aware as to Harley Quinn's true identity would be considered an understatement, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt as if this moment was etched into your brains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is...until Harley instinctively lunged from her seat, lifted up Dr. Miharu by the woman's sweater with surprising strength, gave her a pissed off stare and yelled, \"Alright, brownie! Who sent ya?! Mistah J?! Blubberpot?! Riddlah?! B-Man?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to your expectations at this point, the same couldn't be said with Nurse Takumi, who looked thoroughly surprised at the fatter woman's strength. But as you quickly notice her trying to grab some sort of sedative, you quickly jumped from your seat, as you gazed at the pink-haired nurse and exclaimed, \"Wait! Don't do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why not?!\" Takumi stammered, the syringe looking primed in her plump gloved hands, only to be stopped dead in her hefty tracks as Dr. Miharu bluntly yet flatly exclaimed, \"...Put the sedative down, Nurse Takumi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Takumi didn't initially do as her medical superior demanded, obviously out of Miharu's own safety in their current situation. However, whilst she was forcibly hoisted up by an angered heavier Harley, Miharu gave Takumi a blunt authoritative glare at the fat nurse, which seemed to be slightly unnerving to her. And with a simple gesture, Takumi gently placed the sedative-filled syringe back onto the countertop, then positioned her hands in a surrendering posture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you were glad that she put the sedative down, you were still concerned about what Harley was currently doing, holding up the thinner doctor in a threatening position, still gripping tightly on Miharu's sweater with her semi-plump hands and digits, having this crazed look in her sharp blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in a meaningful attempt to defuse the hostility in her current situation, Miharu soon spoke up towards the fatter Harley and bluntly elaborated, \"...Dr. Pamela Isley sent me and my assistant here to examine you, Ms. Quinzel. Not to bring you harm on the behalf of...whomever you spoke of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially, Harley still bore a noticeably hostile demeanor upon her rounded face. However, as the gears in her often chaotic subconscious turned and spun, her angered features slowly but surely softened, though only halfway when she soon spoke up, using her actual accent and asked, \"...Did she have red hair, leaf green skin, an' a habit of talkin' t'plants like they're people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you figured she would ask that sort of question. Sure, it would've been a downright weird question to ask if you were back in the real world, but you easily remembered WHERE you were, so it wasn't entirely lost on you. Either way, the tension was soon resolved when Miharu gave an affirmative nod, which made her chin press against the neckfold that was her double-chin, then promptly answered, \"...Yes. She was certainly...<i>unique</i>, to say the least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Well, in that case...\" Harley quipped, as she then casually lowered Dr. Miharu back down onto the stool, then proceeded to lumber back to her respective seat, now bearing a bit of an embarrassed blush for lashing out like so. From there, she cleared her throat a little, then continued, \"...Sorry 'bout that. We've been goin' thru some shit as of late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiharu properly readjusted her ensemble back to it's previous position prior to Harley's crude man-handling of her person, pulling her sweater down to re-cover her bulbous light chocolate sphere of a belly. Afterwards, the rotund Japanese brunette then calmly responded, \"...You had your doubts, Ms. Quinzel. It was only fair that you would be initially apprehensive about us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...let me get this straight, because I'm still a tiny bit confused about this. Ivy sent you two?\" You questioned, having your turn to speak your mind, now that the metaphorical dust had settled for the time being. Shortly after readjusting herself on the stool, with Takumi picking up the strewn about papers that laid on the floor from the brief scuffle and putting them back in the folder, Miharu then looked back at the two of you and bluntly answered, \"...Yes. Long story short, Nurse Takumi and I formally met her at a physician's convention in the Shibuya Ward. The only word I could describe her would be...<i>intriguing</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*giggle*</b> Y'got that right!\" Harley chuckled, undoubtedly agreeing with the less heavier doctor in regards to the human-plant hybrid that is her best friend. Of course, once the documented papers were re-gathered, Takumi handed the dossier over to Miharu, to which a silent non-verbal \"Thank You\" was exchanged between the two heavyset women, where the pink-haired nurse proceeded to obtain the necessary medical instruments to continue the medical evaluation on Harley Quinn, just as Miharu then looked back toward Harley and continued, \"...Now, Ms. Quinzel--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--Please, call me Harley!\" The red and blue-haired woman interjected, akin to a gullible (albeit friendly) demeanor known quite clearly in her posture and expression. Correcting herself, Miharu cleared her throat some, then promptly continued speaking, the brief glimpse of an upward curve of her lips appearing before dissipating just as quickly, and retorted, \"My apologies. Now, <i>Harley</i>... I will need to ask you some critical questions, regarding the...<i>current</i>, state of things as it were. Can you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Yeah, sure!\" She quipped, just as Takumi began to perform the standard medical evaluation upon the larger woman before her, only for Takumi to say, \"...I need you to take some of your clothes off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! Gettin' frisky on me, Nurse Takumi?\" Harley coyly teased, which brought about a rather embarrassed blushing expression upon Takumi's chubby face, obviously flustered about her patient's flirtatious quips. Fortunately, Harley was merely jesting, being all too willing to strip herself of her disguise, as she casually flicked her heeled shoes from her plump feet, then proceeded to pull down her business skirt and pantyhose, thus exposing her shimmering yet revealing red and black Harley Quinn booty short-shorts, along with her unnaturally pale bleached white skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, said shorts left little to the imagination as to the size of her snowy white caboose.</span></div></div>",

Anyway, if you're interested in the exploits of Dr. Miharu Endo and Nurse Takumi Hara, go check out Dr-Black-Jack over on his DeviantArt page! (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/dr-black-jack\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.deviantart.com/dr-black-jack...</a>) Now then, let's get back to business, shall we?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Harley proceeded to sit her abundant derriere back upon the chair she previously used, Dr. Miharu calmly received the written documents by her equally tubby assistant. With a few good smacks of the sheets of paper, they were reorganised within the confines of the clipboard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cleared her throat, then commenced the medical interrogation, pulling a pen out from her lab coat pocket as well, then began, \"...According to these documents, you were once a staff member of Elizabeth Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane, and were assigned as the psychiatrist to the criminal they call <i>\"The Joker\"</i>. Is this indeed accurate, Ms. Quinzel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what does this have to do with her health, anyway?\" You questioned in a reasonably skeptical manner, only for you to feel Harley reassure you with a tight squeeze from her plump chalk-white hand. In response, she looked at you with a reassuring look on her slightly rounder face and retorted, \"...It's fine, Puddin'. I can handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Harley refocused towards Dr. Miharu and Nurse Takumi, to which she promptly answered, \"...Yeah. Y'got it right, Doc. Right down to my ties wit' Mistah J.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems your hippocampus is working correctly. Excellent.\" Miharu quipped, noting how Harley still retained a massive portion of her memories prior to becoming who she is today, to which she jotted it down on the clipboard. From there, the heavyset medical professional soon continued,  \"Alright, then. Next question: It is said that you developed...<i>\"Romantic Feelings\"</i> towards the Joker, according to the testimonies by the Arkham staff. Is it true that you helped him escape captivity as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere it was. The most infamous question. The one that made a seemingly naive woman into the notorious Clown Princess of Crime. Your eyes darted over onto the rotund Harley, who looked to have a sliver of nostalgia written on her plump facial features. In response to such a question, she let out a nostalgic sigh, then casually elaborated, \"<b>*sigh*</b> Now that brings back memories...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her mood dampened slightly, to which she continued, \"...Too bad I didn't realize the feelin' was one-sided till he tried t' get me killed on multiple occasions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why? Why would you fall for such a vile man?\" Takumi interjected, to which Dr. Miharu allowed...at least for now, anyway. After all, you can see that the heavyset nurse was having some difficulty comprehending how someone like Harley would fall for someone like the Joker. Of course, Miharu quickly reprimanded, \"...My apologies. Nurse Takumi was rather...<i>adamant</i>, in receiving an explanation regarding yourself, Ms. Quinzel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough.\" She retorted, shrugging her plumped shoulders in response. After all, Harley figured that Takumi appeared rather apprehensive about her, so it seemed fair that she's given a decent explanation. With a short exhale, the pale-skinned rotund beauty then gazed back toward Takumi and reluctantly confessed, \"...I became a psychologist so I can understand why my family was the way it is. Though, as for why I hooked up wit' Mistah J... <b>*sigh*</b> I thought he an' I were kindred spirits. ...That is, till he did some fucked up things lately that made me...<i>reconsider</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instinctive response, you obviously wrapped your hand around Harley's own in comfort, squeezing it some out of affectionate reassurance. Of course, whilst Dr. Miharu was jotting down several personal notes for future reference, Takumi then apologized, \"...I'm sorry. It's just that...I knew a classmate who was studying abroad. I only heard from him how terrible Gotham City was. I...I-I want to understand why someone like you would associate themselves with a madman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstanding the irony of her prior predicament, Harley let out a small dry chuckle, which caused her burgeoning belly to jiggle slightly from such movement, only to then reply, \"<b>*dry chuckle*</b> Yeah. I know da feelin' all too well, Pinkie. ...Some people call it <i>\"Mad Love\"</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's understandable, Ms. Quinzel, considering what you had to endure.\" The heavyset brunette doctor flatly answered, flipping onto another page to continue jotting down crucial notations in the process. But then, almost out of nowhere, Dr. Miharu randomly asked,  \" Could you please get up onto the scale, Ms. Quinzel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, why not?\" She shrugged, casually standing up to her full height, causing her semi-smooth double belly to pooch over and obscure her red and black harlequin panties. From there, Harley seductively waddled herself over towards the scale (obviously to get you flustered from seeing her voluminous backside), whilst a thought crossed your mind regarding the medical instrument, noting, <i>\"...I got a feeling that that scale isn't gonna hold up under her.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Nurse Takumi on the other hand, waddled up towards Harley, who slowly stepped up onto the miniscule scale, only for it to make these metallic <b>*groans*</b> and <b>*creaks*</b> the moment the hefty harlequin gently put her foot down on one side of the mechanism. Judging from all the strained noises echoing from the weight measuring instrument,  it appeared that it was on the brink of crumbling apart should Harley weigh even a single pound more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, due to the accumulated adipose on the insides of her meaty thighs, it made it difficult to get an accurate reading on her actual weight, but she managed to compensate this by forcibly pressing her legs together, causing her thigh fat to ooze and bulge outwards from such an action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the scale dial begun to rapidly spin for nearly an entire minute... That is, until it finally landed dead-center on the true number of Harley's physical heft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Waga kamiyo...</i> &lt;My god...&gt;\" She muttered in her native tongue, as you can tell by her initial reaction towards Harley's weight. From there, despite you not entirely understanding the Japanese dialect, Takumi waddled over towards her equally heavyset superior, only to promptly whisper into the woman's ear and hushly elaborated, \"<i>Miharu hakase, kore o miru hitsuyo ga arimasu.</i> &lt;Dr. Miharu, you need to see this.&gt;\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the pink-haired nurse showed Miharu their patient's estimated measurements, the subtle twinge of a smug grin appearing on the woman's round facial features, responding in the same dialect as her assistant, only retorting,  \"<i>...Omoshiroi. 259.455-Kiroguramu.</i> &lt;...Interesting. 259.455 kilograms.&gt;\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, despite not being proficient in Japanese, you can somewhat tell that she was referring to Harley's current weight. And from one too many math lessons at school, you now knew how much your girlfriend weighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"572 pounds... Wow, I didn't expect Harley to be THAT heavy.\"</i> You mentally noted, only to watch as the aforementioned individual cheerfully skipped back to her seat (which initially seemed difficult given her girth). But soon, as she let her belly flop out onto her lap some, Harley then promptly blurted out, \"Oh! Before I forget; I'm actually preggers, if you catch my drift, Doc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Takumi showed a decently surprised reaction on her part, Miharu on the other hand seemed almost unfazed by this revelation, only writing down another short paragraph of information of note. And with such confirmation at hand...</span></div></div>",

(<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/dr-black-jack\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.deviantart.com/dr-black-jack...</a>) Now then, onto the next chapter at hand!]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the timing of it all, the appointment itself felt like it had gone on for a few decent hours. And yet, Dr. Miharu appeared to be finished with the paperwork at present, to which she then promptly handed the clipboard over to Harley as part of the patient's consent, with the heavyset doctor only saying, \"Sign here, here, and here, Ms. Quinzel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, following medical procedure like she was back working in Arkham, Harkey consciously signed by the dotted lines scattered across several pages worth of paperwork. But still, despite the hectic chaos you've found yourself in not too long ago, it felt quite...<i>fresh, even exhilarating</i>, to be a part of this version of Harley Quinn's life. Of course, whilst she was in the midst of her second John Hancock, the hefty harlequin gave off her signature quirky smirk with a set of somewhat plump ruby lips, then cheekily quipped, \"<b>*giggle*</b> Y'know, I know this wonderful lil' place over on Coney Island you two would love ta see, that's fer sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her initial apprehensions, Takumi slowly began to warm up to the more corpulent clown girl, only for her medical superior to interject, as Miharu bluntly responded, \"...Maybe. However, that will-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*BANG!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BANG!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BANG!*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audible sounds of gunshots were suddenly heard from outside the room, which garnered everyone's attention, accompanied by the notable panicked screaming accompanying the chorus of bullets flying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, both you and Harley weren't as unnerved compared to Takumi, who looked to be quaking in her pink nurse attire, with her bountiful adipose jiggling from the pinkette's unwanted stress and unease, though Dr. Miharu seemed more stable compared to her assistant. However, looking back at Harley, she had this look of disdained frustration as she lowly growled, \"Please jus' let it be some sort a' local fuss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Spread out an' find 'er, boys! That fatass clown bitch has to be here!\"</b> A gruff voice rang out, accompanied by some scuffling noises. Meanwhile, you looked back at Harley, who promptly stood up on her meaty legs, rolling her neck and stretching a little, with you and her noting what's coming next whilst she commented, \"<b>*sigh*</b> Of fuckin' course! Why ain't I surprised?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so what's the plan, Harl?\" You quipped, pulling your pistol out from the back of your pants, only for the two of you to hear Takumi exclaim in a hushed voice and nervously stammered, \"W-Wait, y-y-you knew th-that this would h-happen?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much, Pinkie.\" She retorted, casually picking up one of the stools and wielding it like a weapon with one hand. Meanwhile, you checked how many bullets you had in the ammo clip before inserting the magazine back into the pistol and cocking the weapon. From there, after a brief practice swing with the metal stool, Harley, with a devious twinkle in her eyes and an excited-looking grin plastered on her plump face, then spoke back towards you and replied, \"As fer a plan... <b>*giggle*</b> Isn't it obvious, Puddin'? We're gonna go out there, bash their noggins in, bust some nuts, an' call it a day! That sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you looked back at Dr. Miharu, who was currently trying to keep her equally chubby assistant calm through the tense situation, only to then gaze back at Harley,  a devilish grin growing on your own facial features, and instinctively chuckled, \"...Sounds good to me, sweetie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about us?\" Dr. Miharu flatly questioned, speaking in her usual nonchalant mannerisms, despite the current situation occurring on this floor of the hospital. But whilst the heavyset brunette continued to attempt to ease her equally blubbery assistant through the ordeal, Harley simply answered, \"Just stay in 'ere while (Name) an' I clean house. B'sides, these bozos are afta me, an' I intend ta send 'em packin'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure you lock the door behind us once we're out of the room.\" You interjected, to which Dr. Miharu voluntarily complied with what you were saying, confirming with a sound nod, causing her chin to press some against her double chin in the process. And as the two of you heard a series of footsteps steadily approaching the door to the room, Harley gazed back at you and asked, \"Ready ta have some fun, Puddin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get them, Harl.\" You instinctively retorted, readying yourself in a combative stance, pistol in hand. But then, as the doorknob was turning to allow entry for the armed intruders, despite her weight and girth, Harley lunged at the door with a meaty push kick, sending the thug at the door flying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Harley swiftly leapt from the room, heading straight for the downed goon! And with heaving around her own heft, the heavyset harlequin launched her full weight down upon the creep, with him only screaming, \"Wait-!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*SQUISH!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRUNCH!*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a cacophony of organic stomach-churning noises, the thug that she first assaulted had his entire ribcage and torso region pulverized from a 572 pound heavyset Harley Quinn, with the man's insides turned into a mashed red paste. Harley on the other hand, looked fine as ever, promptly standing up from the bloodied mess she unleashed, only to cheerfully quip, \"Holee-Fracturolee! Who knew havin' such a fat ass can be so effective?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLY FUCK!! She killed Ritchie!\" Another thug exclaimed, who was only three doors down the hall from where you and Harley rushed out, only to be joined by several more of his buddies soon afterwards. Quickly, you slammed the door behind you on the way out, to which Dr. Miharu promptly locked it to prevent unwanted entry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, another set of goons approached from the right side of the hallway, as Harley wiped a bit of the residue blood from her red and black harlequin panties, which inadvertently made her abundantly plump shelf of a butt jiggle and wobble some in response, where she then looked at the pack of thugs, a devilishly Cheshire-esque grin appearing on her full lips whilst she loudly answered, \"Well, what's it gonna be, boys?! Stool, or my big fat caboose?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd back off if I were you, dumbasses! Or do you want to end up just like your buddy over here?\" You impulsively interjected, threatening for the idiots before you and Harley to back off before things got extremely dicey. Of course, noting how their fists were clenching against some of their weapons and possible teeth grinding on their part, it was looking like they were going to be too stubborn and prideful to even think about backing down, where the first thug then impulsively yelled, \"...Fuck this shit! Just kill them all!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, he rushed at you with murderous intent in his gaze, crowbar in hand, raised high and ready to strike! However, as if acting on mere killer instinct, you swiftly aimed the pistol at one of his legs and fired off a round at his kneecap, causing him to collapse onto the floor in agonizing pain, as you then shot him in the head, killing the man. But from there, like a series of falling dominoes, the rest of the thugs proceeded to launch their assault upon you and the obese Harley Quinn, with Harley only quipping, \"This is gonna be fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like something straight out of the Deadpool movies, what followed shortly afterwards was what can only be described as <i>\"Beautiful Symphonic Chaos\"</i>. While you took the group on the right side of the hallway with techniques right out of John Wick's playbook, Harley confronted the rest on the left, swinging away with the metallic stool along with her own brand of heavyset gymnastics, leaping from one of the walls, catapulting herself towards one of the thugs,  and performing (ironically enough) a move ripped straight out Super Mario 64, using her girth and quarter-ton weight to practically squash the goon underneath her chalk-white billowing buttocks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the momentum was more than enough to cause her to bounce right back up onto her own feet shortly after rendering the man's spinal column into bony splinters, as she continued her assault on the preceding thugs before her, with you fighting alongside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, when it was all said and done...</span></div></div>",

(<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/dr-black-jack\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.deviantart.com/dr-black-jack...</a>) Anywho, onto the next chapter at hand!]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnadulterated. Symphonic. Chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo describe the scene before you and the substantially heftier Harley Quinn, the most apt description to sum it all up would be <i>\"Slaughter\"</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeaten, bruised, and dismembered remains of what were once the chorus of thugs that the two of you assaulted laid scattered across a large portion of the hallway. Some slumped up against the walls, sparsely riddled with bullet-holes. Some had parts of their bodies appearing as if they were fatally crushed by a quarter-ton anvil dropped from three stories up. But as you rolled your neck some to get a kink or two out, holding a pistol with an obvious smoking barrel, Harley on the other hand, appeared to be explicitly rejuvenated, possibly from being allowed to let loose, as she arched her back, outstretching her chubby arms towards the ceiling in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*relieved sigh*</b> Ho-lee Slaughter-olee! We sure did a number on 'em! Didn't we, Puddin'?\" She chirped, her voice obviously showing how cathartic it was to kick some ass. But whilst you look over the carnage splayed out all around you, you couldn't help but honestly agree with the hefty harlequin, to which you ejected the emptied magazine from your pistol to then re-insert a new one, only to look back at your heavyset girlfriend and calmly retorted, \"Can't say I disagree, Harl. Unfortunately, now we got a bunch of dead pricks who won't be spilling the beans on who sent them anytime soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, as if on a coincidental cue, the two of you soon suddenly heard some muffled groaning and grunting noises coming from one of the piles of deceased cronies, only to inevitably witness one of the thugs trying to painfully claw his way out from under his dead cohorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnnh...Egh! Fuckin' Ellis...C'mon!\" He grunted, trying to push one or two corpses that have fallen onto his person, struggling to get himself free from the carcasses. However, that would only be the least of his worries, as Harley lumbered over towards the thug, yanking him free by his jacket collar, which showed how deceptively strong she was as she chirped, \"Ooooh! Look what we have 'ere, Puddin'? We got ourselves a live one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaah!! You fuckin' fatass bitch!! You're gonna pay! Ya hear me!?!\" He yelled, groaning from the physical pain he was experiencing, realizing who pulled him out of the pile, only to then feel a meaty punt kick sent straight at his lower jaw, momentarily stunning him. Meanwhile, Harley forcefully propped him up on one of the waiting room chairs, with you following close behind her and her substantial buttocks. From there, getting on the creative side of things, she yanked an extension cord out from the nearby wall, using it as a sort of makeshift restraint, binding the bastard's arms to the arms of the chair in the process, and tying it all up with the cord outlet only jutting out from the wiring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, with all the commotion that occurred within the past ten minutes, you and Harley had the entire hallway to yourselves, especially with what was coming next...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prop his legs up.\" Harley quipped, as you did what she was requesting, which came in the form of propping the restrained man's legs up on a nearby chair you pulled in. From there, you hoisted his feet up onto the seat of the chair, to which Harley tossed you another appliance cord, still attached to a table lamp, where you then began to bind the goon's legs together by the ankles. Obviously, you figured out what exactly the heavyset harlequin was doing right now, as the restrained bruised thug spat out a bloodied tooth that was forcibly knocked loose during the brawl. Putting on the tough guy persona, he chuckled, \"Heh! If ya think I'm gonna snitch, then you're outta luck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we know...\" Harley retorted, circling around him with this predatory twinkle in her baby blue eyes, akin to an overweight lioness toying with her prey. From there, in an almost mocking demeanor, she propped a foot atop one of the thug's legs, administering a slight pressure against his limb, to which she continued, \"...However, since you an' yer buddies interrupted me on an important day, you're gonna wish you was dead when I'm done wit' ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, despite her gullible ditzy behavior in the comics, you undoubtedly had to admit that Harley can certainly be intimidating when push comes to shove. But still, the thug didn't cave in from the bad cop routine, so you approached the goon, gun in hand, only to then question, \"I'm going to only ask you this once, dipshit. And if you still got enough brain matter to think for yourself, you'll give us what we want. Who sent you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister None-Of-Your-Damn-Business, that's who!\" He snapped, spitting a wad of bloodied spit in your face, a bloodied toothy grin spread across his face from his tough guy act. Of course, in response to such retaliation, you slowly wiped the blood-soaked spit from your face, figuring that he wasn't going to talk so easily. So, as you then gazed towards the rotund Harley Quinn, who looked just about ready to administer some pain on the stubborn fool, as you then gave her the go-ahead as you sternly answered, \"...I think someone needs an attitude adjustment. Harley? Would you do the personal honors?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*giggle*</b> It would be my earthly delight, Puddin'!\" She chirped, a cheekily toothy grin appearing on her somewhat chubby face, to which she then waddled down the hallway, stopping only when she reached the fifth doorway down. Though, you had this unmistakable gnawing feeling in the back of your brain, as if it was preemptively warning you that what came next would be very messy, so you instinctively took a few steps away from the restrained goon, a single tear of sweat running down his forehead. Of course, he had every right to feel a little hot under the collar, especially with what Harley was about to do very soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down the hall to where she was standing, despite her overall girth and corpulence, Harley took off running with surprising speed for someone of her heft, where she then contorted her blubbery form to commence several cartwheel-like front-flips, with her launching herself on the third or fourth flip, sending herself flying straight toward the faux bridge that was the thug's bound legs, to which she curled her body into a pseudo-cannonball position while she excitedly (albeit randomly) yelled, \"Sok-A-La-Ho-Ya!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*CRACK!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRUNCH!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SQUELCH!!!*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!!!\" The thug shrieked, screaming at the very top of his lungsupon Harley's quarter-ton physique making excruciatingly painful contact with his legs, only for them to internally shatter and splinter upon impact. In reaction, you nearly gagged from the sight, but you swiftly recovered from the gory display, as Harley gracefully dismounted from the thug's bent-in lower limbs, landing on the floor in a victorious gymnastic pose, pudgy arms outstretched above her head at an ascending angle whilst she exclaimed, \"Ta-Da!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>[Hello, everyone! Vocal here! If you're interested in the exploits of Dr. Miharu Endo and Nurse Takumi Hara, go check out Dr-Black-Jack over on his DeviantArt page! (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/dr-black-jack\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.deviantart.com/dr-black-jack...</a>) Anywho, onto the next chapter at hand!]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU FUCKIN' BITCH!!!!!! You fuckin' fucked up my legs!!!!!!\" The thug screamed, his adrenaline reaching a fever pitch from his patellae, femurs, tibiae, and fibulae being bent and fractured in ways they weren't supposed to. Now, you weren't a medical professional, but you knew what broken legs looked like, as you can see several bits of leg-bone jutting through the man's flesh on the back of his legs. Anyway, as Harley dusted her abundant buttocks off with a free hand, she turned her head a little to eye at the now crippled goon, which easily shut him up, as you then rushed at him, hand on his throat, as you obviously lost some of your patience and angrily roared, \"Your Boss!! WHO SENT YOU!?!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DON'T KNOW!!! I don't fuckin' know, you bastard!!!\" He impulsively screamed, only for you to angrily punch him square in the face, busting his nose and several more of his teeth in the process. With your instincts burning through your patience like an explosive fuse, you swiftly pulled out your pistol, pressing the barrel against the skin of his forehead. Luckily, the brutal intimidation tactics seemed to be quite effective, as you and Harley then suddenly heard the bruised and crippled meathead abruptly squeal, \"Okayokay!! I'll talk! S-Sionis...R...R-Roman Sionis sent us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, the very name the man spoke of hit you like a ringing gong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoman Sionis...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo anyone else, they wouldn't know two shits as to who he is. But you've read a few Batman comics and played most of the Arkham games to distinctly recognize who the bound goon was prattling on about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, he was more well-known by his more intimidating criminal alias...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Black Mask.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the comics, Black Mask is one of the most prominent figures in Gotham City's seedy underbelly of organized crime. Once a member of Gotham's social elite, he was the president of the makeup company, Janus Cosmetics. ...That is, until Roman's own poor business sense inevitably led into a series of bad decisions that ultimately destroyed his reputation as a legitimate businessman. Humiliated, he sought revenge against those he perceived to be responsible for his own misfortunes. To that end, he defiled his father's grave, and carved an ebony skull mask from his father's own coffin, becoming the criminal Black Mask, and developing his own criminal organization called <i>\"The False Face Society\"</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, Black Mask wasn't a household name like The Joker, Penguin, Riddler, Two-Face, Catwoman, Bane, or any of the other members of Batman's Rogues Gallery, but he can certainly hold his own as a messed up individual worthy of a sentence in Arkham Asylum. After all, from what you remember from the video game, Batman: Arkham Origins, Sionis was known to be both paranoid (given his notoriety as a crime boss and the baggage that comes along with it), as well as being rather proficient in torturing people for any sort of valuable information, even going as far as to garner a sick and depraved pleasure for making people endure physical suffering, whether it be by cutting off a guy's fingers with a pair of rusty shears, or thrusting a still-burning cigarette into someone's eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, whilst you and the heavyset Harley were preoccupied with interrogating the now crippled thug, Dr. Miharu Endo unlocked the door, easily noting at how there was no longer any signs of combat within the hallway, only to soon come across the grisly spectacle before her. Fortunately for her, she didn't gag from the sight, but she found the smell of human carcasses a tad bothersome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, figuring that the crony wasn't going to be divulging any more crucial information, you swiftly pistol-whipped the man right in the left temple, thus knocking him completely out cold. Of course, both you and Harley soon realized that the good doctor was present before the two of you, to which she then calmly questioned, \"...I'm assuming the man you were interrogating had some answers you deemed satisfactory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*sigh*</b> Sadly, no. Only more bad news I'm afraid, Dr. Endo.\" You bluntly answered, obviously a tad frustrated at how you now had two prominent figures of Gotham's criminal underworld gunning for the self-inflicted bounty on Harley's head. Of course, Harley didn't seem fazed by the obvious revelation whatsoever, given that she was sorta expecting something like this to occur when she severed her ties with the Joker and hooked up with you. From there, it was Harley's turn to speak, placing her hands upon her wide burgeoning hips, only to then answer, \"Yeah. An' 'ere I thought that we wouldn't have ta worry 'bout anyone else besides Blubberpot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, Dr. Miharu gave you both a somewhat confused expression as to who the hefty harlequin was referring to exactly, especially since you figured she doesn't seem to be the type to keep tabs on the head honchos of various criminal organizations, unlike a certain grey and black-clad Dark Knight. So, in turn, you quickly reprimanded this by calmly explaining, \"...She's referring to a guy she knows back in Gotham City. His name's Oswald Cobblepot, though in certain shady circles, he's better known as The Penguin, due to his short stature and beak-like nose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate the explanation, Mr. (Name). Though, judging from your behaviors, I can only hazard a guess that there is some <i>\"Bad Blood\"</i> between Ms. Quinzel and this Penguin individual you speak of...\" Miharu retorted, only to soon be joined in company by her equally plump assistant, Nurse Takumi Hara. Though, from the look on her face, she appeared a tad unnerved by the overall carnage laid bare in the hallway, looking as if she was about to vomit out her lunch, but she thankfully was able to hold it in by performing several meditative deep breaths. Then again, she IS a nurse, after all, so it kinda came with the territory from such a profession. In turn, Miharu repositioned herself to overlook her assistant, placing her dark-skinned hands upon the pink-haired nurse's chubby shoulders in reassurance that the worst had come to pass, to which she complied with a thankful nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... What happens now?\" Takumi timidly questioned, bringing forth a fairly valid question in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good question...\" You subconsciously replied, experiencing this uneasy feeling that the four of you were being watched, your gaze peering out a nearby window towards a rooftop across the street from the hospital. Somehow, you couldn't help but think that your own developing sense of paranoia was starting to make sense. However, it ultimately ended with you snapping your gaze back towards the heavyset doctor and her equally-sized assistant, to which you then continued, \"...But it looks like we have to postpone our appointment with you until further notice, Doctor. After all, they'll think you and your nurse are accomplices if Penguin, Black Mask, or any other scumbag from Gotham come knocking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*sigh*</b>...As much as I despise leaving an appointment unfinished, it seems we have little choice in the matter, considering the prior situation we've found ourselves in.\" Miharu reluctantly but inevitably agreed, easily noting the situation that her patient has found herself in, so it only made sense in a pragmatic sensibility to postpone any future appointments with the hefty harlequin until this matter was ultimately resolved. And with that, you and Harley assisted the medical duo in gathering up the necessary documents before heading back to Coney Island. Luckily, it only took a few brief minutes to gather them up, as Miharu stored them in a secure binder for later examination. And as the four of you proceeded towards the exit of the Brookdale University Hospital, you and Harley prepared to say farewell to the medical duo from Japan, as Harley (Surprisingly enough) gave Takumi her personal phone number, obviously becoming rather fond of the pink-haired nurse as a friend. </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And as you went your separate ways, you and Harley trekked back towards the refuge that was the apartment complex on Coney Island, with Harley putting her slightly plump bleach white hands behind the back of her head in a casually relaxed manner, to which she whimsically quipped, \"...Y'know, Puddin'? I think I'm gonna like seein' those two, don'cha think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to see you have a good opinion of them, Harl...\" You retorted, obviously glad to see that Dr. Miharu Endo and Nurse Takumi Hara left quite the positive impression on the heavyset clown girl, just noting how the pigtailed woman was absentmindedly whistling to herself while she was at it. Of course, your mind returned to the current problem at hand:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prospect that the Penguin, Black Mask, and any other criminal from the infamous Gotham City now had their sights set on turning in that bounty on Harley Quinn's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah. This won't be easy, that's for sure! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, as the two of you neared the apartment complex, you continued speaking towards Harley, with your concern on full display, as you then answered, \"...Though, to be honest, I'm actually a little concerned as to who else will have the gusto to go after that bounty on your head, Harl. I mean, first Penguin, now we gotta worry about Black Mask gunning for us as well. I mean no disrespect, but even if we have your Gang of Harleys and Ivy on our side, we're still probably outmanned and outgunned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm aware a' that, sweetie. Which is why we're headin' back ta our place an' cook up a plan.\" She retorted, noting your reasonable points for concern regarding the current state of affairs. Then again, this was something she seemed to be quite accustomed to, most likely due to the numerous turf wars between the main factions in Gotham's underworld, whether it came from the gangs led by the likes of The Joker, Black Mask, Two-Face, Penguin, or even <i>\"The Old Guard\"</i> of Gotham City's centuries-long history of organized crime, such as the Falcone Crime Family or the Maroni Crime Family. Needless to say, despite the city being watched over by the mysterious vigilante known only as The Batman (along with his numerous allies), Gotham City would always bear the stigma of being a metropolis drenched in the blackened oil that is organized crime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, as the apartment complex was beginning to come into clear view, you knew that the two of you had an ace in the hole:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Poison Ivy</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, she wasn't outright intimidating in the slightest due to her seductive wiles. However, like the old adage, <i>\"Every Rose Has It's Thorns\"</i>, Ivy is considered a powerhouse in DC Comics, with her powerful ability to control plant life like the Pied Piper charming a swarm of rats with a mere tune. Hell, even the male criminals of Gotham knew not to get on the Human-Plant hybrid's bad side, especially given her tremendous power over plants with lethal force. Though, aside from her precious <i>\"Babies\"</i>, the only other living thing to be so close to Pamela Isley's heart was the very same quarter-ton, pale-skinned harlequin that is your girlfriend in this reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, <i>\"Hell hath no fury like a woman's scorn\"</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as soon as the building's main entrance came into clear view, the melancholy of the day was gouged out in the form of a man outfitted in a ski mask and body armor, screaming as he fell hard upon the spiked metal fence with a fleshy <b>*CRUNCH!!*</b> in the process. Of course, the scene was made all the more gruesome and gory when the man's body split in two from being impaled and ruptured by the cold hard metallic spikes adorning the fence. Obviously, the handful of tourists ran away in panicked droves at the sight, whilst you and Harley were nonchalant at the situation, just as the heavyset harlequin soon looked up and quickly noticed a large vine slithering back inside the building, a cheeky grin appearing on her face as she quipped, \" Looks like Ivy's been havin' fun without us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring that Ivy was most likely fighting off some armed men, you quickly rushed inside the apartment, with Harley in hot pursuit as well, despite the contradiction that is her overall weight and girth. Once inside, you leapt over and under some of the tenants, whilst all of them instinctively moved out of the way when Harley made her way through as well. Although you didn't have some nifty superpowers like X-Ray Vision and such, your mind painted a clear enough picture of what was occurring on the top floor, just as the two of you rushed up the final flight of stairs, finally reaching the double-door entrance to Harley's condo. After all, she IS the Landlady of this establishment, so the tenants kinda expected crazy shit to happen given Harley's track record for such shenanigans to occur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, once you opened the doors, handgun drawn as a precaution, you slowly sweeped the area, checking if there were any stragglers, or rather...what was left of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarious vines strewn about the place, violently restraining the incapacitated cronies against the walls, akin to something straight out of an Aliens movie, minus the Facehuggers and Xenomorphs. Doing a head count, you counted a total of sixteen thugs out for the count, making the masked thug whose entrails were dangling from the fence outside number seventeen. Of course, Harley on the other hand, couldn't help but be bewildered and amazed at her gal pal's murderously botanical handiwork, a chuckle coming from her mouth as she quipped, \"<b>*whistle*</b> Talk about pest control! Hey, Pammy! Ya in 'ere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm in the Greenhouse!\" Her voice echoed, confirming her current status to you and the rotund Harley, which sounded like she was a few rooms away from where you and Harley were at. In response, Harley cheekily skipped on over to where her favorite Human-Plant hybrid was currently located, which caused her flabby heavyset physique to wobble and jiggle from such movement, with her ballooned buttocks, bulbous belly, and hefty breasts being the most jiggly. Meanwhile, you followed close behind your eccentric girlfriend, holstering your pistol in the process. Though, you figured that when Ivy meant <i>\"Greenhouse\"</i>, she was obviously referring to the large room filled with several fully grown trees planted in the area, especially since it was where Harley's little furry companions reside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after seeing much of what had gone down while you and Harley were at the hospital, the two of you soon reached the Greenhouse Room, seeing what you can call <i>\"The Epicenter\"</i> of the plant-based carnage that the famed Poison Ivy had unleashed upon her attackers, as you and Harley soon glimpsed upon the infamous Pamela Isley, who was currently toying with her now captured prey, tied down by an orchestra of Amazonian vines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, upon closer inspection, the man wearing the ski-mask looked as if he was in a complete trance, most likely due to one of Poison Ivy's unique abilities; The ability to secrete a specialized pheromone that seduces practically anyone who gets a whiff of such invisible fumes, which was one of the reasons why Ivy personally gave Harley a special herb that rendered the clown girl immune to Ivy's pheromones, along with giving her the added benefit of having near-superhuman agility.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I wouldn't recommend coming any closer, (Name), unless you want to end up being under my influence as well.\" Ivy calmly snapped, with her concentration currently focused on meticulously altering her captive's brain chemistry to make him more easily susceptible to her pheromones, which was going quite smoothly. Of course, taking her word for granted, you stayed where you currently stood, whilst Harley casually waddled her way over to her favorite gal pal, planting a kiss on the hybrid's green-skinned cheek and cheerfully quipped, \"Heya, Red! Hope ya didn't have too much fun without us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*giggle*</b> Don't worry, Harleen. You didn't miss much, fortunately.\" Ivy retorted, enjoying some of the plush softness that Harley now had on her overall physique, feeling how Harley's much heftier breasts and prominent apron belly press and smoosh against her own tightly smooth back and perky behind. A few moments later, the heavyset harlequin then reluctantly ended the loving embrace to allow Ivy to work her botanical magic on the pinned down thug, who almost looked like he was in a moronic stupor, complete with a sliver of drool on his lips. Suffice to say, you honestly weren't sure if this was an adverse side effect from someone being under the influence of Ivy's pheromones, or if said pheromones were killing enough of his brain cells to make him have a much lower IQ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, you've seen enough Batman media to know when to not get in Ivy's way, just as the red-haired hybrid began to work her botanical charms upon the heavily restrained gunman, to which she whispered seductive words into the man's ear and flirted, \"Now then, my big, strong, man~. Would you be kind enough to tell me who I should thank for the visit by you lovely boys~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, you figured that she was attempting to lull the crony into a deep hypnotic trance, whilst you instinctively covered both your nose and mouth with one hand as to avert inhaling the hypnotic pheromones yourself. Of course, due to the herbs that Ivy gave her long ago, Harley was essentially immune to the pheromones, taking in a nonchalant whiff of the fumes through her nostrils, and then exhaling it through her mouth, to which she cheekily joked, \"Mmm! Smells like strawberries!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Uuuugh...<b>*drunk chuckle*</b>...Sure, seeexy...why...why not...\" The man drunkenly answered to Ivy, the pheromones making his speech patterns more akin to a royally plastered drunkard,  his head moving and bobbing about in a slurred manner. In response, Ivy's lips contoured into a smugly cathartic grin, seeing how her alluring pheromones were still quite effective as ever, seeing the invisible fumes taking it's toll on the hardened man's psyche. And much like a stereotypical femme fatale, Ivy then used her seductive womanly charm and wiles to lull him even more into a false sense of security, just as the man then drunkenly elaborated, \"...<b>*drunk hiccup*</b>...<b>*drunk chuckle*</b>...Thish...Thish guy...<b>*drunk hiccup*</b>...shent me an'...the boys...<b>*drunk hiccup*</b>...callsh himshelf...Mad Hatter...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are ya serious?! Tetchie's afta me too?!\" Harley gasped, as you noted how surprised the hefty harlequin was upon hearing such information. Fortunately, due to playing both Arkham City and Arkham Origins, you instantly knew who they were referring to:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Jervis Tetch, The Mad Hatter.</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the uninitiated, Mad Hatter was one of the most enduring villains of Batman's Rogues Gallery, not to mention one of the more delusional psychos of Gotham City. In fact, Tetch actually believes he is the living incarnation of the Mad Hatter character from Lewis Carroll's most famous literary work, <i>Alice's Adventures In Wonderland</i>, some depictions going as far as to have him being diagnosed with schizophrenia, such as with the Arkham series. But aside from his self-inflated delusions, what made the Mad Hatter so dangerous was his expertise as a scientist, using a mix of technological mind-control devices and psychoactive drugs in order to influence and manipulate the minds of his victims, sometimes getting them to think they're characters from Alice In Wonderland, with kidnapped girls often being forced into the role of the titular character, Alice. And yet, he was one of the least physically threatening criminals in the Dark Knight's Rogues Gallery, often being portrayed as a man standing in at a diminutive 4 feet 11 inches, with an abnormally large cranium and unusually large teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in a few brief milliseconds, your mind had relapsed in order for you to get you caught up to speed on this version of Jervis Tetch, complete with giving you a small nosebleed from the faux brain hemorrhage in the aftermath. Instinctively, you looked back towards Ivy and the heavyset Harley, with a notably concerned tone in your voice and questioned, \"Wait, isn't he that little person who thinks he's a character from Alice In Wonderland?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is, except...he doesn't hire meatheads like Bozo over 'ere.\" Harley retorted, about as confused as you were, given that she attended one or two appointments with Jervis Tetch when she was still a psychiatrist working at Arkham Asylum, to which it was Ivy's turn to speak as she quipped, \"In fact, he's more likely to just drug and mind control those men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing what the two Gotham City Sirens just explained to you, the gears in your brain spun on overdrive, to which you then calmly answered, \"...Check under his ski mask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, both Ivy and Harley briefly eyed at one another in realization, where the Human-Plant hybrid then swiftly commanded a vine to snap the gunman's neck, thus killing him in the process. And just to add an R Rating to the situation, said vine violently ripped off the deceased crony's head with sickening effect. And with that, the plant presented the crudely decapitated head to it's mistress, to which Ivy then pulled off the ski mask from the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn turn, this revealed something that thickens the plot by a good few inches...</span></div></div>",

From there, Ivy plucked the card from the merc's head, personally expecting it to see if it was the genuine article, only to then see the bloodied microchip attached to the card. Ironically, the playing card was a Queen of Hearts, obviously symbolizing the insanely mad Red Queen from Alice In Wonderland. Now realizing it was indeed the real deal, Ivy spoke up towards you and Harley as she answered, \"...Yep, this is Tetch's handiwork alright. He always was obsessed with that delusion of his.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*annoyed sigh*</b> So I'm guessin' he wants ta do somethin' kinky wit' me?\" Harley groaned, lightly tugging at her iconic pigtails in annoyance with her chubby bleach white hands, eyes darting up towards the ceiling in some semblance of frustration. However, that would only be the least of her concerns, as you soon quickly noticed something put inside the ski mask, to which you then spoke toward Ivy and quipped, \"Let me see that ski mask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, Ivy commanded a vine to hand you the discarded ski mask, to which you shoved your hand inside the accessory, feeling a flat smooth substance embedded on the inside of the mask. With a swift series of hand movements, you inevitably pulled out a sheet of paper. Sure, it was slightly wrinkled and somewhat moist from the sweat, but it was still readable by most people. But after briefly reading a few sentences from the note, that feeling in your gut told you that this was bad news, to which you handed it over towards Harley whilst you sternly said, \"Harley, you need to read this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, shortly after letting go of her pigtails, Harley voluntarily grabbed the note from you, icking her tongue out in mild disgust from the soiled sheet of paper, only to then read the penmanship as it disclosed the following:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Oh Frabjous Day, Callooh Callay! Our Harley Quinn's here, it's time to play! Hope you not forgot about moi, Big and Beautiful? For I have a treat for you! A special extravaganza, just for you! Should you decline, a precious member of yours will have quite the tumble! Come to Queen's Dockyards, for you're late! Late! For a very important date!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sincerely,<br>\r\n    Jervis Tetch\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reading the entirety of the message, Harley had this expression of solid frustration and mild annoyance, as one of her lower eyelids twitched in an unnerved manner. Though, you couldn't exactly blame her for the irritability she was experiencing. After all, women who were currently pregnant tend to have more high-strung mood swings, and it definitely seemed more apt when it came to Harley, given her known state of mental health throughout the comics and other media. From there, she quickly turned the message over to see it's back, only to soon realize what the Mad Hatter meant by <i>\"A precious member of her's will have quite the tumble\"</i>:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA photograph of Sy Borgman's great-niece, Hannah Borgman AKA Hanuquinn, currently bound and gagged in a distressed state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMMIT!! He's got Sy's niece!\" Harley lashed out, jumping up and violently stomping her full quarter-ton weight down upon one of the deceased thugs in obvious frustration, causing the body to implode with several sickening noises in the process. However, Ivy was quick enough to repriman Harley's temper as she quipped, \"Temper, Harleen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hush! How was I supposed ta know Tetchie wants a piece a' me as well?!\" The heavyset harlequin snapped, exhaling a deep breath to calm herself down a little. However, it showed how peeved she was at Jervis Tetch for such a low blow as this, let alone involving the kidnapping of a member of her Gang of Harleys. Though, you had a sneaking suspicion that this wasn't the case, as you spoke up toward the rotund clown girl and answered, \"With all due respect, sweetie, I don't think he seems to be interested in the bounty on your head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...He's got a point. From what little time we've spent with him back at the Asylum, we both know he doesn't seem like the type to be interested in making a profit.\" Ivy acknowledged, agreeing with you on Jervis Tetch's modus operandi, given what little time they've spent interacting with the diminutive man back in Arkham Asylum. But as your eyes noted how Harley was clenching her plump hands into a tightened pair of fists, almost to the point of drawing blood from her palms, she soon replied back towards you and Ivy, only retorting, \"I know. But right now, Tetchie's made things REALLY personal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing you're going to just waltz right into where he's at, even though it could be a trap?\" You questioned, figuring that Harley wasn't in the mood for concocting a decent plan at the moment. Of course, that was only a moot point by now, as you and Ivy witness the heavyset harlequin rummage through one of the weapon lockers, her abundantly large chalk-white buttcheeks looking just a tad more prominent underneath her current choice of attire, which was now her preferred ensemble of red and black polyester booty shorts, an almost ill-fitting red and black corset, a set of red and black fingerless gloves, and a pair of red and black converse sneakers with white soles and shoelaces. Currently, she was straddling her signature two-handed mallet upon her rounded shoulders, with an equally effective baseball bat and one of her comically designed handguns holstered on her thickly meaty left leg, looking just about ready to crack some skulls in the process as she chirped, \"Ya read my mind, Puddin'!\"</span></div></div>",

Although she'll be crossed with you when this blows over, you figured Harley will thank you for this later when she felt like doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, underneath the body armor and bullet-resistant helmet, you couldn't help but experience the tell-tale goosebumps. Then again, you couldn't blame your body for behaving in such a manner. After all, this was the first time that you would consciously confront a member of Batman's Rogues Gallery, so it was undoubtedly a big deal. Sure, you were tortured by Harley's ex-boyfriend, The Joker, but that was merely a pre-fabricated memory to coincide with your existence in the DC Universe. But as you covertly perched yourself on a nearby warehouse rooftop, with a definitively clear view of Harley from above, you soon heard Ivy's voice over the internal comms installed in your helmet, as she voiced her concerns and said, <i>\"Do you even realize who you're going up against?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"...Yes, I'm well aware of who I'm confronting, Ivy. But I'm not gonna sit and watch as Mad Hatter does God-knows-what to Harley. You should know that by now.\"</b> You answered, the voice changer equipped around your neck altering your voice enough to make you more intimidating. Your eyes were currently fixated on Harley, and not just on her rather obvious adipose-filled assets and ta-tas, as her abundant buttcheeks bounced and buoyed within the near skin-tight confines of her smooth red and black booty shorts. In a casual gesture, she casually kicked a small can with one of her converse sneakers, obviously in some form of maintaining the stimuli in her brain, where you soon overheard her talking to herself thanks to the helmet's internal software,  to which she muttered, \"...Where are ya, Tetchie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her question was soon answered rather quickly when she turned the corner of one of the warehouses, only to soon gaze upon the main entrance of the adjacent building, complete with a distinctive sight:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small mob of 28 people all dressed up like denizens of the fictional Wonderland, most likely under the control of the Mad Hatter. The guys had those fancy rabbit masks covering their heads, while all of the women of the group were dressed up as the Red Queen's Card Soldiers. And like said aforementioned soldiers, the costumed women stood in attention, each holding a phony spear, with the spearheads in the shape of Spades, Diamonds, and upside down Hearts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the moment that Harley stood before the entrance to such an obvious trap, the entourage of Wonderland-themed individuals soon began to perform a stiffly choreographed dance, which didn't seem to faze Harley all that much, since she knew how much Jervis wanted to put on a show, to which the female Card Soldiers began to sing in unison as they sung, <i>\"You are very cordially - cordially - cordially - You are very cordially - invited to a party!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, the hypnotized men in the rabbit masks soon joined in on the unwilling chorus, only singing, <i>\"And it will be a grand affair - grand affair - grand affair - And it will be a grand affair - hosted by the Hatter!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, in an underwhelming finale to the involuntary performance, the female Card Soldiers soon had their turn, topping off the unwary sight before the hefty harlequin as they sang, <i>\"We do hope that you can come - you can come - you can come - We do hope that you can come - our beloved Queen of Hearts!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*sigh*</b> ...Well, at least Tetchie knows how ta put on a good show.\" Harley said to herself, as she noticed two of the female Card Soldiers stiffly opened the industrial sliding doors leading into the warehouse, akin to welcoming an important guest of the hour. Meanwhile, back on the rooftop, you watched as Harley calmly waddled her way inside the seemingly derelict building, to which you responded back to Ivy over the comms as you stated, <b>\"She's gone through the front entrance. I'm gonna find a way inside and give her some backup.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Understood. Just...be careful, (Name). Tetch might not look imposing, but it doesn't mean he'll have a few tricks up his coat sleeves.\"</i> The Human-Plant hybrid explained, obviously as a fair warning to you on what the Mad Hatter was capable of, as you fired up your jetpack and launched yourself toward the warehouse rooftop whilst you answered, <b>\"Noted.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>=======</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, within the depths of the decrepit warehouse, Harley calmly strolled her hefty self deeper into the bowels of the warehouse, behaving so nonchalantly, especially when it came to confronting someone she had some familiarity with. Of course, you stayed out of sight once you've snuck inside via a loose roof hatch, balancing yourself upon the rafters, hoping they were still sturdy enough to support your weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut like a theatrical play on Broadway, a series of floodlights started to turn on one by one, which soon revealed a rather peculiar sight, which came in the form of what looked like a crude representation of the interior of the Red Queen's palace, with another group of women dressed up as Card Soldiers, as if they awaited the arrival of the Queen of Hearts. And the centerpiece of the display? Hanuquinn bound and gagged on a scrappy-looking throne, forcibly dressed up as the titular character Alice, dress and blonde wig included. Sy's great-niece violently struggled against her restraints,  hoping she'd be able to warn her blubbery boss before it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Harley sashayed her way towards the captured Hanuquinn, removing the duct tape from the woman's mouth whilst she quipped, \"Easy there. I got ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, shortly after upchucking out a sock from her mouth, Hanuquinn impulsively exclaimed, \"It's a trap, boss!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, the moment Hanuquinn spoke, it caused some sort of simultaneous trigger on the hypnotized costumed women to soon slowly surround the two women, brandishing their card-themed spears whilst they cheerfully chanted, <i>\"Our Queen - Our Queen - Our Queen has arrived! She's late - She's late - For a very important date! She's not even dressed - for - the - occasion!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm aware, Hanuquinn.\" Harley nonchalantly remarked, as she quickly freed her underling with a pocket knife she hid in her bountiful cleavage, while the dozen female Card Soldiers encircled the two of them, until four of them swiftly grabbed Harley by the hem of her red and black booty shorts, yanking the heavyset harlequin away from the costumed Hanuquinn, with the woman helplessly watching as the dozen or so costumed women drag Harley away, to which she could only exclaim, \"Boss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine! Just get the hell outta 'ere! Go!!\" Harley yelled, telling Hanuquinn to worry about herself for the time being, just as one of the Card Soldiers promptly drugged Harley with a handkerchief dipped in chloroform so she'd fall unconscious. Now freed from her confines, Hanuquinn tried to rush off to rescue her boss, only to be hindered by some of the rabbit mask-wearing men in the process, who sang an eerie tune as they sang, <i>\"You are not invited - invited - invited - You are not invited - to the Hatter's party!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that now was a perfect time to intervene, you leapt from the rafters and administered a downward kick against the hypnotized man closest to Hanuquinn, violently knocking him to the floor. From there, you stood before the rabbit masked men, dual pistols in hand, with a boot firmly placed on the KO'd man's sternum, you then did your best intimidating voice, with the voice changer amplifying the effect as you growled, <b>\"Not tonight, dipshits.\"</b></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile, whilst you and Hanuquinn were currently preoccupied with taking down the entranced Wonderland-themed underlings, Harley on the other hand, was currently dealing with her own set of problems at the moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the chloroform slowly but surely began to wear off, as Harley began to regain consciousness. However, instead of seeing her beloved and Hanuquinn, her slowly dilating vision soon revealed a long table decorated with various tea sets, with her being accompanied by less than a dozen hypnotized <i>\"guests\"</i>, as Jervis Tetch would politely call them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of the diminutive criminal mastermind, sitting on the opposite end of the table, with a large floodlight illuminating his silhouette, there sat the man known as Jervis Tetch, better known as the Mad Hatter. Currently, much like his fictional counterpart, he was sipping on a cup of tea he brewed in his spare time, seemingly unaware of the awakened Harley Quinn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first instinct that came to mind was to check her surroundings, as Harley soon noticed how her previous outfit was replaced with a massive elegant-looking black and red dress that would fit perfectly on the circus fat lady. <i>\"<b>*sigh*</b> Figured Tetchie would dress me as da Red Queen.\"</i> She mentally noted, as she tried to dismount herself from the chair, only to soon realize her wrists were bound to the armrests via an absurd amount of duct tape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, she instantly ceased all movement the moment she heard the Hatter's voice, a voice befitting of the man's short stature, where he whimsically quipped, \"...More tea, My Queen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tetchie... What's goin' on?\" She questioned, obviously a little confused. Though, it was certainly an understandable feeling, considering how much progress Tetch made in getting this elaborate trap all set up in such a short period of time. However, noticing the current behavior and mannerisms the short-statured man had adopted, Harley could already tell that his Mad Hatter delusions are in control of the once-timid individual. Of course, the Hatter soon spoke back towards the dressed harlequin and chirped, \"<b>*chuckle*</b> What a question. Isn't it obvious, My Queen? We're having a tea party!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't feel like one ta me, Tetchie...\" Harley muttered to herself, to which her delusional captor soon whimsically spoke to his entranced attendees and cheerfully quipped, \"Oh, she's so confused, maybe I should...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, it's simple really. I planted a teeny tiny little idea in your head. A sort of remote hypnotic suggestion. Very complicated stuff, my dear. I'm sure you wouldn't understand but as you can see, it worked.\" He continued, just as Harley soon felt something gently attached to the side of her cranium, hence the feeling like her brain was swimming in a bad mix of gravy and honey. And as he exhaled a giddy chuckle, Tetch couldn't help but brag, to which he randomly hopped up onto the table to announce his proclamation whilst he whimsically boasted, \"Well, you're mine now. You're mine and there's nothing that Cobblepot can do about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, despite being well accustomed to being in proximity to maddened egos like Joker and Mad Hatter, Harley couldn't help but feel a little unnerved at how Tetch was behaving for the time being. In turn, she mentally hoped, <i>\"(Name), where da hell are ya? Now's a good time ta be a Knight in Shinin' Arma'!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>== Meanwhile... ==</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack over in the abandoned lobby of the warehouse, you and Hanuquinn had just finished up with giving the costumed underlings the ever-loving shit beaten out of them, as you violently judo throw one of the rabbit mask-wearing men right into an old oil drum, sending it clanging to the concrete floor in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the immediate threats taken care of, you looked back towards Hanuquinn, who had just finally finished annihilating one of the attackers with a rusty steel pipe, using it akin to a makeshift war club. Suffice to say, you don't blame her for such overkill, since she was involuntarily kidnapped by the Mad Hatter's hypnotized underlings. Being fairly concerned for the girl's mental state, you spoke up toward Hanuquinn, your real voice distorted by the voice changer whilst you asked, <b>\"Hey, Hanuquinn. You good?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*huff* *huff* *huff*</b> ...What the fuck do you think, asshole?\" She growled, gazing at you with a crazed look in her eyes, which seemed to be dying down somewhat. In a brief surge of anger, she violently threw the pipe overhead like a throwing axe in frustration, which ultimately landed on the far end of the warehouse. Of course, you don't fault her for her current mood, as you defused the tension and answered, <b>\"...Fair enough. Did you see where those weirdos took your boss?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after taking a deep breath or two, Hanuquinn straightened herself out and answered...</span></div></div>",

Those thoughts turned out to be unfounded though as you ended up seeing your own reflection. You were always a bit heavier due to an overactive sweet tooth as well as a general lack of energy to work the weight off. The reflection showed that you were actually a bit heavier than you were before; breasts were a bit fuller and softer now, hips were a tad wider, and your stomach was a smidgen more rounded. The thick crimson locks spilling from your head were a little longer than before as well, now reaching to roughly your mid-back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome concern grew as you started to notice the scars scattered around your body, most were on the small side except for a rather notable one going partway around your neck. Reaching up and tentatively touching the mark on your neck brought forth a smattering of disjointed images and sensations, much more vivid than you had experienced before.

You celebrated the final moments of the year of 2017, as the ball in Times Square slowly dwindled down from the pole, counting down the final ten seconds of 2017. However, when you returned to your spacious apartment condo in Midtown for some shut eye, little did you know that your life would be drastically changed forever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you inevitably awoke from your slumber, you oddly felt something soft and doughy pressed against your side, which prompted you to sit up and figure out what exactly you were feeling as you groggily muttered, \"*Yawn*...What...What the hell?\" You rubbed the sleep from your eyes, which cleared up your vision enough to see what, or rather who, was sleeping in bed with you: A woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, the woman appeared to be Caucasian, sporting blonde hair that grazed her shoulders. However, what out the most about this woman aside from her hair and beauty, was undoubtedly her blubbery girth. In appearance, the woman sported a pair of round plump facial cheeks, complimented by a chubby double chin and thick neck. Looking below her head and neck, the woman had a bountiful pair of Double F-Cup breasts, which were constrained by a straining green bra. And just below that, you could easily see one of the largest physical features of this woman: Her large and blubbery apron belly. Easily the size of a spare truck tire, the woman's voluminous stomach jutted out almost two feet from her body, as it pooched downward some and covered a good portion of her lap, while also giving her some well-defined love handles, as they mildly oozed out just above her green panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of panties... Underneath such lingerie, the sleeping woman had quite the blubbery pair of hips and buttcheeks, as her hips were easily four and a half feet in diameter, while each of her buttcheeks were approximately the size of a beach ball. And finally, you noticed how thick, chubby, and doughy both her legs and arms were, as each leg was about as thick as a pillow, while her arms were half as doughy. Overall, if you had to wager a guess, you had to estimate that the woman's weight had to at least be around 500 to 600 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, despite your estimations, your mind still pondered over several reasonable questions, such as \"Who was this woman?\", \"How did she get here?\", \"Why was she sleeping with you?\", and \"Why was she so fat?\" After all, you don't remember having a girlfriend, let alone one who weighed 500 to 600 pounds. However, you need to get some answers as to what exactly was going on here, so you decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Figuring that the rotund woman sleeping in bed with you won't exactly be giving you some decent answers anytime soon, you decided to dismount from your bed and investigate your apartment condo, just to see if anything else had changed besides you sleeping in bed with a very fat woman. After all, you didn't want to provoke a woman trying to get some beauty sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after carefully slipping yourself out of bed, you cautiously made your way toward the door that led out into the main apartment condo, which were now a pair of double doors, possibly so this woman could easily get in and out without getting her fat blubbery ass wedged in the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, once you stealthily exited the bedroom, you could easily see that everything looked the same as you remembered before you went to sleep.... Well, somewhat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat stayed the same in your spacious apartment condo, there was your 108 inch Flatscreen TV and entertainment center, complete with your PlayStation 4 Pro, as well as your trove of PS4 video games neatly organized within said entertainment center. However, instead of seeing two leather reclining chairs standing opposite of the entertainment center, you saw what appeared to be a large red love seat with a coffee table in front of it, both of which you distinctly remembering not buying or having in your possession whatsoever. Glancing around further, you then noticed that there were a few framed pictures placed upon the coffee table. Of course, your curiosity piqued, where you then picked up the largest framed picture of the bunch with both hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the photograph, you could clearly both yourself and the large woman, as the framed photo featured yoyy and the unknown woman posing for the camera. In the photo, the two of you were holding onto each other in a loving yet romantic embrace, with the blonde woman wrapping a doughy arm around your neck, while you had an arm barely wrapped around her bulky and padded waist. Obviously, you were both leaning into each other in a loving manner, where the woman sported a shy yet awkward smile whilst displaying a profound blush on her chubby cheeks, while you displayed a confident, pleased grin. Overall, the sight showed a pleasant yet absolutely cute moment between you and the rotund blonde woman. But then, you soon noticed some writing on the bottom of the photo that said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Your Name) + June Moone = Star-Crossred Lovers. 3rd Anniversary--Together since 2015.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to such a revelation, you exhaled a deep breath of relief. \"...Well, at least I've gotten some sort of answer.\" You thought to yourself, as you soon noticed that you now had a golden ring on your left ring finger, which symbolized marriage, catching you somewhat off-guard. So, you and this... \"June Moone\", have been together for a total of three years, which would make this the year 2018. At least time seemed to be moving normally. And yet, this still didn't exactly fully explain what was going on around here, as you then took a look at the other pictures shortly after setting the first photo back down on the coffee table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn these photos, almost all of them consisted of you and June together doing different things, such as watching fireworks, attending a movie premiere, visiting the Coney Island Amusement Park, the list went on. The one thing you did notice however, was that June seemed thinner in a lot of those pictures. Sure she was still big, but it seemed like if you looked at the photos, you could clearly see some sort of timeline of her getting bigger and fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\" You muttered out loud, taking in all of this information. Judging from the photo time lapse, you could see that she progressed from being kinda big (Maybe around 180 to 200 pounds, if you had to wager a guess) to the 500 pound plus woman she is now, nearly three years later. It was actually somewhat impressive, if you were being honest. Also, it seemed that both you and June appeared to be in a good relationship, as every picture you saw displayed you two being quite happy. And yet, the woman's name, June Moone, seemed very familiar to you, but you couldn't exactly put your finger on it. But still, it kind of made you wonder if you should head back into your bedroom sand wake her up. After all, maybe you could ask her everything you two did last night, get a bit more inddight on the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither that, or check out your apartment some more. Eventually, you decided to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You clenched back some on the floor, as your vision was mildly blurred while your ears rang uncomfortably, where you instinctively ran for cover, which came in the form of a wooden Island in the Kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, you didn't have to wait long to figure out what was going on, as you soon heard several sets of footsteps rush their way inside the apartment condo. Of course, you took a quick peek from behind the Island, only to soon realize what exactly was going on:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour home was under siege.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, as for who exactly was sieging into your home, they appeared to be a squad of five soldiers, all geared up in Spec Ops outfits and equipment, armed with assault rifles and plenty of ammunition to boot. Judging from their speech, they appeared to be Russian Special Forces. But...Why were they in your home? \"Alright, fan out and search the perimeter. She has to be around here somewhere.\" One of the soldiers said, speaking to his comrades with a thick Russian accent, where the other soldiers soon cautiously and deliberately began to search your apartment condo for...whoever they were searching for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, putting two and two together, your eyes went wide with realization that these Russian Spec Ops guys were most likely here for June Moone! But...Why? Why were these Russian soldiers after her? The questions kept piling on to your already established confusion. However, something snapped inside your mind and subconscious, as you began to stealthily and quietly pull out a few steak knives from one of the Island's drawers closest to your current position, brandishing the knives in your hands, ready to strike the nearest Russian soldier who approaches you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later, just as one of the Russian soldiers was just around the corner from spotting you, you swiftly lunged at the soldier, stabbing him in the shoulder, and pinning him on his back. From there, you quickly delivered a violent punch to his masked face, knocking the soldier out cold in the process. Unfortunately, your actions didn't go unnoticed, as a female Russian soldier soon spotted you and yelled, \"Contact!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she began to open fire on you, but not before you quickly grabbed the assault rifle from the unconscious injured Russian soldier, dive rolling away from the stream of bullets aimed squarely at you. Fortunately, yo managed to find cover, which essentially came in the form of the aforementioned love seat, firing back blindly whilst avoiding getting yourself shot in the process, as bullets whizzed past by only mere inches away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fighting and barrage of gunshots from both parties continued to echo throughout the apartment condo for almost six full minutes, until suddenly... The squad of Russian soldiers have stopped firing upon you. It was strange, but against your better judgement considering the situation, you slowly poked your head out from behind the bullet hole-riddled love seat, only to see that the Russian soldiers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>However, much to your surprise, instead of seeing multiple Russian soldiers simply reloading their firearms, they were apparently now suspended in mid-air. Judging from the situation alone, the soldiers were held aloft yet heavily restrained by a mystical green aura which surrounded their individual bodies. You noticed that you obviously weren't the one who was doing this, as you thought to yourself, \"...What the? Who's doing this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my. It seems we have some rude, uninvited guests.\" An ethereal voice rang out from behind you, which strangely sounded like two different women speaking in unison, accompanied by what sounded like a mix between mild chiming noises and low murmuring humming sounds. Suffice to say, this was getting stranger and stranger by the second. <br>\r\nHowever, knowing that you were eventually going to find out who was restraining the Russian soldiers, you slowly turned around to see what or who was behind you, only to see someone completely unexpected:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mystical sorceress of DC Comics, known only...as Enchantress!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, you suddenly realized something, as you soon remembered who June Moone actually was: She was the Enchantress! Or rather, the hostess to the spirit of a god-like witch called Enchantress. Though, judging from her appearance, she was just as fat and rotund as June Moone was when you saw her in bed, as Enchantress seductively sashayed her way out of the bedroom, her hands exhibiting the exact same mystical green aura that restrained the squad of Russian soldiers, where you noticed that Enchantress's outfit was ss mix between her costume from DC Rebirth and her outfit from Injustice 2, which consisted of a one piece green leotard, gray and green hooded cloak, and knee-high brown heeled boots, which easily showed off her thick, fat, doughy thunder thighs and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Enchantress momentarily looked at you with her luminescent green eyes, as if she was checking to see if you were unharmed, which seemed uncharacteristic for the character considering that Enchantress wasn't exactly portrayed as a heroic protagonist in the Suicide Squad comics. \"Did they harm you, lover boy?\" She asked, which seemed to surprise you a little, considering that the spirit of Enchantress didn't give a damn about June Moone's well-being nor her relationship with anyone. So, in response, you calmly stood up and quickly retorted \"...Yeah. Aside from bejjng hit by an exploding Flashbang, I'm fine, Enchantress.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after looking at the magically restrained squad of Russian soldiers, you looked back at the rotund Enchantress, who channeled her magic into restraining the soldiers with little to no effort, where you then spoke toward her and said, \"...So, what gave away the fact that I was in trouble?\" \"...The obvious sounds of gunfire.\" Enchantress coyly retorted, speaking to you in that ethereal voice of hers, who couldn't help but let out an almost sadistic chuckle as she replied, \"To think their little toy guns and bullets would ever stand an inkling of a chance against the power of magic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Enchantress couldn't help but boast a little, especially since she highly regarded that magic would always be superior to technology, as you both then heard one of the restrained soldiers began to shout obscenities at you and Enchantress as he spoke in a thick Russian accent and growled, \"Let us down, you bloated bitch!\" Obviously unamused by the soldier's vulgar tongue, Enchantress used her magic to grab the cursing soldier, where she then violently flung her pillowy arm to the left, thus sending the restrained soldier flying into the wall at breakneck speeds, possibly fracturing some of the man's bones on impact. Then, she flicked her doughy left arm up and down in a violent manner, which of course, sent the soldier being smacked violently against both the ceiling and floor at breakneck yet pain-inducing speeds. The scene itself seemed very reminiscent of a certain scene in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, where Supreme Leader Snoke repeatedly smacked General Hux against the interior of the Star Destroyer bridge by using the Force. Suffice to say, it was entertaining...in a dark comedjjc way, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two full minutes of violently bouncing the vulgar soldier against the ceiling and floor like a pinball in a pinball machine, Enchantress finally ceased her sadistic mystical beatdown on the soldier who called her \"a bloated bitch\", where she then placed the bloodied soldier back alongside his restrained comrades. \"Anyone else would like to contribute to this conversation?!\" Enchantress yelled, raising her eerily calm ethereal voice to a threatening eldritch roar, which definitely rendered the remaining Russian soldiers to involuntarily shut themselves up, considering that they don't want to invoke the wrath of the Enchantress any further than their friend and squadmate has.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short moment later, Enchantress took that soldiers' unanimous collective silence as a solid \"No\", where she then retorted, \"Nothing? Good.\" From there, she crossed her pillowy arms while still channeling her magic, where she thought out loud and said, \"Now... What to do with you, you sniveling worms. Sending you all to a dark dimension? No, way too easy. Ten thousand hours of unrelenting torment? Pfft! Child's play...\" Seeing as how she seemed indecisive on what to do with the Russian soldiers, Enchantress soon turned to face you and coyly asked, \"(Name), darling... What do you think should be the fate of such crude guests? After all, you're the wounded party in all of this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, despite you were luckily not heavily injured, Enchantress did raise a fair valid point, even though the soldiers' original intent was to capture June Moone before she could even transform into Enchantress. Eventually, after a few moments of contemplating on what to do with the restrained soldiers, you eventually decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although, as much as you personally wanted to see those Russian soldiers get their asses completely fried by Enchantress, you knew that such a bloody and violent solution probably won't be giving you some decent answers, as you soon looked back at the corpulent Enchantress and sternly answered, \"...Right now, I want some goddamn answers from them. These bastards better have a damn good reason why they just rushed into our condo, guns blazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, in response to such an answer, the Enchantress expressed a somewhat disappointed look on her chubby face, where she spoke toward you with her ethereal voice and replied, \"Aww! Really? I so wanted to turn two or three of these sniveling worms into newts.\" \"Maybe another time. But right now, we need some answers as to why they're after you and June.\" You firmly retorted, crossing your arms in the process. At first, Enchantress seemed reluctant for the two of you to interrogate individuals whom she compared to mere insignificant worms, but eventually she saw the reasoning behind your decision, shrugging her plump shoulders in response then said, \"Hmm... Fair enough, I suppose, lover boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, both you and Enchantress simultaneously approached the mystically restrained Russian soldiers, stopping only a few feet away from them, where you then spoke toward the levitating restrained soldiers, hands behind your back, and sternly said, \"Alright, you sacks of shit! Here's how this is going down. You Siberian jarheads are going to tell us who sent you here, and why you're after my girl June.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And if we do not give you such answers?\" One of the Russian soldiers scoffed, whom you assumed to be the leader of the squad, obviously not intimidated by your idle demands. However, that wasn't going to end well for him, as he soon felt his throat suddenly becoming clogged up by an unseen mystical force, which of course, was caused by none other than the obese Enchantress herself, who pressed her slightly chubby thumb against her mildly plump index and middle fingers on her left hand, all whilst her hands glowed a mystical green aura. Of course, she displayed a sadistic grin on her smooth but cherubic face, as she casually spoke toward the suffocating soldier with her ethereal voice and smugly remarked, \"...Then I get to take my sweet time slowly unraveling your organs from the inside out, then ultimately devour your soul. Is that any more clear for your primitive mind, worm?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, in response to one of his captors slowly strangling him, the leading Russian soldier quickly nodded his head yes in confirmation, hoping that Enchantress would be merciful enough to let him breathe again. Fortunately for him, Enchantress was feeling generous enough to allow him to breathe, as she undid the spell she placed inside his throat with just a flick of her right hand and wrist, causing the Russian soldier to gasp for air, then inhale and exhale several shallow breaths, so he could get some oxygen flowing through his lungs once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Enchantress.\" You said, thanking her for getting the point across to the stubborn Russian soldiers. Of course, Enchantress couldn't help herself but display a prideful grin on her chubby face and slightly plump lips upon hearing such a compliment from you, where she then spoke toward you with a flirtatious tone in her ethereal voice as she replied, \"*chuckle* Well, I aim to appease, lover boy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, you smiled back at the corpulent Enchantress, where you then focused back onto the restrained Russian soldiers, your tone now a stern one, as you spoke toward the leader of the squad of soldiers and firmly asked, \"Now then, \"comrade\"... Who sent you?\" \"*scoffs* As if we'll ever talk to the likes of you, American!\" One of the male soldiers exclaimed, being mighty stubborn on confessing the necessary answers you need. However, his crude response wasn't exactly received well by his peers, as the squad leader growled, \"Shut it, Krinkov!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, \"Krinkov\". You should really listen to your superiors. After all, you and your fellow soldiers aren't exactly in the best situation to back-talk us.\" Enchantress smugly retorted, noticing the slowly expanding schism between Krinkov and his squadmates. Once more, you spoke toward the restrained Russian soldiers and sternly said, \"I'll ask again: Who. Sent. YOU?!\" Obviously knowing that they have little to no choice in the matter at hand, the soldiers began to disclose the objective of their mission, which was to...</span></div></div>",

However, their commander eventually spoke up and answered, \"...We...We were assigned by the higher-ups in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. That's all you need to- GAH!!\" But as the squad commander was about to finish that comment, Enchantress swiftly used her magic to violently twist his left arm in a way where it's not supposed to actually bend, painfully dislodging his arm in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Enchantress casually wagged a chubby right index finger from side to side, as if she was joyfully taunting the injured squad commander while she spoke toward him with a mocking tone in her ethereal voice as she said, \"Uh uh uh! Sniveling worms like you shouldn't be back-talking!\" \"Stop, please! Leave Sergey alone!\" The female soldier yelped, begging for Enchantress not to harm the squad commander, Sergey, any further than she already has. Of course, such a pleading outburst easily caught the obese Enchantress's attention, where she calmly sashayed her way over toward the restrained female soldier, which made her wide bulky hips sway from left to right with each sashaying step she made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she reached her, Enchantress casually stroked the female soldier's lithe face, all while she spoke toward the female soldier with an amused yet coyly condescending tone as she said, \"...You are quite brave for a worm, little girl! I think I will kill you last.\" Obviously, such a twisted comment coming from the rotund Enchantress had rendered the hardened female soldier to give herself a severe case of cold feet, which made her extremely unnerved by Enchantress's presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Enchantress returned to your side, where you then spoke toward Sergey and questioned, \"Okay, so you and your squad were hired by Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, what I want to know, \"Sergey\", is the reason why they sent you all the way out here for in the first place. Care to enlighten me?\" Knowing that he had little choice on the matter considering his current predicament, Sergey exhaled a heavily frustrated sigh, where he inevitably spoke toward you and explained, \"...Our primary objective was to obtain and capture Mrs. June Moone, better known as Enchantress, then escort her back to the homeland. However, you were a secondary objective, Jack-Knife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you WERE attempting to kidnap June! And let me wager a guess: Russia is trying to create it's own Suicide Squad?\" You said, confirming what you had previously expected when the Russian soldiers first broke into your apartment condo, while also suspecting the reason why the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs was after Enchantress in the first place. And yet, the squad commander called you by such an unexpected alias an antihero deserves, Jack-Knife, you could only guess that this was your alias in this world. Judging from the name, you could only guess that in this new world you're very proficient at using knives, much like how Captain Boomerang is proficient with boomerangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, in response to your speculation, Sergey let out a dry morbid chuckle and answered, \"...What? Did you really think that Amanda Waller's pet project was America's best kept secret? The nations of the world have been scrambling to assemble their own Task Force X to combat Meta-Human terrorism, with varying degrees of success. After all, China was ballsy enough to create their own version of the Justice League, for Christ sakes!\" Upon keenly listening to every word spewing from Sergey's mouth, you slowly but surely began to realize something, as your mind dawned upon a startling revelation:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now in the DC Universe! More specifically, the DC Rebirth Universe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, you managed to keep yourself calm and collected, despite just learning that you were now within the DC Universe as a whole. \"Feeling satisfied with such trivial answers, lover boy?\" Enchantress queried, speaking toward you with her ethereal voice, asking you if you were now satisfied with getting the necessary answers from your \"guests\". Of course, you definitely seemed sufficiently satisfied in your endeavor, where you then spoke toward the corpulent Enchantress and calmly answered, \"*sigh*...Yeah, I think I got enough answers to figure out why they're here, Enchantress. You can do whatever you want to them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, lover boy! Those are the exact words I've been hoping for you to say sooner.\" Enchantress gleefully chirped, quickly rubbing her somewhat plump hands together with a semblance of eager yet sadistic anticipation, all whilst she expressed an almost sadistic grin on her cherubic face, as if she was going to enjoy every little second of their torment. However, just as she was about to commence her mystical handiwork upon the restrained squad of Russian soldiers, you quickly spoke toward Enchantress and said, \"Oh! And please: Would you keep the blood and gore down to a minimum? You know how much a pain in the ass it is to clean bloodstains off the floor.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, this seemed to have made Enchantress somewhat frustrated but disappointed at your comment, exhaling a heavy sigh in response, where she then looked at you, placing her slightly chubby hands on her padded hips, speaking toward you with her ethereal voice and asked, \"Oh? And how would you want us to deal with such sniveling worms then, lover boy?\" From there, you calmly approached the rotund Enchantress, where you then began to whisper into her ear about what you had in mind. However, what you were whispering into her ear seemed to have piqued her interest, causing Enchantress to slowly but surely form a sadistic grin on her cherubic face, where she gleefully retorted, \"...Ooooh!! I absolutely love the sound of that, lover boy!\" And what you had in mind for the fate of the five Russian soldiers, as Enchantress...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>\"Whatever is done for love always occurs beyond good and evil...\"</i> -Friedrich Nietzsche, Philosopher<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>=====</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWise men would say that life can take some unexpected turns when one least anticipates them. Unbeknownst to you, such phrasing couldn't be farther from the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reality, you were never really that much of a popular person, as you slowly drug yourself back onto your bed within your one-person apartment, feeling quite disillusioned after being \"Friend-Zoned\" by your date only hours prior. Why? Well, turns out she's one of those self-proclaimed \"Man-Hating Feminists\" you've heard about all across the internet and social media.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, her dissing you with such rudeness didn't do favors for your self-esteem, as you tossed aside your suit coat, necktie, dress shirt, pants, and shoes and socks onto the floor, collapsing onto your bed in defeat in the process. And yet, as the veil of slumber inevitably drowned your consciousness, little were you aware of your upcoming change in fortune and luck the next time you awoke...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>== 9 Hours Later... ==</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in the dreaming world, you couldn't ignore this gnawing weird feeling that something was amiss, unaware of a certain distinguished entity from the Fifth Dimension rewriting and rearranging your current perceptions of reality, as you sluggishly albeit inevitably arouse from slumber. Your vision initially blurry, but it soon sharpened in contrast and definition, as you eventually gazed upon the sunlit expanse of your new environs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you thought nothing seemed different, but you then felt the newly invigorated cushioning underneath you, as your left hand sunk into the softened surface momentarily. From there, your eyes soon wandered off, quickly taking note of your bed's newfound size and shape. Instead of a one-person mattress bed, what was left is now a downright massive Double King-Sized circular mattress bed, complete with silky fleece bedsheets and fluffed out pillows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, much like the bed, the room itself seemed more...<i>\"Expansive\"</i> at best, adorned with several pieces of bedroom furniture, as well as having a few archaeological artifacts displayed on the adjacent walls. Some had originated from undoubtedly Greek mythology, others from variously contrasting foreign lands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, apart from such distinctive details, the most striking of them all were the almost quiet breathing noises emanating just beside you. Instinctively, your odd sense of curiosity took hold, where you cautiously redirected your gaze to your left, with intent to discover the source. But by doing so, you soon laid your eyes upon the most peculiar spectacle:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn opulently obese anthropomorphic Cheetah-person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, much to your own sanity, you didn't initially flee from the entity, obtaining a better look upon your bedside partner. Upon closer inspection, you can easily see that this Human-Cheetah hybrid was without a shred of doubt female, especially if the bloated fleshy orbs the size of medicine balls that were unmistakably breasts, equally padded hips, and entire absence of male genitalia were anything to go by with your observations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from all the golden yellow feline fur with black spots scattered across her corpulent form, the most notable feature she had in regards to fur or hair was the somewhat yet supple amount of fiery crimson hair adorned upon the Cheetah-Woman's chubby feline head, which looked messy as a result of unconsciously tossing about in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, besides what appeared to be a pink collar with a large heart-shaped medallion adorned upon it, the more obvious features were her sheer weight and girth, with thick meaty arms and legs, fattened paw-like hands and fingers, an unsubtle posterior with a feline tail slowly twitching about, and a rather prominent flabby apron of a stomach, all of which were completely unrestrained by any form of clothing save for her birthday suit. If you had to gamble on a guess, you theorized that this beastly beauty had to have weigh in at about over five hundred to six hundred pounds, possibly even a little more than that, given how much space she would take up on the lavishly large bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, as you watched her fat blubbery gut slowly inflate and deflate with each slumbering breath from her feline snout, you uncharacteristically began to develop a crimson-hued blush upon your cheeks, as your hand unconsciously placed itself upon the uppermost curve of the feline woman's mammoth gut, feeling the silky soft tufts of fur run through your fingertips, as you soon began to slowly rub the surface of her abdomen in large, calm, and soothing circles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely, it was quite therapeutic for you, only to then hear a most distinct noise to exhale from the slumbering beastwoman:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPurring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoft. Gentle. Peaceful. Purring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt so foreign and contradicting, compared to the black feline claws that subtly adorned her thick fatty pawed fingers that she could easily use to claw out your throat if she wanted to. And yet, judging from all the sleeping mewling and purring she was creating, it seemed you found her metaphorical weak spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You wake up feeling refreshed, incredibly refreshed...in fact, it's probably the best sleep you've ever had in a while. As you wake up more, you realize the reason for that: you're sleeping on one of the most comfortable beds you've ever seen. Who designed it, angels? But, a new thought settles in: this isn't your bed. This isn't even your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not going to deny it, you'd love to stay in a place like this. It's an incredibly posh bedroom that must belong to a rather large house, a mansion really. This place really is outfitted with some of the fanciest furniture you've ever seen, and it looks like there are all kinds of gadgets and gizmos to control it all. You didn't know you needed seven different switches to change the ambient lighting. What did you do last night, hook up with Bruce Wayne?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlay time's over though. You've had your fun. Whatever happened last night was a pretty nice break, and you hope whoever it was that took you to their place last night will be a lasting thing. Hard to pass up a lifestyle like this. All the same, you do have to kind of figure out who they are, or at least where you are. Gazing out of the enormous windows, you can see a city skyline just on the horizon, but it's not any kind of a city you recognize. You shrug. What do you know anyway? You're in some mansion outside of the city, of course you don't know which city it is looking at it from that far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly put back on your clothes and traipse out to the living room. You were right: this is some kind of mansion. You've never seen a room this big before. It's like someone could hold a whole party in here, and it's probably likely that a socialite of this caliber probably has. You feel so out of place here. Plain, ordinary you somehow scored it big with someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity takes hold, and you start to look around more. There's lots of fancy, and probably expensive, art decorating the corners of the room, and you really don't understand any of it. That's rich people art for you. A gigantic fireplace roars with a warm glow at one end of the room with an equally large television above. You're afraid to sit on the furniture because it does look so nice, and it looks like someone took a good amount of time making this place spotless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump when you hear a door opening behind you. Maybe you'll finally get to meet this mysterious person. Shock is the best way you can describe your emotions right now. Never, in your wildest dreams, did you expect this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's...well it's Batwoman! The Batwoman! You can hardly believe it, but there she is, red and black outfit and pale makeup and all, standing right there before you. Well, that certainly explains the lavish place you woke up in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, if that isn't enough of a shock, there's also the fact that Batwoman is enormous! Quite frankly, you're a little surprised someone her size is still able to be up and walking, or in her case waddling. That black leather outfit is really straining to stay stretched over her fat frame. Breasts the size of watermelons have stretched the bat symbol on the front of her uniform until it's barely recognizable. Her gut, which folds neatly into a second roll, surges forward, hanging just above her knees and buries her utility belt in fat. Thinking about the belt, you're surprised to even know they can make a belt that size. Most impressive of all are her wide round hips, which could block a whole hallway if you're not careful. You can't help but stare at them with...arousal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles at you and starts to take off the long, dark-red wig she wears to cover up her lighter red, and shorter hair. \"Yeah, I know I'm late,\" she says. \"You kind of know the drill with night patrols now, and stuff. You didn't already eat breakfast, did you?\" She has a pleading look on her face, and you suddenly remember that she always feels bad when she's late for anything that has to do with you. Wait...does that mean you two have been dating for a while now? You're pretty sure you would have remembered that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no, I just woke up,\" you answer quickly, realizing you were getting lost in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe beams. \"Perfect, then we can have breakfast together. I'll get out of...work clothes and come out in a sec.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I kinda want to freshen up myself,\" you say. You're still having trouble processing that you're dating Batwoman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, but you always look good,\" she says, tapping you on the nose before giving you a quick peck. \"Okay, I'll tell the cooks the usual, and I'll join you in a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddles off towards the kitchens, at least that's what you assume. You head back to the bedroom and scurry into the bathroom. This is ridiculous, you think to yourself. There is no way you of all people can be dating Batwoman, and how the hell did she get so big? These are questions, of course, you can't ask her directly. She seems to think you've always been dating her, which is another weird phenomenon you're going to have to figure out. In the meantime, you figure you'll get ready for a late brunch with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look in the mirror to fix your hair, and you see...</span></div></div>",

But, despite your heavier frame, you're still adorable, and you've had your fair share of flings in the past. It's not like you can't attract anyone with your looks. Still, you have always been a little self-conscious about your weight, especially your flabby gut. But, given who you're dating and how big she is, you look pretty good. You decide to finish up quickly and head back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head back towards where you assume the dining room is. Again, you're surprised by the very modern-looking kitchen, with a small island dividing it from the dining room. Batwoman has changed out of her outfit, no longer covered in makeup and the eye-catching wig. She now looks like Kate, her regular self, well, mostly her old self. Those enormous hips fill up two chairs at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pats the chair next to her, indicating for you to sit. \"So, ready to read me the daily stats?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolls her eyes. \"Of course, you can't function in the morning without that little tablet of yours. Honestly, you lose it all the time; you need to tie that thing to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gets up and returns later with a really advanced tablet and sets it before you. \"You left it in the cabinets again,\" she says. \"Doing a little midnight snacking, are we? Alright, now we're ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost without thinking, you turn it on, tap several buttons, and a holographic map of the city pops up. \"Okay, so after analyzing the footage from last night, the reason that landing here...\" You pull in a close up of Batwoman jumping from a great height. She makes the landing but hits her knee in the wrong spot, just a hair off from her mark. \"Is because this spot in the building is under renovation. Structurally, it isn't a good place to jump off of, not given your measurements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere the hell did that come from? You were never great at math in school, and you're not even sure where you know all of this information. Plus, you blush at mentioning Batwoman's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't seem to notice. She's busy examining the diagrams on your tablet. \"Wow,\" she says. \"I don't think some of dad's best analysists would have found all that. Good work, my little techie.\" She kisses you on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're still reeling after all the information you just spouted off, and you're not entirely sure what just happened. But, somehow, you're some kind of tech support to Batwoman, as well as her girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast is shortly served after that, and it's more like a breakfast buffet. You've never seen so much food just for two people. Then again, Batwoman must've developed quite an appetite to get to the size she is and still be able to do all the calorie-burning activities she does on a daily basis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, your own stomach starts to rumble with a hunger you've never felt before. You've never been one to have an immense appetite before. You just sort of got chubby thanks to genetics and a certain degree of laziness. However, you can't help yourself as you plate a heaping stack of pancakes and drizzle it in more syrup than you probably should put on. You're also not going to pass up on the bacon, and you get a hefty handful of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatwoman laughs. \"Okay, okay, breakfast first, and then we can talk more.\" She begins getting her own helpings, which are twice the size, if not three times the size of yours. She goes for a little bit of everything. After all, she asked for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a little over an hour, there really isn't a lot of talking between the two of you, just eating. You're kind of surprised with yourself, as you didn't realize you could put away a whole meal and then some like that. Still, even after you finish all those pancakes and bacon, you're still craving some of the fresh strawberries and heavily buttered toast. Batwoman already has a stack of plates off to the side that has to be at least a foot tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you're both finished, you feel as though another bite would have made you pop. You look over at your girlfriend. She looks stuffed and satisfied, but not distressed in the least by it. Rather, she looks like as if she's only had a morning snack and is just being polite by not asking for more. You, on the other hand, look like a real butterball, stuffed to within an inch of bursting. You really overdid it, and you're not sure how that happened. Maybe Batwoman's habits are rubbing off on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles and rubs your extended belly. Yours is more pronounced because you were thinner to begin with. \"Haha, you keep that up, and you'll be as big as me in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like you could melt into a puddle right now. In fact, you know you could probably get as big as her easily. She at least goes out and does all kinds of acrobatics. You just sit around on the computer giving her advice. She senses your distress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about it so much. You know I love my cute, little butterball all the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile, glad she means that, but still unsure.</span></div></div>",

A few footsteps can be heard, and you hear some hushed whispers. Your heart thunders in your chest. Kate doesn't flinch but grabs a gun from the hidden holster under her shirt. \"Hide,\" she says in a single command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't need to be told twice. You waddle as fast as your legs can carry you in your overfilled state to a guest bedroom down the hall and lock the door tight. You were smart enough to grab your tablet on the way out. At least this way, you can keep an eye on the fight and help your girlfriend if needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hidden cameras in the house come to life, and you select the feed that shows you Kate, who has changed back into her Batwoman costume surprisingly quick. Several thugs dressed in dark robes have broken into the house, and they came armed to the teeth. They must've known who they were going up against. You recognize these figures as being followers of the Religion of Crime, a group Kate has worked hard to uncover and try to put a stop to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I see you decided to bring the fight to me,\" Batwoman says. \"Perfect, gave me time to get in a well-balanced breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls out a second gun and fires from both at the two nearest operatives. You're not too afraid of the blood and gore since you know that she uses rubber bullets. But those will still pack a punch, and hopefully, incapacitate them. One bullet hits its mark on the shoulder of one of the hooded figures. He drops to the ground, crying out in pain. She kicks his dropped weapon out of his reach and has decided to go for him first. He takes a knee straight to the jaw, breaking it, and leaving him down for the rest of the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second thug dodged the bullet and is coming up from behind. \"Behind you!\" you yell into the microphone on your tablet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe strikes him swiftly and smiles up at the camera, and she talks in the mic on her ear. \"Thanks, babe, but I think I've got this bunch. Check the rest of the feeds, let me know what I'm working with, put this place on lockdown, and alert the usual authorities. They'll be pretty quick to get to a Gotham socialite's home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe goes back to fighting the six other attackers in the front hall. You quickly type in all the codes to set the house on a lockdown to prevent others from getting in, if they haven't already. Doing a quick search of the house, you learn that there are at least six more cultists in the house, making for a dozen altogether she needs to take care of. You trust your girlfriend's abilities, especially since it's your life also on the line if she can't handle it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also call the authorities, saying that Kate Kane's mansion had been broken into. You don't mention who you are, since you're not sure if you're a known girlfriend to Batwoman or Kate. It's so hard to keep up with all these secret identities, you think. After all, you're going to need someone to come collect the culprits once your girlfriend's done with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go back to the feed with her still fighting the main group in the front hall. It looks like she's taken out two more, leaving her only three to finish off. \"Two more heading upstairs, one heading for our bedroom, and three scattered down the west hall. I think they're looking for something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe punches another operative between the eyes. \"Yeah, you. I think this was a hit. They wouldn't get so ballsy to come here on their own without a reason. Stay where you are and don't make a sound. Hide only if you hear something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold your breath, hoping she's able to finish this soon. You've never been in any kind of a high-pressure situation like this before. Or, rather, the old you hasn't. You're not sure how much experience this new you has. You realize, though, that there is something you can be doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatwoman has finished incapacitating the thugs in the hall. She's now gone to the other areas of the house. You, begin a search on the bodies of the operatives laying on the floor. You're not just good at analyzing situations, you're a master hacker as well. You start probing into any devices the thugs may have had on them, in the hopes of learning who specifically from the Religion may have put out the hit. You're only able to find some very basic information: who they were going after (you and Kate, duh), and where to find you both. You're a little curious about that. That really shouldn't be public information. How had the Religion connected Batwoman and Kate Kane? You may have to probe further when you can come out of your hiding spot and can physically take apart their equipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just then, you hear footsteps just outside the door. They're heavy, but not the heavy, plodding footsteps of your girlfriend. They're one of the operative's, and they're just outside the door! You gasp.</span></div></div>",

And within a few brief moments later, you managed to find the correct camera feed, which showed Batwoman knocking the Religion of Crime thug out cold with ease. Despite her ludicrously larger and bulkier physique, Batwoman was still able to move as swiftly as if she weighed 400 pounds less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name)? You alright in there? The intruders are down.\" Batwoman said, knocking on the door once or twice, letting you know that it was safe to come out. Of course, you soon approached the door and opened it, seeing Batwoman's handiwork upon the Religion of Crime thugs scattered around several rooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, most of them were tied up by Batwoman, as she was in the middle of restraining several more when you exited the bedroom. Kate soon noticed you, as a relieved smile appeared on her chubby face. From there, she stood up to hug you in relief as she asked, \"You're not hurt, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm fine. It's just my nerves, that's all.\" You replied, feeling Kate's loving but pudgy embrace, obviously a little unnerved by such a near-death experience. Then again, this does come with the job of working with a vigilante such as Batwoman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Batwoman refocused on restraining the Religion of Crime thugs before the police arrive to escort these criminals to Blackgate Penitentiary. And within a few minutes later, Batwoman had completed just that, as you managed to take a few of the thugs' cell phones to see if you can gather any additional informnation regarding the Religion of Crime and their recent machinations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>--- 3 Hours Later ---</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after the police were done detaining the restrained Religion of Crime thugs, you soon got to work on investigating how and why the Religion of Crime had put a hit on both you and Kate, deliberately dismantling some of their equipment for further investigation. Of course, whilst you were probing the thugs' equipment and archiving any and all information you could gather, Kate had secretly got out of her Batwoman costume and back into her civilian clothes, where she currently was drinking a chocolate smoothie as a personal reward to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Kate couldn't help herself in watching you work, as she casually waddled her way inside your Computer Room, she witnessed you hard at work, tinkering away at the various devices the Religion of Crime thugs used in their failed assassination attempt on both your lives. Suffice to say, Kate undoubtedly admired your persistence.</span></div></div>",

Maybe it's just the pregnancy making me self-conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nearly spit out the sip you were taking. Did she just say she was pregnant? When did that happen? How did that happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sweetie, did I forget to tell you?\" she asks, completely oblivious. \"I meant to tell you that the doctor from the clinic had called to tell me it looked like the insemination took. We're pregnant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...uh...clinic? Insemination?\" You're still not sure where to begin wrapping your head around this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods. \"Now, don't play dumb with me. I know I'm not that forgetful,\" she chuckles. \"You remember? I used some of the family funds to help support a new fertility clinic in Gotham. I wanted to make sure the LGBT community and struggling couples here in the city had access to such a good facility. That...and you and I really wanted to start a family ourselves. So, the effort was somewhat altruistic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles, stroking her rounded belly, and getting closer to you. \"Aren't you excited?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...it's just that...wow, that's a lot to think about,\" you stutter. This really is a lot to take in. One minute, you're your single self just enjoying life to the fullest. Now, you've woken up, you're dating someone and not just anyone, but Batwoman, and now you're about to start a family. This is all moving so fast for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hugs you. \"Oh, I know, babe, but I think we can handle it. I've already got designers coming in this weekend to start work on the nursery, and I've already signed us up for some birthing classes. We'll be doing everything we can. And, I think you'll make a fine parent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, what about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waves it off. \"The superhero thing? I think we'll be fine. I'm careful. I don't do anything that stupid. And besides, you're always watching my patrols, giving me the best advice for how to stay safe. We've got this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think it over. This certainly is a big risk. Superheroes having kids always throws a special wrench in things. Plus, you don't know the first thing about being a parent. Kate seems confident, but you're not so sure of yourself. You never were good with kids when you tried babysitting as a teen. And, if you're being totally honest with yourself, you're not really sure how well this pregnancy is going to go with Kate at her current size. Didn't you read something about obesity having an effect on that sort of thing? Forget about what kind of strain superheroing will do to her, what about her health now? Still, you fake a smile. Maybe you'll get used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we got this,\" you repeat, hugging her back as your plushy bodies squish against each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe notices this and gives you a gentle prod. \"And it looks like someone's gaining a little sympathy weight with me. I think that's kind of cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush, not sure what to say about that. Truth be told, you're still hoping you'll get an answer as to how Kate went from the trim, lithe Batwoman you know from the comics to this. And twice now, she's made some remark about liking you a little heavier. Is this a thing for her? You're not yet sure how you feel about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh...do we know if we're having a boy or a girl yet?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughs. \"A little too soon for that, but give it a few weeks, and we'll know then. Are you sure you want to know? You didn't want it to be a surprise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know. Maybe. So, wait, how much planning have you already done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too much. I want you to be involved too. But, I'm just getting some essentials out of the way. Trust me, you're the tech savvy one. I'm letting you pick out all the baby monitors and things like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then leans in for a passionate kiss, and you both are swept up in the moment. Your hands take hold of her ample love handles and you start kneading. For a moment, you're pretty sure something's about to happen right here right now. And frankly, you're excited by that. Maybe Kate really has started to grow on you in the first few hours you've known her. Maybe it's your new self's memories that are kicking in, and you're really starting to feel something for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leans over and you're pressed gently against the table. You're ready to just enjoy the moment, but a loud beeping brings you both back to reality. You turn around to the devices you had been hacking for information. It looks like you got a hit on something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Kate asks.</span></div></div>",

Your eyes swiftly scanned through the available information on-hand, as a smug smirk formed upon your mildly plump feminine face as you answered, \"...Well, it looks like I hacked through the encryptions those bastards were using. Hmph, very sloppy. They don't even have backup firewalls to protect their accounts from my malware algorithms.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*chuckle* That's my girl!\" Kate retorted, lightly patting you on the shoulders for a job well done, impressed by your handiwork. Then again, this was most likely something from this reality that you've learned, so it came as probably no surprise to you as to how much of a cakewalk this whole hacking thing came to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after five long minutes have passed, you found something in the acquired information that stuck out like a sore thumb, which came in the form of the Religion of Crime insignia, which had an encoded message on it that read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Sinclair,<br>\r\nIt appears that your congregation has a Bat infestation. You are fully responsible for the well-being of your flock. Rid of this Bat infestation, and tear off it's wings. Should you fail to exterminate such a nuisance, we will be foirced to take extreme measures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe are always watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSincerely, Mother Superior\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, that doesn't sound good.\" You bluntly said, obviously aware of what this \"Mother Superior\" meant by Bat infestation: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatwoman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say. Then again, we shouldn't have not expected them to retaliate in some form.\" Kate retorted, knowing that the Religion of Crime wasn't going to take such actions against them lying down whatsoever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*sigh* But still, at least we're doing a damn good job on hitting their operations hard enough for them to fight back.\" Kate retorted once more, as she wrapped her plump arms around your neck and collarbone area in a tender embrace. Either way, both you and Kate knew that after such an attack, it would be best to retaliate in earnest as well, just as the rotund Kate then asked, \"Did you find anything else, sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, yes and no, Kate. The good news is that I was able to retrace the stream of messages back to this \"Sinclair\" person. He leases a shady nightclub in the Otisburg District called \"Knocking on Hell's Door\".\" You explained, using the tablet to upload a map layout of Gotham City, zooming in on the Otisburg District, pinpointing where the nightclub's location was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. So... What's the bad news, then?\" Kate queried, feeling like she wasn't exactly going to like the aforementioned bad news, as you exhaled a deep breath, then calmly spoke toward the corpulent red-haired woman and answered, \"...Though, as for the bad news, Kate... Well, I'm not going to sugarcoat it, but...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Can you figure out who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fingers clack at the keyboard for several minutes. \"It's hard to say. I'm having trouble identifying anyone exactly since they're using secret names in their communications, but all of their correspondence is in Russian.\" That isn't a good sign in your book. \"I can try and follow where these bank accounts lead, but I doubt this guy is stupid enough to create an account in his own name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's already waddling off towards her closet. Despite the situation, she seems perfectly calm. \"I think you're right that that wouldn't be a good use of your time. Pull up the camera feeds around the house. I don't want this one taking us by surprise this time. Ugh, I'm really going to have to let this suit out a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear her slipping into the now skin-tight Batwoman suit. You're inclined to agree. If she's pregnant and continues to grow at this rate, she's going to need a lot more room. In the meantime, you're keeping your eyes on the outside of the house, trying to conceal your own fear. Two attacks in one day are two too many for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate returns, now fully donned in her ensemble. She kisses you on the cheek. \"Okay, well, I'm off,\" she says matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what? What about the assassin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughs a little. \"I think he's a little smarter than that. The first attack came to me, and it failed miserably. If anything, he's going to lure me out in three...two...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both hear the cackling of the police-frequency radio on your desk. \"Reported robbery on Second and Jackson. Suspect is armed and has hostages. Requesting backup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be my cue,\" she says. \"I have a feeling he's waiting for me there. I won't be long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaves, despite your attempts to protest. She knows you like to be concerned for her. Before long, you go back to your usual duties with her, making sure you're fully connected to watch and listen to everything that's going on. Something still doesn't feel right to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Batwoman bursts into the business being robbed, you see a formidable-looking figure standing at the head of a group of cowering civilians. He's wearing dark clothes, and his face is covered by a black and red mask. Still, you can see the cybernetic eye, scanning Batwoman. You're more worried about the large, metal appendage strapped to his arm. It looks like some kind of super weapon. The man laughs as she approaches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Batwoman, as I live and breath,\" he said in a thick Russian accent. \"Honestly, I'm a little surprised. The way the Gotham Bat spoke of you, I was picturing something more athletic. I almost feel bad that this isn't a fair fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked. \"You haven't seen me in action, KGBeast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're startled since you hadn't expected this to be the professional assassin. KGBeast was a well-known killer who had some of the best skills and military training the Soviet KGB had to offer. Not to mention, a lot of his skills had been enhanced thanks to cybernetic technology. You really hope Kate knows what she's doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks like he's limbering up. \"Very well, then. Come quietly, and the civilians will live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe launches a small grappling hook, which winds around his feet. With a quick tug, she yanks him over towards her. The civilians scatter to the nearest exit without him in their way. \"I like these things to be a little more intimate,\" she says. \"Now, it's just you and me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brow furrows behind the mask, and he pulls up his weapon arm. Batwoman side steps just as the first bullets are fired. This gives him the opportunity to get back to his feet. The mechanism switches into a machine-gun. He begins firing a spray of bullets in her direction. Despite being a bigger target, she's quick enough to duck away and get behind a counter for cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't hide forever,\" he said, his weapon arm switching into a new mechanism. \"Come out and face me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to put your own fear aside, you try looking for a weak spot. But, Batwoman seems to have already come up with her own plan. Just as KGBeast fired a series of micro-rockets at the counter, Batwoman rolled out from behind and shot a few rubber bullets of her own. They pelted the assassin, and certainly took him by surprise, but they hadn't stopped him in the least. He rushed at her, launching another round of rockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle goes on and on like this, the two exchanging blows back and forth. You try to get a lock on KGBeast, to see if you can analyze how many bullets he has left. But, Batwoman keeps giving him the slip or throwing a few surprises of her own at him. At long last, she spots her opportunity. She throttles him from behind, her enormous weight throwing him off balance and tumbling to the ground. He lays there, being crushed under her immensity. He gags and coughs, trying to get enough air in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatwoman smirks. \"I think we've finally reached an impass. You're going to tell me some very important information.\"</span></div></div>",

It felt like you had just gotten to sleep a few minutes ago, but the clock showed that five hours had passed since you collapsed into bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere it was again: that soft noise that had somehow pierced the veil around your head and dragged you back to consciousness. It wasn\u2019t a knock at the door, it sounded like it was coming from within your home instead. It was probably your refrigerator going out. That old jalopy had been on its last legs when you got it, but it was the best you could do at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a groan, you threw the covers back and forced yourself up. Grinding your hands against your eyes, you tried to focus and adjust to the near absolute darkness.  Within a few steps though you had already rammed your shin into something, cursing under your breath, and trying to figure out what you had hit. Feeling around, you couldn\u2019t tell what it was. Whatever the shin breaker was, you didn\u2019t remember it being there when you had come in last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ended up running into several more things in the darkness along the way. You were getting more and more confused; it felt like the whole room had been rearranged while you slept. A thought wormed into your head, maybe it wasn\u2019t the fridge breaking down, maybe one or more of your friends had decided to play a prank on you and were still working on even more. That seemed more likely when you heard a clatter coming from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfident in what was going on, you grasped around for the door handle and pulled it open. The hallway wasn\u2019t as dark as your bedroom had been, so you ended up as blind as you had been in the dark. Grumbling, you forced your way on, half feeling your way along the wall. With your eyes screwed shut, you missed the photos along the wall, photos that hadn\u2019t been there before, photos that showed\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You staggered down the last little bit till you came to the main part of your apartment. Cracking your eyes the barest amount you could, you couldn\u2019t comprehend why the place looked so different. It wasn\u2019t just rearranged as you had thought before; every last thing within the room was completely changed. Most of the furniture looked lower and sturdier than it had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thud came from the side and you turned towards the little kitchenette area. Again, it looked quite a bit different than it had when you went to sleep. Everything looked much newer and better able to handle larger amounts of food at the same time. There was also the matter of the large pale rump sticking out of the currently open refrigerator.  It was quite honestly the largest ass you had ever seen, and it was right there in front of you, wiggling back and forth in a tiny pair of hot pants as the owner dug around in the depths of the ice chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could do anything except have your jaw drop to your chest, a hand reached around the open door and pulled it shut. Now you could see the owner, and that butt certainly fit with how large the rest of the woman was. Enormous breasts stretched her t-shirt to its limits, while the size of her stomach meant that a wide swath was still exposed under the lower hem. In truth, she was the furthest from what you would think of as someone breaking and entering could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up you from the triple layer chocolate cake in her hands with a smile on her cherubic face, but not even a hint of any surprise. \u201cHello, beautiful. Sorry about waking you, but you know how hungry I can get after a long night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for a response, she turned around and set the cake down on the island behind her. This left her prodigious backside completely exposed to you as if she didn\u2019t have a care in the world. Only now did you realize that there was something very familiar about the young woman\u2019s face, but you couldn\u2019t be quite sure where. You were sure that you had never met a woman with such an incredible girth though. The way she talked to you seemed like she knew you, but you didn\u2019t know her except for a vague sense of familiarity. What in the world was going on here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a blur, you turned and ran back to the bathroom, shutting the door behind you. All thoughts of sleep were banished from your mind as you flicked the light on and dashed for the sink. Splashing some cold water in your face and then slapping yourself did nothing to dispel whatever was going on. You could still hear her in the kitchen just beyond the wall, and you could see obvious signs of two women living here even here in the bathroom, let alone everywhere else. Feeling on the verge of hyperventilating, you looked up at the mirror, hoping that you weren\u2019t going crazy. At least not everything had changed; your reflection showed that you were still the same\u2026</span></div></div>",

Your reflection still showed exactly the same buxom image that you saw every time you looked in the mirror. The same raven locks framed your face, and the same olive hued skin peeked out from under your nightclothes. After seeing the other young woman though, you now seemed downright skinny in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou alright in there?\u201d the other woman called out, breaking you out of your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d you responded instinctively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe muttered something else, but you couldn\u2019t make it out. You tried to piece together what happened, but couldn\u2019t figure it out. It had been a pretty normal night: working late and having to run all over to get everything else done afterwards. Then you crashed out on your bed with barely a thought. There wasn\u2019t any time for something like this to happen, certainly not having another woman living and being quite familiar with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t going to figure much out standing around here though, so you straightened your hair as best you could before shutting off the light and slipping back out the door. The fleshy woman had spent much of the time you were away working on the cake. Already half of the dessert was gone leaving only crumbs behind. She showed no sign of restraint either, slicing off another chunk and devouring it in short order. She chased the latest piece with several chugs of milk before starting with the cake again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite yourself, you found \u201cDo you think you should be eating all that?\u201d spilling from your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips pulled into a tight smile as she said, \u201cProbably not, but you know how my sweet tooth can get. Plus, I needed a little something tasty after having those ration bars you keep giving me. You really can\u2019t get something else with a flavor that isn\u2019t quite so much like cardboard?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMentally scrambling, you mumbled and shrugged. She seemed to be satisfied by your non-answer though. She flicked a loose lock of her fiery hair over her round shoulder before turning her attention back to the cake<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWandering away from her, you decided to check out the rest of the darkened apartment. Even with a bit more light than had been in the bedroom, you ended up running into plenty of furniture because of the differences between how it was and now. Your eyebrow arched as you felt yourself get drawn to a bookcase that hadn\u2019t been there before. Looking it over, you recognized a few of the items there: some of the books you had owned before, a sculpture you had picked up at independent art show a couple of years back, and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze kept returning to one of the many items you didn\u2019t recognize. It was a lump of pale crystal shaped into a rough sphere. You didn\u2019t know why, but you raised your arm and cupped your hand around the top of it. Nothing happened, but then you felt an odd twinge within your mind and you shifted your fingers into a much more awkward grip. That triggered something, because the crystal grew warm in your grasp and there was a muted clank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could react, the bookcase slid sideways across the floor. Within a few moments, a hidden doorway was revealed. Complete darkness lay beyond, but your feet carried you forwards nevertheless.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soft lighting flicked on as soon as you crossed the threshold, and the quiet hum of computers filled the air. A bank of monitors lining one wall all lit up, displaying news feeds, social media sites, and more. A few tables stretched through the middle of the room, their surfaces covered with a wide array of tools and gadgets. The one thing that drew your attention the most though was a floor to ceiling Plexiglas tube. It was obviously made to protect the suit that draped across the form within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jaw dropped again as you came closer to the tube and tried to make sense of what you were seeing. There was no denying it though; the suit within was certainly the costume belonging to Batgirl. Or at least a version of the outfit made for a Batgirl much, much fatter than she had usually shown as. Your surprise only deepened as you realized the woman that was just outside could only be Barbara Gordon, the Batgirl, made flesh, quite a lot of flesh too. That was why her face had seemed so familiar to you despite never meeting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumbled back from the case, backing into one of the tables and catching your hand on one of the batarangs that lay there. You gaped at the little chunk of metal in your grasp before dropping it back where it came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind whirled with the thoughts about what was going on. Somehow, you had been brought into another world or Barbara had been brought into yours. In any case, the much fleshier young woman was living with you. Judging from the little bit she said to you as well as how she looked at you, it even seemed that the two of you were a couple in whatever world this was. The more you thought about it, the less this seemed to be a problem. It was weird beyond belief, but maybe you could get used to being in a relationship with such a beautifully bloated version of the brainy redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking your eyes, you realized that you had been staring at a set of screens without taking them in. Now you saw that they displayed a collection of numbers, lines, and graphs. You couldn\u2019t make much sense of it, but from what little you did understand, you got the sense that you were looking at medical data. One pair of numbers stood out though, the first showed 525 next to the words \u201cCurrent Load\u201d. While the other showed 700 next to \u201cMaximum Safe Load\u201d. You frowned as you tried to figure out what this had to do with what appeared to be medical data filling the rest of this set of screens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait\u2026could it be\u2026?</i> you mused as you believed you figured it out. <i>Is this really Barbara\u2019s current weight? And this bit</i> turning your gaze to the larger number <i>Can she really end up carrying this much?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterrupting your whirling thoughts was a soft weight pressed against your back, while a pair of wide arms encircled you. You hadn\u2019t even heard her coming into the room, let alone get right behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw\u2026you just had to come in and check up on me? That\u2019s so sweet,\u201d she purred against your neck, her breath warm and tickling against your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivered in delight as the warmth from her flesh flowed into yours. Meanwhile your nose filled with a subtle floral scent mingling with a hint of chocolate. Squirming around, you came face to face with her. A wide beaming smile dimpled her rounded cheeks. Squeezing you tighter to get you close enough, she gave you a long lingering kiss that took your breath away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to tell you, you did wonderful, darling. That upgrade you did to my chip worked like a charm. I\u2019m positive that I was moving even better tonight than I did back before all this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was my pleasure,\u201d was the first thing that came to your tongue even though you had no idea what she was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026well, when you\u2019re finished here, maybe we\u2019ll share a bit of that pleasure?\u201d she said with a sultry tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then let you go and swept from the room, her rump swaying back and forth, up and down. You couldn\u2019t tear your eyes away from it till she was out of sight. Despite her size, she walked with a casual grace and ease that you weren\u2019t sure could be matched in a woman a fraction her weight. A quick shake of your head, and you realized what she had hinted at. Licking your lips and getting the taste of the cake mixed with her flavor, you spared one last glance at the screens before heading for the door.</span></div></div>",

Out of the corner of your eye, you noticed the pictures you missed before, but paid little heed to them. Instead, you kept your focus on the bedroom door and the darkness beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping through the door, you frowned upon seeing no sign of Barbara. Before you could move any further, the door swung shut behind you and you were again all but smothered by the bulging blubber. A slight chuckle reached your ears as her breath teased the back of your neck. Her hands roamed down across your body, one stopping to caress one of your breasts while the other continued a bit further to dig into your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching back, you managed to dig your own fingers into the vast expanse of her stomach. The soft flesh oozed through your fingers, letting your hands sink deep. A quiet gasp broke from Barbara\u2019s mouth before she started to nibble on your earlobe, rolling the little bud between her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, you found yourself turned around facing Barbara again. Before you could react, your shirt was discarded. You could barely see it, but you heard enough that you were sure that the redhead had removed her shirt as well. Sure enough, your blind groping revealed that every square foot of her titanic torso was laid bare. She giggled as your hand glided across her body. As you had been expecting, you soon felt her reaching for and removing your shorts before hers dropped to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn\u2019t been expecting to suddenly find yourself pinned under the hundreds of pounds of blubber, but that\u2019s exactly what happened. She nuzzled and kissed your neck, while you panted and gasped for breath. The crushing weight was painful, but also pleasurable and stimulating. On the edge of passing out, she gripped you and flipped over so that you were now riding atop the swell of her body. You could feel how her chest heaved with her breath, eager for whatever you might do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed boggled your mind. It felt like you were operating more on instinct than conscious thought. You immersed yourself in bringing the obese redhead to ever higher plateaus of pleasure. She repaid you in kind, just as earnest as you were. Soon the two of you were slick with sweat and the bedding was everywhere except on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end, Barbara gave you one last loving kiss before she slipped into a much deserved sleep, a light snore slipping forth as she slept. You remained cuddled against her bulk, running your hand across her stomach, feeling how it enveloped your fingers, all but begging to be touched. Despite being completely worn out again, you felt around and tried to cover the two of you the best you could. It wasn\u2019t a perfect job, but it would have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up the next morning, you had a fleeting memory of some strange dreams. There seemed to be some green-cloaked figure in every last one, always in the distance watching, and hard to focus on and remember anything beyond the barest specifics. Shaking it off, you gave Barbara a quick peck on the cheek. She mumbled something in her sleep; you thought it might have included something about cheese. Slipping out of trashed bed, you couldn\u2019t help by run your fingers across the expanse of her bulging stomach again. You could already feel a bit of heat spreading up your neck as you shuffled along and headed for the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick shower, your feet soon carried you to the kitchen. You were feeling a bit puckish, and now that you thought of it, Barbara would likely end up with quite a bit of hunger as well. Again, your body seemed to act more of its own accord and soon you were preparing a veritable feast. You almost jumped out of your skin when Barbara snuck up on you yet again, hugging you tight and resting her flabby chin on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026smells wonderful,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleasing you, she snagged one of the slices of toast you had prepared. She bit into it, the melted butter starting to leak down her chin, as she took a seat at the kitchen\u2019s island. Turning your attention back to the food, you could feel her eyes boring holes in your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs\u2026everything alright?\u201d she asked hesitantly. \u201cYou\u2026haven\u2019t seemed\u2026like yourself\u2026since last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, no, I\u2019m fine, just fine,\u201d you said, trying to keep your voice from betraying you, though you were only somewhat successful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to cover this up by hurrying to serve up the many breakfast items you had thrown together into a fantastic spread. Anytime you looked at the redhead, it was obvious that she wasn\u2019t quite believing you, but wasn\u2019t willing to push the issue yet either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral bites in, and you were impressed with how good everything tasted. You hadn\u2019t quite been able to make much of anything in your old place, between not having the time or the will. Whatever was going on now though seemed to have given you quite a boost in your culinary skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo when do you want to go?\u201d Barbara asked after washing down some of her omelet with a gulp of milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo?\u201d you asked, furrowing your brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, go, don\u2019t you remember?\u201d her expression turning more towards worry now.</span></div></div>",

But then again, her father was and still is the Police Commissioner of the GCPD, not to mention being trained by the Dark Knight of all people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInevitably, in response, you exhaled a sigh and unconsciously replied, \"I'm sorry, Babs. It's just that...I-I am worried that one of us might get caught by whoever kidnapped those girls. I know we have a responsibility to protecting everyone in Burnside, but...*sigh*...It's just that I don't want to see you get hurt again like what Joker did to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, sweetie.\" Barbara answered, planting a longing kiss upon your lips for a minute or two, then severed the kiss and calmly reassured, \"...But I am more worried about you than my own well-being. I mean, as much as I prefer you behind the monitors, I'm afraid we have no choice in the matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how about this, then? After we do a little bit of field recon, why don't we go out on an afternoon date at that Ice Cream parlor you love so much? We could get some of that Couple's Double Strawberry and Chocolate Smoothie~\" Barbara quipped, ending that last sentence in a charmingly tempting sing-song tone, which seemed to be quite effective in making you decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* Alright, alright! You win, Babs. You sure like to temoot my sweet tooth, don't you?\" You confessed, where Barbara then giggled a little, then gave you a quick peck on the cheek and retorted, \"*giggle* What can I say? I tease because I love, (Name). Now come on, let's get ourselves dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-- 30 Minutes Later... --</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting yourselves dressed, you and Barbara were currently taking a leisurely stroll along the streets of Burnside. It was official: Somehow, you must've been transported into the DC Universe, because you could easily see Wayne Tower off in the distance, which stood tall amongst Gotham City's skyline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, you were wearing a pair of skinny jeans that did little to conceal your chubby lower half, as well as a pair of beige flat sneakers, complete with a magenta T-shirt that did little to conceal your cute bump of a chubby belly, along with a leather purse holstered around your right shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Barbara on the other hand, her choice of attire did little to disguise her enormity. In appearance, she wore a pair of blue sweatpants, which stretched over her rotund physique, along with bolstering her apron belly underneath it's polyester fabric. On her feet, she wore a pair of well-fitting leisure sneakers over a pair of yellow cotton socks with the Batman symbol sewed onto them. Meanwhile, up on her torso, she wore a purple t-shirt with the words \"I'm Large &amp; In Charge! Got A Problem With That?\" emblazoned on the front in big bloated letters, which she wore underneath a jacket that was secretly a reverse jacket for her Batgirl costume, just in case for a quick emergency that requires Batgirl. She also carried a decently large but baggy purse with her, which secretly held her Batgirl cowl inside a concealed compartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, the two of you certainly looked fabulous together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after 15 Minutes of walking and one or two brief stops at some local food vendors, you and Barbara had reached...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You felt a shiver pass down your spine as you tried in vain to tear your eyes away from the pinwheel mints that formed the elf\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara\u2019s voice tore through whatever was enveloping your mind. \u201cYes, I\u2019m sure. Look, you can even see the open hours from here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her pointing finger, you saw that the store was indeed supposed to be open right now. According to the black and white numbers, they should have been opened about three hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, they\u2019re obviously not open right now, so what do you want to do?\u201d turning back to Barbara, being careful to not look at the elf statue again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rotund redhead nibbled on her lip, her head tilting back and forth. As you waited, you had the oddest sensation as if you were being watched, the hairs on the back of your neck rising. A quick glance around showed no sign of anyone paying any particular attention to you. The few people out and about on this street were more focused on Barbara, but it seemed to be more curiosity about her exceptional girth than anything ill willed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, we\u2019ll make a quick stop at this place and just keep an eye out for right now,\u201d she said after a few more moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the words left her mouth, she grabbed your arm and all but dragged you along. You stumbled but managed to get your feet back under you before you fell flat on your face. Her target turned out to be a little street side caf\u00e9, one with an open air seating area outside the door. It was a perfect place to wait and watch, at least in your opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, you sat down at a table that provided you a good view of the store. You had to make two extra trips to get your own order of a coffee and donut, as well as helping Barbara with hers. Despite the large breakfast earlier and the snacks along the way, the blubbery Batgirl ordered three donuts, two sandwiches, a croissant, and an extra large latte. She dug in with gusto while you picked at your snack and kept an eye on the storefront.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes passed, and then twenty without any sign of anything happening at the store. Barbara had long finished off her food and was making good headway on her drink. Even with your lethargic pace, you had also finished off your snack. You were about to ask if she wanted to do something a bit more proactive when someone caught your eye. Your mouth dropped open in surprise. The brunette waddling down the sidewalk put even Barbara to shame with her bulk. She had to be in the neighborhood of seven to eight hundred pounds, yet she could still walk. It was an obvious strain though, her tanned skin was shiny with sweat and her breathing was a constant panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god\u2026\u201d Barbara muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, how in the world is she still moving around?\u201d you responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not that, well yes, there is that\u2026But the main thing I mean is that I\u2019ve seen her before. It was just a couple days ago. She was pudgy yes, but she wasn\u2019t nearly that massive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scoffed, \u201cWhat, you mean that she ballooned that far within a matter of days?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to face Barbara, you saw that she wasn\u2019t joking around, she really meant it. An icy fist gripped your stomach. Turning back to the immense woman, you saw that she had stopped at the candy shop and was trying in vain to get through the locked door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then heard the woman shout, \u201cNo, no, you can\u2019t be closed! You can\u2019t!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hit the unyielding door with a meaty fist one last time before turning around. She looked around in a wide eyed panic for a second before adjusting the hot pink jogging suit that did little cover up her vastness. She then waddled off again, heading back the way she came with a bit more downcast expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that was strange,\u201d you muttered while stroking your chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to ask Barbara what she wanted to do when you felt her grab your arm yet again and drag you along just as before.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From there, you and Barbara cautiously followed the elephantine brunette, who waddled at a distressed pace, despite her sheer enormity. Fortunately for the two of you, you and Barbara easily kept pace with the large individual, especially since both you and Barbara were noticeably lighter than the exasperated blob of a girl, whilst keeping a good enough distance as to avoid arousing the woman's suspicions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter following the large girthy brunette for a good thirty minutes, she clumsily waddled into a nearby alleyway, where Barbara soon tugged you along with her into the alleyway. But then, out of surprise, Barbara soon playfully tackled the larger woman against a limestone wall, as if greeting an old friend, where the rotund redhead then said, \"Hey there, Denise!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, the 700 to 800 pound brunette clumsily stood back up, turned around upon recognizing Barbara's voice and meekly retorted, \"Oh! Um... H-Hi there, Babs. I...I-I didn't expect to bump into y-you out here.\" \"Oh come now, Denise! We attend some of the same classes together at the University.\" Barbara chuckled, putting on a rather friendly and jovial demeanor, despite her internal feelings of concern for her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you remember my girlfriend, (Name), don't you Denise?\" Barbara quipped, gesturing Denise over to you, where she timidly waved at you as if she was experiencing some sort of withdrawal. From there, the rotund redhead soon spoke back toward you in a jovial manner and said, \"Sweetie, I'm sure you remember my fellow I.T classmate, Denise Chavez?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as Barbara said her words, your mind somehow caught you up to speed with who Denise was and how she knew Barbara Gordon, as if you were a part of this world for quite some time. \"Yeah, nice to see you again, Denise.\" You stated, trying not to sound suspicious in any possible way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's nice seeing you two, b-b-but I really need to head somewhere--\" Denise hesitantly retorted, behaving as if she was in desperate need of something. But fortunately, Babs had a good grip on her, thus preventing the larger woman from waddling off, as the redhead then replied, \"Come on now, Denise! We're all friends here. Well, technically me and (Name) here ate girlfriend and girlfriend, but that's not the point. We haven't seen you for a little while now. I mean, Esme, Frankie, Alysia, and the others haven't seen you for some time now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course, you and Babs could see that twinge of guilt upon Denise's rounded face, as Barbara laid a semi-plump hand upon the heavier brunette's plump shoulder and asked, \"...Can you at least tell us what you've been doing all this time?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment or two, Denise didn't speak a word. But then, out of nervous impulse, she blatantly blared, \"Okay, Okay, I give up!! I...I-I've been cheating on my diet, Babs.\" In response, Barbara appeared to have a mildly surprised expression on her chubby face, as she soon regained her cheery composure, which was now mixed in with a twinge of concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But why, Denise? What made you want to cheat on your diet? I thought you and Richard were an item.\" Barbara asked, placing her semi-plump hands upon her wide burgeoning hips and waistline. From there, Denise began to instinctively fidget with her chubby fingers, which was troublesome due to her now elephantine proportions, as the bulky brunette then answered, \"W-We st-still are, Red. ...Or at least, I-I still hope we are after my compulsive binging.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can see that, Denise. I mean, you look like you're a little over a hundred pounds heavier than me. What's your secret?\" Babs chortled, trying to sweet talk with the obviously stressed brunette in order to hopefully get some answers. Luckily, it seemed to do the trick, as Denise's demeanor seemed to have almost instantaneously switched from meek and timid to exonerated and jovial, as Denise then joyfully rambled, \"Oh, it's because of that new candy shop, Ms. Rosenthal's Whacky Candy Boutique! Have you heard of it? Their candy is absolutely delicious! It's like tasting a slice of Heaven!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* Yeah, I just heard about that shop for a little while now, Denise. Though if you ask me, I prefer eating loads of calories to keep this hot bod of mine up to par.\" Barbara retorted, lightly patting the furthest curve of her apron belly to emphasize her point, which caused it to mildly ripple like a waterbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before the conversation could continue further, Denise's smartphone began to ring sporadically, with the Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid theme as the ringtone. Quickly as her body would allow her, Denise soon answered the phone, which revealed a notification on her cellular device. Her face soon displaying a gleefully excited dimpled grin upon her round face upon seeing what she received.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH EM GEE!!! Yes! Yes! YES!! The store's finally open!!\" Denise shouted in glee, jumping about like a little girl, which caused every part of her corpulent body to ripple and jiggle wildly, almost threatening to unfurl her belly from the confines of her stretched out sweatpants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're certainly in a much better mood.\" You quipped, in which Denise soon stated, \" Of course I am! Ms. Rosenthal's Whacky Candy Boutique is finally open! I downloaded their SWEET.TOOTH App from the store's website to get the latest news on what they have in stock. I'm sorry, but I really need to go! Talk to you all later!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Denise began to hurriedly waddle off back towards the Ms. Rosenthal's Whacky Candy Boutique from earlier. Or at least, as much as the brunette could handle with so much bulk and girth. Left behind at the alleyway, you and Barbara looked at one another, easily noticing the suspicious coincidence that occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, that was certainly...suspicious.\" Barbara calmly stated, as you crossed your arms underneath your breasts, nodding in agreement and unconsciously retorted, \"No kidding, Babs. I noticed that look in her eyes just before she, um \"waddled\" off. She had the dilated eyes of someone addicted to drugs, Barb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed too, (Name). She looked as if she was experiencing some sort of withdrawal before she got that notification. I got a hunch that that so-called \"Candy Boutique\" might be hiding some sinister skeletons in their storage rooms.\" Barbara replied, using air quotations on the word \"Candy Boutique\", as if something suspicious was clearly going on with that candy shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Barbara soon spoke up toward you and stated, \"We better meet up with Frankie and tell her what's going on.\" \"Agreed.\" You unconsciously confirmed, as if you weren't in control of yourself for a few brief moments. However, you knew there was no backing out of this now.</span></div></div>",

Then turning to you, \u201cCome on, tell her you saw it too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s true; it really looked like she was going through withdrawal. She was fidgety, her eyes were dilated, the whole nine yards.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark haired woman across the table rolled her head back and forth. \u201cLittle Denise definitely wasn\u2019t one to do drugs or anything like that on her own\u2026and Richard wouldn\u2019t have gotten her started on anything like that either, so there\u2019s definitely something up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed how Barbara had skipped over the part where in addition to the suspected drugs, the other young woman had also ballooned hundreds of pounds in a matter of days. Not surprising though considering how unbelievable it sounded. You could only just keep a grimace from crossing your face as you also thought <i>Almost as unbelievable as a person waking up in a comic book made real with the main character bloated up hundreds of pounds as well.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlus there is the disappearances going on, and it all has something to do with that shop,\u201d Barbara said, stabbing the table with a sausage-like finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, alright, you convinced me,\u201d Frankie said, all the while making a calming motion with her hands. \u201cSo what are the two of you going to do about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than answer, Barbara held up a subtle warning finger. Neither you nor Frankie had noticed, but your orders were soon dropped off. Your eyes almost fell out of your head at seeing the ice cream treat dropped before you and Barbara. Despite being glass, what the smoothie came in was something you would consider more akin to a bucket in size. Swirls of red and brown were half hidden beneath a copious amount of whipped cream. Twin straws were punched into the icy mass, each bent to allow easy drinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could overcome your shock, Barbara bent forward \u2013 her flesh oozing around the table as she did so \u2013 and locked her lips around the straw closest to her. She took more than a few gulps, and you could even see the level of the smoothie drop bit by bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting back with a sigh, she smacked her lips a few times before saying, \u201cHmm, I think it\u2019s even better than it was before. Are you going to have any?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a start, you realized that she was asking that of you, \u201cOh, yeah\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing your own straw, you gave a tentative suck. The taste was better than you had been expecting, so much so that you drank a number of mouthfuls before you sat back again. Looking up, you saw that Frankie seemed a bit frazzled at seeing the two of you having so much of a sweet treat, especially with Barbara\u2019s rather noticeable size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression smoothed as quick as it had appeared, and she again asked, this time in a quieter voice, \u201cSo what are the two of you going to do about all this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara sucked down more of the smoothie before answering.</span></div></div>",

I say we head to Denise's place to see if we can find any clues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan to me.\" Frankie quietly retorted, as the waiter had approached where you, Frankie, and Barbara sat at, giving the three of you the receipt for the meal, which was soon paid in full by the dark-haired African American woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, once the receipt was plaid, the three of you proceeded out of the ice cream parlour, heading back to the apartment, as Frankie subtly questioned, \"...So, will you be sleuthing as Barbara Gordon, or will you be putting on the cape and cowl this time, Babs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Barbara winked back at Frankie and eagerly quipped, \"Damn straight, Frankie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-- 5:30 PM --<br>\r\n-- 4 &amp; A Half Hours Later --<br>\r\n-- Burnside District, Gotham City --</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was already setting upon the bustling borough of Burnside. But as the district's economy switched to the risque nightlife, a certain rotund Caped crime fighter swiftly jumped from rooftop to rooftop with mostly relative ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite now weighing a bit over a quarter ton, Batgirl sprinted her way across the numerous Burnside rooftops, with her contemporary costume keeping her girth well contained, even though it violently rippled and jiggled like an ocean in a storm whilst she sprinted and parkoured her way amongst the concrete and neon jungle that was Burnside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://goo.gl/images/799xxy\" target=\"_blank\">https://goo.gl/images/799xxy</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for the rotund redhead, she had undergone extensive training outside of Gotham, and this resulted in her having an incredible amount of endurance, which certainly helped in maintaining her crime fighting career, even if she now weighed 500 to 600 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter traversing across what could only be 7 blocks from her apartment building, Batgirl used a newly improved and somewhat stronger version of her Grapnel Gun to launch herself up to a nearby rooftop, landing on said rooftop with little difficulty, even with her excess bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she perched herself upon the ledge of the building rooftop overlooking Denise's apartment building, Batgirl then pulled out the touch phone Qadir had given her during one of her earliest cases in Burnside, where she dial to an encrypted contact, put the phone before her and said, \"Alright, guys. I'm currently overlooking Denise's apartment building.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Read ya loud and clear, Bats. Let's hope we can find something in Denise's place.\" Frankie replied, communicating with the rotund Batgirl via Bluetooth earpiece laced with heavy security encryptions. While Barbara was out there as Batgirl, you and Frankie were currently back at the apartment, residing within the secret room, where Frankie was sitting at the Main Monitor, keeping tabs on Barb's current whereabouts, while you kept your eyes on the computer screens that monitored Batgirls vitals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, the three of you were a surprisingly well-oiled machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Batgirl fired her Grapnel Gun at the apartment building, zipping her way onto the fire escape. Fortunately, it had a maximum weight capacity of 1,200 pounds due to it's sturdy construction. From there, the obese Batgirl soon made her way inside Denise's apartment, which was on the third floor. Though luckily for the female crime fighter, despite her rotund girthy frame, she was able to squeeze through the large window to the woman's dwellings with little difficulty, as she quietly stepped onto the hardwood flooring to avoid arousing suspicion from the other tenants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as if it was expected by this point Denise's apartment was blackened by lack of occupancy. In response to such stygian environs, Batgirl reached for her utility belt and pulled out a small but powerful flashlight, and cautiously aimed in almost every nook and cranny before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill in contact with you and Frankie, Batgirl then contacted the two of you and hushly answered, \"Frankie, (Name), I'm already inside Denise's place.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? See anything that could help us figure out what's gotten into her?\" Frankie queried, as Batgirl calmly yet cautiously made her way around the Hispanic brunette's dwellings, leaving no stone unturned in the process, despite the darkened facade of an apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, after only a few measly minutes of investigating, Batgirl soon came across a noticeable sight...</span></div></div>",

You could hear the shock and awe in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several moments passed and no explanation came, Frankie asked, \u201cWhat is it, did you find something?\u201d with an obvious impatient tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Well\u2026you could say that,</i>\u201d she responded a bit hesitantly. \u201c<i>It\u2019s probably best if you just see it yourself though.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Frankie looked at each other with a quizzical slant to your eyebrows. Then you turned your attentions back to the screens as an image came through. It took several seconds for you to make sense of what you were seeing, but once you did, your jaw dropped to your chin. You thought Denise had been big before, but the image showed that she was even more immense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought you could make out the couch she seemed to be resting on, but her hips flowed so far in either direction, it was hard to be sure. Her stomach drooped down in several massive rolls to brush the floor in front of her despite oozing out and over her legs. Her breasts had flattened under their own weight and oozed so far down the uppermost curve of her stomach that the nipples were almost certain to be beyond her reach. Speaking of, her nipples \u2013 as well what seemed like acres of flesh \u2013 were on full display. You managed to make out the tattered remains of the outfit from earlier on the ground around her and tucked into some of her numerous folds and rolls. It looked like she had exploded out of it as she inexplicably grew even fatter within the span of a matter of hours. Signs of what had apparently caused her stupendous growth lay all around her: piles upon piles of candy wrappers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think\u2026the two of you\u2026may have left out\u2026some things,\u201d Frankie mumbled, giving you a fright. You had almost forgotten she was there beside you, so stunned at seeing what had happened to Denise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to sputter a response but Barbara cut you off by snapping, \u201c<i>Save it! I just saw something outside the window; it was clinging to the wall. It jumped off and took off heading north once it saw me looking at it. Try to get eyes on it.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah, I can do that. We\u2019re going to circle back to Denise after this though,\u201d turning an accusatory glance at you. Frankie then pulled out a keyboard and went to work, her fingers flying across the keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched in awe as lines of code went flying past on the screen. In a flash, several of the monitors swapped their normal feeds to show grainy and dark videos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to open your mouth but Frankie answered you unspoken question, \u201cManaged to use a backdoor we left in the traffic camera system. If whoever or whatever kept heading the same way, we should\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere!\u201d you said, jabbing your finger at one of the images. It was brief, but you saw something jumping across the street at the top of the camera\u2019s view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see it, I see it,\u201d Frankie responded, batting your hand out of the way. You swore you could hear her muttering about a fingerprint on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the location a bit more pinned down, she started shifting the views to try and get ahead of it. Now and again, the two of you could see something moving very fast and jumping incredible distances to clear whole streets in a single bound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, come on, where are you going?\u201d Frankie said to herself, chewing on her lip as her fingers continued to fire off at breakneck pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t tear your eyes away from the screens, searching for any sign of this mystery thing tearing across the city. Suddenly, there was no more sign of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did it go? Did you lose it?\u201d you asked, your eyes darting across the videos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was right here,\u201d Frankie responded, motioning towards one of them. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026wait, there it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought one of the videos of the fore, showing a leg creeping up over the top of a wall. The other cameras in the area showed no further sign of the fleeing target, hinting that it had gone to ground in that building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit, do you know where it hid at?\u201d You couldn\u2019t make heads or tails of the metadata that was tied to that specific camera, and there wasn\u2019t anything distinctive about the wall it had climbed up, so you shook your head. \u201cThat is the rear wall of Ms. Rosenthal's Whacky Candy Boutique. Whoever or whatever that thing is,\u201d pointing at a frozen image showing the thing mid jump, \u201cIt just went right to that freaky candy shop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at the image. It was horrible quality, dark and very pixilated. Something about it looked oddly familiar and chilling at the same time though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Did I hear that right?</i>\u201d Barbara said, reminding the two of you that she was still at Denise\u2019s. You gave confirmation and Frankie backed you up.\u201c<i>Damn it\u2026All right, that thing seemed to be keeping an eye on Denise, and now it knows that Batgirl is involved in some way. We\u2019re going to have to act fast.</i></span></div></div>",

However, she soon stopped herself before leaping out, where she then spoke to you and Frankie and said, <i>\"Frankie, I'm going to need you to put a spyware into Denise's smartphone. I've got a hunch that whoever it was that was snooping on us will probably return for Denise.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way ahead of you, Bats. Now go get 'em!\" Frankie retorted, her dark lithe fingers flying across the keyboard as if it was natural. And with that, Batgirl closed the window behind her to prevent whatever it was she saw from getting their clutches on a now uncannily spherical Denise Chavez. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, despite her rotund girth, she leapt off the fire escape and quickdrawed her Grapnel Gun, firing it off towards a nearby building, as it quickly reeled her up to the rooftop as if she was 400 pounds lighter. And yet, in the back of her brilliant mind, something told the red-headed crime fighter that there was more to this situation than meets the eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was going to get to the bottom of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-- Ms. Rosenthal's Whacky Candy Boutique --<br>\r\n-- Burnside District --<br>\r\n-- 10:35 pm Eastern Standard Time --</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter traversing across nearly 6 and a half blocks worth of Burnside rooftops, Batgirl soon arrived at her destination; Ms. Rosenthal's Whacky Candy Boutique. Going with what she had learned from the Batman, Batgirl fired off her Grapnel Gun once more, zipping above the streets below her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, despite her substantially larger physique, she was able to parkour around the rooftop ventilation shafts and other accessories that commercial buildings would usually be adorned with, where she soon nimbly landed behind the now suspicious candy shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Red? Not to discourage you or anything, but... Are you sure it's a good idea right now to infiltrate that candy shop right now? I mean, whatever it was that was spying on us, it might be goading us into a trap.\" You asked, becoming concerned for Barbara's safety, since you weren't sure if you remember there being a villain in Gotham that uses a candy shop for nefarious deeds. After all, despite such a short time, you had grown attached to the rotund Batgirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she pulled out a set of lockpicking tools to Lockpick the backdoor to the shop, Batgirl understand what you're saying, as the caped redhead spoke to you with a reassuring tone and answered, <i>\"(Name), sweetie...I understand your concern and I much appreciate you worrying about me, but even if it is a trap, I can handle myself.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd within a brief moment, Batgirl easily unlocked the door with a subtle *Click-Click*, where she then continued, <i>\"...And besides, it's me we're talking about, remember?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, using every trick and skill she learned from the Dark Knight, Batgirl cautiously entered inside the Whacky Candy Boutique, wielding a small but powerful flashlight. Though she wouldn't downright admit it, Batgirl had to admit that something felt...\"off\" about this shop, noticing the uncanny chocolate-skinned elves posing on the podium stalls, as if they were watching the place like a set of gargoyle statues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta admit; This place is even giving me the creeps.\" She thought to herself, whilst she searched through several different areas of the shop. First, she checked the cash registers, but found nothing worth noting. Then, she investigated one or two of the candy stalls, still found nothing of a warranted notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, as if the plot had thickened, Batgirl soon inevitably noticed that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She was coming round one of the displays when she saw the candy elf statue in the middle of the store. Barbara frowned as her eyes fell on it. She understood how her girlfriend was creeped out by the freaky thing. She started to move past the statue, but froze and looked back up at it. A frown crossed her face as she realized it had somehow changed during the time that she was in the store. Before it\u2019s face had been twisted in a disturbing smile. Now though, it was more of a toothy snarl frozen in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chittering noise behind her made her whip around, casting the light about to try to find the source. Nothing was in sight though, so she turned back to resume her search. Her heart leapt in her throat as she saw that the statue had moved again. Rather than a new expression though, the statue itself had taken off, leaving no sign behind except the empty stand. Barbara turned her flashlight to and fro, half hoping that the statue had just fallen over, even though she knew that wasn\u2019t possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes caught as a shadow moved between two of the stands. Darting over as quick as her blubber allowed, she still wasn\u2019t able to catch any sign of what she saw moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sinister sounding hissing laugh came from right behind her. She was starting to turn when something went leaping past her, knocking into the side of her head and almost knocking her to the floor. She was almost able to make it back to her feet when something slammed into her front, bouncing off of her stomach and vanishing back into the shadows. As she fumbled and tried to keep her footing, Barbara was puzzled by how much the thing that attacked her looked like the candy elf statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat same odd laughter came from behind her, but she didn\u2019t have time to turn. Something pounced on her back, upsetting her already unsteady balance. The costumed redhead slammed belly first into a candy display, sending a wave of jawbreakers to bounce and roll across the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she braced herself against the broken plastic, listening to the cacophony of dozens of jawbreakers moving across the floor, she forced her eyes closed. Breathing deep and letting it out helped focus her mind. Whatever was attacking her was probably used to using fear to assist them. Barbara had trained with a real master of fear though, and had fought a lot worse than them though. She had just gotten a little rusty at it though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her mind focused, she opened her senses to take in the environment around her. Beneath the sound of the jawbreakers and broken plastic, she could hear a collection of steady and rhythmic footstep sounds. Wait\u2026one had sped up, and\u2026There it was, the rustle of fabric\u2026She would still need to be precise in her timing to do\u2026THIS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara spun as fast as she could, lifting one meaty leg and sweeping it across her loop. She caught the freaky thing right in the face, sending it flying across the room to smash into a display stand. Boxes went flying and tumbled to the floor as the candy elf collapsed to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat same laugh came from behind her yet again. This time, she ducked and lunged to the side so that the elf that would have hit her from behind against instead went flying past her without a hit. In a flash, she pulled out her grapple gun and fired. The cable entwined the elf\u2019s leg and she pulled, snapping the line taut. She next turned the trapped elf\u2019s momentum against itself, swinging it around her head. Hitting the release at just the right time, she created a midair collision with a third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fourth elf came scuttling across the ceiling, leaping and twisting in midair. It\u2019s teeth were bared and Barbara had little doubt that the creature intended to put them to good use. It never got the chance though and instead took a pair of swift punches that put it flat out on the ground like the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rotund redhead gave a slight chuckle. She was panting from the exertion, and she could feel a bit of pain in her knees, but she wouldn\u2019t have traded it for the world. She missed having a good fight like that, not just chasing down a purse snatcher or whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrouching down, she furrowed her brow under her mask, trying to figure out what in the world were these candy elf things. They were even creepier when they were moving around than they were posing as a statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo lost in her examination, she missed the rustle of fabric till it was too late. A fifth elf leapt past her. A lance of pain erupted from her arm. She managed to lash out on instinct, her fist connecting with the elf\u2019s midsection and sending it flying. It smashed into one of the candy displays along the wall, bringing boxes of sweets down atop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHissing, Barbara took a look at her arm. Her costume was split open, and there was a red line in her skin beneath. A bead of blood was already starting to well up. Looking up, she made sure that her last attacker was staying down. She paused when she saw that the force of the impact had moved the case away from the wall. A sliver of even deeper darkness peaked from beyond. It looked like a hidden opening to an eye experienced in such things.</span></div></div>",

You alright over there?\"</i> Frankie exclaimed over the rounded vigilante's private comms, obviously from both you and her concerning over the redhead's current status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Batgirl soon responded to her support team's concern, where she tapped into her comm and replied, \"I'm fine, girls. Turns out this place has more to it than meets the eye.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You just had to quote Transformers, didn't you Bats?\"</i> You retorted, just after you and Frankie both exhaled an obvious sigh of relief from hearing the rotund redhead's voice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*chuckle* What? It's true!\" She jokingly quipped for a brief moment, then returning to a more professional undertone once she made her way inside the hidden room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, once she made her way inside the secret room, Batgirl could easily make out the lit computer monitors, as if they displayed vital classified intel. The girthy redhead cracked a mild yet cathartic satisfied grin on her chubby face, self remarking as she quipped, \"Jackpot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Find anything interesting?\"</i> Frankie asked curiously, briefly hearing Batgirl's self remark. \"Maybe.\" She replied, as she approached the multi-screened computer console, inserting a USB dongle key she kept in her bright yellow utility belt into the terminal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, she rapidly typed away on the keyboard as if it was merely second nature, thinking aloud to herself as she said, \"Alright... Let's see what you're really hiding. Hmph, and they don't even have the latest kernel patch. Tsk-tsk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only a brief thirty seconds until Batgirl found something rather interesting, as it seemed to have left her quite speechless. Unfortunately, she wouldn't have much time to review all this shocking information, as she soon heard Frankie over her comms as the African-American woman hurriedly said, <i>\"Heads up, Bats! Just caught footage of two SUVs heading your way. Whatever you're doing, make it quick and get outta there!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to such a warning, her mind went into some semblance of Hyperfocus for a brief second on weighing her options, which soon resulted in her copying the classified data onto the USB dongle key for further investigation back at the apartment. After all, time was of the essence for the vigilant yet rotund Batgirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, just as she reinserted the dongle key back into her utility belt, she promptly deleted the tabs as to avoid suspicion from whomever was responsible for these weird occurrences inside the Whacky Candy Boutique, as she sprinted out of the hidden room despite her weight and bulk, throwing out two disposable smoke pellets as to cover her tracks along with losing any potential pursuers, much like certain members of a secret vigilante family she knew and still was a part of when needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut by the time whoever was in those SUVs had arrived at the Candy Boutique, the intruder was long gone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-- The Batgirl Bunker --<br>\r\n-- Barbara, Frankie, &amp; (Name)'s Apartment --<br>\r\n-- Burnside District, Gotham City --<br>\r\n-- 45 Minutes Later --</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, let me get this straight; Those creepy candy elf statues... aren't actually statues?\" You asked, currently overlooking the statistics displayed on an ivory white laptop, which displayed the yellow Batgirl symbol overlapping the medical Red Cross insignia. Obviously, you figured by this point that it was meant for medical evaluations. After all, it was the same laptop you got as a gift from your parents on your birthday. Before you mysteriously ended up as Batgirl's girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the laptop was connected to a pair of three adhesive Electrodes, which were administered upon the upper half of Barbara's burgeoning double belly, as her lightly armoredpurple Batgirl jacket was fully unzipped for better reception that you could analyze on any potential abnormalities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this also exposed the redhead's downright impressive  Double G-Cup rack, which was suitably contained within a pink bra with magenta lacing embedded into it's design. Currently, Barbara was sitting on a reinforced red hospital gurney, her wide lower half putting a noticeable dent in the gurney's mattress padding, with her smartphone placed beside her voluminous rear,  while her yellow combat boots were discarded onto the floor between you and the larger girl, thus giving her plump feet some breathing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Look, I know it sounds too absurd to be true, but it DID actually happen, girls. Surprisingly, they were very agile, considering their size and body mass.\" Barbara explained, elaborating on why she was radio silent for a moment back at the Whacky Candy Boutique to both you and Frankie, as the tech-savvy hacker went over the data that Babs had acquired from the shady business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, you were wearing a light blue Harvard U tanktop, which did little to conceal the lower half of your your small but noticeable plump belly and muffintop, along with a snug pair of orange-red sport short shorts, as well as a pair of red slippers. Overall, you looked as if you're ready for bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Babs. After all that's happened in the past 24 hours, I don't think there's much that'll surprise me. I mean, we live in a city where there's a giant crocodile man, a creature made of clay who can shapeshift into anyone, and a man-sized bat monster flying about at night. So yeah, not much surprises here, Red.\" Frankie retorted, making not-so-subtle references to Killer Croc, Clayface, and Man-Bat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut whilst you were going over Barbara's diagnostics to make sure she has a clean bill of health after taking that nasty scratch earlier, Frankie was meticulously sifting through all that data Batgirl had acquired. And boy, there was a lot to decrypt and analyze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of a puzzling and mildly impatient demeanor, you placed your olive-skinned hands upon your chubby self, with your right hand pressed upon your rounder hips, whilst your left hand traced itself along the outermost curve of your chubby belly. Sure Barbara was substantially fatter than you, but you were definitely in the range between \"Chubby\" and \"BBW\" proportions, due to your addictive sweet tooth as a child and teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, your white laptop beeped twice to confirm the completion of it's diagnosis, which showed the usual medical and physiological statistics but with a few minor notices, as it read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>======<br>\r\n-- Diagnosis: Complete<br>\r\n-- Status: 56% Body Fat, 44% Muscle<br>\r\n-- Neural Chip Status: Intact<br>\r\n-- Neural Chip Connection: Strong<br>\r\n-- WARNING: Minor wound on right bicep. Recommend Minor Medical Treatment Immediately.<br>\r\n======</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go. Clean bill of health. Aside from that scratch you received, I don't see any signs of toxins in your systems.\" You quipped, exhaling a sigh of relief that Barbara's wound wasn't as worse as you thought it would be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? What did I tell you, sweetie?\" Barbara chuckled, reassuring you with a quick but tender peck on the cheek, which made you blush a bashful crimson hue in response to such an affectionate gesture from the obese redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you had just woken up in this new reality, you were already seeing the benefits of being the girlfriend to a rotund Batgirl. After all, even though you were bisexual, you were strangely somewhat more into larger women than guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as you were about to makeout with Barbara right here, Frankie soon interrupted the two of you as she explained, \"Hate to interrupt your little love session, ladies, but it looks like I found something you need to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what is it Frankie?\" Barbara asked, as she pulled off the Electrodes on her stomach, then casually dismounted from the gurney and leisurely yet mildly waddled over towards where Frankie was sitting in the Batgirl Bunker, with you following behind her in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, when you and Babs stood beside Frankie overlooking the three lit monitors, the three of you saw that the acquired data showed...</span></div></div>",

It was plain to see the target of the camera was Pamela Isley, otherwise known as the eco-terrorist Poison Ivy. There was one rather glaring difference that set her apart from how you had seen her before though: the green hued woman shown on the screen was much, <i>much</i> fatter than any you had seen before. Really though, in hindsight, you should have been expecting something like this with how everything else had been going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling your attention back to the screen, you heard Ivy speaking, \u201cOoh, look at you darlings, you\u2019re all doing so well.\u201d She reached out and ran her hands through the flowering plants before her, their leaves reaching back towards her. Then her voice took on a much darker tone, \u201cEven cooped up like I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Barbara gasp beside you. Glancing over, you saw her biting her thumb. She was intent on the screen and didn\u2019t even seem to notice you looking at her. Frowning, you turned back to the video. You saw that Ivy had moved along further down the row of plants, the camera tracking her progress. Watching her walking along, you were shocked to see her moving. She was so massive you didn\u2019t think she should be able to stand, let alone walk along. She was even bigger than Denise had been before her latest candy binge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden wave of motion hit Ivy as she jumped after being startled by the sound of a door opening somewhere out of view of the camera. Even with the angle and limited resolution of the camera, you could see how she clenched her jaw and glared at whoever was coming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Pamela, I trust you had a restful night,\u201d a feminine voice called. There was something odd about the voice, but you couldn\u2019t quite place it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy all but snarled back, \u201cYou know I did no such thing. You\u2019ve got enough cameras watching me all the time to know that!\u201d She threw her arm in the direction of the camera you were watching a clip from, sending a ripple that passed through her entire body and kept it moving for almost a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Ivy\u2019s comment had any effect on the other, she didn\u2019t let any of it appear in her voice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that, but we do have a schedule to keep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what if I don\u2019t want to keep getting hooked up to your machines?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen we would have to fall back on our previously discussed method to\u2026persuade you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no hint of malice that you could hear, but it was clear to see that there was something to that implied threat. Ivy\u2019s face paled, an impressive feat considering her standard coloring. \u201cNo! No, that won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d She kept her eyes on the floor after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell go on, get on with it. Like I said, we have a schedule.\u201d At first, you thought the other was talking to Ivy, but Ivy continued to wait nevertheless. After a few moments, a pair of those creepy candy elf things scurried into view. Seeing them in motion made your skin crawl even worse than seeing them pretend to be a statue, Barbara wasn\u2019t lying about that at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elves loped up to Ivy and she turned to waddle off. Then the screen went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s it. Now correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but wasn\u2019t that the super villain Poison Ivy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara seemed quite distracted, still biting her thumb and her gaze locked on the screen despite there only being computer code displayed there now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFilling the gap while you kept an eye on the rotund redhead, \u201cSure looked that way to me, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s ever been that big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, but with everything else going on in the area recently, it doesn\u2019t seem too surprising.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to admit that Frankie wasn\u2019t wrong there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there anything about a location for where she\u2019s being kept?\u201d Barbara suddenly blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh\u2026nothing so far,\u201d Frankie said, her fingers tapping away at the keyboard again, \u201cBut there\u2019s more data you pulled off that computer that I haven\u2019t been able to access yet. Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to rescue her,\u201d Barbara blurted out. She then clapped a hand over her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, run that by us again: you have to rescue the crazed super villainess that regularly wants to turn people into a bunch of crazy plants or something?\u201d Frankie snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s\u2026! She\u2019s not like that, not anymore,\u201d Barbara retorted, seeming almost bashful in your opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you would know that how?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I can\u2019t tell you, not yet. But please believe me, you two, it would be for the best if we rescue her, especially if she is involved in this thing going on with the candy shop like it seems.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie huffed and spun back to face the computer screen muttering to herself. You were more torn, wanting to believe Barbara but also unsure of why she was being so secretive. Your train of thought was derailed as you realized that Barbara was starting to suit herself back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, where are you going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even slowing down or looking up at you, she responded, \u201cI\u2019ve got to get back out there. I\u2019ve wasted enough time already.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>However, as you saw the rotund redhead re-zip her armored purple purple Batgirl jacket back up, you felt an odd instinctive twinge in the back of your mind, which caused you to quickly put a hand on Barbara's plump left shoulder and unconsciously quipped, \"Sorry, Babs. I can't let you go back out there tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara looked at you with a mildly confused yet quizzical expression on her round face, raising a crimson eyebrow in response to your words as she retorted, \"...Sweetie, this isn't the time for one of your <i>\"You're overworking yourself\"</i> lectures. Ivy is in serious trouble!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-And I get what you're saying, Babs. But you need to slow down a little and think for a minute. Besides, you're now just experiencing that trademark Tunnel Vision of yours.\" You replied, moving your hand from Babs' plump shoulder to her chubby left hand, squeezing it a little to reassure her and confirm your decision. After all, despite only being in this world for roughly a full two days, you felt like you already had a deep connection with the corpulent Batgirl, looking at her with a set of reasonable concern in your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Look...Right noiw, I don't care about your reasons for wanting to rescue Poison Ivy, Red, but I am more concerned about you running yourself ragged and overexerting yourself to complete exhaustion. I mean, what if you head out right now and suddenly collapse from exhaustion while fighting a couple of thugs in an alleyway?\" You automatically explained, putting your profound concerns on full display, as Frankie turned the chair around to look at both of you and said, \"She's got a point there, Babs. Look, we can save Poison Ivy at a later date. But right now, we're more worried about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing the legitimate concerns from her own support team, Barbara first looked at the computer monitor of the now corpulent Poison Ivy displayed upon the screen, then back toward Frankie, and finally toward you. In response, after hearing you and Frankie's reasonable pleas for her not to overexert herself, Barbara exhaled a deep sigh in mild reluctance and reluctantly said, \"*sigh*...Alright, alright. You girls won me over. But what would you have me do until then? Whoever has imprisoned Ivy might be doing something terrible to her or worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to her question, as you slowly unzipped the purple Batgirl jacket from Barbara's person, then calmly stripping it from her voluminous form, you spoke to her in a reassuring tone and answered, \"...Well, as your personal in-house doctor, I'd recommend a temporary recess from your nightly escapades for tonight, and focus on recuperating for the time being. That is, until you fully recover your strength. Don't you agree?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you fully stripped the Batgirl jacket from Barbara's rotund form, which left her upper body in her pink laced bra and yellow cuffed Batgirl gloves, Barbara exhaled another sigh, knowing that you weren't going to be swayed so easily into letting her go back out into Burnside tonight. From there, she then spoke to you and coyly replied, \"*sigh*...I suppose you're right, (Name). I really can't say no to you, can I?\" She gently pressed a gloved hand against the outermost curve of her belly and continued, \"...And I guess a little bit of R&amp;R will do me some good, especially with my current size and all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after dismounting herself from the reinforced hospital gurney, Barbara casually uncuffed her yellow Batgirl gloves from her her plump hands and wrists, setting them upon the gurney alongside her smartphone. From there, after she did so, Barbara looked back at the dark-skinned computer wiz and pragmatically asked, \"Frankie, do you think you can decrypt the rest of that intel I gathered while I recuperate for the rest of the night?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to such a question, Frankie soon displayed a confident grin toward her chubbier compatriots, nodding in confirmation then replied, \"Already on it, Babs! You just focus on getting some rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, before you calmly stripped the purple and black Batgirl pants from Babs' person, you lifted up her apron belly a bit to undo her yellow utility belt and leg pouch, carefully discarding them upon the hospital gurney, which now left the rotund Barbara Gordon in nothing but her pink laced bra and equally large pink laced panties. From there, Barbara placed her chubby hands upon her wide burgeoning hips in brief contemplation and huffed, \"*exhakke* Well, if I'm going to be having the night off, I might as well get myself a midnight snack before going to bed as a personal reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, as she swiftly grabbed her smartphone, Barbara calmly but lightly waddled her way out of the Batgirl Bunker, with her hips and equally fat buttocks lightly sashaying to and fro like waves on a beach shoreline. But as you began to put the Batgirl costume back onto the obese mannequin in the display case, Barbara looked back at you with a coyly flirtatious twinkle in her jade green eyes and quipped, \"...Care to join me, sweetie?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I will, babe. Just let me finish up with getting your costume back in place first, and then I'll join you.\" You instinctively retorted, bearing a bashful look on your slightly chubby face, as the olive skin on your cheeks flushed a crimson red in response. Of course, the rotund redhead soon concurred and replied, \"Fair enough, I suppose. But in the meantime, I'll see if I can get myself into some PJs. Don't wanna catch a cold on your watch~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Barbara took off, almost having a jovial skip in her chubby step, as you soon returned to the task of putting the Batgirl costume back onto the obese mannequin, while Frankie began to work on decrypting the rest of the data that was acquired. First, you started with the pants, then you inserted the yellow boots onto the mannequin's feet. From there, you put the large purple jacket onto the mannequin, zipping up the jacket, and then came the yellow utility belt and leg pouch. And finally, you cuffed on the yellow cuffed gloves and inserted the bat cowl upon the mannequin's head, thus completing the ensemble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, you soon tapped a button or two on a console upon the display case, which caused a plexiglass door to shut before you. From there, a mechanical female voice rang out as it flatly stated:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Activating Decontamination Protocols. Deploying Sanitation Countermeasures.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, that certainlytakes care of things for tonight. G'night, Frankie. Good luck on those decryptions.\" You said, wishing the dark-skinned brunette a good night, as she then casually replied, \"Oh don't worry 'bout me <i>Nurse Ratchet</i>. You just take care of that <i>Chubby Caped Crusader</i> of ours, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*chuckle* Don't have to tell me twice.\" You jokingly quipped, bidding Frankie a good nightleaving her in the Batgirl Bunker for the rest iif the night. Although you had only been in this world not too long ago, you certainly weren't regretting it by being here. From there, as you left Frankie to her devices for the night...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stepping out of the hidden door, you waited for a moment as it sealed behind you. Around the corner, you heard Barbara in the kitchen. Peeking around, you saw that she was hard at work digging into a sundae that wasn\u2019t quite a match for the size of the smoothie the two of you had split earlier, but it was still a rather impressive amount. Even more impressive was the evidence of how much she had already eaten in the short time since she had left the secret room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWandering over you thought about asking her about whatever her connection to Ivy was, but decided against it. She would tell you in her own time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how\u2019s that pajama thing coming along?\u201d you asked, letting your gaze trail down over her still mostly bared skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little slow in fact,\u201d she responded with a sly grin crossing her face as she brought another heaping spoonful to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ice cream\u2019s journey faltered a bit, before she turned it around and shoved it into your mouth instead. Soon after, the two of you finished off the ice cream. The cold mass settled in your stomach, leaving you a more than a little full after everything earlier. It also left you with a bit of a sugar rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you made an offhand comment about this, Barbara remarked with a coy grin. \u201cI <i>think</i> I can help with that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou next found yourself pinned to the bed by her bulk. Barbara seemed even passionate than she had the night before. She also was the one in charge, no matter your preference in the matter. The skill and dexterity she showed despite her size left you unconcerned with this though. You lost track of time and what happened as you passed into a pleasure filled haze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like an entirety of heaven later, you became conscious that you were snuggled up against her warm and yielding bulk. Peeking an eye over the curve of her body, you saw that she was flicking through her phone with a slight smile on her lips and her eyes half open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, just checking out some of the posts that sprang up about my jaunt tonight. There\u2019s a number of posts about seeing an enormous woman sprinting across rooftops and flying through the air. There are also quite a few people calling it an insane promotion for a weight loss product among other things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you on your phone right now, shouldn\u2019t you be getting some sleep? What time is it anyways?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d She stopped as she winced. \u201cI\u2026couldn\u2019t get to sleep. I was thinking about\u2026you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIvy?\u201d you prompted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a sigh and closing her eyes for a moment. \u201cYes. And no, I\u2019m not ready to talk about it. Tell you what, the phone is being put away, and we can try to get some sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter tucking the phone in a drawer, Barbara closed her eyes. Even still, you remained awake for a while longer, keeping an eye on her even after her breathing had turned low and slow. Only then did you let yourself slip back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome the morning, Barbara seemed more reserved and distracted than she had the day before. Even the small talk over breakfast seemed almost forced. She only perked up when an alert from Frankie came through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease tell me you have something,\u201d Barbara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe,\u201d Frankie responded. There was the sound of furious keyboard typing coming across the line as well. \u201cWhoever set up that video feed was doing a fantastic job of covering up their tracks\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit,\u201d came Barbara\u2019s dejected response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, Babs, you think so little of my skills. I said they were doing a fantastic job of covering their tracks, not that it was enough to beat me.\u201d Barbara regained some of her fire at that. \u201cBut that being said, I wasn\u2019t able to pin it down completely. They bounced the signal across more than a dozen relays, must have been running at least three different encryption protocols, and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes, you\u2019re a technological wizard Frankie, we get it,\u201d you said with a bit of a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right, sorry. I think I\u2019ve managed to pin the signal source coming from one of three locations: a warehouse on the Burnside docks, the old fire station, or an abandoned factory over in Gotham. I could maybe try to pin it down further than that, but it will take a while longer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee what you can do, but in the meantime, we\u2019ll have to see about checking each of them out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven without seeing her, you knew for sure that Frankie was certain to be making a face and wondering just why Barbara was so intent on this. You were trying your damnedest to not let a similar expression cross your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Frankie provided a welcome distraction. \u201cAny idea which one you\u2019re going to hit first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara looked deep in thought for a moment before responding and saying she was going to\u2026</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With her eidetic mind transitioning into Hyperfocus once more, Barbara weighed the available options before her and her partners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, there was the abandoned factory within main Gotham City. It was once a regular toy factory until the Joker decided to turn it into a not-so-whimsical deathtrap for Batman, Robin, and Batgirl prior to her relocating to Burnside. As for it's location, it was easily located on the outer rims of the Bowery District, which was undoubtedly in Penguin's territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, there was the old Burnside fire station, which was once in use before City Hall funded the construction of a new, cleaner fire station for the Burnside Branch of the GCFD. And who knows? It might be in use by whomever was holding Ivy captive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd last but certainly not least, was a warehouse at the Burnside Dockyards, located approximately seven blocks southwest of Burnside Bridge. Some of the warehouses there were still in use today, but there was a small margin of these storage facilities that were completely derelict, perfect for whomever was holding Ivy prisoner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContemplating her decision, the rotund redhead weighed her options, putting a plump hand on her equally chubby chin and double chin as she spoke aloud and said, \"Hmm... The abandoned toy factory in the Bowery seems like an obvious choice. However, I still think they wouldn't put Ivy in there due to some of Joker's <i>\"toys\"</i> most likely still laying about in that God awful place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously understanding where she's coming from, you empathized with the rotund Barbara Gordon and complied, \"Fair enough, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Then there is the old Burnside fire station on Jefferson Avenue. It hasn't been used since April of last year. But honestly, it's way too exposed and out in the open for anything these people are doing with Ivy not to be noticed by the locals.\" Barbara continued, pacing briefly from left to right, her wide hips and burgeoning buttocks sashaying in rhythm with her mildly waddling steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Wouldn't make sense for whoever has Ivy to have her imprisoned in an area with high pedestrian traffic.\" Frankie agreed, her arms crossed whilst she looked at you and Babs in her swiveling chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--Which means there's only one place that isn't just easily accessible, but also private enough not to be noticed by the public, and close enough to distribute whatever they are concocting from Ivy: The Burnside Dockyards.\" Barbara flatly confirmed, with her answer making the most logical sense in terms of discretion and accessibility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing what she had elaborated on, you and Frankie soon agreed with the rotund redhead, as you then spoke up and retorted, \"Well, guess we now know which one we're investigating first, Babs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and me both, sweetie. You and me both.\" Barbara quipped, putting on a soft agreed curve on her lips. However, just as she was about to approach the plexiglass casing that held her purple and yellow Batgirl costume, Barbara's stomach soon began to gurgle audibly, which caused an unbiased yet noticeable blush upon her chubby face, especially with such an unexpected interruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*chuckle* Well, it sounds like a certain redheaded crime fighter I know needs a bit more sustenance than what she ate for breakfast~\" Frankie chuckled, easily knowing how Barbara's stomach seemingly had a mind of it's own on occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, you couldn't help but agree with Frankie, as you seemed to feel a smidgen bit famished yourself, where you chuckled a little whilst placing a hand on your chubby hips and retorted, \"Yeah. I think we can all afford a short reprieve before getting back to finding Poison Ivy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, despite feeling as if finding the now corpulent Poison Ivy was an utmost priority, Barbara reluctantly had to agree with you and Frankie, letting out a reluctant *huff* in response. \"*sigh* Alright, alright, you girls win. Stupid greedy stomach of mine.\" Barbara huffed, grabbing a good amount of belly flesh with a plump hand, shaking it aggressively in annoyance towards her expanded organ for an inopportune interruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww! But it's my favorite part of you, Babs.\" You instinctively chirped, putting a teasing yet affectionate hand upon Barbara's substantially attentive apron belly, which the redhead couldn't help but display a doting curve on her lips, dimpling her round cheeks some as she replied, \"I can't stay mad at you can I, my little medic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* What? I'm not little!\" You teasingly yelped, where Babs soon turned herself to press her substantially larger abdomen against your own, easily emphasizing her point, while she smugly placed her plump hands on her wider hips and quipped, \"*chuckle* Well, you are when compared to me, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*chuckle* Alrighty then. While you two are busy showing off, I'll see if I can get a hold of Alysia and Jo,  see if they're available for a get-together. After all, it's been a while since we've seen them, y'know?\" Frankie chirped, as she then casually picked up her smartphone and dialed up Alysia's phone number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, since we're going to be taking a break from searching for Ivy, I'm gonna get myself spruced up some if we're planning on seeing Alysia and Jo.\" Barbara stated, as she calmly waddled off towards the bedroom to get herself properly dressed in some street clothes, with her voluminous buttcheeks lightly bobbing up and down with each step and gait in the redhead's movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you decided to momentarily check what's happening on social media, pulling out your smartphone and opening the Twitter app as you did so. From there, you were soon given a small load of notifications from Twitter, which seemed to be mostly related to the now fatter Batgirl, which seemingly now had it's own hashtag, <i>\"#FatBat\"</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFitting, considering how big Barbara Gordon and Batgirl were now. And yet, you're still questioning how nobody seemed to have connected that Barbara Gordon and Batgirl were one and the same yet if they're so big now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut anyway, your curiosity soon but briefly took hold, as you tapped on one of the notifications, which revealed a tweet  posted on there that read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Was about to get robbed by some jerks in Biker threads until #FatBat showed up and kicked their asses. Thanks, #FatBat!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe comment was about a day or two old, as you then scrolled down to look at another tweet, which seemed to be praising Batgirl as well, only it was briefly discussing about her sending a metaphorical message about body positivity,  which read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Man, you never see that many plus-sized superheroines out there, huh? But boy is #FatBat sticking it to the stereotypes. OMG!! She looks so confident with her size! #FatBatRules!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were initially yet honestly surprised at how much of a following the now fatter Batgirl had, especially with some of the posted comments correlating to how she wasn't just helping the hipster community, but also showing that anyone can be their own superhero, no matter their size and body type. From looking at the profile page, you can easily see that Batgirl has a whopping total of 240,000 followers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, with such fame, there would always be a few haters and trolls out there. But one tweet stood out the most, which came from the notorious hacker and blackmailed, Riot Black, who posted a rather insulting yet immature tweet that said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"#FatBat? More like #LardAss! I've been a #Fad before she was #FatBat. #FatBatSucks #KissMyAss #DumbLosers\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, that post was a week or two old, as the tweet by Riot Black was absolutely DESTROYED with over 200,000 Dislikes and almost 300 nasty comments aimed squarely at the deadlocked hacker douchebag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, it definitely brought a smug smile upon your olive-skinned face.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sometime later after the morning respite at the apartment, you, Barbara, and Frankie were now currently traversing the streets of Burnside, intent on a rendezvous with Alysia and Jo at the one place that was most familiar to them:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe restaurant establishment known as \"Papa Joe's\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, you were sporting a pair of denim shorts over a pair of diamond patterned leggings, as well as a pair of red and white converse sneakers on your lower half. Meanwhile, your upper half wore a shirt that bore the logo of the band, Ashes on Sunday, who once had Batgirl's ally and Birds of Prey member Black Canary as their lead singer, as you had your semi-baggy purse holstered upon your right shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, looking at Frankie, you could see that she was sporting a black skirt that reached to just above her knees, bearing these peach-colored polka dots on the fabric, whilst she wore a light pink loose shirt with puffy short sleeves, along with wearing a crescent moon necklace around her lithe chocolate colored neck, yet her hair was put into a blooming wavy ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, as you looked at the rotund Barbara Gordon, you could easily see her chosen ensemble, consisting of a stretchy pair of purple sport shorts, which overlapped a pair of colorful leggings, while she wore a set of yellow and white Converse sneakers on her bulky lower half, as her burgeoning paunch of a belly could easily be seen, as the lower hem of her belly was contained underneath the stretchy fabric of the sport shorts. And to top it all off, she had a long-sleeved plaid shirt tied around her waist, as the shirt seemed almost strained in wrapping around the redhead's bulbous girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on her upper half, Barbara was wearing a simple yet massive white T-Shirt, which only outlined her established enormity, especially when it came to her bountiful bosom. Overall, Babs' ensemble did little to no effort in concealing her rotund size and bulk, as she had a spacious purse holstered around her plumped up left shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, Barbara was undoubtedly excited to see Alysia and Jo once again, bearing an excited curve upon her lips, despite the occasional onlooker gawking at the redhead's substantially heftier physique, which didn't seem to bother Barbara whatsoever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I honestly can't wait to see those two lovebirds again. I mean, we haven't seen them often in my opinion.\" Barbara gleefully quipped, in which Frankie nodded in agreement then replied, \"*chuckle* Agreed. After all, those girls are inseparable these days, y'know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, whilst Frankie and Babs were reminiscing, your mind seemed to be giving you a recap on who Alysia and Jo were. Alysia's full name was Alysia Yeoh (no relation to actress Michelle Yeoh, of course!), and was Barbara's roommate before Babs moved into her current abode. Alysia was of Singaporean descent, and surprisingly, transgender. At times when she wasn't working as a bartender or painting, she would occasionally get herself involved in activism, alongside her girlfriend and now wife, Jo. Still don't know Jo's full name, though, but you think it is most likely short for Joanna or Joan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, outside of their activist work, they were actually rather nice people. Soon, your mind pulled you back into the physical world, as the three of you had just arrived at Papa Joe's. From there, upon entering the establishment...</span></div></div>",

Her wife, Jo, on the other hand was looking more than a little chunky. She was still rather skinny compared to Barbara, and some of the other women you had encountered as of late, but the change from the same picture was striking nevertheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you know all about my sweet tooth, Lyssa,\u201d Barbara responded with a twinkle in her eyes, drawing your attention away from the curvier Jo. Your surprised staring seemed to have gone unnoticed. \u201cPlus, <i>she</i> doesn\u2019t seem to mind me having a bit of extra weight,\u201d giving you a playful hip bump that still almost sent you stumbling into a nearby table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re the one that big red here used to replace me,\u201d Alysia said, narrowing her eyes as she looked you straight in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden and rather jarring switch left you reeling, till the raven haired woman\u2019s straight face broke and she burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, you\u2019re so serious, I\u2019m just messing around with you,\u201d she said motioning for the three of you to take a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe only does that with people she likes,\u201d Barbara whispered in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mumbled back, \u201cGood to know,\u201d as you took the seat in the middle to save Frankie from the encroaching weight of Barbara; all the better to enjoy it yourself as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what have you two been up to? We haven\u2019t talked much for a while,\u201d Barbara said, diving right in after your trio placed their orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve managed to sell a few more paintings. Nothing major, just a couple of private sales. I do have a piece in a gallery close by though. It\u2019s strange seeing it surrounded by some of my idols though,\u201d Alysia said after a sip of her drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get all misty eyed now,\u201d Jo chided her wife with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlysia grumbled something before continuing, \u201cI\u2019ve managed to get a chef\u2019s job as well\u2013\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did!? Oh, I know how much you wanted that,\u201d Barbara gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark haired woman waved her hand, \u201cIt\u2019s just in a food truck, but it\u2019s nice to be able to do more than just sling drinks.\u201d Pulling her wife close, \u201cJo\u2019s been helping me taste test a few new offers as well\u2026which might be why she\u2019s putting on a bit of weight recently.\u201d She added a grin at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, stop that. You know you like me a bit curvier. Anyways, there\u2019s all that taste testing, plus the baby weight might be\u2013\u201c Jo\u2019s mouth snapped shut so fast and so hard that people a few tables away must have been able to hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d Barbara all but shouted. \u201cI\u2019m so happy for the two of you! But why didn\u2019t you tell me!?\u201d It looked like she would have jumped up and hugged them if it wasn\u2019t for the table in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo looked down at the table, her mouth compressed till her lips were a white line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlysia sighed and rubbed her forehead. \u201cWell, we were <i>trying</i> to keep a secret for now, just to make sure that there weren\u2019t any\u2026\u201d waving her finger around a bit \u201ccomplications, you know? The doc says things look good so far, but wanted to keep an eye on everything just in case.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarious bits of excitement and cheer went around the table. You even got into it. From there, things devolved into small talk that you paid only half attention to. The food arrived and saved you from passing out. It took a second waitress just to carry Barbara\u2019s massive order. Alysia and Jo looked aside at each other with their mouths kept shut, not saying a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were going well \u2013 everyone was eating with gusto, interspersed with smaller bits of small talk \u2013 till Jo\u2019s phone gave a buzz that shivered across the table. Alysia paused wide eyed, with a forkful of her salad almost at her lips. Jo gulped loud enough that you could hear it across the table as she starred down at the phone as it continued to buzz. She picked it up with a slight tremor to her fingers, flicking through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screwed her eyes shut before muttering \u201cShit\u201d under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Barbara said, diving right into her caring friend role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou remember Denise, right?\u201d Jo responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we ran into her yesterday. She was\u2026bigger than I remember,\u201d Barbara said, her voice and face kept surprisingly casual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Understatement of the year there</i> you thought while trying to keep your face unchanged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo gave a little snort before continuing, \u201cWell, according to Richard, that\u2019s her boyfriend if you didn\u2019t know, she came back home last night. He\u2019s sure of that. But she wasn\u2019t there this morning, he can\u2019t reach her at all, and he has no idea where she is. The police aren\u2019t taking it too serious either, the whole \u2018gone for 24 hours thing\u2019 you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout Jo\u2019s recounting, you watched out the corner of your eye as Barbara\u2019s face paled further and further. You thought she was going to pass out or something if it continued. You were almost certain that it was because of some guilt that perhaps she could have done something if she hadn\u2019t gotten distracted tracking down the elf across town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlysia couldn\u2019t help but notice Barbara\u2019s reaction. \u201cHey, Red, you all right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie dove in and helped cover for the larger woman. \u201cShe\u2019s been hearing about some of those other disappearances in the area, and she\u2019s just as worried as we are. More so, in fact.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I suppose it\u2019s bad enough hearing about that happening. Even worse when it\u2019s someone you know,\u201d Alysia said, nodding her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara recovered shortly thereafter. She set into talking with Alysia and Jo about Denise\u2019s disappearance to give the appearance of not knowing what was going on. You could tell that she was still haunted by her inability to save Denise though, the way her voice was tighter than usual and she had a white knuckle grip on the side of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the cover of the distraction, Frankie leaned in and whispered, \u201cThink it was those elf things, coming back for her or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a quick nod. There was little doubt that they had done something while the rest of you were distracted at the candy shop.</span></div></div>",

With some luck, she might find Denise and the other missing girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, whilst she parkoured her way across the Burnside rooftops via robust acrobatics and a reinforced Grapnel Gun, the rotund redhead's mind wandered a bit, thus letting her muscle memory do the work for her. Her thoughts contemplated on what Alysia and Jo said about Denise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You remember Denise, right?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yeah, we ran into her yesterday. She was...bigger than I remember.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, according to Richard, that's her boyfriend if you didn't know, she came back home last night. He's sure of that. But she wasn't there this morning, he can't reach her at all, and he has no idea where she is. The police aren't taking it too serious either, the whole 'gone for 24 hours thing' you know?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"--Batgirl?\"</i> Your voice rang out, thus snapping the rotund Batgirl back into reality, as she nimbly landed upon an apartment building rooftop with ease, despite her obvious weight and girth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...Are you alright? You've been radio silent for a little while now.\"</i> You asked, noting how Barbara has been rather quiet after the luncheon,which undoubtedly raised some reasonable concern in you. However, Batgirl soon responded back, perching upon the corner of the rooftop facing the Burnside Dockyards whilst she replied, \"Sorry about that, sweetie. I've been...thinking a lot lately.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You've been thinking about what happened to Denise last night, haven't you Babs?\"</i> Frankie interjected, obviously noticing Barbara's current disposition, despite being a good distance away from the apartment lair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...It's my fault, Frankie. If I had just focused more on keeping Denise safe, she wouldn't have been kidnapped.\" Batgirl retorted, feeling more than a twinge of guilt, exhibiting certain symptoms of what the superhero community has dubbed \"Vigilante's Guilt\", which is when a hero or heroine feels as if they failed to defend the people they've sworn to protect due to circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, being someone with a medical profession, you could see that she needed a bit of moral support, as you then spoke back toward the rotund Batgirl and answered, <i>\"Look, Bats; Getting Denise kidnapped wasn't your fault, it was those damned Elf things and their master to be blamed for this. We'll find Denise and get her back home, we just have to play it smart and fast is all.\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh*...You're right. We need to double our efforts in stopping this madness.\" Barbara firmly stated, her mood feeling more bolstered, as she soon leapt off the rooftop in a rotund swan dive, firing off her Grapnel Gun at the nearest rooftop, thus using her enlarged body like a pendulum to swing forward and launch herself onto a nearby warehouse rooftop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after arriving at the designated point, Batgirl perched herself on a nearby warehouse rooftop edge, overlooking the designated warehouse, where it seems that the WayneTech satellite she <i>\"borrowed\"</i> from Lucius Fox had previously picked up a lot of thermal heat coming from this specific warehouse, Warehouse A-34.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSticking to the shadows as her cape blew wildly in the windy evening breeze, Batgirl pulled out a pair of binoculars attached with a live camera feed heads-up display, zooming in on the front entrance of the warehouse. From there, she can undoubtedly see a pair of those wretched Candy Elf things standing by the metallic sliding doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, even though there was definitive proof that these creatures exist, it was still bone-chilling to see these wretched abominations in action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Gotta admit, girls; It still sends shivers up my spine just looking at them.\"</i> Frankie quipped, with you and the rotund Batgirl unanimously agreeing with the ebony-skinned hacker, as you and Frankie watched from the camera feed, keenly observing every jitter and quiver these Candy Elves made, despite their short statures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, I can see a truck coming. A Moving Truck, from the looks of it.\" Batgirl interjected, as she aimed the electronic binoculars at an oncoming moving truck approaching Warehouse A-34, which was rather shady considering the timetable for these specific vehicles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as if expected, the vehicle went straight toward Warehouse A-34, as the metallic doors automatically slid open, thus letting the storage vehicle proceed through. The size of the vehicle was certainly an indication that they were indeed transporting something rather massive...or someone.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From her perch on the nearby rooftop, Barbara had a good view as the truck pulled inside. The loading dock door started to close, but before it did so, the back door on the truck opened and a platform started to slide out. Beneath her mask, Barbara\u2019s eyebrows furrowed as she tried to figure out what that shapeless blob was\u2026and then it clicked. That was a human, Denise to be exact, and far fatter than she had been before. Movement was almost certain to be an impossibility, reducing her to an immobile blob of blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door sealed with a muted clatter and yet Barbara didn\u2019t move. She didn\u2019t react at all till your voice came through her earpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBarbara, what\u2019s wrong? Your heart rate shot up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2013I think I\u2026saw Denise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did?\u201d Frankie asked, her fingers already flying across the keyboard again to get whatever data she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, at least we know that those elf things really did take her,\u201d you chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara mumbled agreement. \u201cLooks like they did quite a number on her too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow so?\u201d you asked, dreading that you knew the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s <i>enormous</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a muted curse. That was what you were expecting. Didn\u2019t make it any better to hear that it was true though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to get in there before it gets any worse. You see a way in, Frankie?\u201d Barbara asked, adding her eyes to the search as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like there\u2019s a service door on the roof. There\u2019s security\u2026huh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018Huh\u2019? What\u2019s up?\u201d you asked turning your attention to her main screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s just after everything they did to cover up this place. The security on the door seems kinda light.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe they got overconfident with how well they hid this place. Doesn\u2019t matter, I\u2019ll take it,\u201d the redheaded crime fighter said as she fired her grapple and swung up onto the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door was right where it was supposed to be, and opened with only a slight creaking noise. The skies seemed to open up at that instant, dumping a wall of water down on the city. Ducking down, Barbara moved in, her suit already shedding the little water that had landed on her. There was a muffled pop in her earpiece, but she didn\u2019t think anything of it. She was too intent on rescuing Denise and anyone else caught up in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was unaware that miles away within her apartment, you and Frankie were trying anything to get Barbara\u2019s signal back. Frankie hadn\u2019t encountered this type of jammer before and couldn\u2019t figure out a way to counter it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack within the bowels of the targeted warehouse, Barbara prowled through the shadows. The rain hammering above and the claps of thunder meant that there was a lot of noise to fill her ears. The matching bursts of lightning left her blinded whenever they struck, as well as filling her gaze with shifting shadows and false movements all around her. Despite the trouble, Barbara continued moving along, careful for a surprise attack that never came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sneaking down through the building, she came to the main floor. A large open space greeted her, as did a huge indoor greenhouse, lights above blazing bright. The walls were frosted glass that prevented her from seeing inside, but there was little doubt in her mind that Ivy was inside. What better spot to keep the botanically inclined woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching up, she pressed against the side of her cowl, triggering the earpiece. \u201cGuys, I think I\u2019ve found where they\u2019re keeping Ivy,\u201d she whispered. Static was her only response. \u201cHey, you reading me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to curse how obvious a trap this was when her voice died in her throat. That same noise that those elves made in the candy shop came from behind her. Gritting her teeth, she prepared herself for the attack. Barbara didn\u2019t have to wait long, a couple of the elves lunging from their hiding places and trying to slice her open. Her experience from the previous fight meant it was easy for her to dodge and counter. Before long, the elves were scattered about in varying stages of unconsciousness and she was none the worse for wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching up to try her earpiece again, she froze. Another bolt of lightning briefly illuminated the dim surroundings. Dozens if not hundreds of pairs of eyes gleamed in the burst of light, all of the locked on her. Now that she had seen them, she could make out the vague shapes of them moving around her. She was completely surrounded with elves scrambling across the ceiling and walls. At some trigger, they all dropped to the floor forming a veritable carpet of vicious candy creatures. They all paused, apparently taking delight in their prey\u2019s reaction to the sheer numbers.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>But then, just as Barbara stood her ground in a combative stance, bracing herself for the imminent horde of twisted Candy Elves to lunge at her, both she and the Elves heard a set of slow yet audible claps, along with a matriarchally feminine voice that said, \"My, my, my! It is uncommon for us to receive such reputable guests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing the voice of this unknown individual, Barbara aptly noticed how...\"obedient\" the creepy elves were, just from hearing this woman's voice alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara also noted that this woman must have some credible influence over them, as she witnessed the owner of such a voice walk out of the shadows and into the light, giving her a full view of who she assumed to be the true ringleader of this operation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, the woman wore a hybridized violet Qipao dress with an equally violet puffy short-sleeved overcoat,  which clearly displayed a physique that was equally as rotund as Batgirl's, only the woman's adipose was more allocated to her voluminous breasts, hips, and butt, thus shaping her body into a curvaceous hourglass shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer right leg was visibly exposed, which easily showed off the woman's ornate footwear, appearing as some sort of footwear only found in ancient Feudal Japan. Edo Period, to be precise. While on her left forearm, she wore some sort of black Shinobi vambrace, which bore a pair of fingernails painted a magenta hue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her head, her hair was groomed into a formal and regal top knot, kept together with a metallic gold hairband and a pair of jade ornamental sticks, along with the remains of her fiery red hair put into a pair of small braided twin-tails. And to top it off, the bangs of her hair were dyed a fluorescent pink, and spiked off to the side similar to some anime protagonists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Barbara had also noticed that this strange woman had some distinct tattoos on her right arm and leg. Going through her eidetic memory, she could easily tell that the tattoos symbolized Japanese Kanji. More specifically, the symbols on her arm translated to \"Sleep\" and \"Fat\", while the tattoo adorned on her right upper thigh stood for \"Sweets\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/vocalrvbplayer/art/Ms-Rosenthal-788886115\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.deviantart.com/vocalrvbplaye...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, Batgirl has seen a few notable weirdos during her tenure as Burnside's own caped crusader, but this curvaceous yet very unusual woman certainly ranked as one of the weirdest in her personal opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, this shady yet off-colored individual certainly ranked high enough in Barbara's <i>Weirdos List</i>. Still in a combative fighting stance, Barbara metaphorically pulled a fast one out of Nightwing's Book of Quips and smugly replied, \"Heh! And who are you supposed to be? An otaku wannabe?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* Cute. Now then, what would the illustrious Batgirl of Burnside want with this excellent establishment of mine?\" She chirped, as if she seemed unphased by Barbara's stealthy intrusion. Then again, Babs wasn't at all that this woman obviously knew who she was, considering Batgirl's increased influx in popularity on social media.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Barbara knew that despite the woman's friendly demeanor, she couldn't let her guard down for a single second, where she furrowed her brow underneath her bat cowl then firmly stated, \"...Judging from your creepy little friends, I'm guessing you're the ringleader of this operation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, pardon me! Where are my manners?\" The woman coyly retorted, as if this was a minute inconvenience. From there, as the perched Candy Elves keenly watched Batgirl's movements, the voluptuous woman gave her a formal curtsy, then promptly stood back up and continued, \"I am Ms. Himiko Rosenthal. And you, my dear...are trespassing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon introducing herself, the Candy Elves gave off these ecstatically menacing fanged grins on their caramel-colored faces, as well as making these chattering clicking and hissing noises. It was at this moment that Batgirl now realized that Rosenthal was not only complicit in these kidnappings, but the actual ringleader of this shady business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're the one responsible for all those missing girls, huh?\" Barbara firmly accused, in which Ms. Rosenthal then expressed an almost sadistic grin upon her rounded face, which was unbecoming for someone of her status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*chuckle* Well, I guess it seems that my invested operations aren't so classified anymore, now is it?\" Rosenthal smugly chirped, obviously playing coy with the redhead vigilante. And with such confirmation, Batgirl soon questioned, \"Where are you keeping Denise and the other kidnapped girls?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm afraid that's classified intel, Batgirl. Intel you won't have the privilege of viewing.\" Rosenthal answered, flat-out denying any access to what the fates of Denise and the other girls were. And with that, as she turned around to head towards the exit, Ms. Rosenthal gestured to the Candy Elves and chirped, \"...She's all yours, my spry little friends. Don't rough her up too much, for I have <i>special</i> plans for this one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with their mistress giving them the go-ahead, two Candy Elves lunged from the wall and towards Batgirl. However, due to her extensive training, she saw this coming a mile away, unleashing a meaty roundhouse kick upon two of the Elves, sending them flying into a stack of oil drums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn turn, this caused more of them to attack her at varying intervals and numbers, as the rotund Batgirl did her absolute best to fend them off, and even that wasn't enough. Despite knowing fully that she had walked into an obvious trap, she was completely cut off from you and Frankie, which obviously contributed to some sort of portable signal jammer hidden somewhere in the warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut like a horde of zombies, the diminutive Candy Elves weren't relenting their assault, and it would take a seemingly small miracle to survive in this situation. But still, she knew she had to keep fighting. To survive. To rescue Denise and the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, she learned from the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd fortunately for her, said miracle in the form of...</span></div></div>",

She was not ready for the screech that made it feel like her teeth were going to vibrate out of her head. The elves were unprepared as well; dozens of them shattering like fine glass due to the onslaught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their attention divided and their numbers slashed, it was just the chance Barbara needed. She dove in. Fists found weak points and batarangs picked off more distant targets. The elves hissed and retaliated, but it was too late. Another sonic scream came from the shadows, blasting another crowd of the elves into shards. The stragglers ran off, seemingly thinking whatever punishment they would receive for retreating must be better than continuing a losing fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne elf seemed to not care. It rushed towards where the sonic screams seemed to be coming from. Barbara drew another batarang and was ready to send it whirling through the air. She paused as the elf instead fell to a crushing axe kick that put it down in an instant. Slipping the batarang away again, Barbara turned her attention back to her earpiece, trying to get a signal through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her, a leggy blonde stepped from the shadows. She spared a quick glance around the room, making sure that no other elves or other tricks were lying in wait before stepping up to Barbara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout turning around, Barbara said, \u201cHey, Dinah,\u201d while continuing to work on her earpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Canary gave a chuckle before saying, \u201cNice to see you too, Babs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou getting jammed too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, something in here cut my signal as soon as I came in,\u201d Dinah said, holding up a phone to prove her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara was about to respond when Rosenthal chimed in again. \u201cOh dear me, that didn\u2019t go to plan. Though I wasn\u2019t expecting you have a friend backing you up Batgirl, you always struck me as more of the\u2026loner type, like the big Bat after all.\u201d She turned much more chipper as she said, \u201cAh well, it\u2019s no matter. I\u2019ll get what I want anyways.\u201d Hope the two of you have fun, especially you, you lovely blonde bombshell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Barbara found a camera tucked away. The mechanics whirred softly as the lens refocused. A snap of her wrist and a batarang buried itself in the camera, a few sparks dropping before the camera drooped and shutdown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s a real weird one,\u201d Barbara commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinah shrugged her shoulders and responded, \u201cEh, we\u2019ve dealt with a lot that were plenty crazier than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara cocked her head a bit, she wasn\u2019t wrong there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026looking good,\u201d Barbara commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, red, you too. Though I think you\u2019ve put on a bit of weight,\u201d Dinah said with a sly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara gave a little huff but grinned as well, \u201cYou\u2019re one to talk. I think you\u2019re bigger than I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Dinah replied as she tugged the sleeves of her jacket down around arms thicker than most tree trunks. She then propped her arms on hips that were each wider than her very considerable waist. \u201cEnough of your tomfoolery though, we should probably get moving. You rescuing someone too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara nodded and quick stepped up to walk beside Dinah. The pair moved off deeper into the warehouse, careful to avoid any further traps as well as Rosenthal\u2019s cameras. Around the next corner, they found the wall of a greenhouse; the walls were fogged over so they couldn\u2019t see inside. Both of the women tensed upon seeing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, you\u2019re here for Ivy too?\u201d Dinah asked as she saw the reaction in the other woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara rocked her head, \u201cKind of, I was following a trail of her that lead here, and then I saw one of my friends being brought in here as well. But come on, we should get moving before Rosenthal decides to deal with us again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Barbara slunk up to the door. The lock easily fell to her lockpick and the door swung open. Keeping a wary eye out, Barbara slipped inside, with Dinah following.</span></div></div>",

Keeping a wary eye out, Barbara slipped inside, with Dinah following suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, upon entering the greenhouse, the two rotund heroines became aware of Ivy's matronly care of her supposed <i>\"children\"</i>, as they soon noted how they appeared to be...<i>guiding</i> them to where Ivy was currently located, which was made all the more obvious by the sounds of a gluttonous mouth chomping down on various delicacies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..You hear that?\" Batgirl asked, as Dinah promptly nodded in agreement and retorted, \"-Yeah, I noticed. We must be getting close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as they got closer to the source of the loud munching, the plants physically shifted themselves to allow Barbara and Dinah passage, as if to guide them to what would be their intended destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what they stumbled upon was something rather unprecedented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they cleared out of the shifting branches and foliage, they were confronted by none other than Poison Ivy, only...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh..My...God.\" Was all that the rotund Batgirl could simply utter, becoming rather shocked by what had become of the green-skinned Poison Ivy. Or rather, how many pounds she's packed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, Ivy appeared to have doubled in weight and girth, according to Barbs' mental estimations. Her floral red hair had grown an extra foot in length, but that was minuscule compared to Ivy's increased enormity. If Barbara had to describe Ivy's current body shape in a single word, it would be <i>\"blobbish\"</i>, as Ivy's legs were now considerably thick enough to hide you on one side, as her elephantine legs splayed off to the sides to compensate undoubtedly the plant woman's largest body part; Her stomach, which looked massive enough to hold Barbara inside, while also making Ivy's green plant-like veins much thicker and more noticeable at first glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts had tripled in size, trying to keep up with her now enormous buttocks and monstrous abdomen in both size and volume. Due to to her even more enlarged broadsides, this forced her now pillowy fat-laden arms to lay off to the sides, as they struggled to lift up some of the calorie-rich food to her now gluttonous maw to satiate her uncontrollable hunger, as her enchanting face and head weren't spared from the surge of obesity that now all encompassed her once lithe physique, as Ivy now bore a pair of cartoonishly bloated cheeks and a total of 3 thick extra chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Barbara and Dinah had to wager a guess, they would assume that she was most likely on the cusp of immobility, with Ivy's weight dangerously reaching the 1,000 pound mark, as they witnessed Ivy forcibly shoving what appeared to be a triple-deluxe Glutton Burger from Big Belly Burger down her throat, which the real Ivy would be absolutely disgusted at eating such a grease-filled cuisine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus. She's huge.\" Dinah muttered under her breath, equally shocked as well upon seeing the human-plant hybrid in her current  yet absurdly corpulent state. However, the duo's words did not fall on deaf ears, as Ivy forcibly swallowed what remained of the Glutton Burger, letting out a rather unladylike burp in response, looking back at them with a pair of squinting glowing green eyes and slovenly answered, \"*huff* I can *huff* still hear *huff* quite clearly *huff* *huff*, Canary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey can easily tell that Ivy was experiencing trouble fully talking without sounding completely exasperated due to all of that accumulated body fat on her now elephantine form. From there, Batgirl slowly approached the seemingly immobile Ivy, obviously to show she wasn't hostile to her, while she spoke up and explained, \"Ivy, we came here to rescue you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. *huff* *huff* Harley *huff* contacted me *huff* about it *huff* *huff* in secret.\" Ivy elaborated, which left both heroines flabbergasted. Dinah being shocked that Harley wanted Batgirl to rescue Ivy, while Batgirl was surprised to hear that Ivy was already aware of this rescue attempt. Still a little in shock, Batgirl soon stammered, \"B-But how did--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--I know *huff* about what you're *huff* doing? *huff* *huff* I gave Harleen *huff* one of my *huff*<i> Adeptus Communticatum Rosali </i>*huff* *huff* before I was *huff* captured by *huff* that perverted *huff* *huff* meatbag of a *huff* woman.\" Ivy elaborated, explaining between exasperated huffs and puffs. Suffice to say, she was undoubtedly WAY too out of shape to get up under her own volition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Can you get up on your own?\" Batgirl asked, easily noticing Ivy's heft, as Ivy then slowly shook her head in response and said, \"I'm afraid *huff* not. *huff* I've been *huff* stripped *huff* of my ability *huff* *huff* to walk for *huff* a few days *huff* now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit. How are we gonna move her out of here now?\" Dinah queried, putting her fingerless gloved hands upon her bulbous fishnet-covered hips. They were definitely in quite a pickle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, upon quickly looking around the greenhouse and anything nearby, Batgirl soon displayed a cathartic grin on her plump face, where she discovered... </span></div></div>",

The smile was short lived though, as she saw a few glittering eyes peaking around the vehicles. The chittering sound bounced around the space as well, even from above and behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stifled a curse; this wasn\u2019t the time to be losing her head. Then looking back over her shoulder, she called, \u201cHey, Dinah, come over here.\u201d Once the blonde started over, Barbara said softly, \u201cOur \u2018friends\u2019 are back. Looks like not all of them got the message.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre they doing anything?\u201d Dinah asked, peeking out the door as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara shook her head. \u201cNo, nothing yet. They\u2019re just hanging around out there, keeping an eye on us.\u201d And then she added with a bit of agitation, \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean that won\u2019t change though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinah nodded and rubbed her chubby chin. \u201cYou\u2019re not wrong there. Got a plan, Red?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara scowled. She could feel it slipping away. Her original plan hadn\u2019t counted on Denise and who knows who else being here. Nor had she been counting on the sheer numbers of foes standing in her way. There seemed to be no end to them and often kept throwing themselves at their targets with no self concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026think we\u2019re going to need to split up,\u201d she responded after a bit with more than a little hesitation and doubt evident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinah arched her brow. \u201cSure that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve got a choice. Rosenthal might already be ready to pull out. She probably even sent those little freaks to keep us busy while she works on something else, and I have to see if I can find Denise. Might find someone else that needs to be rescued as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the idea, but you\u2019re not wrong either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you can take care of the elves, but think you can get Ivy loaded up?\u201d Barbara asked, pointing to the truck and forklift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow hard could it be?\u201d Dinah responded with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara did her best to return the grin, hoping her doubts and worry weren\u2019t showing through. They shared quick thumbs up and the blonde gave her a friendly pat on the shoulder before Barbara ran off. She dodged past several of the elves and smashed several others around. Behind her, a sonic cry ripped through some of the encroaching elves. The shockwave shook the lighting above and knocked dust loose. Barbara couldn\u2019t help but let a grin cross her face as she heard a number of the elves shatter like yet more glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore elves tried to stop her, but they weren\u2019t successful in even slowing her down. Her steps did falter as her earpiece gave a static filled screech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2013amn it, keep trying! Try something else!\u201d she heard your voice at last. Covered in part by static, another familiar voice was welcome in any case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you guys got it, a bit at least. I can hear you,\u201d she said as she resumed her run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! Score another win for the tech-wizard!\u201d Frankie shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow have things been going since we lost contact?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBusy,\u201d Barbara replied with a grunt as she slammed one elf into another. \u201cSome weirdo named Rosenthal knew I was coming and set up a trap.\u201d Before you could express any concern over that, she continued, \u201cBlack Canary happened to show up though and get me out. We found Ivy. She\u2019s even bigger than Denise was though, so that\u2019s an issue. Dinah\u2019s trying to take care of that\u2026\u201d Almost as if on cue another sonic cry reverberated through the metal structure. \u201c\u2026and I\u2019ve split off to try to find Denise. You got anything to help with that, Frankie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026hold one,\u201d Frankie said as she returned to furiously tapping on her keyboards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, no rush,\u201d Barbara said with sarcasm dripping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheck out the North end of the warehouse, I think there\u2019s a lot of activity going on there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, heading there now,\u201d her mind whirling with what layout of the warehouse she had been able to figure out, and her course adjusting to suit. A few more turns, and Barbara ended up in an enclosed walkway overlooking a loading dock. More elves were scurrying about, loading up several waiting trucks. Barbara let out a growl as she saw Rosenthal overseeing the work. A smile spread across the strange woman\u2019s face suddenly, and then she looked up at the walkway and Barbara. Rosenthal gave a little wave before shouting something to the elves and hopping into one of the truck\u2019s cabs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bars across the window meant that she couldn\u2019t go out that way. She had to find another way around, and do it now. Before she could though, the trucks started to pull out. Rosenthal stuck her arm out the window and gave another wave, laughing the whole way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrankie! Track the trucks leaving now!\u201d Barbara snapped, running off to find some access down to the lower floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, on it!\u201d the tech-head responded. \u201cUh, wait, what trucks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018what trucks\u2019? The trucks pulling out of the North end of the warehouse. The elves and their leader loaded up at least three trucks and they\u2019re pulling out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not seeing any trucks here, Barbara. Everything around the warehouse is totally clear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d Barbara shouted as she rounded another corner and bounded down a staircase to the loading dock. The place was empty and there was no sign of any trucks outside the doors. \u201cThey were right here\u2026\u201d she said as she ran out the doors to confirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I can see you now or\u2026at least I think that\u2019s you. No, yeah, that\u2019s you. But no trucks\u2026not anywhere around here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not seeing anything on the screens, honey,\" you confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH\u2026how\u2026?\u201d was all Barbara could manage.</span></div></div>",

It's Batgirl. You got my ride ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>== 2 Minutes Later... ==</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as she was being transported in the front transport truck, Ms. Rosenthal sat in the passenger seat of the truck cab, whilst three Candy Elves were preoccupied with driving the large vehicle, due to their diminutive size and height. One drove with the steering wheel, the second handled the gear shift, and the third controlled the gas and brake pedals. Eerily enough, Rosenthal chuckled to herself with an almost euphoric grin on her rounded face as she chortled to herself, \"Ohohohoho~ I must admit, Batgirl, you certainly are quite the fascinating individual. *sigh* But sadly for moi, I have places to be, business to conduct.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, Rosenthal seemed to have a keen eye on the finer fetish-related things in life. However,it also seemingly blinded her to an obvious truth, as Batgirl stealthily approached behind the small convoy of transport trucks via the Bat-Cycle she was given, courtesy of Qadir. Though, it had to be slightly reinforced to adequately compensate for Barbara's quarter-ton physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact she was about to break approximately several motorcycle and big rig laws for what she was about to commit, it was not a priority at the moment, as she soon revved up the motorcycle's throttle some to get closer to the rear of the truck. And then, with a flick of the wrist, Batgirl flung a small but powerful magnetic Bat-Tracer towards the bottom of the truck trailer, where the device's magnet soon turned on and clamped itself on the bottom of the trailer with a light metallic *THUNK!* in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I got you now, pervert.\"</i> Batgirl smugly thought, a cathartic grin appearing on her plump lips, swiftly pulling off a 180 degree drift, as she then heard Black Canary over her earpiece as the buxom blonde quipped, <i>\"Hey, Red! I've already got Ivy in the truck, and we're just out of that weird shithole. Where are you?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* That's good to hear, Dinah. Unfortunately, Rosenthal escaped in three cargo trucks, but I managed to put a Bat-Tracer on one of them before they got away.\" Batgirl replied, relieved to hear such good news, where Black Canary soon retorted, <i>\"Well, shit. *sigh* Still, at least we'll know where that crazy fatass and her Christmas special rejects are heading next.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, Barbara couldn't help but chuckle a little at such a snide remark from her friend, just as she drifted around the corner of an adjacent intersection, using her rotund girth as a counterweight to make such a sharp turn. However,despite such witty banter between the two, Dinah soon spoke to Batgirl with an ounce of seriousness in her tone and asked, <i>\"So...Care to tell me why we just rescued Big Green here, Red?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there it was. The big question. Exhaling a deep sigh, Barbara knew that eventually she would have to confess the true reason for rescuing the now immobile Poison Ivy. She just wished it was after the case was closed. So, in response, Barbara soon spoke into her earpiece and explained, \"*sigh* I'll explain it to you when we drop off Ivy in a more secure location, Dinah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I take it that the supposed \"secure location\" would be the new Birds of Prey safehouse we just set up here in Burnside, right?\"</i> Black Canary questioned, in which Batgirl soon replied, \"...Exactly. Think you can get her in the elevator?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"--Just as long as she doesn't weigh over two and a half tons, then yeah. What will you be doing in the meantime, Bats?\"</i> She quipped, where Batgirl soon exhaled another deep sigh and elaborated, \"...Let's just say I've got a skeleton in my closet that I've gotta confess to my girlfriend and Frankie. We'll meet you there ASAP.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Fair enough, I suppose. I'll see you at the rendezvous, Barb.\"</i> Dinah stated, thus ending the conversation while she drove the truck towards the Birds of Prey safehouse in Burnside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, whilst she made her way toward the safehouse, Batgirl soon called you and Frankie on her comms and said, \"Hey, girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Babs! *sigh* Do you have any idea how worried I was?!\"</i> You exclaimed, attempting not to sound too angry towards the rotund redhead vigilante. Suffice to say, Babs understood your predicament, bearing a loving curve of her plump lips on her chubby face and replied, \"Sorry for making you so worried, sweetie.

You tried picking through your memories of the few comics you had read to try to figure out why Barbara was willing to work with someone like Harley, but came up blank. You shook your head; you weren\u2019t going to find out waiting here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rain was still battering everything in sight, so you turned around and grabbed a coat before slogging out into the storm. Shaking clinging drops off, you grabbed your phone. You could have asked Frankie for the directions to the clock tower, but that would have gotten you too many questions. Fortunately, a quick internet search and you had it. Flicking the wipers on high, you pulled out, a sense of unease settling in the pit of your stomach.</span></div></div>",

And yet, speaking of the human-plant hybrid, you noticed how Barbara didn't exactly go into detail as to how big Ivy was now, as you mentally contemplated, <i>\"...Babs didn't exactly say how big Ivy was now.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...Though, I've got a feeling that I'll find out soon enough.\"</i> You noted, calmly closing the driver side door with a gentle yet briefly audible *Clunk!* behind you, quickly fast-walking to the rear entrance of the building, which led to a private service elevator leading up to the main <i>safehouse area</i> where Black Canary, Poison Ivy, Batgirl, Frankie, and yourself would rendezvous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from your prior knowledge of anything related to a Clock Tower hideout was in the video game, Batman: Arkham Knight, and yet, there were a few key differences, aside from the private industrial-sized service elevator, of course. From there, as if from mere memory, you instinctively entered the elevator, pressing the number five on the elevator keypad, then the number one, the number four, and finally the number three button, as if inputting a numbered passcode. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the button keypad soon displayed a lit up LED Bat Symbol on the keypad, as it then promptly spoke with an animatronic female voice and said, \"Access Granted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, the elevator doors automatically closed themselves, as the elevator then began to slowly but progressively ascended up the elevator shaft. Whilst the elevator ascended, you soon got a text on your smartphone, to which you promptly pulled it out to examine the text message. Fortunately, it was from Barbara, which read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Okay, we seem to be in the clear for now. Heading to rendezvous now. Be there in a minute!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"*sigh* Well... At least things haven't gotten TOO out of hand. Hopefully, we can stop that freaky Rosenthal woman,\"</i> You thought, feeling rather relieved that your stomach's instinctive pessimism was proven incorrect, as the elevator finally reached the intended floor of the Clock Tower, where it came to a full stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, the elevator doors opened, then the secret Clock Tower entrance opened, which was hidden behind an extensive bookcase attached to a metal sheet with many moving mechanical components, as the secret door opened in a similar manner to the reinforced doors in Arkham Asylum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the secret doors opened to allow you entrance, you finally got a good long glimpse of the now corpulently immobile Poison Ivy. And much to your surprise, she was MUCH fatter than you thought she'd be. However, your eyes weren't the only ones to notice this, as you soon heard the bulbous Ivy speak to you with a now somewhat husker voice due to the accumulated fat on her neck and face whilst she sarcastically quipped, \"...Like what you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Um...S-Sorry for that. I just, um...n-never seen someone as big as you, that's all.\" You stammered, as you slowly walked into the main interior of the safehouse. Shortly after your retort, you soon heard Black Canary's voice, which indicated that she was on Ivy's left side, out of your sight for now, where she chuckled, \"*chuckle* You got that right, girl!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you soon saw Black Canary come into view, whose larger hips wobbled from left to right in a sashaying motion as she approached you. And then, much to your internal surprise, Black Canary wrapped her meaty arms around you in an almost familial hug of sorts, as if you and her had some history, where she then promptly yet jokingly quipped, \"Long time no see, Doc! How's Bats been treating you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to your surprise, you seemed almost at ease with Black Canary, akin to speaking with an old friend from High School, given your <i>\"supposed history\"</i> with Batgirl in this world, where you automatically eased up a little as Black Canary severed the embrace, placing her fingerless gloved hands upon her burgeoning hips whilst you replied, \"...She's been treating me quite well, Canary. I just got a text from her while on the elevator, said she'll be here very soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear that, Doc! And speaking of which, I got you an old patient of yours, right here!\" Canary chortled, where she gave one of Ivy's now gargantuan buttcheeks a hefty slap, which not just caused the excessively huge buttcheek to jiggle and ripple wildly in physical response, but also elicit a greatly embarrassed expression on Ivy's bulbous fatty cheeks, bearing a pinkish hue to such green skin.</span></div></div>",

That increasingly familiar twinge came at the back of your head and you moved over to a nearby cabinet on instinct. Inside laid and hung a number of medical devices, both ordinary and extraordinary. Picking up one that looked a bit like an iPad with a rugged case and a much sophisticated camera system, you turned back to the mountainous green woman and the \u2013 relatively \u2013 smaller blonde beside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth moved before you could think. \u201cJust going to take a quick scan first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fingers danced on the screen before you pointed the camera towards Ivy. A blue light lanced out, painting a large square of crisscrossing lines on her side. You moved around her, waving the pad up and down to cover each portion of her in turn. Data streamed across the screen as you watched, collecting together and building a profile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinah turned to glance at a screen on the wall. You peeked over yourself and saw it showed an interior view, a large bike, and an even larger woman astride it. You couldn\u2019t mistake Barbara sitting there, and even with her helmet, you could tell that she was psyching herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoc here will take good care of you, Green, like before. I\u2019ll be back shortly.\u201d Dinah didn\u2019t wait for a response before taking off through another door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned your attention back to the screen in your hand. According to what you saw there, Ivy was in perfect health for a human-plant hybrid. That shouldn\u2019t have been possible at her size and weight, but the fact that she was absolutely still alive and relatively still well was a testament that contradicted that impossibility. You expressed your amazement to Ivy, though with far more tact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt did seem that shrew Rosenthal and her annoying little helpers did not want to harm me. When they took me from\u2026\u201d she hesitated before giving a sigh and a shrug that hefted her elephantine shoulders. \u201cThey took me from Harley. It seemed more like they needed me for something. I think that\u2019s why they had that greenhouse set up for me: to keep me somewhat happy as they did\u2026<i>this</i>.\u201d Her wands wiggled upon her flanks, a motion hinting at her bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brow furrowed a bit. \u201cHarley\u201d, could she be referring to Harleen Quinzel, aka Harley Quinn, the partner to the big clown himself, whenever she hadn\u2019t broken away from him for one reason or another? There had been hints and outright statements that something may have been between Harley and Ivy in their various versions. It seemed that this wrld might have been one where it had been fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered, <i>Could that have something to do with\u2014</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were sidetracked by Dinah coming back, grumbling \u201cYou could have told me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her came Barbara, looking warn out but also pleased with even this partial victory. Upon seeing you standing in the room, she took a quick step towards you. She then held back, folding in on herself a bit. You opening your arms towards her broke her hesitation. She rushed forward, enveloping you in a pillowy hug pickled with the sweat from her recent exertions. You wouldn\u2019t have traded it for anything even still.</span></div></div>",

Its been eating me up inside a little after we made that oath to each other.\" Barbara confessed, returning the embrace as well. Although you felt rather sore about her keeping you in the dark with such an important issue, you voluntarily forgave her as you held her gloved hands in your own and replied, \"Bats...It's alright. I forgive you. I mean, it's a small price for what we're doing here and now, y'know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*relieved sigh* That's...That's good to hear. Thank you, sweetie.\" Barbara answered, planting a brief but loving kiss upon your lips, grateful for your forgiveness, to which Dinah abruptly interrupted the two of you via lightly patting Barbara's ballooned posterior and quipped, \"Hate to ruin the moment, lovebirds,  but we still have the issue of a Half-Ton Ivy at present.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for the obvious, Dinah.\" Ivy dryly quipped, not exactly amused with the Black Canary's nonchalant jab at her current weight, rolling her green eyes in the process, just as a small burp escaped Ivy's plump lips, causing a greatly embarrassed blush to emerge on her fatter cheeks. Suffice to say, this wasn't what she would call \"a shining moment\" in her crusade to protect Nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRefocused on the current disposition at hand, you swiped at a few buttons on the touch pad, which soon brought up a half-sized digital model of the now elephantine Ivy, to which Barbara looked at you and asked, \"So...What are we looking at here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, according to the scans I've performed on our <i>guest</i>, she appears to be in a clean bill of health, despite the many contradictions to what we're suspecting of this level of obesity.\" You automatically explained, to which your thoughts noted, <i>\"...Okay, this'll take some getting used to.\"</i> Of course, as Dinah placed her chubby biker gloved hands upon her burgeoning fishnet-covered hips in an almost quizzical nature, she bluntly questioned, \"...Okay, so she's healthy. What's the problem?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--I. Can't. Walk. Anymore.\" Ivy flatly interjected, to which she proved such a claim by attempting to stand up, only for her elephantine girth acting akin to a truck-sized anchor, thus pinning her to the floor in green-skinned adipose, which sent violent ripples across the human-plant hybrid's massively bloated form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Ivy. You made your point.\" Barbara replied, her tone in an accepting manner to calm the now immobile Poison Ivy. From there, you continued despite the interjections and elaborated, \"...Anyway, moving on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a few more touches on the tablet, a set of numbers appeared alongside the digital model of Ivy, showing her blood pressure, heartbeat, and current weight. Frankie approached the group and immediately noticed the statistics, quickly making a sarcastic jab and jested, \"Heh! Wow. One thousand five-hundred and eighty-two pounds. Damn, Red. You <i>REALLY</i> let yourself go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, Frankie.\" Barbara jeered, quelling Frankie's verbal roasting of Ivy, to which the hybrid huffed and rolled her eyes in response. From there, Dinah turned her hefty self towards the equally rotund Batgirl of Burnside, hands on her wide hips and asked, \"So...I take it there's a reason why the Clown Princess of Crime sent you after Red here, Bats?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* I figured that'd come to light sooner or later. Fine, I'll explain this conundrum as promised.\" Barbara admitted, to which she then exhaled a deep breath and began to explain, \"...It all started almost two weeks ago. I just finished up on taking down another one of Riot Black's schemes that night, and was heading back to the apartment until--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--Let me guess: Harley tackled you midair?\" Dinah interjected, getting a bit of a chuckle out of such a statement, which brought a small blush upon Barbara's plump cheeks as she then answered, \"Pretty much, Dinah.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...Why would Harley Quinn want your help anyway, Babs? I mean, doesn't she have some friends of her own to do that?\" You asked, to which Ivy soon interjected into the conversation and elaborated, \"--That's because Harleen has...<i>ended</i> her relationship with the Joker. It was pretty much what every criminal in Gotham was talking about when it happened. In fact, she now lives in Coney Island last time I checked.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well...that explains a lot.\" You stated, being legitimately surprised that Harley was able to cut ties with the famed Clown Prince of Crime, especially given their history, albeit an abusive relationship. But then, another question popped into your head, as you looked at Ivy and questioned, \"...If that's the case, then why did Harley ask for Batgirl's help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* ...To be honest, human...It's partially my fault. Three weeks ago, I was contacted by Rosenthal due to her interest in my work as a botanist, At first, I thought it was something minute. Oh, how naive I was in such a moment of weakness...\" She mused, doing her best to flex her fattened arms, hands, and fingers, which now seemed practically useless at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting two and two together, Barbara soon came to the conclusion as to what happened next, as she then answered, \"I see now... Rosenthal kidnapped you, didn't she?\" In response, the elephantine Ivy nodded once in confirmation, her fattened head and face smooshing against her plumped up collarbone area, then continued, \"Unsurprisingly, she wasn't interested in my research, of course. But rather, she was far more intrigued by....<i>something else</i> that I possess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--Wait a minute; I think I know what she's referring to!\" You calmly exclaimed, to which you quickly sifted through the statistical analytics shown on the touch pad, until you stopped at a single dubious heads-up display. Then, you presented it to Barbara and automatically said, \"Take a look at what's in her chlorophyll levels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Barbara didn't see much, but then her trained eyes instantly caught something that stood out. \"Holy... No wonder why Ivy appears so lethargic. These Melatonin levels are too high!\" She stated, as she then noticed something else as well and continued, \"...There's also something else in her systems as well, some sort of...isotope?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--That's...what she has been pumping me full of for the past few weeks, Miss Gordon.\" Ivy begrudgingly answered, formally calling Barbara by her last name, obviously hinting that she's already aware of Batgirl's real identity. From there, as she then displayed an ashamed expression upon her bloated face, she reluctantly continued, \"She calls it her... <i>\"Nebutori Filling\"</i>. *shudders*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from how Ivy was reacting, you can clearly see she didn't exactly enjoy what Rosenthal had pumped into her systems, as Dinah lumbered over to the immobile Ivy to console her, while you, Barbara, and Frankie looked at one another, as Frankie then spoke up first and queried, \"...Any of you got that feeling that Rosenthal is just a big fat weeaboo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and me both, Frankie. Still, this is going to be troublesome to explain to Harley how Ivy got so...<i>fat</i>.\" Barbara retorted, to which got you a bit curious, as you interjected, \"Yeah... But still, weird how Rosenthal called it her Nebutori Filling, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name): A Nebutori is related to an odd superstition in ancient Japan where if a woman goes to sleep after eating, they would become incredibly fat and lethargic. My guess is that Rosenthal based this <i>filling</i> of her's on the Japanese myth of the same name, if the high levels of Melatonin pumping through Ivy's veins are anything to go by.\" Barbara elaborated, putting a plump contemplative hand against her chin and double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the more you thought about it, the more it almost made sense. After all, Rosenthal seemed to bear a very strong Japanese motif to her overall appearance when she made herself known, even though she barely looked Asian. Overall, you figured that things were probably gonna get weirder from here on out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You gave a through stretch as you entered your home. It had been a late night at the restaurant, but not a bad one. As the sous-chef it was your job to make sure that all the kitchen equipment was in good order. Everything had been in order and no real problems had occurred, so the really only thing to do was give everything a through scrubbing and cleaning. After that, you had made sure that all everyone\u2019s work schedules were in order for the next month. Requests for certain days off, employees swapping shifts, making sure that everyone got suitable hours, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything just had to be straight and in line as you would be on vacation for the next month. You wouldn't be on call if something went wrong. But, you had faith in the kitchen staff. They were good and you personally trained each one. There was little to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yawned as you removed your jacket and carefully hung it up. Your gaze turned to the clock. 2:54 am. Oh, yes, it was time for bed. Just because you were used to the late nights didn\u2019t mean you liked it. So the moment that you got your clothes off, you dived into your nice bed, ready to let the exhaustion of the day take you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before you drifted off, your eyes popped open. You sat up and turned off your alarm clock with a tired smile. You wouldn\u2019t need that for some time. You let your eyelids droop down and before you knew, you were enjoying blissful slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you awoke the next morning, you could feel that something was off, even before you opened your eyes. It wasn\u2019t bad, mind, but it was still different than what you had become accustomed to. You felt warmer, more cozy. That...that wasn\u2019t right. You had a good bed but it certainly didn\u2019t feel like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou forced your eyes open rather easily. All the times you had to wake up early to go to work over the years had given you plenty of practice in forcing yourself awake when needed. The small bit of alarm that you felt didn\u2019t help either. Eyes open and your awareness expanding with your waking, you saw the source of the change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...a woman. Not just any woman. An absolute mountain of a woman, easily one the biggest living  things you\u2019d had ever seen. She easily dwarfed you in size and mass, many times of over. She was so large that she had easily dominated the bed space. In fact, you weren\u2019t lying on the bed, you were lying on her! Her vast belly acted as your mattress. It was easily larger than you were and it was easy to see how you could have slept on it. Her breasts were the size of exercise balls and one even served as your pillow. Her thighs were monstrous, like literal pillars of soft adipose. Her butt was large enough to be a couch and would have decimated a car is she had sat on it. All of this was topped by a rounded face with a quadruple chin. Her complexion was a healthy shade of pink and she had black hair that just passed her shoulder blades. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked once. Twice. Thrice. Your brain shut down, unable to process the fact that a woman who was several times larger than a wrecking ball was in your home, laying in bed with you. It felt like hours before your brain kick started itself into action. Who was she? What was she doing in your house? In your bed?! She certainly wasn\u2019t there last night when you went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs these questions assaulted you, a memory jogged. She looked familiar. You had seen her before. In comics. In your favorite, Superman. This...human mountain was Lois Lane! But that was impossible. It didn\u2019t make a lick of sense but then again, none of this made sense. You gently shook your head, as if that would clear it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do with the crazy situation?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sun\u2019s rays peeking through the blinds in your apartment stirs you awake. You blink blearily as consciousness slowly comes back to you. As your eyes adjust, you begin to notice that something feels very strange. This isn\u2019t the bed you fell asleep in last night, nor is this even your apartment. You start to wonder what was in those drinks last night. Well, what happened, happened, you admit. Time to face the consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You roll over to get an idea of where you may have ended up, or at the very least, who you just had a regretful night of drunken escapades with. Your eyes widen with surprise as you see the sleeping form lying next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019s beautiful, to be sure. Her pleasant face has all the soft and attractive features of a goddess, you think. Her golden locks cascade over her eyes as she snoozes softly. It\u2019s her size that takes you by surprise. The gargantuan woman laying beside you has to be at least five-hundred pounds, if not more. Her thighs have to be about as wide as a single, much thinner girl, each. The curve of her rump peaks higher under the covers than you ever thought anyone\u2019s could. You can see the hint of her flabby gut, which spills over her hip-line like rising dough. Most dominating of all is her impressive rack, which looks like it would burst out of her nightshirt if she so much as hiccupped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she carries the weight well, and despite her size, she still has a curvy, feminine form. You\u2019re not going to lie to yourself: this may not be the kind of girl you\u2019re used to, but she is still pretty hot for a girl her size. Though, you do have to wonder just how mobile she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to be hanging around much longer. Your plan is to get up, throw your clothes on as quickly and quietly as possible, and get your walk of shame over with before anyone sees you leave. However, as you stand up, you are curious about the apartment you\u2019re in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s nothing fancy, but it\u2019s certainly no dump either. For someone who looks too big to make a simple walk from the bed to the couch, this girl certainly has kept a tidy place, not at all what you were expecting. You were kind of expecting the place to be littered with to-go boxes and containers, but then you realize what a total slimeball you sound like for assuming that just because the girl\u2019s huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stride over to the window and gasp with surprise. When the fuck did you go to Japan? Gazing at the city skyline, you realize that you\u2019re somehow in Tokyo. It\u2019s starting to occur to you that this isn\u2019t just a matter of having one too many drinks. Something seriously messed up is going on here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgetting about your quick escape, you decide to explore some more, hoping to find some clue as to what happened. Nothing looks familiar, and you still have no clue how you ended up here. You decide to head to the living room, hoping to find more clues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find one, but it\u2019s certainly something you\u2019re not expecting. There on one of the end tables by the couch is a photograph, and it\u2019s a picture of you and the girl in the bed. You two look so happy, and so close as if you\u2019ve been dating her for months. In fact, the more you look around the apartment, the more you realize you have been dating her for months. You\u2019ve practically moved in with her\u2026or maybe she moved in with you. It\u2019s hard to tell when you suddenly wake up with a different life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re not sure what kind of Twilight Zone shit this is, but you don\u2019t want to stick around to find out any more. You start heading back to the bedroom to grab your clothes and go look for help. That\u2019s when you notice something off about the bookshelf in the corner, by the kitchen. It looks like there\u2019s a bit of a gap between the wall and the bookshelf, and if you\u2019re not mistaken, it looks like a passageway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath. This already got weird from the minute you woke up. What\u2019s another surprise? You creep over to the shelf and start to push on the side of it, hoping to move it out of the way to get to the entrance. Of course, that doesn\u2019t work. Thing\u2019s practically bolted to the floor. You\u2019ve read enough comic books and seen enough cheesy horror movies to know there has to be a trigger somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through the shelf, you start to get an idea of what sort of tastes this girl has. There are all kinds of stuff on aliens, UFO\u2019s, and IT books galore. Great, this one\u2019s a total nutjob, you think. Still, you find what you\u2019re looking for: some gooey romance novel that clearly doesn\u2019t belong with the rest of the collection. You pull it out, and the bookshelf swings back, revealing the passage behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, it\u2019s not much of a passage. It\u2019s just a storage room for hidden necessities. It\u2019s what you see inside this storage closet that makes you realize you\u2019re clearly not in Kansas anymore.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You feel like your jaw could just drop to the floor. In the secret closet is a white superhero suit. It's practically a one-piece bathing suit with an extremely revealing cut for the bust. A short red cape hangs from the back, and it's completed with blue gloves and boots. Suddenly, you remember where you've seen this before. This is the uniform of Power Girl, cousin of Superman, and all around kick-ass superhero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there's something wrong. The suit is clearly made for a woman of a larger size as it is stretched over an overweight mannequin. This certainly makes the bust cut look even more revealing, but it's clearly let out for someone with a larger gut, and the bottom is little more than a glorified thong. Of course, you realize that this is meant to be worn by the girl sleeping back in that bedroom, but she couldn't be Power Girl, not by a long shot. She just has to be one of those overweight fangirls who wears the suit to comic cons or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind soon changes on that opinion though, as you turn around and see the enormous girl from earlier hovering over towards you, wearing nothing but a lacy red bra and panties that stretch and barely cover her large form, a sleepy smile on her face. Wait...she's hovering! Well, that explains how she's able to still get around at her size, but still...hovering? That means she has to be Power Girl. There's no other explanation for it. No one else would have that Kryptonian ability for flight, or that kind of strength to lift such an incredible bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch her enormous gut sway and bob as her body hovers closer to you. It presses against your chest, as she wraps her arms around your shoulders and kisses your cheek. \"Morning, sweetie,\" she says in a sleepy voice. \"What are you doing up so early?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon kissing you, a few of your memories start to come back. No, wait. They're not <i>your</i> memories, not really. They're memories that go with this reality you've woken up to. You've been dating Power Girl for a little over a year now. You met when she saved you from a building being destroyed by Reactron. You got a rare opportunity to thank her in person, and thankfully, you hit it off better than could ever have been expected, especially since Power Girl wasn't known for having a major social life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...I was...\" you stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks behind you and notices the super suit. \"Oh, god, not that again,\" she says. \"I've already told you, I'm not wearing that one to bed. It's my only suit, and I have to keep it in good condition.\" Her voice softens to that seductive purr. \"I don't think it could take all the stuff we do in bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh nervously, not exactly sure what to say. You only just now remembered you were dating. Still, she keeps the conversation going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's for breakfast? I'm starving. You definitely gave me a workout last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a sec,\" you say, rushing into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not exactly sure what you're supposed to do. This feels so weird right now, and still not sure how you got here. You try to see if more memories can come back to you, but that's failing. You can only remember the basics. Her secret identity is Karen Star (good information, you suppose for when you two go on dates out and about town in front of citizens), she's Superman's cousin, so she basically has all of his powers, she can be a bit of a cold hard-ass sometimes. But, this is all information any idiot with an interest in comic books could get. You're not getting any information that can tell you more about your relationship with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, one memory does come back, and you start to realize that memories only come back to you when they're relevant to the situation. You remember what sorts of things she likes to eat, and your mind starts to spin as you realize what an appetite she's got. Though, you're still not sure how she went from a rail-thin, busty superhero to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug and start to get to work in the kitchen. Funny, you never were much of a cook back in your old life. Hell, you had a gift for burning water. But, who knows, maybe your relationship with this enormous girl gave you more experience. You whip up an incredible breakfast in a pretty short time: a stack of buttery pancakes drenched in syrup, eggs over-easy, extra crispy bacon, thick, juicy sausages, toast, buttered on both sides with plenty of jelly and jam, and diced potatoes with extra ketchup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bring out the meal just as you see her settled down on the couch, tapping away at the computer. \"Whatcha doing?\" you ask casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grunts, but then eventually replies, \"Just answering a few emails. This is probably the best part of getting to work from home: I can work when I want, wearing whatever I want. I'll just be a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah, well, I'm just going to pop into the shower while you do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set the food down, and leave her to her work while you sneak off to the bathroom. <i>This is insane,</i> you keep telling yourself, <i>or am I the one who's insane?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou splash some water on your face and look at yourself in the mirror.</span></div></div>",

No, you\u2019re still just plain old you, which is a good thing, all things considered. You look carefully at the slight five o\u2019clock shadow on your chin. It\u2019s been a day or so since you\u2019ve shaved, you figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cleaning up, you decide to return out into the living room.

Maybe some more false memories will come back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look out into the living room and still see Power Girl\u2026er, Karen, you must keep reminding yourself, still sitting on the couch working. To her, nothing is out of place about this scenario. In her mind, you\u2019ve been dating for several months now. You cautiously approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what were you thinking of doing today?\u201d you ask casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you curiously as if you're a complete idiot. \"Same as always,\" she says with a shrug, \"just stay here and hang out. You know I don't really like going out, not when I have to do that every day fighting crime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh nervously. \"Oh, yeah, forgot. Probably just want to unwind and all after all that.\" In your mind, you have a hard time imagining someone her size still being able to fly around beating up bad guys, and unfortunately, you don't really have all that much of a filter. \"So, you're still into the superheroing thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sick or something?\" she asks. \"What do you mean you forgot? You've always known...oh, I get what this is about.\" She purses her lips and then tersely responds, \"Look, we've been over this. I told you, I'd be working practically up to my due date. Everything's fine. I'm Kryptonian for god's sake. The babies will be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head, not realizing what she just said. So, she didn't catch on that you really had no clue where you were or what was going on. But then, your mind throws on the brakes. \"Babies?\" you sputter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives you another look. Karen was never one for beating around the bush or playing stupid games like this. But, she still hasn't caught on. \"I thought I told you yesterday after I had my appointment that they found out I'm having twins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to feel light-headed. This is all moving so quickly. Not only are you dating Power Girl; she's having your children! \"Um, wait...\" you start to say, trying to process it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolls her eyes, hefts herself up from the couch, and goes to kiss you on the cheek. \"You really are a moron sometimes,\" she says, \"but I guess you're my moron. You really don't have to be so worried about this. I mean, yeah, it's two kids instead of just the one like we planned, but I think we can make it work. We'll just have to maybe make a little more space in the nursery, get a few more things...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you say, \"yeah, I'm just...I guess this is starting to become real for me. You're sure you're going to be okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughs. \"Kryptonians are pretty durable, and plus, these kids are going to be half me. I think they can handle a little strain. Comes with the job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddles back to the couch and sits down. \"That was a great breakfast, by the way,\" she says, \"but god, I'm stuffed! Course, I know that's what you like.\" She gives you a seductive glare. \"It didn't take me long after I started dating you to figure out I was going to end up a pretty fat girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you're the reason that she's this size! That realization hits you like a bag of rocks, but it triggers more of those false memories. You have a strong background in cooking and have always taken pleasure in knowing others like your cooking. It, therefore, came as no surprise that many of your previous girlfriends ended their relationships with you significantly heavier than when you had started dating them. Power Girl was no exception, but she stuck around with you the longest, mostly because she liked your personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what?\" you ask stupidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gonna come over here and cuddle with your fat, fluffy girlfriend or what?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're suddenly aware that your body is naturally responding to her seductive behavior. It's like the part of you that does exist in this world is growing more attracted to her by the minute. You sidle up next to her on the couch, stroking her corpulent sides while she continues to work. You're both content like this. You converse over a few things. You try to get her to tell a little bit more about the past, without being too obvious about it. Everything seems perfect...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>However, unfortunately for you, just as things between you and the enlarged Power Girl were about to become more intimately romantic, Karen abruptly ceased with her work, as she swiftly turned her head to the left, her ears subtly perked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you soon realized that she was undoubtedly hearing someone or something with her Super Hearing, which meant only one certainty: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething big was happening...or It was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What's wrong?\" You asked, clearly displaying a tone of concern in your voice in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you inevitably were about to find out exactly what she was hearing, as both you and Karen then suddenly heard this unnatural yet animalistic sound:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KSS-KSSS! KSS-KSSS!! SSSSKKRREEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few brief moments later, Karen hurriedly closed her laptop, where she then swiftly rose from her seating position on the couch via Kryptonian Flight. From there, she quickly hovered toward the overweight mannequin that held her iconic costume, as she quickly stripped the costume from the mannequin's possession. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, you were still a tad bit shaken up by that beastly shriek from earlier, as you quickly rose up from the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karen... What the hell was that!?!\" You exclaimed, obviously a little unnerved by whatever made that shriek in the first place, as you saw Karen put each bulbous leg through the legholes of her Power Girl costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...was a Kaiju, (Name). And judging from all that hissing, it's gotta be that same snake Kaiju Alan Scott and Jay Garrick had warned me about over a week ago.\" Karen explained, as she managed to pull the remainder of her costume past her round bulbous belly and over her massive mammaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, besides the obvious references to Green Lantern Alan Scott, as well as the original Flash, Jay Garrick, two of the founding members of the Justice Society of America, you soon realize what Karen meant by \"Kaiju\". After all, while you were very much into comic books such as DC Comics and Marvel Comics, you have a cousin who was a huge fan of Kaiju movies. Plus, thanks to said cousin, you knew what the word \"Kaiju\" meant:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGIANT. MONSTER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, both you and Power Girl were currently living in a city that was basically a massive hotspot for giant monster attacks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Karen was fully finished with putting on her white leotard and began to strap on her equally large blue gloves and boots, you spoke toward her with a hint of nervousness in your voice as you queried, \"Kaiju? As in giant monsters who come ashore and wreck cities like they're made of building blocks? Those same creatures that can easily crush someone like me as if I was an ant underneath their feet?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah, pretty much. That's why my cousin, his JLA buddies, and my friends in the JSA had us move out here to Tokyo in the first place. *sigh* And here I was hoping we could go a whole week without some giant monster attacking Tokyo.\" Karen bluntly retorted, huffing out a frustrated sigh in response to the Kaiju rudely interrupting her downtime with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what Power Girl said did make a bit of sense. And yet, it seemed to have raised a few more questions in your mind, including why there were Kaiju in the first place. After all, the DC Universe didn't exactly had any legitimate giant monsters of its own that you could remember. Although, despite you felt a little bit relieved that Power Girl was here to stop the monster, another feeling began to well up inside you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParental Concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, Power Girl was currently pregnant with Half-Human, Half-Kryptonian twins, which gave you some valid reasons to be greatly concerned for both Karen's and your unborn kids' well-being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...what about you? Are the kids going to be okay if you fight that creature?\" You instinctively asked, obviously becoming concerned for the aforementioned well-being of both Power Girl and the unborn twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, upon fully suiting up as Power Girl, Karen was fully aware of your concerns. So, in response to such worries from you, Karen casually approached you, her wide burgeoning hips sashaying from left to right as she slightly lumbered toward you. From there, as her soft bulbous belly pressed against your lower torso, Karen placed her gloved hands upon your shoulders in reassurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Look, I get it. You're concerned about me and the kids, and that I should be on maternity leave from being a superhero. But like I said before, sweetie: They're Half-Kryptonian, meaning they can take a beating.\" Karen answered, not beating around the bush whatsoever when it came to her current disposition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly, Power Girl...er, Karen, then administered a passionate but caring kiss upon your lips, obviously in an attempt to let you know that there wasn't a thing to worry about for the time being. However, such a passionate and tender moment between the two of you had to come to an abrupt end, as you both heard the sounds of the Kaiju coming a little bit closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to the situation, Karen soon ended the kiss, much to her reluctance to do so, as she then quickly hovered toward the doors leading out onto the balcony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, you quickly spoke toward Karen and said, \"Karen! Just...promise me you'll be careful when you're fighting that...thing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren looked back at you with a warm reassured smile upon her plump cherubic face, nodding to promise you on that offer. After all, even though you've just woken up to such a drastic change in your life, you still had these established feelings for Power Girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Thank you, (Name). Now...if you'll excuse me, this looks like a job for Power Girl!!\" She retorted where she then swiftly flew off toward the Kaiju at breakneck speeds, going from zero to Mach 5 in a matter of milliseconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, somehow in the back of your mind alongside these established false memories, you were never going to get tired of seeing Power Girl rush off faster than a speeding bullet to save the day like she always has in the comics. And yet, you couldn't shake off that gnawing feeling of worry when it came to Power Girl, especially in her current state. So, in a possible attempt to shrug off those feelings, you went back towards the couch and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The truth is you can never stop worrying about her, so you go turn on the TV to watch the fight for yourself. She's told you a million times not to watch her fight the bad guys because all you'll do is worry and cringe every time she takes a hit, but that hasn't stopped you before. You need to watch just to see to it that she's safe. Plus, in all honesty, you're kind of curious. You've seen her take down plenty of supervillains and baddies, but a giant monster is a horse of another color indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed, this creature is something the likes of which you've never seen before. It certainly lives up to its name of Kaiju, as it practically towers out of the shot the news crew is shooting from a safe distance. It's a colossal king cobra-looking creature with five heads. It's red/gold scales look like some tough armor to crack, and parts of its hood glow a sickly, pulsating green color. It hisses and roars as it causes destruction. At the moment, it's spewing green venom, which melts the nearby buildings like acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOuroboros, the news anchor calls it. Even if this is all happening in Japan, it's certainly a big enough event that it's attracted the attention of the rest of the world, meaning you could find an English channel to tune into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of the shot, you can just see Power Girl flying onto the scene, and the cameras direct their attention over there. She starts to assess the situation, planning her next move. The news anchors chuckle a bit and make some remarks about her size, noting that she's even bigger than the last time she helped solve a crisis. You let it slide since you know this is just them trying to cope with a very dangerous situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature doesn't give her a chance to think and just lunges for her with all five heads ready to strike. Despite her size, that hasn't really affected how nimble she can be when flying. She zigzags through the striking heads and hovers just high enough out of its reach. She then dives for its middle, hoping to land a sure strike. She does, and her fist makes contact with the serpent's back, but those scales are hard, even for Kryptonian strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOuroboros whips its head around and goes in to strike again. She just barely misses being hit by those fangs. You cringe just a little clutching onto one of the couch pillows for dear life. You can see it in her eyes that this isn't a challenge she was expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decides to take a chance and strike for the heads, preferably the main one. If she can injure it, or at least poke its eye out, maybe she'll have better chances. She flies straight for its eye, but it whips its tail around and knocks her away like a pesky fly. You wince, but she seems to be okay as she recovers her hovering balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she hasn't done enough yet to get its attention on her. It goes back to spewing acidic venom. Technically, she could probably withstand an attack from this stuff, but she's not willing to take her chances until she knows more about this creature's abilities. She and you are both on the same wavelength of thought. Maybe those outer scales are tough, but the softer under scales of its belly might be a weak point. Her eyes alight and she shoots a beam of heat at the serpent's belly. It doesn't look like it's doing much, but it is enough to get Ouroboros' attention. It roars and goes straight for Power Girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold your breath and watch. This is kind of what she was hoping to accomplish, but it isn't going as well as hoped. As she tries to lead it to a more advantageous spot, it's body slithers and knocks about buildings at will, creating more of a mess. You hope she knows what she is doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to allow anymore destruction to happen, she comes to a stop and tries to fight the beast once more. It's formidable and fast, just as fast as she is. That's the problem. She can't land a good strike in time because it reacts to her just as quickly as she can react to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begins to take a big breath and you know what this is: her super breath. She lets out a gust of freezing air. Ouroboros goes to block it with its tail, but hisses in pain as the frozen wind freezes its tail. Like her, you now realize that the creature is weak against the cold. Now she's got an advantage! You let out a cheer, even though there's no one around to hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, it isn't done yet. The creature has been holding back it's best attack yet. It's eyes open wide, and Power Girl freezes in her tracks. At first, you don't know what's going on. You start to panic when she doesn't get out of the way, but then you realize she's powerless to do so. Ouroboros is somehow hypnotizing her to stay still. Its hood starts to fully open, the green pulsating sections glowing even brighter. With a cry a nuclear energy spills from the hood, washing over Power Girl!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Taking the full force of Ouroboros' Nuclear Wave attack, you watched as Power Girl was then knocked back by a surprise attack from the massive five-headed serpent, as Ouroboros swung it's massive tail at Power Girl like a giant, scaly club!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you cringed a little as you watched as Power Girl was sent flying through several skyscrapers in the process, all whilst the news helicopter still kept it's gaze on Power Girl. Although you weren't exactly sure if Power Girl could hear you at the moment, you thouhhht aloud as you said, \"Come on, PG! Think! This overgrown snake has a weakness to cold. You gotta slow it down with your Freeze Breath or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for you, Power Girl slowly but surely arose from the rubble and debris that feebly encased her rotund form. Of course, as the helicopter's camera zoomed in on Power Girl, you could clearly see from her facial expression that she was undoubtedly using her brain, to concoct some semblance of a Plan B against the enormous multi-headed serpent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, she soon came to the same conclusion as you: She needed to use cold-based attacks on Ouroboros! And fortunately for her, there was a Tanker truck full of Liquid Nitrogen, which was most likely being transported to Karen Starr's personal company, Starrware Labs, judging from the logo on the side of the Tanker truck trailer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Power Girl swiftly approached the Tanker truck, and using her Kryptonian strength, she effortlessly tore the Tanker trailer from the truck, where she quickly spoke toward the driver in Japanese as she said, \"M\u00f5shiwakearimasenga, watashi wa kore ij\u00f5 anata ga hitsuy\u00f5desu! &lt;Sorry, but I need this more than you!&gt;\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, you could somewhat tell a little that her Japanese was a bit rusty, just as you saw Power Girl quickly flew off toward Ouroboros, still carrying the Tanker trailer full of Liquid Nitrogen, doing her best to avoid being spotted by Ouroboros, especially with how fast the massive creature's reaction time was, despite it's ludicrously sheer size, as Power Girl swiftly flew from building to building, using the skyscrapers as cover. After all, Power Girl now realized that in order to defeat this Kaiju, she had to play it smart instead of her usual plan of rushing in and beating it up with her Kryptonian strength and other abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, still angry towards the corpulent superheroine for attacking it, you watched as Ouroboros relentlessly searched for Power Girl, sniffing the air with it's reptilian nostrils, attempting to detect any changes in the wind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, just as Ouroboros cautiously slithered around one of the skyscrapers, Power Girl then launched her surprise attack, where she quickly flew behind the massive five-headed serpent, throwing the Tanker trailer towards the back of the serpent's main head. Unfortunately for Ouroboros, it was too late to react towards Power Girl's ambush in time, just as Power Girl unleashed a powerful beam of heat from her eyes, aiming it straight at the Tanker trailer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn turn, this caused the Tanker trailer to explode on impact with Power Girl's Heat Vision, causing Liquid Nitrogen to shower all over Ouroboros' primary head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SSKKRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!! SKREEEEEEEEE!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt shrieked in pain, as Ouroboros felt the stinging cold from the Liquid Nitrogen blasted all over it's serpentine head. It violently thrashed around in agony from the searing cold, causing it's movements to become more sluggish and disoriented in the process, as you saw that Power Girl's sneak attack was very effective. You sprang up from the couch and cheered with glee as you exclaimed, \"WHOOOO!!! Go get it, Power Girl!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, seeing how it couldn't retaliate much due to being inflicted with negative 364 degrees Fahrenheit of Liquid Nitrogen, Power Girl then took this opportunity to lay a Kryptonian beatdown on Ouroboros, as she swiftly went from zero to Mach 5 in mere milliseconds, flying towards Ouroboros at obliterating speeds until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRAAACK!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower Girl unleashed an immensely powerful Haymarket upon Ouroboros' primary head, causing the massive serpent's jaw to break and fracture upon impact! However, it wasn't just it's head that got busted up, as Power Girl then swiftly delivered several left and right hook attacks upon Ouroboros' head, cracking the creature's head, causing it an enormous amount of head trauma, as the durable scales that protected Ouroboros were now rendered as fragile as glass from the Liquid Nitrogen inflicted upon it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn it's current state, Ouroboros couldn't fight anymore, as it's four secondary heads simultaneously shut down when the primary head was severely damaged! From there, Ouroboros began to slouch over and collapse toward a nearby skyscraper, which unfortunately still had civilians inside it evacuating. Upon seeing this, Power Girl swiftly flew underneath the collapsed Kaiju, using a combination of her Kryptonian Strength and Flight to attempt to slow it's descent to avoid racking up casualties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, she seemed to be struggling a little, as Power Girl then diverted the trajectory of Ouroboros' descent, making it land upon the large stretch of Freeway with an audible \"THOOM!!!\" in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, once she laid the massive serpent upon the wide road, Power Girl hovered upwards until she was twenty feet above the enormous creature. She stared longingly at it's lifeless form. Of course, you could surmise that she was using her X-Ray Vision to determine if Ouroboros was still alive or not. Moments later, she displayed a reassured smile upon her plump cherubic face, placing her plump gloved hands upon her burgeoning hips with a sense of pride and accomplishmnent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before she was about to fly off (most likely back to your spacious apartment), Power Girl momentarily stopped upon hearing the applause and cheers from the numerous civilians who witnessed Power Girl's victory over the Kaiju. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, you could see that Power Girl appreciated their rounds of applause, as bowed forward some in respect to them whilst she was hovering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arigat\u00f5. Anata wa totemo y\u016bkandatta. Sewa o suru! &lt;Thanks. You were all very brave. Take care!&gt;\" She said to them in Japanese, briefly waving at them with a plump gloved hand before swiftly flying off into the sky and out of the sights of the news helicopters. And with that, the news reporter then looked back at her camerajan in the helicopter with her as she said, \"Sate, anata wa sore o motte imasu, josei to shinshi.  Paw\u0101g\u0101ru no okage de m\u00f5hitotsu no kiki wa yoke raremashita! Watashi wa Sakai Hiromidesu. Anata wa TBN o mite imasu.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Technically, the Starrware Labs you were familiar with was actually based in New York, but since your girlfriend's move to Japan, she opened up another branch in the middle of Tokyo. And, in all fairness, this was actually a great decision on her part. Karen, business savvy as always picked an excellent location to continue her progressive work in technology. Still, it kept her pretty busy, and when she wasn't off superheroing, she was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after two weeks since you woke up in this reality, you had adjusted well and got used to her routine. Today, you decided to surprise her by coming to her office with lunch. Actually, you really should have rethought this. Karen's enormous appetite meant that you bit off a little more than you could chew when it came to transporting everything over to the office. You had to make several trips back to your car just to get it all up there. So, exhausted after all the trouble to do it, Karen has already eaten about half of what you brought before you're able to actually sit down and enjoy it with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was so sweet of you,\" she says, digging into her third course. \"But, I probably should have told you the elevator was out of order before you came down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" you say, sweat dripping off your forehead. \"It was worth it. So, how's your day going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, mostly just administrative stuff. I can't seem to go a day without someone emailing me about a crisis that really only takes a few minutes to solve. But, I guess it makes me look like I'm doing something useful. What about you? I worry that you're getting bored being here with nothing to do but be a house-husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh, now having a bit more knowledge about your \"past\" in this reality. You know you're not actually married to Power Girl...not yet anyway. But, it is something you've been thinking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I mean, it was tough giving up my job back in the states, but it's not like that was going to be able to compare with your job here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugs. \"Still, I worry that you feel like you need something to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle. \"So, is that a job offer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know about here. You're not really the techie type. I was thinking, you've always wanted to open your own restaurant...maybe you could do that here! I mean, we've got the funds to do that. You just need to find a good location. Plus, it'd be way more fulfilling than what you did back in America.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...we'll see. I don't know if I'm ready to commit to all that just yet. I mean, we are having kids here soon. We're going to have to plan for how to handle all that. I don't exactly envision you as the 'stay-at-home' mom type.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, true. We'll need to work all that out, but I really think it isn't impossible for you to still be able to do something you like. Wow, that was amazing. Thanks for lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving finally finished everything you brought, Karen is looking even bigger than when she started. Ever since you started dating her, she wasn't one to turn down a meal you made, and perhaps that's what encouraged you to keep making more and more each time. Right now, you're enjoying a good view of her stuffed gut as all of that food settles for her. Chances are, she's going to have to have some new clothes tailored soon. That poor blouse doesn't look like it's going to stand much of a chance any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Karen's weight is a little bit more of an inconvenience when she's out in her civilian identity. It's kind of hard to go around floating to avoid waddling without having some explaining to do. Thankfully, she works for a tech company, so technology to suit her needs has always been at the forefront of her research. For a while now (roughly after her weight got past 450), she's had an office chair that serves as a scooter for getting around the office. Of course, as she continues to get bigger, she's going to have to find more solutions to other problems, but for now, she's got everything covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, anyway, I do have a doctor's appointment today,\" she says. \"Would you be able to come too? They'll be able to judge my due date finally, and I think my doctor said something about being able to determine the genders at this point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't miss it for the world,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, it is that later that day, you had gone with her, excited to learn more about your future offspring. Much like any parent, you're nervous and curious at the same time. However, in this case, you're even more curious since you really don't know all that much about half-Kryptonian births. To be quite frank...you're pretty sure that hasn't happened before, not unless Superman finally decided to start a family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, you and Karen are waiting for the doctor to come back after she had just finished the initial blood test. You're pretty sure Karen is slightly hovering over the table where she's supposed to be sitting, probably to avoid accidentally crushing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor returns. \"Well, let's start with the most important news,\" she says. \"It looks like you're right on schedule. You'll be due...\"</span></div></div>",

According to your ultrasound, you'll be due in approximately...4 months from now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour months?! ...Well, I guess that did explain a lot regarding Karen's increased appetite as of late, despite her established rotund physique. After all, she is currently in the middle of her second trimester. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, Karen had to not wear her Power Girl costume underneath her business ensemble due to the fact that she had to take an ultrasound test, as you then spoke toward the female doctor and asked, \"...Are they any complications?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...None that I can think if, Mr. (Name). Aside from their mother's, um...\"Rubenesque\" physique,  the fetuses are surprisingly healthy.\" The female doctor answered, taking note of Karen's substantially larger form. Obviously, Karen deliberately bumped you with her plump elbow as she retorted, \"See? I told you the kids would be fine, (Name)!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay! You're right, I shouldn't have been so worried.\" You replied, rubbing the side where Karen lightly jabbed you with her elbow. Fortunately, it wasn't a powerful jab either, just as Karen chuckled a little, which seemed to lighten things up between the two of you, even though you and Karen have a very stable romantic relationship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honesty, you were honestly looking forward a little to having Half-Human, Half-Kryptonian twins. Sure, it might become quite hectic, especially if they inherit the powers of their mother, such as Heat Vision, X-Ray Vision, Flight, Super Strength, etc. Overall, things were looking rather bright in your future with the obese Power Girl...even if you didn't exactly predict this outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, out of curiosity, Karen then spoke toward the female doctor once more while she lightly drummed the side of her bulbous, pudgy, yet pregnant belly and queried, \"Doctor Uzumaki, since I'm currently in my second trimester... Were you able to tell us what their genders are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomentarily, the female doctor, Doctor Uzumaki, began to pull out photo copies of the results from Karen's ultrasound, where she then spoke toward both you and Karen as she explained, \"...Well, normally we don't tell those who are pregnant what the baby's gender is until the beginning of the third trimester. However, I can make an exception.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Doctor Uzumaki began to flip through the pages until she reached the ultrasound photo of the unborn twins, where she then looked back at both you and Karen as she answered, \"...Alright, according to the results from the ultrasound, it appears that the twin fetuses are...\"</span></div></div>",

Congratulations! You'll be giving birth to two lovely daughters!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell... That was certainly unexpected. After all, you were initially assuming that one twin would be a boy, while the other twin would be a girl. Suffice to say, you felt gratefully relieved to hear that the unborn twins were perfectly healthy, as you saw casually dismount herself from the examination table she was sitting on. After all, even though she had packed on a lot of weight since she started dating you, her Kryptonian strength were still as strong as ever, which made things a little easier when moving around at her current size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much, Doctor Uzumaki. We appreciate what you're doing for me and (Name) here.\" Karen confessed, as she then put her fashionable glasses back on her cherubic face, which disguised her from anyone discovering that both Karen Starr and Power Girl were one and the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, despite her well-established girth and bulk, Karen gave a respectful bow towards the female doctor before returning her posture back into an upright position. Of course, Doctor Uzumaki did the same to Karen, as the female Obstetrician (A doctor with special training in how to care for pregnant women and help in the birth of babies) then proceeded to shake Karen's hand, where the female doctor then retorted, \"Not a problem, Ms. Starr. I'm just merely doing my job.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as both you and Karen were about to exit the Examination Room, Doctor Uzumaki then spoke toward both of you once more and said, \"Though, there is one more thing I want to ask you, Ms. Starr.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Of course, doctor! What is it that you want to ask?\" Karen bluntly retorted, trying to still be polite as ever, despite such an unexpected retort. From there, Doctor Uzumaki then began to go through the results from the ultrasound, while she spoke toward both you and Karen as she queried, \"This might sound odd, but...While I was examining the blood sample taken from you, I noticed something...strange, regarding the twin fetuses. Apparently, your unborn twins appear to be Half-Kryptonian.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing that, you noticed that Karen looked like she froze in place, as if her biggest secret just got revealed to the entire world. Obviously, Doctor Uzumaki easily noticed Karen's disposition, looking at the rotund woman out of concern as she asked, \"Ms. Starr? Ms. Starr?! Are you...feeling alright? You look like you've seen a ghost.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that? Um...You see, I uh...happen to be a surrogate mother for Power Girl's children. Yeah, that's right! I became a surrogate mother for her kids. That's why the twins are Half-Kryptonian.\" Karen hastily confessed, trying to come up with a convincing enough lie for why she's bearing Half-Human, Half-Kryptonian twins. Although, you had to admit, even you were a little nervous yourself regarding this debacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for the two of you, Doctor Uzumaki seemed to have been convinced by such a blatant lie, as the female Obstetrician then spoke with a hint of surprise in her voice as she replied, \"Really?! I honestly didn't know that Power Girl wanted to have children of her own.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*nervous chuckle* Yeah, you can say that again, doctor. She wanted to keep it on the down low to avoid any supervillains from trying to take her kids when they're born. Just...promise you'll keep quiet about this.\" You answered, mildly scratching the back of your head out of slight nervousness. Of course, Doctor Uzumaki eventually spoke back and said, \"Hmmm....Well, normally I would have to document this information regarding Ms. Starr's surrogacy, Mr. (Name). However, since this IS a superhero's children we are discussing about here... I'll make an exception for this, even though this might cost me my job as an Obstetrician.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Doctor Uzumaki. It means a lot for you to keep quiet about this.\" Karen answered, just as the female doctor then quipped, \"Don't thank me, Ms. Starr. Thank patient confidentiality.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, both you and Karen parted ways with Doctor Uzumaki, as the two of you exited the examination room, casually proceeding out of the hospital and out onto the bustling streets of Tokyo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, once you and Karen were finally out of the hospital building, both you and Karen simultaneously exhaled a sigh of relief, just as Karen then spoke toward you and said, \"*relieved sigh* Damn, that was close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, a bit too close for comfort. She almost found out who you really were, Karen.\" You retorted, where both you and Karen then began to leisurely walk down the wide sidewalk, keeping with the pedestrian traffic. But while the two continued walking, Karen exhaled a deep sigh and replied, \"*sigh* I know, sweetie. But still, I think it was worth the risk. I mean, I don't want to waste my time flying all the way back to the States, just to find out if we'll be having a boy and a girl or vice-versa. At least we now know we're going to be having twin daughters. Sure, it wasn't exactly like what we had initially planned, but we can change that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, Karen.\" You said, as you voluntarily grabbed Karen's plump left hand with your right hand, which Karen was definitely enjoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But still, I'm glad nothing seriously bad had happened while Power Girl was fighting against Ouroboros.\" You remarked, subtly referencing Karen as Power Girl in third person as you briefly winked at your rotund girlfriend, which Karen easily picked up on since you were talking about her. After all, you were both out in public, so you simply couldn't blatantly say that Power Girl and Karen are the same individual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in response, as she gently rubbed up and down her blouse-covered gut with a plump right hand, Karen calmly spoke toward you with a warm reassured smile upon her plump cherubic face as she replied, \"I know what you mean by that, sweetie. Thankfully, Starrware Labs and Starrware Industries are assisting the Japanese government in rebuilding the more damaged areas of the city from the battle.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you both stopped and waited to safely pass through the intersection, you then spoke toward Karen and asked, \"So...Now that we're done at the doctor's office, what do you want to do next, Karen? After all, it's a lovely day. Might as well get some things done while we're out here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, despite not being that much of a social person on her own, Karen seemed to be optimistic about these whilke you were near. So, after much debating with herself on the matter at hand, Karen eventually spoke toward you and answered, \"...Now that I think about it, (Name), I was thinking about...\"</span></div></div>",

Apparently, they just opened up a brand new Plus-Size store over at LaForet Harajuku, and I want to see what they have over there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind that at all, Karen.\" You flirtatiously retorted, planting a tender kiss upon Karen's plump left cheek, which made her blush a little in the process. After all, she doesn't exactly mind you cuddling up to her when you're both at home in the apartment building looking over the Shibuya Ward, but out in public on the other hand...She can be a little hesitant. Fortunately, she's got you to handle herself in these social situations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after progressing through the elongated and intertwining streets and pathways of Tokyo, you and Karen had finally reached LaForet Harajuku. In appearance, LaForet Harajuku was a massive trend setting shopping complex, which consisted of seven floors of fashion boutiques and shops, mainly catered towards a young, female audience. From what you could remember from these \"False\" memories of yours, this was considered one of Karen's favorite places to shop,  especially with the numerous yet various clothing boutiques available in the 7 Story building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she now weighed in at a little over five hundred pounds, Karen still retained a surprisingly healthy physique underneath all that extra blubber she now carried, most likely due to her Kryptonian physiology. Overall, she definitely didn't seemed tired at the slightest, as she casually waddled her way down the stretch of hallway without breaking a sweat, her wide burgeoning hips sashaying from left to right as she trekked down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after wandering through several floors of the shopping complex, you and Karen inevitably found the aforementioned \"Plus-Size \" Women's Store, dubbed \"Biggubondeddored\u012bsu &lt;Big-Boned Ladies&gt;\" in big, puffy, and bloated pink Kanto writing. Of course, it was most undoubtedly a Plus-Size Women's Store, as you noticed some equally rotund Japanese women going through various articles of clothing and trying them on, seeing how they fit their rubenesque yet tubby forms. Obviously, they weren't as big as Karen, especially since she happened to stand at 5 feet 11 inches, which was considerably tall compared to the average Japanese woman in Tokyo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is the place! Let's see what they've got here.\" Karen bluntly quipped, as she casually waddled her way inside the spacious yet packed department store. But as she stepped inside the store, Karen was then greeted by one of the shop clerks, who was a fairly plump teenage girl, who had her hair tied up into a bun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed Karen inside, just as the clerk spoke to her with an enthusiastic tone, speaking in Japanese as she quipped, \"Kon'nichiwa misu! Watashi wa d\u00f5sureba anata o tasukete kureru no? &lt;Hello, Miss! How may I help you?&gt;\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you could tell a little that Karen had initially wished that the clerk would speak English, but to each her own, she supposes. So, shortly after exhaling a mildly frustrated sigh, Karen then spoke toward the chubby female clerk, speaking in Japanese as she answered, \"*sigh* Hai, watashi wa ikutsu ka no atarash\u012b bijinesu-fuku dakedenaku, kajuaru-fuku no ikutsu ka no setto o sagashiteimasu. Watashi wa osoraku anata ga miru koto ga dekiru y\u00f5 ni, \u00f5ki-sa matawa 2tsu agatte iru kamo shiremasen. &lt;Yes, I'm looking for some new business clothes, as well as a few sets of casual clothes too. I may have gone up a size or two, as you can probably see.&gt;\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing the plump woman thoroughly looking at Karen's substantially larger form, you could easily tell that the chubby female clerk had never assisted a woman of Karen's size and stature before until now, as the plump woman disguised her shock with a cheery smile, where she then spoke toward Karen and replied, \"Mochiron! Kono y\u00f5 ni shite kudasai. &lt;Of course! Right this way, please.&gt;\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Karen was gestured to follow the female clerk deeper into the fashion boutique, as you slowly followed behind them, just to see if Karen was feeling emotionally okay. Much to your surprise, Karen was certainly holding her own a little, as she felt the plump female clerk taking numerous measurements of her with a measuring tape, much to Karen's personal feelings of embarrassment, especially since she's more accustomed to having you be the one to get this close to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watashi wa mitomenakereba narimasen, misu: Anata wa tashika ni koko shusseki shite iru hotondo no josei yori mo r\u016bben-tekidesu. Watashi wa kore o homekotoba to shite itte imasu. &lt;I have to admit, Miss: You're certainly more rubenesque than most women that attend here. And I am saying that as a compliment.&gt;\" The female clerk confessed, as if she was impressed by Karen's substantially larger physique, just as the woman then began to measure the circumference of Karen's thick bulbous thighs, much to Karen's reluctance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u0112 to, arigat\u00f5. &lt;Um, thanks... I guess.&gt;\" Karen flatly retorted, currently not in a bit of a talkative mood due to feeling like she's being poked and prodded like a guinea pig with the chubby clerk constantly taking her physical measurements. Of course, you stood there before her, leaning against the wall, your arms crossed and bearing a smug yet reassuring grin upon your slender face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, upon seeing you, Karen began to relax a bit more as you said, \"Well, at least you don't have to strip down in public, honey.\" Of course, your response undoubtedly made her blush a little, but in a good way, just as the female clerk then spoke toward you and Karen as she asked, \"Itte yaru ga \u012b. Demo, shinkon no f\u016bfu wa futari imasu ka? &lt;Say, I don't mean to pry, but are you two a newlywed couple by any chance?&gt;\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, in response to such a blunt question, both you and Karen simultaneously answered, \"\u012be, watashitachiha kekkon shite imasen! &lt;No, we're not married!&gt;\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Sukunakutomo, mada. &lt;...At least, not yet.&gt;\" You swiftly answered, which earned you Karen's signature \"Watch it, buddy!\" expression upon her plump cherubic face, which quickly faded away, since she couldn't stay mad at you for long. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Subete kanry\u00f5! &lt;There we go, Miss! All done!&gt;\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, the plump female clerk then began searching through the various aisles of the fashion boutique for clothes that matched Karen's exact measurements, thus leaving you and Karen alone to your own devices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, she certainly seemed nice. And they say that chivalry is dead.\" You said, referencing how polite the tubby female clerk was, as Karen rebuttoned the buttons on her enlarged white work blouse, where she spoke toward you with a slight hint of a mildly annoyed tone in her voice as she bluntly remarked, \"Yeah, a little too nice for my tastes, if you know what I mean, (Name).\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hate to rub salt on the wound, Karen, but it was actually your idea to come here in the first place. After all, you DID want some clothes in a larger size, plus you weren't sure of what services they provide here.\" You sarcastically retorted, your arms still crossed whilst you still leaned against the wall, still looking at Karen in the process. Of course, Karen looked back at you, placing her plump hands upon her burgeoning hips as she replied, \"Yes, I'm very much aware of that, sweetie. But still, it feels so relieving to find a place like this just a ways off from our apartment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after almost five minutes of waiting, the chubby female clerk swiftly returned to both you and Karen, now carrying an assortment of various plus-sized clothes in her plump arms, where she then spoke toward both you and Karen as she explained, \"Okure ni taisuru watashi no shazai. Watashi wa korera no ish\u00f5 no ikutsu ka o anata no sokutei ni awa sete ch\u00f5sei shinakereba narimasendeshita. &lt;My apologies for the tardiness. I had to get some of these outfits tailor-made to fit with your measurements.&gt;\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daij\u00f5bu. Anata wa shigoto o shite iru dakedesu. &lt;That's okay. You're just doing your job.&gt;\" Karen replied, speaking in Japanese toward the chubby female clerk, reassuring her that it was alright to be a little late. From there, the female clerk then gestured Karen to follow her toward the Fitting Rooms, as you then followed closely behind Karen, easily noticing her burgeoning hips and voluminous butt sashay from left to right as she approached the Fitting Rooms. Suffice to say, you were undoubtedly enjoying the view of Karen's ample rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the three of you reached the Fitting Rooms, you decided to patiently wait outside the Fitting Rooms, while Karen and the chubby female clerk leisurely made their way inside one of the spacious Fitting Room stalls. From there, once they closed and locked the stall door, Karen began to calmly yet reluctantly strip herself down to her large red bra and panties. Hoping to ease some of the stress that Karen was enduring, the chubby female clerk then spoke toward her with a friendly tone as she said, \"Watashi wa iu hitsuy\u00f5 ga arimasu, misu: Anata wa tashika ni watashitachi no kokyaku no hotondo yori mo segatakaidesu. Anata no himitsu wa nanidesu ka? &lt;I must say, Miss: You are definitely taller than most of our customers. What's your secret?&gt;\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u0100! \u0112 to... Watashi wa on'nanokodatta toki, watashi wa \u00f5kibona seich\u00f5 o togeta to ierudeshou. &lt;Oh! Um...You can say that I had a massive growth spurt when I was a girl.&gt;\" Karen flatly retorted, obviously not adjusted to having someone else besides you staring at her in only her lingerie, as she began to put on the first set of clothes given to her, which was this wonderful mahogany red business ensemble, complete with a white business blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, she casually stepped out of the Fitting Room stall, where you stood back up and saw her wearing the business ensemble. Mentally, you felt like your jaw just dropped to the floor. Karen looked downright attractive! From there, upon seeing you standing there before her, Karen spoke out toward you and asked, \"...Well?  How, uh...How do I look, sweetie?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Karen... You look absolutely beautiful!\" You swiftly answered, which undoubtedly raised her spirits upon hearing your words of approval. In response, Karen pulled off a few sexy poses in front of you, as she spoke toward you and queried, \"Really? Do you think so?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*chuckle* What can I say, Karen? The color red absolutely suits you, wether you're in a three-piece business suit or in lingerie!\" You boldly answered, which made Karen feel rather bashful, much to her mild annoyance. Then again, you always did bring that out in her at times, which was one of the things she loved about you. Upon turning around to face a nearby full-body mirror, Karen could easily see how the three-piece red business suit fit comfortably around her rotund form, as well as accentuating her plush curves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile crept up upon her plump cherubic face, easily liking how the business ensemble accentuated her substantially larger form. From there, after a brief moment of reflection, Karen then spoke aloud to herself as she said, \"...Oh yeah, this is definitely a keeper!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watashi wa anata ga korera no fuku ni manzoku shite iru to omotte imasu, misu? &lt;I take it that you are satisfied with these clothes, Miss?&gt;\" The plump female clerk chirped, easily seeing that Karen was undoubtedly liking the red business suit. In response, Karen swiftly spoke toward the clerk in Japanese and retorted, \"*giggle* Tebukuro no y\u00f5 ni fitto! Kono y\u00f5na ifuku wa nani ka atta no? &lt;Fits like a glove! Got any more clothes like this?&gt;\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* Tashika ni, misu! &lt;Certainly, Miss!&gt;\" The female clerk answered, where she then gestured Karen to follow her back into the Fitting Room stall once more, prepared to go through numerous different clothes with the same measurements as the three-piece red business suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-- One Hour Later --</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after going through numerous amounts of Plus-Size clothes, Karen was inevitably satisfied with the clothes she had bought from the \"Big-Boned Ladies\" fashion boutique, as both you and Karen were now heading back to the apartment, carrying several bags worth of clothes custom-tailored to fit Karen at her current size and girth. Suffice to say, this was undoubtedly a productive day for both you and Karen Starr. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you and Karen got out of the elevator and entered the spacious apartment the two of you live in. Upon entering, you and Karen simultaneously set the bags full of clothes down upon the dining table, as Karen casually waddled her way toward the couch, slowly collapsing upon the couch's cushiony hide, exhaling a relieved sigh in response as she blatantly said, \"*sigh* Damn, that clerk was a bit TOO peppy for my tastes, if you ask me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww! Come on, Karen! It wasn't all that bad.\" You replied, reassuring her that the trip wasn't a waste of time, as you then approached the couch and sat beside her on the furniture. In response, Karen exhaled a deep sigh, tenderly rubbing the outward curve of her plush belly, speaking toward you as she retorted, \"...Yeah, maybe you're right. Then again, I'm sure YOU had a wonderful time staring at this big fat ass of mine, honey.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, you couldn't help but bite your lip a little from such a remark, which Power Girl couldn't help but chuckle some from your mild inconvenience, where she then swiftly pulled you in closer to her with a plump left arm, putting her Kryptonian strength on display, then smirked as she quipped, \"*chuckle* You might be a gullible idiot, (Name). But you'll always be MY gullible idiot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, she immediately pulled you up toward her face, then administered a passionate kiss upon your lips. Even though you've just woken up in this new alternate world and have been here for the past two weeks, you had to admit that Karen Starr was undoubtedly a good kisser. </span></div></div>",

Always when I'm just trying to live a normal life.\" She looks at the name on her caller ID. \"Oh...\" she says rather suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize whoever it is, it must be important, so you scootch back while she proceeds to talk. \"Um, hey, so... Oh, okay. No, no, that's totally fine. No, it's not a bad time. Well, I mean, right now was since I was kind of in the middle of something, but it's fine. So wait, is it anything important? I'm not saying you're not important, it's just...okay, well, bye. Yes, love you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hangs up and looks back at you. \"Sorry, that was family stuff. I guess Clark's decided to come pay us a visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clark? You mean like, the Superman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the Superman. God, you can be silly sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he say what it was about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs. \"No, and he has a horrible habit of doing that. It's always 'I'll tell you later\" with him. I swear, he can be about as annoying as human cousins sometimes.\" She stops, looks around the apartment and sighs again. \"Guess that means we'll have to get the place ready for his visit. You know him, he can be a bit of a neat freak sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah,\" you say, noticing that the place practically looks spotless as it is. \"But, uh, we don't have to start just yet, right? I mean, it's not like he's going to be here any minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughs. \"No, surprisingly, he's coming over the human way. So, his flight's not until next week. That gives us some time. Now, where were we?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*   *   *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few days, the two of you set to cleaning up, planning some family meals, and just getting everything ready to both Karen, and what you hope is Clark's liking. Rather, you've done most of the cleaning. As Karen's pregnancy progresses, you notice that she is starting to get tired easily. Well, that and still trying to maintain her superhero status, mostly at nights, she's left pretty dog tired by the daytime. You don't mind all that much. After all, she is carrying your future children. The least you could do is be extra helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour favorite part of the day is when you cook the immense feasts Karen considers meals. Somehow, no matter what, it just impresses you how much she can eat and still stay an active hero. It's a stark difference from what you used to be. Before all of this, you probably would have never given girls her size the time of day, yet, with her, it seems that she stays stunningly beautiful, no matter how big she gets. Actually, come to think of it, you're starting to remember less and less of your previous life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the day arrives when Superman himself is going to be in your own home. You can't help but feel giddy at the thought of that. Never in your wildest dreams did you imagine having any connection, let alone even meeting, any part of the Kryptonian family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've just finished getting everything put away and picked up. Karen is meanwhile finishing the large breakfast you prepared for her a couple of hours earlier. You're pretty sure it's more than just the twins increasing her appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, babe,\" she says, pushing away the last of the empty plates. \"You've been an amazing help this week. I'm sorry I couldn't really help all that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go and sit beside her on the couch, glad to be off your feet for a while. \"That's okay. I know you've been hard at work too.\" You pat her growing belly, which now feels like a combination of firm and squishy. You suddenly feel a sharp knock against your hand. \"Wow!\" you say breathlessly. \"They're kicking.\" You move your hands across the curve of her stomach, feeling a few more kicks and pummels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods. \"Yeah, they've been doing a lot of that for the past couple of days. It stops being so fun when they're hitting my bladder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel some more. \"This is just amazing. It's...it's real now. We're going to be parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles and laughs. \"You're such a goofball sometimes, but I love you for it.\" She kisses you. \"And that's why you're going to end up being such a good father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kiss her back. \"Well, don't sell yourself too short there. You're going to be a great mother. I hope they look a lot like you. They'd be the most beautiful girls in the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, that's so sweet. I just hope they don't get my appetite though. You're good, but I don't know if you could cook for all three of us like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh. \"Well, no matter what happens, I know they'll be perfect. They're our kids after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles and shakes her head. But before she can say anymore, there's a knock at the door. She starts to heft herself up from the couch. \"Well, that's got to be him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddles over towards the door and answers it. You peek over her shoulder.</span></div></div>",

Karen is excited to see them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you guys could come. It's really been too long. How are you, cousin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe manages a tight smile. \"We've been well. You seem to have settled into life here in Tokyo just fine.\" He looks Karen up and down, an unsure look on his face. You're not exactly sure how he feels about her increase in weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren still beams and wraps Lois in a big hug. \"And Lois, it's good to see you too! Clark didn't tell me he was bringing the whole clan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois seems much more pleasant and chatty than her husband. \"It really is good to see you too, Karen. We were really sad when you decided to move, but I can see that you're very happy here. You'll definitely have to show us some of the sights, provided you're up to it. Clark said the last time he talked to you, you were pregnant? That's wonderful news!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them continue to chit-chat while Karen shows them around the apartment. Clark is still keeping a pretty stern face, so you're not sure how to approach him or even begin talking to him. In the meantime, Karen's moved on to Jon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Jonathan, you've gotten so tall! You're in what, fifth grade now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Hey, Aunt Karen, dad says there's lots of big monsters that come to Tokyo. Is that true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives a knowing smile. \"Sometimes, but those are usually taken care of in a jif. Okay, well, that's the grand tour of the place. I think we could all use some time to catch up. What have you been up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, for the next hour or so, you listen in while the whole family catches up on everything that's been going on. You rarely get a chance to talk, nor do you even know where to begin. You're kind of starstruck, to be honest. Occasionally, as Karen is telling them about her pregnancy, they ask you the occasional question, to which you either nod your head or give a yes or no answer, but that's about all you can muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it sounds like you two are excited and are doing everything you can to get ready,\" Lois finishes. \"But, aren't you worried about how this affects your work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been alright, but I am getting pretty tuckered by the end of the day. But no, no more stress than the average pregnancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's good at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark finally speaks to you. \"So, how have you been about all of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp. \"Um, excited, I guess. A bit nervous too. I mean, when has parenting ever been easy?\" You give a nervous laugh. \"I'm happy, I really am. It's just, it's a lot to think about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we've never asked, but what is it exactly you do?\" Lois asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother flood of memories come back to you, and it finally fills in some of those missing gaps you've had about how exactly you met. \"I...uh...well, nothing in particular right now,\" you answer. \"We've been considering the possibility of me becoming a stay-at-home dad. But, before all this, I used to work at my dad's law firm. Course, I always had the secret desire to be a chef. Not to brag, but I'm pretty good in the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren laughs and pats her gut. \"Yup, I can attest to that. He really has a gift for it. I don't know where I'd be if I didn't meet him. Anyway, thinking of food, how about I take you guys into town for a little looking around and we can go out for a nice dinner after?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone seems to agree, and pretty soon, you're all headed out to the city. Despite how crowded it can be sometimes in Tokyo, it seems that people clearly leave enough room as Karen tries to waddle past most of them. Nonetheless, it seems like everyone is having a relatively good time. Lois is enjoying some of the shopping. Jon likes taking pictures of all the neat statues and buildings he sees. And even Clark looks like he's enjoying the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he pulls you aside. Now, you're worried. \"We haven't gotten to talk much ever since Karen met you. We've only really spoken with each other a couple of times,\" he says awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, it's not that I don't like you. It's just...she's my cousin, and I kind of have to feel protective of her. I just want to know she's alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, she's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gives you an examining look. \"Really, though, how is she? I mean, there's the whole...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug. \"Well, yeah, I was kind of concerned at first. But, it hasn't really slowed her down. She's pretty okay about it. And you know, I actually like her this way. Is that a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doesn't say anything at first. \"No,\" he says at last, \"but I just want to be sure she's okay.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before you can say anything else, you hear an earth-rumbling roar. That's clearly not a good sign. Just on the horizon, you see a looming, gigantic figure emerges over the Tokyo skyline. It looks like a gigantic alligator. But, it's more than that. Its scales look incredibly tough and spiny. Some of its flesh looks like its rotting off, and its eyes are glowing. It's clearly another kaiju. Already, it starts swinging its tail and smashing anything in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zombie alligator,\" Karen says as she steps up behind you. \"Just what we needed today. Alright, well, I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help,\" Clark says, following behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, another rumble stops everyone in their tracks. It's coming from the other direction. You look over and see a large, slimy, lizard-like creature, surrounded by flames. It seems like everything it touches catches on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two beasts see each other for a moment before they roar and hiss at each other. The alligator creature charges at the lizard and pounds it into the ground. It recoils as its senses react to the heated skin of the lizard. But it recovers and attacks again, swinging its hard-scaled tail at it, knocking it back. The other beast isn't about to take this lying down. It hisses and throws itself at the alligator, its skin burning into the rotted flesh of the alligator. It roars in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly, whatever brought these two things here has been lost in their territorial battle with each other. And unfortunately, the city is caught between their fighting, destruction looking imminent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all the chaos, you hardly noticed Karen and Clark disappearing to transition into their superhero identities. Behind you, you hear the air whip as they both take to the sky to take on the creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, their main objective is to separate the two fighting beasts. If they can single them out, then they have a better chance of defeating them with the minimum collateral damage as a result. That, however, is easier said than done. The two creatures are too busy snapping their jaws at each other to notice the barrage of attacks from Power Girl and Superman. The alligator, in particular, seems the least affected by it all as its hard body keeps it from feeling the blows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower Girl shoots a strong breath of cold air right in the lizard's eye. It finally can no longer ignore everything else going on around it. It pushes the alligator off of it and goes after Power Girl. That leaves Superman to try and keep the alligator at bay, but it's not going to be an easy task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you can keep your eyes on is Power Girl. After all, she's the one who's especially important to you. You've already taken cover in a nearby store, along with Lois and Jon, so all you can do is hold your breath and hope this works out. It's not like you don't trust her abilities, but with two monsters attacking, and her getting pretty far along in the pregnancy, you're not sure if her stamina can take all of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe keeps her distance from the creature, since it seems like it burns with touch, initially. She ducks and dodges it, trying to hit it with her cold breath to keep it from causing more flammable damage. But, she throws in a few other attacks, like her eye beams for good measure. But its skin seems pretty tough. Not much is taking effect. It leans forward and belches a river of flames out onto the street, trying to tell Power Girl to back off. She avoids it, and works quickly to save as many civilians as she can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis provides enough of a distraction for the creature to dig its claws into the ground and burrow. Pretty soon, it's disappeared beneath the earth. That's definitely not a good sign. Power Girl tries to sense where it might be before it springs up for a surprise attack. But, a rumble in the ground is what gives her the alert. It emerges once again, roaring and spewing more flames. She's really pissed it off now. It grabs the top of a skyscraper with its tail and throws it at her. She catches it just in time, but she's got to do more than just play defense here.</span></div></div>",

Apparently, judging from the information being unfolded to the three of you, Grimmgarl was first initially spotted in the Bayous of Louisiana, which explained a little why it was an alligator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, despite it's ludicrously massive size, Grimmgarl didn't seem very intelligent, possibly due to it...well, being a zombie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, as Superman delivered attack after attack upon Grimmgarl, it appeared as if the enormous undead reptile didn't feel a damn thing thrown at it. However, in retaliation against the Man of Steel, Grimmgarl lunged at Superman snout first, opening it's decaying jaws wide in an attempt to devour him. Unfortunately for the undead Kaiju, Superman quickly evaded the attack, only to be violently batted away by the massive beast's scaly, decomposing tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn turn, this launched Superman through a building or two, where he quickly recovered enough to avoid crashing through a third building. He grunted in pain a little, where both you and Superman suddenly realized something:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmgarl was somehow infused with Magic, one of the few weaknesses that can harm someone like Superman and Power Girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, stopping this enormous creature was extremely high on Superman's list of priorities for the time being, as he then quickly flew toward Grimmgarl. However, instead of continuing his assault upon the undead reptile, Superman, using his trademark Super Strength, began to lift up the entirety of Grimmgarl, ascending higher and faster with each passing millisecond, with Grimmgarl involuntarily along for the ride, as it struggled to free itself from the Man of Steel!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly but eventually, Superman threw the undead Grimmgarl far outside of Earth's atmosphere and into the deep black abyss that was outer space. Hopefully, it would crash land on a different planet devoid of civilization, as Superman then quickly flew back to Tokyo to assist his rotund yet pregnant cousin, Power Girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as you, Lois, and Jon help a group of survivors escape to a safer area away from the ongoing battle, Power Girl continued her fight against the charcoal black, fire-breathing salamander that the press have dubbed \"Urogora\", based off of a massive beast from Ancient Greece, whose description was strikingly similar to that of the Kaiju that Power Girl was currently fighting against. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as Power Girl used several consecutive but powerful Freeze Breath attacks upon Urogora, hoping that cooling it's intensely hot body temperature. Suffice to say, it seemed to be an uphill battle for the corpulent superheroine.</span></div></div>",

At least with two fighting against one, the odds are better, you hope. Second, the Japanese government has arrived with a containment vessel for Urogora. It seems that being used to a  great many large monsters attacking the country, the government has devised a system for dealing with such problems. Now Power Girl and Superman have a plan: corral the beast into the containment vessel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower Girl gets a second wind, literally. With a newly instilled confidence in the success of their plan, she used her freeze breath to deter Urogora from thrashing at other buildings and began directing it into the path she had in mind. Superman aided with his own heat vision. While it doesn't do much damage to the creature, it does annoy it enough to force it in another direction. Tag-teaming their powers, they are able to lead the salamander-monster on a path straight for the containment vessel. Despite its reluctance to go into an area it knows is a dead end, the creature is forced into the containment vessel, and the Japanese lock the door. It's at least heat resistant, and their plan is to put it at the bottom of the ocean, where it can slumber peacefully without causing more damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with the situation handled, Superman and Power Girl land down on the ground to a crowd of relieved citizens. They proceed to answer a few questions from waiting reporters, accept a few thanks from citizens, and reassure the crowds that these monsters have been taken care of and will not wreak havoc again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you, Lois, and Jon rejoin the crowds, getting out from your cover spots. You all wait patiently for the two Kryptonians to finish up their duties as superheroes. Pretty soon, Clark and Karen rejoin you. \"Not how I planned for us to spend a family vacation,\" Karen said a little breathlessly. \"Looks like Starrware is going to be making another donation towards helping to rebuild.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" you ask. \"You seem a little...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, fine,\" she says, clearly sounding winded. \"It's just getting to be a lot of work these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's no wonder,\" Lois adds. \"Those two little ones are taking up a lot of your energy. Have you considered when you're going to be going on bedrest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren sighs. \"Well, we haven't talked about it yet. But, I mean, trouble isn't going to stop just because I'm making plans for motherhood. Who's going to keep Tokyo safe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois puts a hand on her shoulder. \"I know, but you do have to realize you're going to be feeling it a lot more with twins. You'll probably have to start resting sooner. I'm sure Clark, or any of his contacts would be more than happy to help out around here. After all, your kids need to come first. You want them to be healthy and everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, maybe we'll talk more about this before you guys leave,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark, of course, returns to business as usual. \"You've had several of these kaiju attacks in a short period of time. Are you sure it's only a coincidence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gives you reason to ponder. You were never one for conspiracy theories before, but you do find it a bit more than unusual that so many attacks have happened in a short span of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren ponders for a moment. \"You don't really think someone would honestly be setting these monsters on the city on purpose? I mean, how would they even have access to them, let alone control them. And what would be the point? If Power Girl's handled them every time, what would be the point of trying the same technique over and over again. That's like the definition of insanity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugs. \"I don't know. It's just a thought. I may want to look into this more. I do have some connections with the Gotham Bat.\" He says this with a slight tinge of bitterness, as if he's want to contact him. \"He has a background with detective work. He may be able to provide some persepctive on the matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren nods. \"It can't hurt, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pudgy gut starts to growl with ferocity. \"But, I think dinner's going to be my top priority for now,\" she adds with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou agree. \"It probably would help you perk up a little after all of that. So, where did you want to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thinks for a moment, pondering all the delicious options.</span></div></div>",

After all, Karen definitely deserved a bit of a break from all that fighting against Kaiju and criminals for a week or two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, knowing Karen and her established appetite, she certainly had ordered more than large handfuls of food, due to a combination of an increased appetite and being pregnant with twins. On the other hand, you, Clark, Lois, and Jon ordered an average amount of food for yourselves, whilst the four of you began to converse some, as you spoke toward Clark and asked, \"...So, how are things going back in the U.S, Clark?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Surprisingly well, all things considering, (Name). My family and I had just moved back into Metropolis, even though Jon was initially against moving, since he had made friends with some of the kids in Hamilton.\" Clark answered, where he then continued slurping up some of the Soba noodles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Lois then spoke toward you and said, \"Though I must admit, (Name), we didn't expect Karen here to get so...\"Rubenesque\" when we first arrived here in Japan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, Lois was being delicate yet polite regarding the sensitive topic of Karen's substantially larger and bulkier physique. But of course, knowing Karen, she easily knew what Lois was referring to, as she voraciously slurped down another large bowl of Soba noodles, then spoke back toward Lois and bluntly retorted, \"Yes, I get it already, Lois: I've gotten pretty fat. But hey, (Name) here has been taking great care of me throughout my pregnancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Which we are grateful for, Karen. Lois here is just merely worried about your physical health, that's all.\" Clark answered, successfully defusing the subtle tension between the two women, as you attempted to calm down Karen by your own hands. After all, you knew Karen enough to know that she can rather blunt, straightforward, and direct when it comes to conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, shortly after both women had calm down, you spoke to Clark once more and asked, \"So...out of curiosity, what's it like having a child that's Half-Kryptonian? I mean, Karen and I are a few months away from having two Half-Kryptonian twin girls, and we kinda want to know how to handle them if their powers start to emerge.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Clark contemplated on how he should explain something as heavy as this to you and Karen, but eventually, after a minute of contemplation...</span></div></div>",

That isn't exactly a comforting thought. You're especially nervous because you'll be having to deal with twice that kind of fun. \"Um, when did that happen exactly?\" You don't like the thought of having a toddler going through the terrible two's while blasting things with heat vision or throwing things around with super strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark laughs. \"Jon was in school by then. True, he was young, but it was still a time when he was old enough for us to talk about his powers. But, as new powers come up, you're going to have to be prepared for whatever consequences come with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren notices your discomfort. \"It's not going to be that bad. Usually when those things happen for the first time, they're not going to be at full strength. We'll have time to talk to them and properly train them. I wouldn't worry so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, the only real challenge is just dealing with how everyone else is going to react. People can be a bit dodgy about those things, and when they're scared of your kid, then your kid gets scared of their powers. Makes our jobs as parents that much harder,\" he continues. \"I can't tell you how many times teachers have called me in to have a 'talk' about Jon, and the whole matter could have been easily solved if everyone had just stayed calm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren nods in agreement. \"Yeah, I think that's the hardest part for any of us. Look, it's no offense to you, but it's just part of us being from another planet. Sure, people appreciate what we do, but they always secretly fear what we're capable of, and it can get isolating at times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois adds, \"True, and I think the best thing you can do is accept that these two girls aren't going to have a very human childhood, but it's their childhood nonetheless. So, you might as well make the most of it for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, I'm just not sure how well I'd do at it,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren pats your hand. \"I know you'll do just fine. You're kind of a kid at heart anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing up dinner, you head back to the apartment for some much-needed rest after everything that had gone on that day. Clark and his family get settled into the guest room, and you go to bed with Karen. \"You're not worried about being a dad are you?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda, why? I mean, it's normal for any future parent to worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, but I mean, that stuff Clark said today. You know it's not really going to be that bad. I think sometimes he exaggerates just to get under your skin sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyebrows raise in surprise. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know him. He's kind of like an older brother to me sometimes, and so that makes you the big bad boyfriend taking his precious sister away from him. It's just a natural reaction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug it off. \"Yeah, I've got a sister that I do to sometimes. I get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb into bed. She continues, \"I really think we can manage most of this. Yeah, powers can get scary and everything, but it really isn't bad if you just keep your cool, like he said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you agree. \"So, are they like mad about you being big and all?\" You kind of got those vibes throughout the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's just something they're not used to seeing,\" she says, rubbing her rounded middle. I mean, I was pretty thin before I met you. It's hard for them to understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snuggle closer to her. \"So, what's the plan for tomorrow?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolls over as best she can to face you. \"I think our best bet is to divide and conquer.

After all, despite only being in this new reality for a few short weeks, you rather enjoyed and adored Power Girl's newly established heft and girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, in response to you unfounded worries, Karen casually rolled her eyes, then proceeded to sit up, where she then placed herself on top of you in a knelt sitting position, her thick blubbery smooth thighs straddling your lower half with little to no effort, as she spoke into your ear with a flirty tone in her voice and retorted, \"*chuckle* Fat chance, (Name).\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, sure this was bound to happen eventually with all the food you're giving me. But hey, I'm certainly not complaining about it, that's for sure.\" Karen explained, where she then began to blush profusely, her plump facial cheeks taking on a light red hue in response to such blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, as she subconsciously made a few circles on the front of her profound belly, Karen then hesitantly confessed, \"...Though, with all honesty, honey, I, um... I-I actually really like being this big. Was I shocked to hear you like girls at my current size? Of course I was! But... I've already started to see the appeal of being a few hundred pounds heavier. Even if it is more difficult to do stuff without using my Kryptonian abilities and not having to make up a convoluted explanation.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... I'm taking that as a Yes, then? That you'll be staying at your current weight?\" You asked, where she then began to casually lean forward, her large doughy belly leisurely pressing against your crotch and abdomen like a heavy blanket. From there, Karen then calmly yet seductively whispered into your ear and chirped, \"...Damn straight, sweetie. Now, what do you say you give me one of your homemade belly rubs?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, the two of you began to passionately kiss one another, while you proceeded to tenderly knead and rub Karen's bulbous apron of a belly with relative ease. Such love-making lasted for an hour or two before you both succumbed to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-- The Next Day --</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting some breakfast alongside Karen and the Kent Family at the apartment loft, you and Karen decided to go with the original plan, with you taking Lois and Jon around Tokyo for some tourist sightseeing, while Karen would have her \"talk\" with her cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, much like his father, Jon had to wear a pair faux glasses as to avoid being recognized as the new Superboy, as you drove the SUV with Lois and Jon in the passenger seats. Thankfully, traffic was fairly light during the morning hours. But as the three of you were a good distance away from the apartment high rise, you then spoke toward both Lois and Jon as you curiously asked, \"...So, any places you would love to visit here while we're out and about, Lois?

I know what you're talking about, Jon. In fact, I happen to be friends with a guy who so happens to be a store manager over at Gundam Base Tokyo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute?! How do I even know this!?!\" Your subconscious exclaimed inside your mind, which still had remnants of your old life prior to being transported to this new reality. Obviously, even though Jon seemed rather intrigued at such a revelation, Lois looked at you with a slightly confused expression and queried, \"Gundam Base...Tokyo? Never heard of a store like that before until now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*chuckle* That's the funny but interesting thing about Japan, Lois: The Japanese Animation Industry has a huge fan following here in the Land of the Rising Sun. And one of the biggest franchises is what Jon here just mentioned: Mobile Suit Gundam.\" You explained a little, as you drove the SUV onto the Freeway, which was en route to the Gundam Base Tokyo building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the way, you then spoke toward Jon once more and asked, \"So, Jon? Why the interest in the Gundam franchise?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Um... I made friends with some of the other kids over at Metropolis Junior High. Some of them are fans of that show, even though my Mom doesn't think I should be watching it until I'm 13.\" Jon retorted, letting you know of his mother's somewhat disapproval of watching such a show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you could understand where both Jon and Lois were coming from, as you spoke toward Jon while keeping your eyes on the Freeway as you answered, \"...Well, I certainly don't blame your mother for protecting you, Jon. I mean, I was around your age when I first saw Gundam Wing on TV for the first time, and I didn't understand some of the reasons behind all that fighting until I was older.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gundam...Wing? Never heard of it before.\" Jon quipped, where you then quickly replied, \"Yeah, it was around before you were born, Jon. But hey, it was what got me and a few of my friends into Gundam in the first place, much like how you and your friends are watching...Which Gundam series did you and your friends watch?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I think it's called \"Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans\" or something similar.\" Jon answered, just as you saw the Gundam Base Tokyo building come into clear view on the left. \"See that building over there?\" You chirped,  pointing to the building. \"That's Gundam Base Tokyo.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Jon looked out the window and saw the aforementioned building just a short distance away. And standing in front of the building, was a life-sized 64 foot tall replica statue of the Unicorn Gundam from Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn. Suffice to say, you could tell that Jon was in some semblance of awe upon laying eyes on the area just beliiw the three of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-- 30 Minutes Later --</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you drove the SUV off onto the nearest Freeway exit and made your way over toward the Gundam Base Tokyo's parking lot, with you, Lois, and Jon exiting from the vehicle and proceeding toward the building. Once inside, both Lois and Jon were surprised to see how vast the place was in it's entirety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after much exploring through the building itself, you led the group over to the designated store that your \"friend\" just so happened to be the store manager of.</span></div></div>",

Once her Half-Kryptonian son was out of earshot, Lois then began to speak toward you and asked, \"*sigh* So... How has Karen been faring before Clark, Jon, and I had arrived?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Um... Sh-She's been pretty good. You know, all things considering, Lois.\" You stammered a little, casually rubbing the back of your head momentarily. Of course, you instinctively figured that it would be either her or the incognito Man of Steel that will bring up a certain...\"topic\": Karen's (AKA Power Girl's) current *ahem* \"weight\", shall we say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm guessing that she is happy at her current, um... \"Size\". Right?\" Lois queried, putting such an expected topic to the forefront of the conversation. Obviously, Lois seemed a little hesitant to bring up Karen's weight, most likely out of being polite toward her husband's cousin's choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in response to such a question, you looked back at Lois and calmly retorted, \"...Still not comfortable with Karen's new size?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, (Name)! I'm not offended by Karen's new appearance by any means. It's just that...I am concerned about her health. After all, she IS in the middle of being pregnant. I mean, I have heard that women who are obese that become pregnant could experience some... \"unhealthy\" complications, with the fetus and such.\" Lois explained, which seemed to clear things a bit for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, you could see where Lois was coming from with what she said. And yet, due to her incredibly durable Kryptonian physiology, it was so surprise that Karen had a clean bill of health, even if she was currently pregnant with two Half-Kryptonian twin girls. From there, you then spoke toward the Man of Steel's wife and answered, \"...Well, I appreciate your concern for Karen's health, Lois. But thankfully, we just went to a doctor's appointment a week or two ago to get an update on Karen's pregnancy. Turns out we're gonna be having twin girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to such a revelation, Lois was undoubtedly a bit surprised by the news, but then became relieved at such reassurance from you, as she then replied, \"I'm guessing she kept telling you that she can handle a few beatings and that the babies will be fine, did she?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Pretty much. Lois, I get what you're saying and all. To be honest, I sometimes worry about her when she's off to fight the villain of the week or some other major threat to the city. But...for some strange reason, I can oftentimes see that she'll find some way to save the day.\" You confessed, where Lois then placed an understanding hand upon your shoulder, obviously knowing what you've gone through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Lois spoke to you once more, this time with a reassured tone in her voice, as she spoke up and replied, \"...I know how you feel, (Name). After all, it wasn't exactly easy for me when I was married to Clark, and that was after I discovered who he really was underneath. Whether it was fighting off Darkseid with other heroes like himself, saving the world from a global crisis, or even confronting some... \"unsavory\" individuals, I would always worry that one day, one day...He might come back home.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And yet, deep inside, I...I always knew he would find a way to succeed and save the day.\" She said, where Lois then had you face her directly and continued, \"...Listen to me, (Name): There might be times where things will look bleak for Karen, whether it's getting beaten up by some maniacal madman, or if the city will be wiped out in seconds. But at the end of it all, you chose to love Karen, just as much as I love Clark and Jon. They both have went through a lot, and what matters most in the end...is Family.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, Lois's not so little reassurance speech definitely seemed to do the trick for you, as you felt a tad more confident when it came to your relationship with Karen Starr AKA Power Girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back at Lois, nodding in agreement with her words, where you then spoke and answered, \"...Thank you very much, Lois. Your words definitely mean a lot as to what I'm going through.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* Not a problem, (Name)! It was my pleasure. After all, I'm sure you and Karen will become great parents.\" Lois retorted, lightly patting you on the shoulder in reassurance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, after putting her hands off of you, Lois then spoke toward you once more and queried, \"...Say, mind if I ask you something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Lois! What's bugging you?\" You readily answered, where Lois then looked back at you and questioned, \"Look, um... I mean no disrespect toward you and Karen, but... Does Karen, um, you know... like being so \"Rubenesque\"?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, you could see that Lois was doing her damnedest not to sound so offensive with such a sensitive topic.

I mean, I'm not some sadistic pedophile or anything as such, it just...happens, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--I get what you're saying here, (Name). But still...

And with that concluded, you, Lois, and Jon proceeded toward the Gundam Base Tokyo building main exit, all set to return to the apartment condo that you and Karen live in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-- Ten Minutes Later --</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, the three of you were now currently in your SUV, driving along the Freeway back towards the apartment condo. Instead of opening the box right there inside the vehicle, Jon decided to wait until the group was back at Karen's apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, in an attempt to stir up a conversation inside the vehicle, Lois curiously spoke toward you and asked, \"...So, (Name). When will you bring up the big question for Karen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you obviously knew what Lois was referring to: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was asking when you were going to ask for Karen's hand in marriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honesty, it kinda slipped your mind until Lois brought it up, as you exhaled a sigh and answered, \"...To be honest, Lois, I...I was going to wait until after Karen had given birth. I mean, I don't even have an engagement ring yet, let alone one big enough to fit around her ring finger.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, Lois could tell that you were subtly referring to Karen's now slightly chubbier fingers, but she easily understood what you were saying, as she then reassured you and replied, \"Don't worry, (Name). I'm sure you'll find the right time to ask her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the three of you had returned to the apartment condo, as you drove the SUV into the Basement Parking Lot, where you, Lois, and Jon got out of the SUV and entered the elevator leading up to the apartment condo that you and Karen live in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you, Lois, and Jon had returned to the apartment condo, the three of you were greeted to the sight of...</span></div></div>",

Instead of wearing her enlarged beige turtleneck sweater and form-fitting blue sweatpants, Karen was currently wearing her Power Girl, only it was just her white one-piece leotard, with her short red cape, blue gloves and blue boots still adorned upon the obese mannequin hidden behind the bookcase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what stuck out the most about this situation was that Clark was using some sort of highly advanced alien-looking scanner, as well as what appeared to be a rather lanky alien-looking bipedal robot standing beside Clark and Karen. Currently, Karen was calmly yet casually sitting on the Kitchen's Island countertop, using her Kryptonian Flight to avoid putting her full weight upon the Island countertop and accidentally crushing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, being curious as to what exactly was going on here, you spoke up toward both Clark and Karen, letting both your presence and Lois and Jon's presences be known to the two Kryptonian cousins, as you questioned, \"Alright, what did we miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, your quip easily caught the attention of both Clark and Karen, as Karen easily displayed a soft reassured grin upon her somewhat plump face, obviously feeling a bit relieved to see you, where Clark then spoke toward you and calmly retorted, \"...A lot, apparently.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened, Clark? And why is one of your robots from the Fortress of Solitude here in Karen's apartment?\" Lois asked, obviously noticing that one of Clark's Kryptonian automatons was here as well, just as Karen then casually dismounted her rotund self from the Kitchen Island, then calmly hovered her way toward you, landing before you, then proceeded to wrapped her meaty arms around your neck in a hefty embrace out of reassurance for a brief moment or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Karen then disengaged her hug upon you and explained, \"Sorry to get you worried, honey. I guess the kids are starting to inherit some of their mother's powers before they're out of the womb.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?!\" You said, obviously taken aback slightly by what you just heard from Karen, where you then, out of parental and marital concern, spoke toward Karen and asked, \"You're not hurt, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't worry too much, (Name). Karen's alright, it appears that your unborn twins seem to be developing their Kryptonian abilities much sooner than expected.\" Clark elaborated, which gave you some semblance of relief that Karen was relatively alright. And yet, when Clark said that the unborn twins developing inside Karen's stomach were beginning to slowly develop their Kryptonian abilities.</span></div></div>",

Some of them will assist you in protecting Tokyo in any future Kaiju attacks.\" Clark elaborated, speaking towards his substantially heftier cousin, Karen Starr (better known as \"Power Girl\"), who was currently devouring her second large snack, all whilst she keenly listened to her more well-known cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a heavy gulp, she swallowed a big slice of Extra-large Akiba Pizza, as it's contents slid down her gullet and fell into her waiting stomach. From there, she looked back at Clark and queried, \"...And Atlee? How is she faring in New York without me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, Clark could see that Karen was both curious and concerned about her ward slash sidekick, Atlee, who happened to be the latest individual to take up the superhero title \"Terra\". In response, Clark placed a reassuring hand upon Karen's plump left shoulder and answered, \"...She seems to be doing rather well. Jay Garrick just told me that she's become an invaluable member of the JSA. And that she misses you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh! Well, that's certainly good to hear, Kal. So, got any idea who's sending all these Kaiju here?\" Karen questioned, referring Clark by his Kryptonian birth name, Kal-El. After all, they both originated from the planet Krypton, not to mention they share the same abilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pondering for a brief moment or two, Clark then looked back at Karen and elaborated, \"...Well, from what the Gotham Bat had explained to me while you were, erm... \"preoccupied\", he explained to me that this might be the ploy of one of your villains, Kara. I think your situation reminds him of what happened during a certain... \"event\", in his career.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Karen had this look on her plump face, one akin to that of experiencing a bad gut feeling, which prompted Karen to exhale a deep sigh and she replied, \"...*sigh*...I can think of a FEW people who still have a grudge on me--- AAAGH!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Karen was speaking, she felt this sudden surge of intense heat hitting her on the left side of her bulbous yet pregnant stomach. However, instead of feeling the intense heat against her skin, Karen felt said intense heat from INSIDE her stomach! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-- 30 Minutes Later, Now --</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And that's what Kara and I are doing here for the past five minutes.\" Clark finished, explaining what had transpired in the past half hour prior to you, Lois, and Jon returning to the apartment condo. Of course, you soon spoke up toward Karen and asked, \"...And I'm guessing that what the twins did have something to do with you wearing your Power Girl leotard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Turns out turtleneck sweaters are NOT flame-retardant, so I had to change into my Power Girl leotard since it's highly heat-resistant. Y'know, just in case the twins decide to play \"Heat Vision Tag\" with their mother.\" Karen shrugged, jokingly remarking about that \"Heat Vision Tag\" comment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you couldn't help but become internally concerned, especially with the fact that all of these Kaiju attacks were most likely coordinated by one of Power Girl's enemies, where you then looked at Karen and asked, \"...Any idea who would be capable of this, Karen? I mean, you've said so yourself: \"You've made a good amount of enemies\".\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting a slightly plump hand to her chin and double chin for a moment or two, Karen contemplated as to who would be capable of controlling and/or manipulating several giant monsters.

But after much contemplation, Karen soon spoke back to you and the rest of the group and answered, \"...Considering that these Kaiju are basically animals the size of a small mountain, there's only one person that certainly rings a bell: Sara Descarl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, just as Karen said the name Sara Descarl, you began to experience a brief but very vivid flashback, which got you up to speed as to who the rotund Karen Starr was referring to: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara Descarl. Though she's better known by her villain alias, \"Satana\". From what your \"False\" memories of dating Power Girl in her secret identity have explained to you, Satana was actually the girlfriend of one Gerard Shugel,  better known as \"Ultra-Humanite\", a highly intelligent but terminally ill man who had transferred his brain into that of a massive albino gorilla, which was aided by Satana, who had romantic affections toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Gerard Shugel obviously had no solid connection to the original Ultra-Humanite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow as for how he became enemies with your corpulent yet pregnant girlfriend, Ultra-Humanite attempted to perform a brain transplant on Power Girl, transferring his brain into Power Girl's body. And this was before you started dating her. Fortunately, Power Girl was able to free herself and defeat Ultra-Humanite, but ultimately sent him to Blackgate Penitentiary after Ultra-Humanite became severely injured by Power Girl's Heat Vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this made Satana hellbent on exacting revenge on Power Girl, sending an army of genetically-modified anthropomorphic animals (including some experimented Thanagarian Man-Hawks) after Power Girl, which was actually a distraction to kidnap Atlee, the new Terra, and transfer Ultra-Humanite's brain into Atlee's body. It was ultimately a failure, which resulted in Satana's left arm getting cut off by Power Girl's Heat Vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Satana? As in The Ultra-Humanite's girlfriend? Didn't you cut her left arm off and tossed her crazy boyfriend in Blackgate?\" You questioned, where Karen then nodded in confirmation as she explained, \"...Yeah, pretty much, hon. And if I was betting on my demise, I would want to get someone just as strong and powerful on my side.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And where do you think she is now?\" Lois questioned, obviously concerned for Karen as well, considering how dangerous Satana now was if she truly was the one controlling some of the Kaiju. Karen was now standing at the main apartment skyline window, which overlooked the city of Tokyo, her doughy arms crossed out of concern, not just for her own well-being, but also for your safety as well (And also that of Lois and Jon's if Satana launches an attack before Clark and his family leave a few days from now). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you could somehow always tell when she's upset about something, as you calmly approach from behind her and said, \"...You're worried about me getting caught in the crossfire, aren't you Karen?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* ...To be honest? Yeah.\" Karen bluntly stated, a sense of worry clearly seen on her. Of course, Clark can clearly see that the two of you need some time alone to sort things out, so he motioned Lois and Jon into the other room, thus giving you and Karen some much needed personal space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, this was something you and Karen needed to sort out personally.</span></div></div>",

To you and the corpulent Karen Starr, two weeks had flown by surprisingly quick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week after Clark and his family had arrived in Tokyo for a family get-together, they left just as they came seven days later. Suffice to say, they certainly enjoyed their time here in Japan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut right now, you were currently spending some quality time with Karen, spending said quality time on a rather romantic date night. Although Tokyo wasn't known for housing heftier residents (Aside from the average Sumo Wrestler), you did manage to find a suitable restaurant that can certainly handle someone of Karen's size and girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe restaurant in question was known as \"Okada-Sensei's Cuisine Shrine\", and it was a well-reputable place of business, especially for those in Tokyo who have a hefty appetite. On the outside, it was designed to look like a replica of the Meiji Shrine, while the interior had a Edo Period decor style to it, complete with the waitresses all dressed up in romanticized Shrine Maiden uniforms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, Karen certainly admired the historical aesthetic the restaurant was going with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, you were wearing a three-piece formal suit, complete with red button-up vest over a white dress shirt, but with the sleeves rolled halfway up your arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Karen on the other hand, she (mildly reluctantly) was all dolled up in what appeared to be a blue and white kimono, which was custom-tailored to properly accommodate upon her rotund frame. Normally, she would've preferred to wear an evening dress, but you consistently asked if she would wear the kimono, since you got it for her as a gift for the upcoming Kamakura Festival, which was celebrated on the second and third Sundays of April.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Suffice to say, she certainly looked beautiful in such an outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, whilst Karen was consuming a good amount of food, you were contemplating about what Clark had said to you the night before he, Lois, and Jon returned to Metropolis...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-- Karen Starr's Apartment --</b><br>\r\n<b>-- A Week &amp; A Day Ago --</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNight had fallen upon the city of Tokyo, as the skyline lit up in an almost dazzling display, Currently, you stood on the spacious balcony of your apartment condo, leaning on the railing, as you absentmindedly overlook the sprawling Japanese metropolis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You alright there, (Name)?\" A voice rang out from behind you, which you easily recognized as Superman, who was currently in his Clark Kent persona, glasses and all. You turned your head to look at him as he approached you, where you then spoke to him and answered, \"Oh! Um..I-I'm fine, Clark. It's just that I needed to get some fresh air, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I understand how you feel. After all, it wasn't easy for me to reveal who I really was to Lois after some time had passed.\" Clark retorted, placing his hands on the balcony railing, standing beside you as the two of you gazed over the Tokyo skyline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief moment of silence between the two of you, where Clark then abruptly ended the silence, as he spoke toward you with a calm sensible demeanor and asked, \"...(Name), do you mind if I ask you something? I never got the chance to do so before you and Karen moved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Fire away.\" You casually replied, bracing yourself for whatever question the Man of Steel was about to ask you. From there, Clark then exhaled a deep breath and queried, \"...(Name), be honest with me: How much do you care about my cousin, Kara Zor-El?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you knew that when Clark was using Karen's Kryptionian name, you figured that it must be a serious question, where you turned your head to look back at Clark, exhaling a deep sigh and fiercely answered, \"...Clark: I truly LOVE Karen with every fiber of my being. It doesn't matter to me if she weighs 200 pounds or half a ton, I still love her. I want to make her feel like she's the most important person in my life, whether we're out in public or in bed together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, as if you could tell that he was using his X-Ray Vision to see if you were lying or not via your pulse and heartbeat, Clark then looked back at you with a somewhat reassured expression on his stoic face, where he then spoke toward you once more and asked, \"...Are you absolutely sure of yourself, (Name)? After all, the lifestyle that Kara and I had chose could put you in life-threatening situations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you could obviously tell that Clark was subtly referring to the lifestyles that he and Karen have chosen, as the heroes known as \"Superman\" and \"Power Girl\", which you understood all too well from some of Karen's \"Worry Lectures\". After all, if one of her enemies, such as Ultra-Humanite or Satana, ever found out that you were close to Power Girl, they would target you to get to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in response to what Clark had just said to you, you stood up from the railing, turned around to face him, bearing a determined look in your eyes and replied, \"...I appreciate your concern, Clark. However, that won't change my mind on how I feel about Karen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with such a confirmation from you, Clark patted you on the shoulder in reassurance and replied, \"...You're a loyal individual, (Name). I'm just glad to see that Kara has found someone who is willing to have a serious relationship with her. You know, I'm only doing this out of concern for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. She's family, and family's important, considering what had happened to you and Karen, and what you two had to endure. I just hope I can live up to her expectations. I mean, I plan on asking her to marry me eventually.\" You said, thankful for Clark accepting your love for Karen, as you divulge to him on what you had in store for your future with Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Clark didn't seem fazed by what you said, almost as if it reminded him of his relationship with Lois prior to Jon's birth. So, he spoke toward you and queried, \"Oh? And when will you pop the question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I was thinking of asking her as soon as possible. Y'know, before the twins are born. However, the only problem is that I haven't found the perfect ring for her.\" You answered, elaborating on what your plans were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I think I can help you with that, (Name).\" Clark quipped, where he turned his head to the right, looking at Karen, Lois, and Jon, who were currently watching a movie on Karen's massive Flatscreen TV, just to make sure they were distracted.

From there, Clark then dug into his pants pockets and pulled out what apoeared to be a pair of finely ornamented engagement rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Clark at some semblance of confusion as he presented them to you, where you then spoke to him and asked, \"...You're giving me a pair of engagement rings?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not just an ordinary pair of engagement rings, (Name). Take a closer look.\" Clark answered, where you then promptly picked up one of the two rings that Clark presented you, examining it very closely. It beared an audacious blue sheen to it, but upon examining it further, you soon recognize something adorned on it:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA visible engraving in the form of Superman's insignia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, from what Karen and your \"False\" memories have explained to you, the diamond S wasn't just Superman's trademark emblem, it was also Clark and Karen's family crest, The House of El.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back at Clark with a sense of astonishment on your face, as You soon spoke to him and chirped, \"My god... These rings are family heirlooms, aren't they?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark nodded in confirmation. \"You're correct, (Name). These engagement rings are one of the last remaining family heirlooms of the House of El that were recovered and preserved before Krypton's destruction. Surprisingly, marriage customs on Krypton are surprisingly similar to those on Earth.\" Clark explained, confirming what you had suspected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Clark continued speaking as he said, \"(Name), over the past week, I have seen that you and Kara have become intimately close. And you have proven that you can handle yourself when Kara is Power Girl. I would like you to use these rings when you propose to her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, you couldn't help but become practically speechless at what the Man of Steel was giving you. After all, he was giving you a family heirloom as a way to assist you in your engagement proposal to Karen. In response to what Clark had proposed to you, you instinctively blurted, \"...Clark, I...I can't take these rings. I mean, don't get me wrong, I apooreciate what you're doing, but... I just can't take them. These belonged to your family lineage, and I don't want to be taking something that us so important you and Karen, considering what the two of you had went through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand your reasoning, (Name). I know you're trying to sound considerate and all, after what happened to me and Kara. But still, I'd like to believe that Krypton still lives on with our families. After all, I have Lois and Jon, while Kara has you and the soon-to-be-born twins.\" Clark gestured, which convinced you somewhat to at least take the rings as a gesture of good faith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-- Present Day --</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back in present day, you contemplated on when you should properly propose to Jjaren with the House of El rings that Clark gave you, as you saw that Karen was nearly finished with voraciously devouring another plate of delectable cuisine, finishing up with a set of playful pats upon her downright stuffed apron belly, bearing a contentful smile upon her plump cherubic face. </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile, back in present day, you contemplated on when you should properly propose to Karen with the House of El rings that Clark gave you, as you saw that Karen was nearly finished with voraciously devouring another plate of delectable cuisine, finishing up with a set of playful pats upon her downright stuffed apron belly, bearing a contentful smile upon her plump cherubic face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was certainly tasty, but not as good as your cooking if I do say so myself, sweetie.\" Karen complimented, leaning back a little in her chair, which caused it to creak and groan a smidge under her substantially larger physique. Of course, knowing her, Karen had always preferred your cooking over going to a restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, she noticed how you appeared to be somewhat distracted, where she looked at you with a mildly concerned expression on her plump face and queried, \"...Hey. Is everything...alright, (Name)? You seem to be rather... \"distracted\" about something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Um... Sorry about that, Karen. I've... got a lot on my mind, that's all.\" You retorted, snapping out of your daze, courtesy of Karen Starr. Obviously, Karen didn't seem all that convinced that you were worrying about something minor, as she looked at you with a rather stern expression, despite the plump rounded physique of her face. Then, she crossed her thick plump arms in response and said, \"...Come on, hun. We both know you're a horrible liar, and I can tell if you're lying from examining your heartbeat. So, care to divulge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, due to her Kryptonian abilities, Karen could easily see right through your words, where you then exhaled a sigh and ultimately confessed, \"...Karen, I, um...have a confession to make--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly, before you could even say another word, both you, Karen, and everyone in the restaurant heard a series of explosive noises, followed by the sounds of numerous people screaming and running for their lives, most of them screaming \"Kaiju!! Kaiju!!\" in Japanese. Both you and Karen then quickly headed out of the restaurant to investigate, which revealed to be as what the panicked masses have deduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*frustrated sigh* Can't even get a damn break, Can I?! *sigh* Well, time to get to work, then.\" Karen muttered, obviously a tad frustrated at what was occurring before her. In response, you quickly spoke to her and replied, \"Okay, I'll try and get these people to evacuate while you do your thing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, you were also frustrated at such an impromptu moment towards preventing you from popping the question to Karen, as the rotund blonde quickly went into a nearby alleyway to change into Power Girl, while you had the people evacuate from the restaurant as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-- Meanwhile... --</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, along the Tokyo skyline, Power Girl quickly flew off towards the source of the disturbances. However, as she approached where the Kaiju would be, she was suddenly attacked from the side in a blitz attack! It came out of nowhere, but before she could even recover, the Kaiju suddenly grabbed her and pinned her against one of the nearby skyscrapers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, she could easily break out of the monster's grip, but she was then assaulted by something blunt to the side of her head, momentarily disorienting her for a brief respite, where she then heard a smug womanly voice speak to her as it said, \"Hello, Power Girl. We have much catching up to do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, Karen beared a scold on her face, as she looked up to see who had restrained her. In appearance, she was a woman with short black hair and purple and red eyes. But the most distinguishing feature was the somewhat bulky suit of leopard-printed Power Armor she currently wore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Karen easily recognized who she was confronting, as she growled, \"...Satanna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, glad to see that you remember me. Though, I must say, you're certainly more... \"Rubenesque\", than our previous encounter. Did you decide to become a Sumo Wrestler during your stay here? *sadistic chuckle*\" Satanna quipped, obviously remarking about Karen's increased weight. But of course, Power Girl retorted back with her own savage remark and bluntly said, \"...That's none of your damn business. And besides, I carry this weight MUCH better than you do, Descarl!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in response to such a snide remark, Satanna bashed her with a massive two-handed high-tech hammer in her grasp, which seemed to heavily disorient Karen even more. Of course, you saw what was going on as you made your way out of the building. You became extremely worried as you then realized who was attempting to bash Karen's brains in: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara Descarl, better known as \"Satanna\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd from the looks of things, she was most likely the one who sent all those Kaiju after her in the first place! After all, she appeared to have some sort of Killer Whale Kaiju to assist her in restraining Power Girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://kaijucombat.com/wiki/doku.php?id=ckc_monster_list:orzul\" target=\"_blank\">http://kaijucombat.com/wiki/doku.php?id=...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as Satanna bashed at her head with a high-tech hammer, she felt this negative energy being emitted against her. Of course, she soon realize what it was that Satanna was hitting her with: Red Solar Radiation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the effects of a Yellow Sun or a Blue Sun, instead of enhancing her powers, Red Solar Radiation has the opposite effect on Kryptonians, substantially weakening them. And unfortunately for her, Power Girl was Kryptonian, and she could feel the negative effects of being exposed to Red Solar Radiation, as she could barely push against the Kaiju's massive hand to free herself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile, back on street level, you easily notice that for some strange reason Karen wasn't retaliating in force like she usually does. Of course, the subconscious synapses in your mind was blaring out numerous red flags to tell you that something was DEFINITELY wrong, as you watched as Satanna kept bashing at Power Girl with that high-tech hammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figured that Power Girl's submissive state was somehow connected to that hammer Satanna was wielding, which meant that you had to do something and fast. Off to your right, you saw a nearby police officer about to aim his gun at the villainess, so you instinctively rushed toward the officer, yanked the gun out of his grasp, and then fired a shot at Satanna, which grazed the plating of her Leopard-Patterned Power Armor, which easily got Satanna's attention as you yelled, \"HEY!! OVER HERE, YOU CRAZY BITCH!!! HOW ABOUT YOU PICK ON SOMEONE WHO HAS A BIGGER EGO THAN YOU!?!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name), what the hell are you doing?!\" Karen thought, as she witnessed what you were doing, which seemed to be getting on Satanna's nerves quite easily, where the villainess then looked back the massive Killer Whale Kaiju and growlingly commanded, \"Orzul: Keep Power Girl restrained! I have an insolent annoyance to crush.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if it was a loyal soldier, the giant Killer Whale Kaiju (now known to be called \"Orzul\") nodded it's Orca head in confirmation, as Satanna then leapt off the creature's elongated arm, falling toward street level with a crater-making KRAKOOM!! in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, she stood up from where she landed, wielding the high-tech hammer in her hands, lightly smacking the hammer's head against her Power Armor gauntlet twice or thrice, slowly approaching you in a eerily calm manner as she growled, \"...Now, what did you just call me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me, you hammer-wielding psycho: I called you a crazy bitch!\" You quipped, raising your arms out to the sides in a taunting manner, where you then continued, \"Are you gonna just stand there for posture, or are you going to prove me wrong, you Lex Luthor wannabe!?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood news: You managed to grab Satanna's attention. The bad news, however, is that she wants to bash your brains in with that hammer of her's, as you then began to haul ass into a nearby alleyway, with Satanna hot on your trail, causing loads of collateral damage in her determination to rip you a new one, but at least she isn't focused on Power Girl for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bobbed and weaved through the alleyways, avoiding Satanna's attacks to the best of your ability. However, for a brief moment, you lost Satanna for a second or two, only for her to flank you by barreling through a nearby wall, where she then grabbed you by the throat and pinned you against the side of a building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled somewhat to free yourself, but Satanna tightened her grip, sneering at you as she said, \"Not so tough now when you're held by the throat, huh? Now, who are YOU to confront me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*grunt* Name's John Doe, and you can kiss my ass, you psycho!!\" You growled, taunting her with a false alias, which Satanna rewarded you by bashing the head of her hammer against your gut, causing you to spit out a bit of blood in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must think you're quite brave, saving a self-aggrandizing bitch who fancies herself as a so-called \"Hero\".\" Satanna retorted, which only embolden your resolve to help buy Power Girl some time to recover her strength, as you then mocked the villainess some more as you then taunted, \"And here I am, being lectured by a woman who's head over heels with a crazed lunatic who transferred his brain into a Gorilla. Face it, Satanna: Power Girl is better than you and that damn dirty ape boyfriend of yours!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously now more pissed off thanks to your insults, Satanna bashed you with her hammer once more, then violently tossed through another wall, launching you through it, as you then painfully skidded against the street pavement, blood dripping down the side of your face, as you sluggishly stood up onto your own two feet, as Satanna calmly approached you, where you then raised your fists into a combative stance, despite your bloodied and bruised state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do this all day, you crazy girl. Bring it on!\" You muttered under your breath, as you then recklessly rushed at Satanna, futilely delivering several quick jabs against her armored abdomen, bruising your hands a bit more, which Satanna then rewarded you with a Power Armor booted Push Kick to your sternum, violently launching you into a nearby marketplace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, even through the bruised muscles and broken bones, you knew you had to stall Satanna long enough for Power Girl to recover, as you fought through the pain to stand up once more. However, you soon felt a cold metallic hand grasp around your neck once more, as Satanna now bore a sadistic grin on her face, as gravity increased the pain receptors in your brain from your received injuries, where Satanna then hissed, \"...Any more jesterly jabs  at before I pulverize you into a bloody smear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, as you had always hoped, Power Girl then appeared just nine feet behind Satanna, using her Kryptonian Flight to avoid detection. You looked back at Satanna with a smug look on your bruised face, as you then raised a middle finger towards the armored villainess whilst you spoke in Japanese as you replied, \"...Yeah... Jigoku ni iki, meinu (Go to Hell, bitch).\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly, before Satanna could even figure out what you just said to her, Power Girl swiftly unleashed a powerful Right Hook upon the side of Satanna's head, instantly knocking out the villainess in one clean hit, causing Satanna to collapse to the floor in a loud THUD!!, due to the heavy exosuit she wore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you were about to fall once more onto the floor as well, Power Girl swiftly grabbed and held you aloft, bearing a very concerned look on her face, as you looked at her and she said, \"You...Idiot. What were you thinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*bloody cough* Sorry about that. Was trying to buy you some time, Pee-Gee.\" You apologized, as Power Girl then carefully laid you against a nearby wall, where she then proceeded to easily peel the suit of Power Armor off the unconscious Satanna, balling up the armor and tossing it aside, as you then asked, \"...What about Satanna's pet Kaiju? Shouldn't you be *bloody cough* taking...care of it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I managed to give it a nasty concussion while you were busy with Satanna. The JSDF should arrive very soon.\" Power Girl elaborated, as you slowly but surely began to lose consciousness, most likely from the thrashing Satanna had given you, as you sluggishly replied, \"That's...good to...hear.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head slumped to the side some, as you soon fell unconscious, as the very last thing you heard was Power Girl's voice, which beared an extremely worried tone as she exclaimed, \"...(Name)? (NAME)!?!\"</span></div></div>",

That couldn't be farther from the truth. The last thing you remember before succumbing to exhaustion was seeing that Karen was alright and intact. That was all you were ever worried about while you kept Satanna distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, you couldn't keep yourself awake long enough to see Power Girl carry you to someplace that can heal your wounds, as your life dangled by a thread due to your extensive injuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-- A Few Hours Later... --</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly regained consciousness, hearing the faint beeping sounds of a Hospital I.V Monitor. At first, your vision was blurry at best, but it slowly but surely dilated to compensate for the increased brightness. Eventually, you began to regain basic motor functions in your limbs and muscles, only to feel some of the pain you've received from Satanna, clenching your teeth as you carefully propped yourself up in an angled sitting position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome to think of it, you noticed that you were now inside what apoeared to be a hospital room. You placed a hand against your forehead, noticing that it was properly bandaged to prevent any further bleeding, where you said aloud, \"...Where the hell am I?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in the Justice League Watchtower.\" A voice rang out, which had a masculine yet suave tone to it. In response, you quickly turned your gaze toward the source of the voice, which revealed a rather surprising individual standing in the doorway, arms crossed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, he was undoubtedly African American, with short black hair, and the left upper hemisphere of his head bearing a cybernetic scalp, brow, and a glowing red cybernetic eye, with the rest of him was covered in a metallic cybernetic form. Of course, you soon realize who you were facing, as you stammered, \"Wait, I know you! You're Cyborg! From the Teen Titans!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to your words, he couldn't help but smirk a little upon knowing that you recognize him, as he uncrossed his arms and replied, \"*chuckle* Always nice to meet a fan. Glad to see you didn't suffer any extensive brain damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Brain damage? What're you talking about?\" You asked, as Cyborg walked up to your I.V Monitor and had a holographic Heads-Up Display appear on his cybernetic arm, tapping away at it whilst checking your vitals and explained, \"...Let me recap: You distracted Satanna, in order to buy Power Girl enough time to recover. Gotta say, you're one crazy S.O.B to do something like that on your own, especially since she was wearing a LexCorp Warsuit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, what Cyborg just said definitely jogged your memory enough to remember what had happened to you, where you then became more concerned about Karen, as you then queried, \"...What about Kar--  Er, I mean, Power Girl? Is she alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look to your right.\" He quipped, where you promptly turned your head to your right, only to see a sleeping Power Girl, still wearing her iconic outfit, as she was on her knees, leaning against the hospital bed in an unconscious state. Seeing her relatively unharmed certainly reassured you of your worries, where Cyborg then retorted, \"...Don't worry. I was already well-aware of who she is long before she started dating you, (Name).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...Why did she bring me here instead of a regular hospital, Cyborg?\" You asked, wondering why Karen brought you to the Justice League's headquarters instead of one of the handful of hospitals in Tokyo. Of course, Cupyborg smirked a bit from your question, as he then answered, \"...Well, for one, the nearest hospital from your location was severely damaged by that Killer Whale Kaiju during the initial stages of it's attack. And second, you were badly injured in numerous places and needed immediate medical attention. We're talking about a fractured sternum, mildly fractured scalp, multiple sprained and torn muscles, and a punctured left lung. You're lucky to even be alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what Cyborg just said to you, it sounded like you were more injured than you previously thought, as you gently caressed Karen's mid-length blonde hair out of self-reassurance. From there, you spoke back toward the cybernetic superhero and said, \"...How long was I out?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'd say about 4 hours, 23 minutes, and 15 seconds. Thankfully, the Watchtower is equipped with the most advanced medical equipment in the world, otherwise you would have died from your injuries. Though, you had to be either very brave or reckless to take on someone wearing a LexCorp Warsuit.\" Cyborg elaborated, as he was finished with your medical evaluation and said, \"Okay, then. Your body's reacting positively towards the nanites that were injected into you. With luck, you should heal up in a few days at best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeirdly enough, you weren't in complete shock from learning that they injected nanobots into you. Then again, you had become well-adjusted to this world, so this didn't surprise you whatsoever these days. From there, you saw Cyborg proceed towards the door, whilst he spoke toward you and said, \"...I'll Let you know if anything changes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, you were left alone with a slumbering rotund Power Girl, as you gently stroke her hair with love. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From there, she planted a deep passionate kiss upon your lips, then replied, \"...You stubborn fool... What were you even thinking?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, you could easily tell that she was undoubtedly upset over your actions some hours ago that left you in your current state, where you then let out a light chuckle and quipped, \"What can I say? People do all sorts of crazy things for the ones they love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course, being as blunt as she was in such situations, Karen gave you that famous thousand-mile stare of her's, where you then apologized, \"...Sorry for making you so worried, Karen.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, after a moment or two, Karen couldn't stay mad at you for long, wrapping her thick meaty arms around you once more as she replied, \"I know... You were only doing what you could to protect me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Karen, um... back at that restaurant, there...there was something I wanted to ask you.\" You said, which soon caught Karen's attention, as you sluggishly went for your pants, which were laid out on a nearby table, as Karen worriedly replied, \"...Hey! Take it easy, (Name). You don't have to overexert yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know... But I wanted to confess to you.\" You retorted, which made the rotund superheroine quite confused, cocking a blond eyebrow at you as she asked, \"Confess what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you slowly limped your way back onto the hospital bed, holding some things in your hand, where you then looked at Karen and answered, \"*grunt* Back at the restaurant, before Satanna's attack, I, um...I-I wanted to give you...THESE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, you opened your hand to reveal the two blue Kryptonian engagement rings Clark gave to you to present to Karen. Obviously, Karen had a look of complete surprise on her plump face, putting both of her blue gloved hands in front of her mouth and nose in shock. Then again, there were few things that could legitimately surprise her, given her line of work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-Those rings... H-How did you get them?!\" Karen mildly exclaimed, still getting over the shock of what you were presenting to her. From there, you began to speak with her and confessed, \"Karen... We've been through many things for some time now, whether it was moving from New York to Tokyo, to even me risking my own life to buy you enough time to recover. I don't care if you weigh 200 pounds or half a ton, or if you one day turn into some sort of Human-Animal hybrid. All I care about right now...is to spend the rest of my life with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren took in the romantic words you said to her, still trying to get over the fact that you were now asking her hand in marriage, as you then continued speaking and confessed, \"Karen-- No... Kara Zor-El: Will you do me the honor of being your loving wedded husband?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, despite her initial shock over what was unfolding before her, Karen knew that you were very serious about this when you called her by her Kryptonian name, causing her to shed a tear or two of joy in the process. A brief moment or two later, Karen then swiftly wrapped her bulky arms around you, squeezing you a bit tighter, but not enough to reopen your wounds, then giving you a passionate kiss as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'll take that as a yes, then?\" You asked, where you then felt Karen firmly nod in response, where the two of you were in each other's arms for a few long hours, not wanting to let one another go.</span></div></div>",

It took you more than a few seconds to realize that this had to be Jennifer Walters, the She-Hulk in the flesh and in your bed. And there was so much flesh to be in, which may have helped contribute to why it took you so long to recognize her. Depending on the artist, she had usually been slender to somewhat muscular, but the version sleeping soundly before you was buried in a thick layer of flabby blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pretty face was now cherubic in appearance with plump lips sinking partway into rounded cheeks that flowed into the hefty chin that crowed her thicker neck. Her torpedo like breasts were far beyond any that you had ever seen her with, though her stomach was far larger still, easily more than large enough that it looked like it was holding a full grown person within. Her legs were thick slabs of flesh with thighs that looked like it would take quite a wide footing in order to prevent them from meeting most of the ways to her knees and rounded calves that bunched up against her feet. Even her toes were delightfully plump on those feet. Her arms weren\u2019t spared either, rounded meat that oozed into her elbow both above and below the joint with similarly sausage-like fingers upon her hands. So much of her body was displayed as well, wearing only teeny lacy bra that strained against her mammoth breasts, along with matching panties, though you were only able to see them along the upper curve of her hips due to her stomach pooling in front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after spending more than a little bit visually exploring the mountainous woman that had mysteriously appeared in your bed did you realize that one of her eyes was open and that luminous green eye was looking directly at you. You gulped loudly, so much so that you were sure that she had to have heard it. You started to open your mouth to asking about what was going on, but the words caught in your throat as she propped herself up on one arm. Her extremely long hair was sleep tousled, but still looked gorgeous flowing down about her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething the matter, darlin\u2019?\u201d she asked sleepily. \u201cWhat are you doing out of bed at this time of night?\u201d Then she seemed to realize that the covers were pulled back, exposing much of her body. \u201cHmm\u2026just had to take another look at your beautiful wife, eh?\u201d She giggled lightly, giving you even more of a thrill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everything else, it took your mind a bit longer than it should have to realize what she just said. <i>I\u2019m married to She-Hulk!?</i> you mentally screamed. Before you could even begin to fully process that, the bloated green woman grabbed a hold of your hand and pulled you across her rotund form. You felt her pillow soft body beneath you as you were effortlessly pulled back into bed. She giggled again before she give you a sensual kiss, holding you close as she moved the covers back over the both of you. Try as you might, even her light grasp wouldn\u2019t budge and she was already obviously drifting off to sleep again, her breathing going low and slow. You were obviously not going to get any information now, so the only option you had was to submit to the sleep that was already pulling at your mind. You felt a smile curling your lips as you resumed your previously interrupted slumber.</span></div></div>",

After all, the first thing you saw upon opening your eyes was a bed empty of anyone except you. However, as you pushed yourself up, you could see that the bed was still much wider than it should have been with obvious signs of another person sharing it with you. Turing your attention even further away, you could see how your room wasn\u2019t how you remembered from when you went to sleep at the beginning of last night. The room was larger than before and had furniture to suit having two people rather than just yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA noise made you turn your head; it was coming from your bathroom. Hopping out of the bed, you crept over to the door. Opening just enough to peek through, you saw indisputable proof that you really had She-Hulk living with you: her obese body completely bared in the shower. A portion of your mind pointed out that the bathroom was different as well; much more lavish looking including a step-in shower and adjacent whirlpool tub, but most of your focus was understandably centered on the spectacle within the shower. Through the door, you could see her jade flesh gleaming from the water as she lathered her lengthy hair. As she turned around, you briefly saw the twin mounds of her butt cheeks pressed against the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour trance was only broken when she suddenly said, \u201cI know you\u2019re out there, honey. Glad you\u2019re up though \u2018cause I\u2019m getting hungry.\u201d As if to illustrate her point, you heard a loud grumbling roar that could only be her stomach. She giggled again before continuing, \u201cSee what I mean? Better run off and get started on breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou momentarily thought about ignoring her request and instead joining her, but decided against it, there would apparently be time for that later. Somewhat regretfully, you turned away but not before one last lingering look at the bloated woman that had just popped into your life. This would also give you a chance to see if and how the rest of your home was similarly changed.</span></div></div>",

Now you were in a much longer and wider hall with numerous other doors along its length. Walking along, you checked out some of the other rooms and found rooms like a couple guest bedrooms, guest baths, a swanky office, and a personal gym, among others. One door \u2013 near what must have been the center of the layout \u2013 was locked and nothing you did would budge the door. You were more than a little curious about what lay beyond, but shoved those thoughts aside\u2026for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you came to the living room, itself nearly as large as your old place used to be and worth probably a lot more by just itself from the looks of the furniture and pieces of art. Much of the far wall was a floor to ceiling window overlooking the city skyline outside; something about some of the buildings you could see didn\u2019t feel right, but you couldn\u2019t quite figure out what was wrong though. Now you could see though that the \u201cstreetlight\u201d outside your window last night must have been the lights of the cityscape below your rooftop perch instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around now, you saw a large dining room with a door that presumably led into the kitchen. You started to walk that way, but your eye caught on a framed picture hanging from the wall. It was obviously a wedding photo, showing a much skinnier (but still undoubtedly chubby) She-Hulk. She looked radiant with that gorgeous smile, the flowing snow-white dress, and an emerald necklace hanging around her throat, accentuating the lovely green of her\u2026well, everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so caught up in looking over your bride \u2013 which still felt weird to you, but less so now \u2013 that you almost didn\u2019t pay any attention the person standing beside her. It almost certainly had to be you, but something seemed off, but yet again you couldn\u2019t quite place your finger on it, then it hit you.</span></div></div>",

Puberty hit you like a truck and it arrived early, so you were always more than a bit heavy in the breast and thighs department, but the picture showed that you had a bit of a belly that helped even everything out. You weren\u2019t fat by any means, especially compared to the larger green woman at your side; you were just a bit softer looking now. Turning your eyes elsewhere on the picture, your crimson tresses were artfully arranged and spilling around your face and shoulders, and a wide smile split your face. Looking the picture over, you could easily tell that you were the happiest you had ever been with you and your beautiful blushing bride arm in arm. Your dress was just as white and shaped similarly to Jenny\u2019s, but not exactly the same. You also had a ruby necklace to compliment your hair color, even if it wasn\u2019t as striking as your bride\u2019s emerald. Looking at the bottom of the photo, you saw writing engraved on the lower part of the frame: \u201cSarah &amp; Jennifer Brooks\u201d with \u201cTogether Forever\u201d below your names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I least I know I don\u2019t have to call her She-Hulk all the time now,\u201d you murmured to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping back, only now did you think to look down at yourself. You saw that you had softened a bit further than you had been in the photo. You belly was now just starting to push out from the rest of your body, but it was still mostly hidden between the swell of your somewhat larger breasts above and your meaty thighs below. Running your fingers through your hair, you found that you had also let the locks grow a bit longer now, so that they spilled to about your mid-back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to the window, you briefly considered your reflection for several more seconds. Then you turned around one more time and headed through the dining room. The door you had spied before did indeed lead to the kitchen, and it was quite a beaut: no uncomfortably small kitchenette that was practically falling apart for you, no, the room that greeted you now was spacious and packed with plenty of modern conveniences. There was a massive restaurant style refrigerator along with a matching freezer, a large induction cooktop with a pair of high capacity ovens, plenty of free counter space even with all of the other appliances out for easy use, and more ample cabinet space. You were only partially surprised when you found that there was an enormous walk-in pantry through another door in the back of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned against the central island, dumbfounded at this on top of everything else. You had always enjoyed cooking when you were growing up, but had gotten so used to basically only being able to make unevenly cooked ramen noodles, and that was only if your beat-up old microwave decided to work for the day. With this space, you could really let your culinary talents loose. <i>No wonder Jenny is getting so big if I\u2019m cooking in a place like this</i> you idly mused. The thought of Jenny \u2013 and her growling stomach \u2013 spurred you out of your daze, time was wasting and your wife was likely only getting hungrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leapt into action, quickly getting pans heating, the ovens warming up, and so on before pulling out slabs of bacon, cartons of eggs, a bag of flour and more. It had been so long since you had actually cooked, but once you started mixing things and cutting others, it felt like you had been practicing most of your life. You didn\u2019t even have to think about what you were doing; your body naturally went through the motions so that numerous breakfast items were soon starting to pile up. Pancakes, omelets, muffins, eggs served sunny side up, hash browns, you started to lose track of everything you were whipping up, but the smells mingled and set your own stomach a rumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter wiping up a little smear from the edge of a plate, you stepped back and looked over the vast array of food you had made. It didn\u2019t seem like it had taken that long either, certainly not enough time to make all of what laid before you, but there it all was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026looks and smells good, like usual,\u201d you heard softly purred in your ear as a wall of softness pressed against your back and a pair of flabby arms looped around your torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all but jumped out of your skin at the shock. <i>Still not quite used to her I guess</i> your whirling mind managed to piece together. She either moved a lot quieter than you would have thought possible or you were so focused on the cooking that you hadn\u2019t even heard her coming up behind you, probably a combination of both. Unaware of your thoughts, she giggled lightly before apologizing for frightening you, then slipped around you granting you an excellent view of her bloated body clad in only a skimpy little robe that wouldn\u2019t have fit a woman half her size. It couldn\u2019t even be tied shut in front, the silky fabric flowing along her numerous curves and spread wide by the expanse of her belly. She grabbed a pair of the plates and made to leave, but when she swung around, her mountainous rear bounced into you, knocking you to the floor with an <i>oof</i>. Hearing you hit the ground, she instantly set the plates down and leaned over \u2013 briefly giving you the fear (and excitement) of being buried under an avalanche of green flesh \u2013 before easily picking you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that, darling\u2019. Still not quite used to how much of me there is now and where it\u2019s all moving,\u201d she said with a bit of a blush coloring her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to open your mouth to speak but the words caught in your throat as you realized that she hadn\u2019t just pulled you back to your feet, she was effortlessly holding you above the floor. It hadn\u2019t really hit you, but now it did: the incredible strength she had in the comic books was obviously intact and still in action judging from now easily she was holding you up as well as being able to effortlessly move her obese body around. She next really scrambled your brains when she pulled you in close and gave you a kiss that lasted for several seconds and yet also seemed to last an eternity. Only when her stomach let out another loud roar did she pull away, but it was more than a little regretfully as her teeth caught your bottom lip and pulled on it slightly. Setting you back down on the floor, you also saw how she was more than a head taller than you, making you feel smaller still compared to her; funny how you hadn\u2019t see such a height different in the wedding photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the plates she was taking before and set off again, this time being careful not to knock you down again. She did brush past you though, giving you a bit of a thrill again. When you finally got your brain in gear again, you helped her take the plates out to the dining room and the both of you were soon seated. Jenny had already started to eat before you had finished, shoveling vast amounts of the food into her mouth and quickly making room for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while and careful not to speak with her mouth full, she coyly remarked \u201cYou made up an awful lot of food again. It\u2019s almost as if you want me to get even fatter,\u201d finishing with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to admit that you really did want that, but you didn\u2019t say it out loud, instead, you just gave a coy little smile of your own before the two of you returned to eating. When you finally pushed your plate back, you groaned lightly as you sipped the last of your juice. You had definitely eaten more than you usually did even when you had the chance to eat till full, but the feeling of the pressure in your gut was pleasant. Far more pleasant however was the sight of your wife gulping down mouthful after mouthful, more and more food to add to her rotund frame. Despite how much more she had to eat, Jenny didn\u2019t take much longer to finish off her portion, even going so far as to wipe up every last trace with the last couple of pieces of toast. Sitting back in her chair, you heard the unfortunate piece of furniture groan under the strain, but she looked unconcerned and extremely content as she idly let her fingers rub the engorged stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her mouth as if to speak before stifling a small burp, but then let loose with a massive belch that almost felt like it swept your hair back. She quickly murmured an apology before getting to what she had meant to say before.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You sat up a little straighter after she said that, it seemed like the right thing to do. You had no idea what you could say though, wishing that you had some idea what she was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, you decided to keep it simple, \u201cOh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded before continuing, \u201cSaw the message on my phone before coming out. They still can\u2019t figure out what exactly I was hit with or how to get them out yet. They said they would keep trying but\u2026ehh\u2026\u201d Then a smile spread across her face as she leaned over, took your hand and pulled it so that it rested on her stomach, \u201cSo it looks like we\u2019re still stuck with them, and I know how much you hate that,\u201d the last bit said with her voice dripping with sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were wondering what exactly she meant by \u201cthem\u201d but then you felt it: a movement beneath the layers of blubber, almost like\u2026and then another and another. There was no doubt in your mind; she was pregnant. And with more than a few too from how it felt in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing you knew, you were looking up at the ceiling, but it didn\u2019t feel like you were on the floor, it was too soft for that. You then became aware of a hand caressing your hair before Jenny\u2019s face came into view, but it was upside down and there was obvious concern etched on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey baby, I was worried about you. You passed out for some reason, are you feeling all right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded your head, idly thinking <i>Now that I see you, my dear</i>. Out loud you managed to stammer, \u201cHow many?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow many what? Am I pregnant with?\u201d to which you nodded again. Her worry only seemed to deepen. \u201cFive, you know this. Are you sure you\u2019re all right, you didn\u2019t hit your head that hard, did you?\u201d placing her hand atop your forehead. \u201cIt isn\u2019t like it changed since we found out nearly two years ago or anything. You don\u2019t seem to be running a fever or anything, but maybe you need to see a doctor anyways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some effort, but you managed to convince her that you didn\u2019t need a doctor, you really were fine. Inwardly though, you were more than a little euphoric. The thought of being married to such a beautifully bloated version of the She-Hulk was like a dream come true; the addition of her being apparently permanently pregnant with quints, that was virtually heaven in your book. When you started to sit up, you were a little light headed, but you figured that was to be expected considering everything, and it passed soon enough though it gave you a perfect reason to remain where you were. You soon saw that Jenny had carried you out to the living room and laid you on one of the sofas. With her bulk taking up much of the space though, it meant that your legs had to propped up on one of the arms of the sofa though and your head was nestled into the pillowy soft fat of her hip and rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout ten minutes later, her concern seemed to have faded enough so she eased you back to your feet. She again asked if you needed to go see a doctor though, to which you responded that you didn\u2019t. You instead said that you were going to head out, take a quick drive and get some fresh air. She seemed to think that would do you some good before saying that she had to get working anyways. You almost asked where she was going to work, but stopped yourself; it wouldn\u2019t do to worry her any more by asking about something you should have already known. Instead, you fell in behind her, which admittedly did grant you an excellent view of her rump bobbing up and down with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the bedroom, the two of you changed, though you couldn\u2019t help your eye straying to look at her beautiful green curves as she slowly got dressed. You went with something casual, a loose flowing tee with calf length jeans. You were more than a little surprised with Jenny\u2019s choice: business attire with blouse, jacket, and skirt, all sized to suit her flabby body. You were careful not to let your surprise show on your face, though you did recognize the outfit someone as being similar to some of what she had worn when she worked as a lawyer. <i>Another part similar to the comics</i> you mused. You finished well before her, and offered to help, but your wife turned down your assistance. Giving one last look over your shoulder as she valiantly tugged the shirt over her stomach; you turned away and walked to the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there, you found multiple sets of keys hanging beside the door, and grabbed one. You\u2019re not sure why you grabbed that specific set, but it felt right somehow. Heading out the door, you found yourself in a small entryway with only the door you exited and the elevator door besides some decorative touches. Taking the elevator down to the garage, you stepped out and realized that you might have a problem: you didn\u2019t know what car was yours. Fortunately you thought about using the key fob and after several minutes of darting back and forth hearing the car chirping, you found it. The gleaming Mustang was nothing like the jalopy you used to drive, so that was yet another good turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling up to the exit, the man in the booth gave a brief sideways glance before giving a double take. \u201cMorning Mrs. Brooks, heading out to get everything ready for tonight, huh?\u201d He smiled behind his bushy mustache and gave a slight chuckle. \u201cGuess I would want to make it a special night too if I had a relationship like yours. Have a good day now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave him a nod and pulled out onto the street as you tried to figure out what he meant about tonight. Jenny didn\u2019t seem to give you any clues about something happening tonight, but maybe you were keeping it a surprise for her. That was really helpful since you didn\u2019t seem to have any memories from this world. Since you hit a traffic jam anyways, you decided to check your phone thinking that maybe you had put a reminder or something. It didn\u2019t take you long to find today\u2019s date with a rather important reminder: your anniversary.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It just seemed like yesterday that you were celebrating the last hours of 2016 but that was life for you. After the party, your friends had dropped you off at your apartment. You'd would have drove yourself but you had had one too many drinks. When had gone straight to bed, not realizing how much your life was about to change when you awoke the following morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you exited your peaceful slumber, you couldn't help but realize that there was something...off. As you stretched out, easing the stiffness from your body, when you felt two things: one, the bed seemed quite a bit bigger than before and , two, there was this large, soft and warm mass that was gently pressed against you. Even in your barely awake state, that caused you enough alarm to quickly sit up and look over to your side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked the sleep from your eyes rapidly as you took in the sight next you: a young woman with Caucasian skin and long, black hair that fell down to length of her back. You could barely believe it as you took in her form. She was huge. Her face was rounded but plump cheeks followed by a double chin and thick neck. That led your gaze down towards her body. She had bulbous Double-F breasts that strained at the grey t-shirt that covered them. Underneath that, and the top of which was barely covered by the garment, was her cauldron of a belly. The expanse of pale girth jutted out at least a foot and a half like a fleshy wrecking ball from her body. The sheer volume of flesh caused it sink downwards between her legs, covering her lap and seeped over her black panties in the form of love handles.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat led you to her lower body. Her blubbery hips had to be at least four feet around and beach ball sized butt cheeks that looked like they could crush a small child. Her arms and legs were thick and pillow like in their mass, like elongated marshmallows. Overall, this woman had to be at least 500 pounds or more. But there was another thing that stuck out to you. The young woman's skin was completely without blemish and smooth. Not a trace of stretch marks or cellulite visible. It was almost like she was a doll, if you were being honest with yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was the least of your worries. Who was this woman? Where did she come from? Why-why was she so <i>big</i>? You looked away, somewhat frantic. It was then that you noticed that your bedroom seemed different. It was bigger, had more furniture...it just wasn't the same as before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to find out what was going on! You had to do something but what?  </span></div></div>",

You needed more info and you wouldn't get it laying in bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly and carefully, you slid of the bed, watching your unknown bed mate the entire time. Those were some of the longest moments of your life as worried she'd wake up. Luckily, it wasn't to be and you were able to quietly exit your bedroom. You made your way into the living room and sure enough, it was different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was bigger, just like the bedroom. There was also a rather large love seat that you knew you never had bought or owned before. Glancing around, you also saw a nice little coffee table with a few pictures. Curiosity peaked, you went over to it examining the pictures. You picked up the largest one that was in the middle of the table. It was framed and featured you and the unknown woman. You and said woman were posing for the camera. The two of you were holding on to each other with the woman's arm around your neck and your own wrapped around her waist. You were both leaning into each other. The woman sported a shy, kind of awkward smile while you sported a pleased grin. It was, overall, a pleasant or even cute picture. You glanced down at the bottom of the picture where it was written: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Your Name) + Laura- 2nd anniversary. Together since 2016.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a breath. You actually managed to get something useful. So you and...Laura had been together for about two years according to this. That would also make it 2018.  At least, time seemed to be moving. Still, that didn't explain what exactly was going on. You took a look at the other pictures and you set the first down. Almost all of them were of you and Laura together doing different things. Watching fireworks, attending a movie premiere, the list went on. The one thing you did notice was that Laura seemed thinner in a lot of those pictures. She was still quite big but it seemed like if you looked at them you could see a kind of timeline of her getting bigger and fatter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" You breathed out loud. It looked like she went from kind of big when you two started dating (maybe around 180 to 200 pounds, if you had to guess) to the plus 500 she was by the new year nearly two years later. That was kind of impressive, if you were being honest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, if you were being honest, it seemed like you and Laura had a good relationship. Every picture you saw seemed to display you two being happy. It kind of made you wonder if you should go back and wake her up. Maybe you could ask her everything you two did last night, get a little more insight on the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe you could explore the apartment a little more?</span></div></div>",

In response, you slowly turned toward the source of the footsteps, which revealed that Laura was now undoubtedly awake. Sure, she still showed signs of drowsiness, judging from how her eyelids still seemed a little heavy, but she was certainly conscious, no doubt about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from her appearance, her silky black hair looked a little frazzled, which resulted in having a case of \"Bed-head\" hair. From there, Laura instinctively outstretched her doughy arms, opening her mouth real wide, causing her to let out quite the explicit yawn, which lasted for nearly 15 seconds, then she ceased her roar of a yawn, her lips smacking together once or twice to get rid of the morning breath in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was properly awake, Laura soon noticed you, where she then displayed a comforting but bashful smile towards you, as she waddled her way toward you, where she proceeded to wrap her pillowy arms around you in a loving embrace, then administered a kiss upon your lips, which you had to admit, it felt quite blissful.

She was never late, at least not without letting you know. Something was wrong. Grabbing your phone, you tried calling her but she didn\u2019t pick up. Flicking over to a news app, you quickly scrolled through, but didn\u2019t immediately see anything in the news that would involve her. Leaving the bench, you headed back to your car. Your desire to hurry was countered by not wanting to attract too much attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, you reached towards the center console. Touching what would appear to anyone else a random series of buttons on the screen, the display switched over to the tracker setting. You frowned a bit as the system displayed the dot close to halfway across the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What is she doing all the way over there?</i> you wondered for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring that you would get the answer to the question when you found her, you pulled out into traffic. The congestion was high as usual, and you had to take numerous detours due to various super activities around the city. First you ran into the Fantastic Four and Doctor Doom having a brawl over several city blocks. Next was a battle between Iron Man and Technovore. You were forced to hurry down another street as their fight started coming towards the police barricade. You almost got caught in the third when Spider-Man was chasing down some purse snatchers before he got ambushed by Venom. The two of them smashed into the car right behind you. All told, it took you most of another hour to even get close to your destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting at yet another stoplight, you glanced out the window. Your eyes drifted around before snapping back upon seeing a certain rundown bodega.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Isn\u2019t that\u2026?</i> your mind started, but the light changed and already the person behind you was laying into the horn so you had to speed along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn you went, your gaze catching on various other buildings and locations that brought forth memories. Sparing a quick glance down at the screen, you recognized where it was now. You still wished she would have told you that she was heading there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nearly ended up pulling hair out with how long it took to find parking on top of everything else. Eventually, you dashed down an all but empty sidewalk to your destination. Standing outside the dirty looking tavern, you paused. Stepping over to a grimy plate glass set in the storefront next door, you gave a quick once over. As you stepped up to the door, you passed your hands down across yourself, smoothing out your semi-formal\u2026</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Walking in the door, you stepped to the side to get your bearings. The lighting was dim but didn\u2019t hide the ubiquitous dirt; what tables and chairs there were tended to be broken, partially repaired, and mismatched; and there likely wasn\u2019t a clean glass in the place. Looking around, you saw bloodstains, both new and old, but you gaze was more drawn to those that you could recognize from when you came here a year ago today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">+\u2014+\u2014+</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were dispatched to Binky\u2019s, a small time tavern that mostly only hosted troublesome clients, in order to confirm reports of possible super activity. From the reports, it was maybe a street level super at best though. When you arrived, there was a pair of men \u2013 bikers perhaps, judging from their attire \u2013 on the sidewalk outside, both unconscious but still breathing and not in any apparent need of immediate medical attention. The one\u2019s arm certainly looked like it would need a cast or something from the way it was twisted the wrong way around though. Radioing in your initial findings, you moved inside, following the noise of an ongoing fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, you saw several other men scattered around the main room of Binky\u2019s, other bikers from what you could see. You had to drop to the floor as yet another man went flying through the air, straight out the door you came in, to join the others on the sidewalk. Scrambling back to your feet, you saw the cause of the disturbance: a tall and well muscled woman standing in the middle of the tavern. Your heart skipped a beat as you looked on. You had never seen anything quite as beautiful as her when she broke the chair over the biker\u2019s back. The fact that she did this one handed while lifting another up to the ceiling with her free hand on only his collar made your heart skip a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlaming red hair cascaded down her back, across the stylish longcoat that draped to her ankles. When she turned around, the open coat revealed a purple blouse cut to highlight her busty physique. Eyes glittering, her expression looked as if it would have fit better on a woman finding an exceptional deal or something, not waist deep in a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer turn culminated with her tossing the guy in her hand into one of the few unbroken tables left standing before dropping her attention to the guy she broke the chair over. He was trying to crawl away from her, but this was in vain due to her grabbing his ankle and hoisting him up till his fingers were just able to brush the dirty floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was winding up for a punch that likely would have put the man through the wall if she hadn\u2019t noticed that you were now pointing you pistol at her and demanding her to stand down. It surprised you as well, you didn\u2019t even remember drawing it, yet there it was in your hand, rock steady and pointed straight at her. The woman seemed just as surprised by that as you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you started to demand that she put the man down, she instead reacted by throwing him at you. The impact drove you against the wall hard enough to knock the wind out of you. It also caused your pistol to discharge, the beam scorching the ceiling where it hit. By the time you recovered, she was already heading out the back door. You saw her briefly stop on the threshold though, turning back and looking at you with her brows furrowed and her blue eyes lingering on you. Before you could disentangle yourself from the groaning biker, she was gone, leaving you to try and figure out what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time backup and medical services arrived, you had found the owner of the tavern lying low in a hideaway behind the bar. He explained the bikers had gotten very drunk, and then more than a little rowdy before they tried robbing the place. He had gone for his gun under the bar as usual in such a case, but one of the bikers had been too fast for that despite barely being able to stand. That\u2019s when that mystery woman joined the fray, but he didn\u2019t see much after the first guy went flying out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only his statement and the state of the bar even before the fight, you weren\u2019t expecting much in finding this woman if she didn\u2019t want to be found. The other officers that showed up agreed, though some of them couldn\u2019t pass up ribbing you over getting taken out so easily. Squaring your shoulders, you let the taunts roll off your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on, while going home for the night, that mysterious woman dropped into your life again\u2026literally. As you were walking towards the steps leading to the front door of your apartment block, you heard and felt a sudden thump behind you. Before you could react, a very strong arm wrapped around your throat, pulling you up on tiptoes. She demanded to know why you didn\u2019t shoot her when you had the chance, and instead wasted the opening. After several attempted lies she persuaded you to tell the truth through careful squeezing of your throat, so you admitted that you found her extremely attractive. After several tense moments, she purred that if you really felt that way, you would take her out on a date the next night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">+\u2014+\u2014+</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head to bring yourself back to the present, you found that you had been staring at the backside of a very familiar figure. Flaming red hair cascaded down her back, a back that bore little similarity to how it appeared back then. A figure-hugging dress highlighted her well fleshed shape, especially around her superabundant hips. Hips that know easily took up two of the bar stools and looked to be encroaching on a third. You knew from extensive experience that her superhuman strength wasn\u2019t hindered in the least by her adipose though, her softness disguising the muscles buried deep beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could have told me that you were coming here, rather than making me waste a lot of time on the other side of the city,\u201d you muttered after winding your way through the sparse crowd and slipping onto the seat next to the pair she occupied at the chipped and stained bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary\u2019s only response was a teasing grin fired sideways at you as she continued to devour the plate of nachos before her. It wasn\u2019t the first either judging from the stack of plates off to the other side. With her attention diverted for the moment, you took the chance to cast your eye across what you could see of her blubbery form. You noted with some glee that her already superb breasts seemed to have taken a bit more of her ever increasing weight, the gap between the mounds becoming a deep canyon. The stomach between her breasts and legs was just as impressive. It pulled her dress taut and surged out across her legs and hung down over her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly now did you realize that she was watching you stare at her with an expression that all but stated that while she enjoyed the attention, she was certainly going to give you some sort of punishment later on in return. With that finished, she turned away and ordered a heaping plate of onion rings.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Overwatch. A game that has become extremely popular in the gaming community since 2016. Suffice to say, you were one of those people drawn to such a vibrant yet complex fictional world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as you stir from you slumber after a long-night session playing Overwatch, you slowly but surely noticed something...\"odd\", regarding your environs. After all, you only lived in a one bedroom apartment, and it looked nothing as fancy as the room you were in, since you passed out on the couch due to you not wanting to drag your feet all the way back to your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet... it felt as if you woke up in someone else's home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe living room was spacious enough to fit your entire apartment in it, complete with a massive Flatscreen TV before you, as you were currently sitting in a couch large and sturdy enough for a cow to lay on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on?\" You thought to yourself, as you cautiously stood up from the couch to get a better understanding of the abode you found yourself in. Suffice to say, the place itself felt like it could only be bought by millionaires, complete with a massive kitchenette adjacent to the homely living room you woke up in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely enough, you soon heard what sounded like singing coming from another room, along with the sounds of running water. With curiosity getting the best of you, you cautiously crept your way towards the source of the noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that...singing?\" You thought, as you got close enough to make out a voice, which was undoubtedly female, as the unknown woman sang:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Je vois ta porte rouge et je veux la peindre en noir.\"<br>\r\n\"Plus de couleurs, je veux qu'elles deviennent noires.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"J'ai vu passer les filles vetues de leurs vetements d'ete.\"<br>\r\n\"Je dois tourner la tete jusqu'a l'obscurite.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from the woman's tone, the song she sang sounded rather sad, despite not understanding a word she said. But then, as you reached what you assumed to be the bathroom, you carefully opened the wide door to peek at whoever was inside, only to be shocked at who you saw standing within the enormous shower stall:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seductive female voice. The lingerie spewed about the room. The pale blue skin seen clearly behind the blurry glass walls of the shower stall. You couldn't believe it, but there she was: Amelie LaCroix, better known ass the cold-blooded assassin known as \"Widowmaker\", stood before you with the shower stall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you have tried your hand in playing many of the playable characters from Overwatch, yet none of them resonated with you more than the blue-skinned femme fatale that was Widowmaker. Plus, she had one of the most tragic backstories you have ever seen in gaming history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, upon further examination of the blue-skinned woman, you soon noticed something obvious about Amelie, and it didn't hit you until now: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWidowmaker now looked like she weighed 500 to 600 pounds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't see the finer details, but you could clearly make out an outline of the woman's now bulkier physique. Her arms were chubby and plump, especially on the biceps. Her breasts were equally as large as well, as they were propped up upon a large doughy double belly. Looking down, you could easily see the largest part of Amelie's physique; Her hips, butt, and legs. Her buttcheeks were each the size of beanbag chairs, while her hips jutted out in a 4 and a quarter foot diameter, whilst her behind perfectly dimpled against her equally bulky thighs and legs, which helped in supporting all that weight, thus giving Widowmaker a profound pear shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you soon were about to get a better look at the larger Widowmaker, as she opened the shower stall, as steam poured out in the process, as her rotund physique was drenched in numerous droplets of water, with her long voluminous dark purple hair downed from being soaked in water. It was there you noticed how chubby her face was, complete with a rounder face and double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/ray-norr/art/Widowmaker-634000793\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.deviantart.com/ray-norr/art/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely enough, she didn't seem to have noticed you yet, as she went for a downright massive towel hanging from a towel rack. But then, she soon spoke up in a mix of French and English as she remarked, \"Je sais que vous etes la (I know you're there), Darling. No need to hide yourself from moi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it was official: the jig was up. She knows you're here...Wait, did she just call you \"Darling\"? This just became all the more confusing, as Amelie turned her head a little to look at you, bearing a cute dimpled smile on her cherubic face, as if subtly enticing you to approach her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, you couldn't resist such lustful temptations, as you soon walked out of the doorway toward her, revealing your...</span></div></div>",

However, as if guided by some unknown to be compelling you, you soon spoke toward the rotund Widowmaker and asked, \"...You sure you're feeling alright, Am\u00e9lie?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* ... Pour \u00eatre honn\u00eate, mon amour (To be honest, my love), I...I don't I shall ever \u00eatre entier (be whole) again.\" She calmly retorted, her voice having a somewhat sad and somber undertone, considering that even though she was technically brainwashed by TALON, it was still her hands that ultimately killed her late beloved, just as you noticed her slowly wrapping a somewhat plump but still lithe hand around one of her bulky flab-covered biceps in some instinctual way of calming herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what you could see, despite her obvious increase in weight and girth, this was still the tragic character of Am\u00e9lie LaCroix, as you began to hear her lowly hum to herself, continuing the song from before, only...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Je vois ta ligne de couleurs ...\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"...And they're all painted black.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...You could clearly understand what she was saying now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"With flowers and my love, both never to come back.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was there that you recognized the lyrics; She was singing the song \"Paint It Black\", which had anti-war and anti-drug undertones in the words sung. Ironic yet all the more tragic, considering Am\u00e9lie's life as the cold-hearted assassin Widowmaker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, it seemed as if the song was...\"calming\" her down some, which made you all the more empathetic towards the blue-skinned plus-sized woman, not because of your personal bias, but the sympathy you felt for such an iconic individual. You began to move, this time of your own volition, as you soon approached behind the substantially fatter Widowmaker, where you promptly but slowly wrapped your arms around her in a loving embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, the intimacy initially surprised her, but as you lean your head upon her shoulder, she began to lull into an affectionate disposition, where she soon then slowly moved her plump hands upon your own, resting her chubby head along your head in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You looked at your black dated alarm clock that and now saw the time was 1:30 am.  Your attempts at a constructive session of Competitive, where futile due to either the overall toxicity of the randomly assigned teammates or your internet provider just deciding to put on the brakes to the connection speed.  You went to bed to sleep off the frustration and dream of an escape from this world, but you only got a few hours of dreamless sleep before you woke up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d  You asked, looking at the white digital alarm clock. \u201cOkay, 5:55 A.M.

You recognized her as Satya Vaswani, AKA Symmetra from Overwatch, looking closely as she did in the game.  That is with one major exception: she was very fat, roughly somewhere between 550 to 600 lbs.  Her belly was a large apron of fat, breasts were the size of bowling balls, and her right arm had a good amount of flab to it.  Symmetra\u2019s left prosthetic arm was just as \u201cfat\u201d as her natural right arm.

As you got yourself out of bed, there was men\u2019s clothes being stored in the nearby tall dresser cabinet that looked like your old dresser in your old apartment.  You knew somehow, the contents were yours (because the walk-in closet had extra-large versions of Symmetra\u2019s attires). You got dressed in a white undershirt, a grey T shirt, dark blue jeans, and a pair of light green fingerless leather gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking look out of the bedroom, the clean, white, futuristic aesthetic of the new bedroom extended all the way throughout the rest of the 2-bedroom apartment.

The kitchen wasn't large, but it had excellent storage and high-end appliances.  It was as if the kitchen wasn\u2019t the primary eating area in your relationship, specialized for more intimate meals. The logical explanation was since you were apparently in the Overwatch world now, odds are the two of you were now stationed on base somewhere.

Once your eyes came into focus, you could clearly see the rocky cliffs, Mediterranean views, and futuristic military structures and pathways that was Watchpoint Gibraltar, one of the levels in Overwatch.  You could see the entrance to the rocket hangar with its doors wide open and the second check point clearly visible below.  The walkway looked cleaned up and free of dirt and gravel, and the metal walls of the hangar and towers looked like they had new application of polish.  It was as if Symmetra had taken to cleaning up the watchpoint herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking your view away from the scenic watchpoint, you then noticed on the living room coffee table, a pair of Overwatch Badges and ID cards.  The two small badges were placed left and right next to each other.  The badges' composition were platinum with gold accents, shaped in the same manner as Overwatch\u2019s logo.  The ID cards were laminated plastic, neatly stacked on top of each other, and you could see sensor pads on it, meaning the card used an integrated circuit chip like a smart card.  The top card had the photo of Symmetra (her weight was the same as when you saw her in the bedroom) and read, \u201cOverwatch Agent ID: Satya Vaswani. Codename: Symmetra.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slid Symmetra\u2019s card shortly to the left to look at the bottom one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOverwatch Agent ID: (Name).

It all started when you took on that one job, the one where you and Symmetra first met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*11 months ago (Overwatch time), O\u2019Hare International Airport*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your plane touched down on the runaway.  You were done looking out the window<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, we have landed at the O\u2019Hare International Airport at Chicago, Illinois. Thank you for flying with\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the flight stewardess gave her instructive speech of airplane exiting protocol, you took your attention to an email on your phone.  A week ago, you received that email, requesting your services as freelance investigator and bodyguard, from an unknown client.  You were eager because this would be your first job outside of the United States and it paid ten times as handsomely than your previous jobs, but you kept those emotions to yourself.  The email included a boarding pass for the very plane you\u2019re riding on along with an instruction to meet with some anonymous associates at the airport\u2019s terminal 3.  As you got the strap of your carry-on duffel bag containing weeks of clothes, armor, and sundries around your left shoulder, you calmly made your way off the plane, and into the instructed terminal.  Once there and not seeing who you were supposed to meet, you looked out the window to see the great metropolis of Chicago, your hometown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHome sweet, home.  Nice to see the place one more time,\u201d You said, but then you felt the presence of a trio of dignitaries, two humans that looked to be in their mid-40\u2019s and an omnic, holding a banner with your name on it behind you, so you asked, \u201cCan I help you?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour Mr. (Name) I take it?\u201d the middle bronze omnic in a tan business suit asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust call me Laser-shot,\u201d you replied, and then asked about the banner, \u201cAnd is little early for that?  I haven\u2019t made it out of the states yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are here to confirm that you have accepted our employer's mission,\u201d the man on the right answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it have made sense for you people to have met me back at Tucson?\" you asked, \"I wasted two hours just getting my armaments cleared by security.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have our reasons for the travel arrangement sir.\u201d  The woman on the left answered, \u201cWe will tell you more once we take flight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You groaned as you followed the trio of dignitaries to one of the airport gates that seemed to be unusually empty for a rather busy air port. The woman talked with the airport employee behind the desk and  before you knew it, the door to the jet bridge was open and the four of you were able to move forward.  At the end of the jet bridge, you entered the plane. You noticed the cabin on the plane you were had gold as its primary color scheme with lightly gold walls, yellow gold upholstery on the seat, and gold carpeting.  You thought of the interior as an eyesore, but as everyone sat down and got buckled in, one the plane\u2019s crew omnics handed you a black gun case that had your weapons of choice inside and you quickly opened it up, pulling out your primary firearm, the Tommy Laser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Modeled after the legendary M1921 Thompson submachine gun, your Tommy Laser was a laser carbine that fired non-lethal but numerous electric laser shots quickly and accurately. Your gun was personally customized with a green color scheme with white accents, and accessorized with a vertical fore grip, a pistol grip stock, and the Tommy Laser\u2019s source of ammo: a large round battery that was size and resembled the ammo drum magazines commonly associated with the tommy guns.  You first got the Tommy Laser back when you were assigned to the Chicago SWAT team, the weapon was deemed ideal to suit your unique abilities out in the field. With it, you did your part with flying colors in the SWAT team's numerous busts against violent gangs and drug rings, and dangerous hostage situations. Focusing on the present, you reassembled your firearm and asked, \u201cNow that we\u2019re here, you mind spilling why we\u2019re here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have intelligence that the terrorist group Talon have been planning to attack and assassinate our employer, who has very recently spoken out against them.  Our selection algorithms have chosen you for your combat experience within the last 11 years.\u201d The omnic answered, handing you a set of documents as the plane began to takeoff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOut of all the heroes in whole world, you had to pick me,\u201d you replied somewhat cockily, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say spending 8 years on the Chicago SWAT Team straight out of high school would be qualifying to take on a terrorist group, but I'm flattered. I\u2019ve been spending most of my 3 year freelance career against small timers like Los Muertos and the Deadlock Gangs out in Arizona.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is true in most circumstances,\u201d the Omnic continued, \u201cbut your unnatural marksmanship was an outlier in the process.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that.\u201d You answered, \u201cYeah, at around high school, I found out I had developed some power to sense whatever was behind me at rougly\u2026 10 meters.  When I joined the police like my parents did, I discovered that the talent extended to shooting things behind me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You decided to show the three your abilities first hand. What caught your attention out of the whole dossier, was a trio of photographs that contained three of Talon\u2019s top agents: Reaper, the black robed killer who has been hunting down Overwatch agents; Widowmaker, Talon sniper and the assassin of Tekhartha Mondatta; and Akane \u201cDoomfist\u201d Ogundimu, One of Talon\u2019s leaders.  You threw those photographs to the air behind you.  Your reflective vision kicked in, and without turning your neck to look back, you took aim and fired three shots from your Tommy Laser.  The laser projectiles ricocheted in airplane cabin three times, not harming the plane. On the third bounce, your laser fire precisely found their mark, leaving gaping holes in Reaper, Widowmaker, and Doomfist\u2019s photos also causing a brief updraft to have the pictures return to your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike so.\u201d you demonstrated, handing the hole laden photos back to the dignitaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is indeed impressive.  Our employer at our destination will be pleased to know that.\u201d The woman answered not flinching like the other two at the demonstration, taking the pictures from your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where are we going and who am I supposed to guard anyway?\" you politely asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man answered, \u201cWanting to get the point Mr. Laser-shot? Very well, where you\u2019ll be going is\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

It deflects radar detection. We\u2019ve been taking extra precautions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll it took for the plane to reach Dorado, Mexico was close to an hour.  Once the plane touched down at Dorado\u2019s airport, you got your passport checked out by airport personnel.  A few minutes later, you exited the airport and headed to a limo that was by the shuttle parking area. You finally figured where these 3 strangers were working for when you saw the turquoise ziggurat emblem on the limousine\u2019s door, the Mexican based energy company Lum\u00e9riCo.  You and the three associates got in the limousine and the vehicle took off to Lum\u00e9riCo\u2019s central offices in the Dorado city center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLum\u00e9riCo\u2019s infrastructure has already been compromised once. A Hacking group had stolen very valuable information from Lum\u00e9rico and its employees, and worse falsified company documents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d The man, Angel Burciaga, answered, \u201cA recent investigation from Volskya\u2019s agents had revealed a connection between Talon and the hacking incident that has defamed Lum\u00e9riCo. Mr. Potero will be making a keynote speech denouncing Talon at the G30 summit here at Dorado, but his health has been declining and we\u2019ve been already receiving been threats. With our forces busy locating Sombra, we needed outside help for keeping the city safe. We will be turning to you in the next few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd right now?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive us some time,\u201d Ms. Jimenez answered, \u201cWe\u2019re making arrangements for extra support with our business partners.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the drive was uneventful, that is until the limo was stop by a protest group of Dorado citizens at the front entrance of Lum\u00e9riCo's corporate offices.  You looked out the window to see many people holding picket signs utterly whose contents were utterly critical of Lum\u00e9riCo:  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u00a1Dorado pertenece a la gente! &lt;Dorado belongs to the people!&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u00a1Vishkar no se puede confiar en! &lt;!Vishkar cannot be trusted!&gt;\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u00a1Recodar los barrios de Rio de Janerio! &lt;Remember the Favelas of Rio!&gt;\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u00a1Lum\u00e9rico no puede vender a su gente! &lt;Lum\u00e9rico cannot sell out its people!&gt;\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u00a1Proyecto Armonia nos obligar\u00e1 a salir de nuestros hogares!\u201d  &lt;Project Harmony will force us out of our homes!\u201d&gt;<br>\r\nThe Dorado police were busy holding the demonstrating people back from blocking the traffic, allowing the limousine to enter the Dorado building\u2019s parking garage.  Once the limo was parked you got and out followed the three Lum\u00e9rico officials into a corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, your reputation took a dive?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026*sigh*\u2026 Si Lasershot.\u201d  Ms. Jimenez answered, her dark brown drooping down as she placed the fingertips of her left hand to face, clearly to hide her shame.  \u201cOur internal investigators have cleared Lum\u00e9rico and Mr. Potero of any wrongdoing, but the citizens refuse to believe us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t want to face the shame of being in the wrong.\u201d You replied.  \u201cI take it you want a few outside sources to clear your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Ms. Jimenez answered. \u201cAs we said, we need to make arrangements with\u2026 hablando del rey de Roma. &lt;Speak of the devil.&gt;\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo Indian representatives, one male and one female, approached you and Lum\u00e9riCo staff.  The two of them were wearing white and purple uniforms, apparel commonly associated with the Vishkar Corporation. The male representative didn\u2019t that many noticeable features, namely his hairstyle of two spikes, and a strange device mounted to his right wrist.  The woman\u2019s left arm was a white armored prosthetic, with her hair with set of bangs on her right side, and the back of her hair was organized into a bun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u092f\u0939 \u0906\u092a\u0915\u094b \u092b\u093f\u0930 \u0938\u0947 \u0938\u0941\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u091c\u093f\u092e\u0947\u0928\u0947\u091c \u0915\u094b \u0926\u0947\u0916\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u090f\u0915 \u0916\u0941\u0936\u0940 \u0939\u0948\u0964\u201d The Vishkar man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry but my Hindi is a bit rubbish.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry.  I said, \u2018It\u2019s a pleasure to see you again Ms. Jim\u00e9nez.\u2019\u201d the male Vishkar representative replied, tapped the ID tag mounted to his chest, making its Hindi script become English and letting better understand his name: Sanjay Korpal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ID\u2019s Hindi script became English, letting you better understand his name, Sanjay Korpal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI take it you\u2019re one of the heroes Lum\u00e9riCo has hired? It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you Mr.\u2026\u201d  Sanjay asked holding his arm out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaser-Shot,\u201d you answered, shaking Sanjay\u2019s right hand, you than turned to the Vishkar woman asked, \u201cAnd your name would be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSatya Vaswani.\u201d She answered, tapping her own ID tag.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSe\u00f1or Korpal,\u201d Ms. Jimenez said surprised, \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting you to be early.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArriving early is how Vishkar shows solidarity.\u201d Mr. Korpal replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re planning enter into a partnership with Vishkar Corporation.  Lum\u00e9riCo is hoping to expand outside of Mexico,\u201d Angel explained to you, \u201cWe\u2019ve made a partnership contract with Vishkar so that Lum\u00e9riCo provides clean energy for the new developments in Mexico, and in return, Vishkar will help Lum\u00e9riCo expand outside of Mexico, so we provide electricity to those in need anywhere in the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI take it this \u2018Proyecto Armonia\u2019 a project between the two of you?\u201d  you asked, reflecting to the protest rally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly. Proyecto Armonia will be a joint development collaboration between Vishkar and Lum\u00e9rico to enhance the city of Dorado\u2019s self-sufficiency.\u201d Sanjay answered, \u201cVishkar\u2019s urban planning will be combined with Lum\u00e9rico\u2019s clean energy systems.  The population that the city of Dorado can shelter, and support will increase exponentially.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sanjay explained Proyecto Armonia for you, Satya held out her prosthetic hand forward, palm side upward. Light erupted from her palm, emerging as first as a cyan column of light the length of her arm span. Then Satya used both of her hands to remold the light pillar through stretching, compressing, splitting, and distending it until the final product was a holographic quartet of nine tiered arcologies, all connected with a series of plexiglass skyways with windows on every view.  Each sector was shaped after a symmetrical parallelogram and was organized by function.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you can see,\u201d Mr. Korpal continued, \u201cThe first three sectors of a Proyecto Armonia arcology will be devoted to varying industries, with the heaviest at the bottom.  The next three will be designated as residential zones for people of varying incomes, with lower incomes on sector 4 and wealthier citizens residing in sector 6, but we decided to house the police and security personnel in sector 5 to give them consistent mobility to respond to any threat in the buildings. Sectors 7 and 8 will be devoted to amenities: with shops, restaurants, community centers, and schools, for sector 7 and larger scale amenities like parks, zoos, hotels, and stadiums for sector 8. The highest-level, Sector 9, will designed for large scale agricultural production and is quartered for different specialties such produce and livestock. Sector 9 will be encased in a holographic dome that allows the control of both weather and atmospheric pressure.  Each of our Vishkar arcologies will have power and utility decks between each sector providing air, clean drinking water, and Lum\u00e9riCo energy to the sectors below and above it.  Moving up and down the sectors will be supplied by 12 giant elevators, 4 near the arcology\u2019s center and 8 around the edges.  These elevators also serve as Proyecto Armonia\u2019s means of support and structure, keeping the arcologies remain stable under all conditions.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you had to guess from Satya\u2019s model, which was as tall as she was if not half a foot to two higher, each building would be 180 stories tall with each of the sectors taking about 20 stories apiece. You stated, \u201cNice sales pitch, but a couple of people didn\u2019t want that in their backyards.\u201d You stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve expected this.\u201d Mr. Korpal answered. \u201cMost people are reluctant to make compromises and sacrifices when it comes to public order.  Vishkar has seen similar protests in Khartoum and Rio de Janerio.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you looked over at Satya, you noticed like she is having some remorse over something.  Once Sanjay cleared his throat and Satya\u2019s expression reverted back to stern professionalism.  By closing her artificial hand, the Proyecto Armonia model disappeared.  Satya then looked to you and said, \u201cI am looking forward to working with you to bring order.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanjay immediately explained, \u201cVishkar is committed to seeing the G30 summit run peacefully. That's why we had Satya volunteer herself for the security detail.\u201d </span></div></div>",

As Angel Buriaga opened door, the office of Guillermo Portero was dark, with all the curtain blinds blocking all forms of light.  Once the hall brought light to the office behind the desk sat the stressed out and fatigued CEO of Lum\u00e9rico, Guillermo Portero.  Mr. Portero looked utterly exhausted, and the top of his desk had documents scattered about in an utterly disorganized matter, two empty bottles of Tequila laying on their sides with a third bottle just recently opened right next to the nine tenths empty glass, and an ashtray with a quarter of a long-extinguished cigar sticking straight upward. His newly grown stubble near his chin looked inconsistently shaved. His mustache looked completely unkempt, and its ends were split apart.  You noticed how baggy and red his eyes were as the Lum\u00e9rico executive tried to shield them from the hall lighting with his left hand while the right hand was clutching the right part of his skull. Mr. Portero\u2019s lips looked dry and cracked.  His Lum\u00e9rico lapel pin was put on crooked. You could see that Satya was wanting to fix up the executive\u2019s clutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god, he\u2019s relapsed again.\u201d You could hear Ms. Jimenez say under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Mr. Portero said, \u201cI just working late and I\u2026 got off the phone with the\u2026 divorce lawyer and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 Sir, the first of the security detail have arrived.\u201d Ms. Jimenez told her boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Oh! Welcome,\u201d Mr. Portero quickly put a false bravado, \u201cI\u2019m glad the two of you have come help with protecting the G20\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG30 se\u00f1or.\u201d Salphador corrected his boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG30 summit on Lum\u00e9rico\u2019s behalf!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw all that you needed to know your clients' boss; the false corruption accusations had taken its toll on the Lum\u00e9rico CEO and he\u2019s turned to liquor to cope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeave it to us sir.\u201d  You said, ending the conversation and headed out of the Lum\u00e9rico building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, outside the Lum\u00e9rico building, your back-vision powers caught sight of Ms. Vaswani catching up to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou finished sorting out Mr. Portero\u2019s desk?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.  Walking off from your duty is considered is a rude behavior.\u201d Satya said, not approving of what you just pulled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just shrugged and answered, \u201cConsidering our bosses at Lum\u00e9rico don\u2019t have any leads, I wouldn\u2019t consider us \u2018on duty\u2019. From what Ms. Jimenez told me we would just be waiting for them to order us around.  I prefer seeing it as finding the truth myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Satya replied, somehow intrigued by your last sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c'Finding the Truth' means that you should be seeking out the answers.  You can\u2019t be taking what people tell you at face value.  Accepting whatever\u2019s convenient for you will only make you susceptible to the manipulators of chaos.  Not accepting evidence that goes against your worldview will only harm you in the long run and by accepting it, we can use that knowledge to fix the flaws in ourselves, our beliefs, and become stronger and adaptable.\u201d You answered, \u201cBut enough about me, you should loosen up.  Don\u2019t you got anything more casual to wear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatya gave both your philosophy and your question that some thought.  For the latter, she then took her mechanical hand out, this time summoning a small cone of hard light. Placing it on the ground, the light cone transformed into a Vishkar Teleporter pad.  Satya stepped in the teleporter, and half a minute later, she stepped out in a new attire: a sleeveless dark blue dress, with metallic gold accents and a cyan glow to it.  Satya was also wearing a black polyester undershirt, metal heels, and black stocking that went past her knees.  On her head was a white helmet that exposed the front of her head and face while letting her hair pass through.  The helmet had an extension that ran across her head to the forehead with a cyan diamond at the end.  Across her face was a holographic visor.  A pair of cyan column earrings hanged from the helmet\u2019s ear coverings and a metallic band across her neck.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSymmetra, reporting.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou call yourself that?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m on missions, yes. And is this more casual for you Laser-Shot?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019ll definitely do Sym.\u201d You answered her, feeling the start of an exquisite partnership with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso Ms. Jimenez said you forgot your map of the city.\u201d  She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSymmetra handed you a map of the city of Dorado. The Gran Puesta Del Sol Resort\u2019s location was marked with turquoise circle near the center of southeast corner of town, overlooking the sea. Another area of interest on the map would be a G30 Cultural Harmony Festival that gets held in every city when it hosts a G30 summit, full of international entertainments, souvenir stands, and plenty of food booths of cuisines from around the globe.

If you made your way to the festival now, you could get lunch there with having to avoid the crowds.  You told Symmetra, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s head to the festival.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSymmetra was hesitant about that answer replying, \u201cI\u2019m not the one that enjoys festivals.  There always too crowded and too noisy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I hear that.\u201d You agreed, \u201cBut the festival is part of the G30 summit. If we arrive early enough the lines won\u2019t be long. Besides, a large noisy crowd is what a terrorist group like Talon will usually aim for.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re correct on that Laser-Shot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you walked on over to the festival, avoiding the crowd of demonstrators that were at the front of the Lum\u00e9rico plant.   At the festival entrance in Dorado's central plaza, there were a few Lum\u00e9rico personnel that were working what looked to be an admittance booth.  One of them asked you for a ticket for admittance into the festival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWe\u2019re part of the security detail.\u201d You told the staff, taking out the passcard \u201cThat should get us in, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two staffers recognized the passcards as something that could only be issued by Lum\u00e9rico\u2019s security department.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe see you have the voucher passcards.\u201d One of the staffers said, \u201cRight this way se\u00f1ors.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you predicted, the crowds of the G were relatively light, limited just around several families, although considering the large protest about Proyecto Armonia, you wonder if that was why the attendance low. Balloons of various family were tethered the plaza\u2019s fountain and most of the booths. The booths themselves had their wares completely set up and consisted of three types. First was were the booths that used G30\u2019s name for merchandising, mostly consisting of cheaply made, low quality, souvenir shirts, mugs, posters, and plush toys.  The other two types of booths had a better idea on the G30\u2019s promotion of global unity. The uncommon artists booth with their quality handmade goods that represented their trades, travels, and cultures.  Finally, the last type was the concession stands.  The food booths were manned by cooks and chefs of the highest caliber. The smells of fresh ingredients being put on the grill was enough for your salivary glands begin to slowly water.  You looked at Symmetra but found a worried expression on her face and in her body language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething wrong? First time at a festival?\u201d You asked your new partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s just\u2026\u201d Symmetra answered, overwhelmed, \u201ctoo many choices.  Lunch is much easier at the Vishkar commissary.  I get what is according to my diet program: a light 150 calorie meal cube.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuddered to think what a meal cube would be, but you ended up asking, \u201cwhat\u2019s a meal cube?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSymmetra\u2019s answer did nothing to assuage you, \u201cIt\u2019s cube that you eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf what little she said about this \u201cmeal cube\u201d, the only conclusion you got was it would be utterly tasteless and bland.  So you suggested, \u201cWell, you\u2019re working at Dorado for now.  Since they\u2019re paying for the whole thing, just take one of each and see what you like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left Symmetra to her own devices as you searched for a food booth that could have a good lobster roll. Once you found one and paid for it with the passcard, you headed back to your table, and discovered Symmetra took your advice in a way you didn\u2019t expect. While you meant to say one item from each booth, the Vishkar architect took it as one of each item from each booth.  The table you had set up for just the two of you ended up being one half filled with food all sorts: corn dogs, french fries, mozzarella sticks, currywurst, j\u00e4gerschnitzel, A large pretzel, fish tacos, a platter of nachos, quesadillas, chicken parmesan, calamari fritti, caprese salad,  focaccia bread, skewers of shrimp tempura, chicken teriyaki, a bento box full of various kinds sushi, and a ramen bowl were among the many food items left that Symmetra had yet to eat.  The other half was filled with empty plates and bowls of sauces, bones, and crumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to finish all that?\u201d You asked, amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Symmetra answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn that case, how are you liking it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I \u2026 enjoy it. I never realized how much I could eat in one setting.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMuch better than one of those meal cubes huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSymmetra blushed as you gave extended belly a gentle massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 A meal cube is better because\u2026 The Vishkar Corporation said so and\u2026.\u201d She answered but put down her plate, that look of <br>\r\nregret returning to her face back when Sanjay mentioned Rio de Janerio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s something the matter with Vishkar?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes I think the Vishkar Corporation\u2026 might have done\u2026 something unsavory.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was just an awkward pause between the two of you.  There was something eating at Symmetra's conscious that the rest of Symmetra's meal couldn't snap her out of, but instead...</span></div></div>",

Watching over the festival was uneventful, the only time the two of you were called in was to take care of a rowdy tourist who was way too drunk.  Once the sun began to set over the Misi\u00f3n Dorado at 6:42 pm, all the booths began closing for the day, and the crowds started to slowly disperse.  You gave yourself a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was it?\u201d You asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurprising orderly.\u201d Symmetra answered, her stomach somehow retaining its largeness from her massive lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled as the two of you made your way back to the Puesta Del Sol Resort, and it took a half hour since left the festival for it to be nighttime in Dorado as you two walked across the Dorado\u2019s beach with Symmetra's ballooned belly swaying with each of her steps. The night sky was as clear as the Gulf of Mexico the city overlooked.  You could see the moon in a beautiful waning crescent and the constellation of Scorpius, the constellation of your zodiac sign, front and center in the night sky. To the right of Scorpio, you saw the constellation of Libra.  Considering Symmetra was to your right as well, you made a circumstantial guess that her sign would be Libra as well. It was as if the stars were hinting at it.  Unfortunately, the moment was broken with the sound of three bullets firing and the shattering of glass.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA gunshot.\u201d Symmetra answered, keeping her calm during the sudden outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cObviously. Let\u2019s go check out if somebody\u2019s hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you ran back to town and you saw Symmetra\u2019s large gut didn\u2019t impede her agility in the slightest bit.  In ten minutes, and 3 blocks away was the source of the commotion.  Somebody had just robbed a local hardware store named Ferreter\u00eda Babor.  The front window was just destroyed, and was the clerk leaning the door frame, clutching his left shoulder which was slowly leaking blood.  The nature of the wound looked like the weapon came from a pulse weapon.  His wife was on her phone, in a frantic conversation with the emergency services. The time showed at the store's clock was 7:25 PM, which caused you to note that the robbery took place at around 7:15. Thankfully, you knew plenty of Spanish to converse with the injured shopkeeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u00bfQu\u00e9 te ha pasado? \u00bfEst\u00e1s herido?\u201d  &lt;What happened to you? Are you hurt?&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDu\u2026ele. Ahhh.  &lt;It\u2026 hurts.&gt;\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo se preocupe se\u00f1or, estamos aqu\u00ed para ayudarlo. \u00bfPuedes decirme algo sobre el tirador?  &lt;Don\u2019t worry sir, we\u2019re here to help.  Can you tell me anything about the shooter?&gt;\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, \u00e9l solo ... irrumpi\u00f3. Espera un minuto ... \u00bfest\u00e1s con ... la polic\u00eda?? &lt;I saw him... trying to steal\u2026 some wiring. Wait a minute... are you with... the cops? &gt;\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo del todo, &lt;Not quite,&gt;\u201d You replied, \u201cAcabo de tener la sensaci\u00f3n de que el responsable de esto trabaja para alguien que mi cliente busca. &lt;I just got the feeling whoever\u2019s responsible for this is somebody our client is after.&gt;\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSymmetra on the other hand was staring at the broken window and the many pieces of shattered glass were scattered around both sides of the wall that formerly held it. While Symmetra used her light to fix the window, you helped yourself inside.  There weren\u2019t any security cameras in the store, cash register was left in place, the silent alarm was going off and already notified emergency services. and only thing stolen was a trivial number of wiring bundles that were on sale. You didn\u2019t look far for your first clue, as on the ground close to the wiring was a cheap looking white smart phone with a black plastic shell meant to protect the phone from falls and impacts.  Considering your gloves didn\u2019t have fingertips and you did not want to get your prints on a potential piece of evidence, you quickly grabbed some empty plastic bags from across the counter, slipped your hands in, and went back and picked up the phone.  The first thing you noticed the something was carved into phone\u2019s back.  It looked like a bunch of lines with dots that you couldn\u2019t make any sense of.  You turned on the phone but was imminently taken a touch password screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you find something?\u201d Symmetra asked, finishing repair the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerp lost his phone in the struggle.\u201d You answered, showing the phone to her. \u201cThere\u2019s something on the back and I want to say it\u2019s the password.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou placed the phone on the Cashier\u2019s bench face down, showing the glyph. Something is Symmetra\u2019s mind just intuitively click.  One second later, she leaned forward, pressing her belly against the bench and she flipped the phone screen up with her prosthetic arm.  Using the same arm, Symmetra entered the phone\u2019s password started with a vertical line, then made the shape of an S, a dollar sign.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re in.\u201d She told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how did you know figure out the password so easily?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looked like a hard-light instruction for making a spiral staircase back at the architectural academy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeird... Looked like a dollar sign to me.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you noticed was the wallpaper. The background was black, and you could see the distinctive red and white emblem of the terrorist organization Talon behind the 4 X 6 grid of applications.  You decided to check the photos gallery and your fingers were able to work the phone without, thinking the perp would leave plenty of selfies.  That assumption was proven correct as the first 75 percent of the photos contained a blonde American man in his late twenties with a buck toothed smile.  All the social media accounts the phone was logged onto identified the suspect as Jimmy Glakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the culprit alright.\u201d You said, \u201cLum\u00e9riCo was right to think that Talon was after them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSymmetra pressed a button on her visor, and the visor began scanning Jimmy\u2019s face, bringing up valuable information, such as a criminal record.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe enlisted in the army to get a jail term reduced but was dishonorably discharged for war crimes. Jimmy Glakes has numerous criminal offenses in the United States:  Multiple counts of armed robbery, gun trafficking, possession of controlled substances with intent to sell, and Indecent Exposure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMust be nice getting info from that,\u201d You said, \u201cAnywho, maybe we can look at his text messages, so we can try to figure out his movements.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou accessed the phone\u2019s text messages app, and the latest conversation Mr. Glakes was involved with somebody named \u201cNerg\u00fci Tanguul\u201d, and from the context of the conversation, he looked he was one of Glakes\u2019s superiors within Talon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">NT: Our engineers spent months spent perfecting the bomb and you happened to lose all the copper wiring?</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">JG:  The wirin\u2019 was all their last time I checked.</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">NT: You were the last person to look after the bomb and yet the bomb\u2019s wiring is still missing, so it must have been you.  Do you know how angry Doomfist will be when the bomb fails to go off in two days? He has everything at stake to make sure the G30 leaders present there are assassinated.  Do everyone in involved in this mission a favor and get some replacement wiring!</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">JG: How am ah supposed to find wirin\u2019 in this joint?  All da signs are in Mexican.</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">NT: \u2026  I marked a hardware store closest to your location for you. Please, get the replacement wiring now!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation ended but there was a map attached to Mr. Tanguul\u2019s last message. The map had two locations pinned down:  The store, and a place labeled \u201csafe house\u201d.  You clicked on the button that was labeled \u201cSafe House\u201d and immediately got an address: Guidance Parkway, 555, Terrace Ridge.  Emergency services finally arrived to take the shopkeeper to the emergency room.  You left the phone at the store as you were able to mark the safe house\u2019s location on your own map of Dorado. Knowing there talon had a devastating bomb with the world leader's name on it, you had to make your next more quickly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Following the map, you were led to Terrace Ridge on the northwest corner of the city, overlooking the old fort Castillo.  Terrace Ridge was one of the poorer communities in Dorado with a much denser population to boot.  Terrace Ridge looked like a slum, with poorly maintained sidewalks, deteriorated benches, and a rusted playground equipment that was in shambles, and litter flying all over the place in the night breeze, with nobody caring for the state their neighborhood was in.  Businesses that set up shop in this neighborhood were on the sleazy side, mainly a few \u201cno tell\u201d motels, a couple bars, and a tobacco store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, so much filth lies on these streets.\u201d  Symmetra said, making her belly vibrate with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s neighborhoods with character, and then are neighborhoods in serious need of a public works renovation.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome to think of it, Terrace Ridge is where one of the arcologies for Proyecto Armonia would be established.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould be nice for these folks, but whose backyard is it going to be in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour partner\u2019s uneasy look implied couldn\u2019t think of answer, so she decided to change the subject at hand, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just focus on Talon.  To think a terrorist cell could establish themselves in this city.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore like the homeowners are so desperate for money, they put the house on the greatest get rich quick scheme, the rent sharing market, and Talon fooled\u2026\u201d you bluntly answered before you arrived at the safe house, an abandoned, dilapidated apartment complex, causing you to backspace on the last word you just said, \u201c\u2026found a perfectly empty abandoned apartment to squat in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo avoid suspicion, you leaned your back to the front window and let your back-vision power do the reconnaissance. You could see at three people in the living room, open kitchen hybrid.  None of them looked like they were of Mexican or even Central American ethnicity, confirming your sharing market theory. The one on the couch was Russian, the one in the kitchen was Macedonian, and streaming on tablet on the partial wall/dining table was Libyan.  They were in plainclothes, but you could see their uniforms, black and red with Talon\u2019s logo on the chest, along with several assault rifles and shotguns placed on a wall mounted coatrack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Talon\u2019s safe house alright. I can see the uniforms and a couple of firearms.\u201d You told your partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cracked your knuckles and pulled out your Tommy Laser. Symmetra got out another orb of light manifested it into her weapon, the Photon Projector.  It looked like a futuristic pistol with throngs extending from the muzzle, however she put the sidearm to her hip, which was partially obstructed by her large gut, for moment, preparing for the fight with her abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's show them at Order overcome Chaos\" She said.</span></div></div>",

Then she then placed what looked like another teleporter pad straight against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little short for a teleporter?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Shield Generator.\u201d Symmetra answered, it will give us protection.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the shield generator was established and a holograph of a spherical barrier of hexagons was displayed above it, you felt your flesh being enveloped in a force field, leaving a transparent cyan sheen to your skin. You flex your arms and hands to feel how the shielding would affect your movements, which was non obstructive. Symmetra took hold of her Photon Projector out of her holster and a ball of light was forming out of the sidearm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood to know. Could always use some extra durability.\u201d You replied, putting a fresh battery into your Tommy Laser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou counted down the timing with your free hand. When the countdown expired, Symmerta placed the second teleporter in the kitchen corner of the enemies\u2019 hideaway, you knocked on door, getting their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally! Those damn fish taquitos are late!\u201d You heard Russian Talon goon say, having no idea what he and has coconspirators were in for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d You said, \u201cIt\u2019s on the house!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kicked in the front door the moment you felt the doorknob turn.  The impact staggered the Russian minion and Symmetra delivered the follow up by firing the charged up ball of light form her photon projector, blasting the Russian before he had a chance the open the door, knocking him to the floor. Before any of the other talon minions reacted, you backflipped into the teleporter entry pad, warping to straight behind them, delivering a backwards clothesline to the back of one the Macedonian\u2019s head. You took a backwards aim with your Tommy Laser, firing a barrage of lasers which found their marks on the Libyan mook's back before he could grab a firearm. Your ambush was successful, but from your position, you could hear reinforcements coming in from upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReinforcements incoming!\u201d You yelled to Symmetra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more Talon soldiers were coming out of hall, having been alerted to the ruckus the moment you kicked in the door. Your partner entered the apartment complex and threw 6 orbs of light from her Symmetra's palm like pellets of a shotgun. The orbs became sentry turrets that armed themselves in less than a second. Two more opponents did make their way in, and the six sentries fired powerful slowing lasers, electrocuting and immobilizing them for you to deliver a strong flying knee attack to their chests. The next two goons were Talon assassins with blades mounted on each forearm.  They were agile enough that they could power their way through the sentries and lunged forward at both of you.  Symmetra was able to fend off her attacker by blocking the swipes with kicks and strikes with her cybernetic hand as her photon projector fired a powerful beam that locked to the assassin.  The beam forced a current of amplified light into the Talon soldier\u2019s body that grew in power the longer the beam locked on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou on the other hand had to use metallic stool as an improvised shield to block the blades, which wasn\u2019t as effective as you ended up getting a few scrapes and cuts to your personal shield.  The Photon Projector\u2019s beam forced the assassin that was battling Symmetra to pass out, and your partner quickly turned the photon projector over to your attack, having her collapse to the ground faster than the first.  Symmetra quickly helped up to your feet.  After you thanked Symmetra, both looked at the knocked-out Talon mooks.  Symmetra summoned a pair of white plastic handcuffs from her prosthetic hand, gave one pair to you, and then the two of you started putting the cuffing the unconscious goons.  As you placed the last cuffs, Symmetra caught notice of someone. There were one more talon agent, a blonde American, who trying was trying to sneak out of the safe house.  Both of you knew who your next target was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Glakes!  He\u2019s trying to escape!\u201d She exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot for long! He\u2019s not the one to hit the ground running!\u201d you said, tossing down a special device, a Pursuit Bomb, to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pursuit Bomb\u2019s shape looked roughly like a computer mouse with a robotic scorpion mounted on it.  The Pursuit Bomb's coloration was the same as your Tommy laser, white with green accents.  The Pursuit Bomb took off after its target. A few seconds later, you both heard a bang and a series of thuds to indicate that Jimmy was tumbling down the stairs.  At the bottom of the stairwell was the dizzy but uninjured suspect of your investigation, Jimmy Glakes.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been looking all over you, Jimmy.\u201d  You told, lifting him by his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh didn\u2019t do nothing.\u201d Glakes lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe know you robbed Ferreter\u00eda Babor!\u201d Symmetra answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh wasn\u2019t near that place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere your phone was found.\u201d Your partner bluntly added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u2019d never lose mah phone. It was on mah pocket da whol time since 7:15.\u201d Glakes replied, confused at the statement you just said, but fortunately incriminated himself by the time of the robbery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSymmetra reached into Jimmy\u2019s pants pocket and surprisingly there was a phone it. She took it out the phone and held it up to yours for comparison. Both of you were in for a surprise, the two were completely identical, from the make and model, to the password, even the apps and texts were the same, including the one that instructed Jimmy to rob that hardware store.  The only difference was that strange glyph that on the phone\u2019s back covering was missing, and there was a new text sent from the phone just two minutes ago sent as a warning to the other Talon agents out in the city, \u201cSafe house is being raided!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you slapped the cuffs on Jimmy, your subsequent investigation in the rest of the messy rooms apartment complex just turned up a portion of the stolen wiring, more firearms, narcotics, blood money, but no bomb.  There was one room in Talon\u2019s safe house left to investigate, a master bedroom that doubled as a makeshift office.  It was all neat and orderly in contrast to other rooms, the bed was neatly made, a rectangular throw was placed parallel to bed\u2019s left and right sides, and on the nightstand was a file, and three photographs had some familiar holes in them. You just realized that this was the dossier from the flight this morning, but what was it doing here?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at one of the photos and its relevant intelligence and said, \"Hey, Lum\u00e9riCo hit the intel jackpot.  It seems we found this Nerg\u00fci Tanguul person, and he's one of the members of Talon's council and their head director of Engineering and Logistics to boot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNerg\u00fci looked like a man in his thirties, with a notable X shaped scar that ran diagonally downward from the edges of his forehead to his cheeks.  His hair was brown, had a small goatee, and a mustache in the style of, for lack of a better word, \u201cFu Manchu\u201d.   While Lum\u00e9riCo\u2019s intelligence indicated he was a former military engineer from Mongolia, his eyes indicated otherwise for some reason. You gave Nerg\u00fci's photo to Symmetra but the Talon\u2019s Engineering and Logistics Head Director\u2019s face was starting to look awfully familiar to her, but she couldn\u2019t put a name to it yet.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for yourself, you tried to find some other clues in Nerg\u00fci\u2019s room and all it took was a pulling the nightstand\u2019s drawer to find the bomb\u2019s schematics.  According to the schematics, Talon\u2019s bomb would use the research of somebody named Dr. Siebren de Kuiper. The \u201cSpatial Rending\u201d bomb would envelop a large area in a black hole for a short period of time. The area would be large enough to not only destroy the area designated for the G30 summit, but a few adjacent neighborhoods as well.  The expected death toll in a city like Dorado would be likely be in the thousands<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, this is pretty unnerving. Looks like in three 3 days, Talon is going to wipe out the G30 conference with use their special black hole bomb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSymmetra took heed, and tried to contact Sanjay, pressing a button into her visor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Satya Vaswani, I would like to make an emergency call to supervisor Sanjay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry but Sanjay\u2019s whereabouts is classified to under qualified Vishkar personnel.\u201d  An automated voiced immediately replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!? But Sanjay is my supervisor\u2026\u201d Symmetra replied, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Ms. Vaswani you do not have clearance to speak to him.\u201d The voice once again reasserted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe automated voice then terminated Symmetra's call, and soon after, you could see fear in Symmetra eyes for the first time. There was plenty of issue about this investigation frustratingly that didn\u2019t make any sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m starting to get the feeling this whole bust was staged.\u201d You said, \u201cIf Jimmy didn\u2019t lose his phone, then the one we found must have been planted by someone.

Well, you certainly can testify to that quote, that's for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all started after you arrived home in your apartment in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, about ready to go to bed after a long night of partying since it so happened to be your birthday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you slumped over onto your bed, letting yourself succumb to exhaustion as you closed your eyes, little did you realize that by the time you woke up the next morning, your life would be changed forever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-- 8 Hours Later --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up, you were half-expecting to experience a full-on hangover headache from drinking one too many shots of alcohol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly arose from your bed, where you eventually began to realize that something felt...off. From there, you soon noticed that the room you were currently in definitely wasn't the bedroom you fell asleep in last night, just as you then quickly became aware that you were now wearing nothing but your skivvies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, (Name). You might have had one too many drinks.\" You subconsciously thought to yourself, recollecting your thoughts in the process. However, all those initial thoughts were soon pushed aside when you suddenly felt something... rather plush and soft rub up against your left side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, you turned your head toward the source of such a feeling, only to come across an abrupt revelation: You weren't alone in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, the large figure appeared to be female, as well as obviously being of Hispanic ethnicity, judging from the tone of her skin. However, the most distinguishing feature of this woman was her lengthy dark brown hair, which was put into a side shave hairstyle, as you could clearly see the shaved left side of the woman's smooth scalp, while her lengthy hair was dyed a neon purple halfway down the tip of her luscious hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first glance, you couldn't help but feel like this woman looked strangely... \"familiar\" to you. But of course, your brain soon kicked in shortly thereafter, which made you quickly realize who this mysterious woman actually was:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sleeping woman before you was none other than the Hispanic Hacker known only as \"Sombra\", from the video game Overwatch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened with shock, now realizing who you slept with. After all, when it came to playing Overwatch, you would always choose to play as Sombra. Why? Because her playstyle and skill set was so unique compared to the more mainstream Overwatch characters such as Tracer,  Soldier 76, Reaper, and many other Overwatch characters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course, your mind soon began to wonder, as you subconsciously thought, \"But... How is this even possible?! Sombra is a fictional character from a video game!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, upon further inspection, you soon began to notice something that felt off about all of this. Instinctively, you cautiously unfurled the bedsheets from Sombra's sleeping form, which revealed something particularly uncanny: The woman known as Sombra appeared as if she weighed 500 to 600 pounds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face was much softer and a bit cherubic compared to what she looked like in the game, as Sombra now sported a pair of lightly chubby facial cheeks and a definitive double chin. Looking downward, Sombra now carried a hefty pair of E-Cup breasts, which were held up a little by a purple bra. Her arms had a noticeable amount of adipose on them, giving her biceps a pillowy appearance, along with a mildly plump pair of forearms and a pair of chubby hands and fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes scanned below her voluptuous breasts, which showed a prominent but doughy belly, as it displayed itself in a set of two rolls, while it casually laid atop her lap, along with an equally padded waistline. Compared to her abdomen, Sombra's lower half was certainly the largest parts of her substantially larger physique, as each of her buttcheeks were now easily as big as a pair of beanbag chairs, complete with wide enough hips to compensate. Her legs were just as thick and bulbous as her derriere and burgeoning hips, with her thighs being the thickest parts of her legs, feeling as if she wrapped a thick body pillow around each of her thighs, complete with thick fat-laden calves and plump feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/ray-norr/art/Mondo-Sombra-689932240\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.deviantart.com/ray-norr/art/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, you could see that this iteration of the Overwatch character was certainly much fatter than what you remembered.

See what else has changed besides your bedroom, as well as the fact that the now rotund Sombra was sleeping right next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, you slowly crept your way off the massive bed, which now appeared to be much more circular than you previously remembered. Of course, you made sure you inadvertently awaken the Hispanic Hacker from her slumber, as you cautiously made your way out of the bedroom, carefully closing the now double doors behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, once you made your way out of the bedroom, you finally got a clear glimpse at what had become of your residence. In place of your crummy apartment, you were now currently standing in a lavish yet spacious apartment condo, which was heavily stylised in this futuristic art-deco style. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff to the right, there was this lavish neon futuristic living room, complete with a massive squared off deco style couch and plexiglass coffee table, as well as a massive fancy Holographic television set. Of course, this made you beginning to question if you were somehow now in the Overwatch universe, considering the game itself takes place 70 years into the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff to another corner, you soon took notice of a massive yet futuristic Kitchen area, complete with an ungodly massive futuristic-looking refrigerator, which appeared to be decked out with glowing neon purple markings, taking the form of Sombra's notorious insignia: A Day of the Dead Skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, in the center between the living room and the Kitchen area, there was this large 30 foot by 30 foot area of open floor, where you cautiously yet curiously approached the area. However, once you stepped foot onto the area itself, the floor suddenly began to mechanically open and separate itself, which caused a bunch of metallic cabinets to arise from the opening the floor autonomously made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, your curiosity got the better of you, as you carefully approached the cabinets, hoping something bad doesn't happen to you in the process. Moments later, you soon discovered what these metallic cabinets held within: Numerous advanced gadgets, as well as Sombra's trademark Machine Pistol, along with what appeared to be a bunch of portable Translocator Beacons Sombra uses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to top it all off, there was an even larger metallic cabinet adjacent to the other cabinets, which you promptly opened up, as it revealed a substantially larger version of Sombra's trademark cyberpunk-esque outfit and ensemble. Curiously, you gently touched the outfit, only for it to spontaneously turn invisible in front of you for a brief moment or two before becoming visible once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* Okay, it's official: I was DEFINITELY sleeping with Sombra. But...how did I even get here in the first place?\" You thought to yourself, slowly backing away from the brightly colored Thermoptic Camo outfit, only for you to accidentally bump into a holographic button on the side, which set off what sounded like a radio played at full volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The song playing is \"Neo Tokyo (Dance With The Dead Remix)\" by \"Scandroid\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit! SHIT!! Not good, not good!!\" You loudly thought to yourself, as you feebly attempted to shut off the 80s Techno style music blasting from the futuristic speakers, having a bad feeling that this was undoubtedly going to wake up the corpulent Sombra.</span></div></div>",

(Son of a bitch...)\" She muttered to herself, as she then hacked into the futuristic radio to turn it off, which was very effective in that regard. From there, she turned her attention toward you, bearing a lovey-dovey look upon her plump face, as if she was relieved to see you or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as she casually waddled over to you, her wide burgeoning hips sashaying from left to right, as you easily noticed that she was still in her lingerie, but it seemed of little importance to a woman like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, despite feeling like you were being backed into a corner by the burgeoningly buxom woman, Sombra wrapped her meaty arms around your neck area and, unexpectedly, pulled you in for a passionate kiss on the lips. At first, you were completely surprised by such a revelation, especially since you were still confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, all that confusion soon contorted and changed into instinctive passion, as you returned the kiss towards the bottom-heavy Sombra, who seemed to be enjoying the attention you're just giving her, displaying a flirty smirk upon her plump lips as she spoke toward you with a mix of languages between English and Spanish as she quipped, \"*giggle* So...

Well, I guess that explains all esa raqueta que hiciste, cari\u00f1o (that racket you made, Sweetie).\" Sombra retorted, where she noticed you blushing a little in...embarrassment?

God, you were so confused right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* I gotta admit, though, you're certainly mucho mas lindo (much cuter) when you get so flustered like that.\" Sombra chirped, obviously having a bit of a chuckle, regarding your current state of affairs.

In appearance, instead of wearing merely a massive purple bra and panties, the Hispanic cybernetic hacker now sported a more <i>casual</i> set of attire, which left little to the imagination when it came to her prominent enormity. Surprisingly, it has an almost striking similarity to her signature ensemble, especially with the toed foot leggings that showed a noticeable outline of her now chubby feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, unlike her signature outfit, it was a sleeveless one-piece, high-tech looking neon pink and neon blue bodysuit, which easily flaunted of her chunky meaty arms, as well as a little bit of her flabby sides, whilst showing off her ponderously hefty breasts.But what notably stood out the most aside from her abundantly large lower half, was her beanbag-sized bulge of a gut, as it seemingly stretched the smooth high-tech fabric near taut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><i>*relieved sigh*</i></b> <i>Santa mierda</i> (Holy shit), I certainly packed it all in, didn't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe mused, giving her double-folded dome of a belly a few curious pokes on her part, just after she got herself comfortable at a nearby reinforced chair, all whilst her said stomach made it's thoughts known to you both. Weirdly enough, you could understand what she said when speaking Spanish, as you calmly took a seat next to the enormous Overwatch character, who soon began to assault the breakfast food with the table manners of a competitor at an eating contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, you figured you would at least let her finish eating before asking any questions, to which you began to grab a small plate of waffles for your own breakfast...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>== An Hour Later... ==</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UURRRP!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSombra bellowed, unleashing quite an unladylike burp in the process, which also purged some excess gas within the pit that was her stomach.

Meanwhile, Sombra fondly stroked the top of her belly with a chubby hand, akin to a pregnant mother with their unborn child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>*chuckle*</b></i> Who knew getting so <i>maldita gorda</i> (goddamn fat) would have it's perks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe commented, a small blush of pleasure forming upon her somewhat rounder cheeks, as her eyes momentarily focused on her fattened form, to which you absentmindedly asked, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...

My head.\"</i> You thought to yourself, as you soon slowly felt your migraine receding in aggression, giving you some much needed clarity, noting how much sunlight was shining through the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wait...I don't remember having a bedroom window! Or...do I?\" </i> You contemplated, quickly noticing how off everything felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, last time you checked, you lived in a one-bedroom apartment in Queens, New York. But now...it appeared as if you were in some sort of...oversized RV? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly had the atmosphere of an RV. Or at least, a massive one the size of two regular RVs sandwiched together to make something bigger. But as your vision gained more clarity with each passing second, you soon took heed of your current environs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of your familiar scene of a one-person bed with a bedroom TV and other necessities, you now sat in an undoubtedly large two-person king-sized bed, complete with an assortment of clothes strewn about. However, you soon became aware of something rather surprising: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive pair of women's lingerie strewn aside upon the shaggy carpeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, as you curiously picked up a pair of black laced panties, you soon realized how big the wearer must've been. <i>\"Okay...Whoever wore these humongous things has gotta be weighing a quarter-ton or more.\"</i> You thought, blushing profusely at this realization, since you weren't exactly proficient when it came to dating women. Then again, you don't remember being into women of *ahem* <i>larger</i> stature, you could say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, just as you were about to contemplate on your predicament any further, your hearing soon cleared up enough for you to suddenly hear the violently loud and audible sounds of industrial tools being used, accompanied by the high-pitched sounds of grinding and shearing metal, which was undoubtedly unexpected for sure. Instinctively, you quickly covered your ears to protect your hearing, which proved as a momentary respite, to which you looked towards the wide door leading out of the bedroom as you thought, <i>\"...What the hell is going on?!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that you weren't going to find answers by simply lying in an unfamiliar bed, you quickly unfurled the bedsheets from your person, to which you attempted to find any clothes that'll fit you, which came in the form of a pair of mahogany sweatpants. Quickly, you hastily pulled up the sweatpants over your legs and pulled the pants strings to fasten it around your lower half. From there, you carefully traversed your way out out the bedroom, to which left you entering a large yet homely main area of the mobile home, which looked to have a slight futuristic European aesthetic to it, as you tread through the area, passing by a photo of you alongside some strikingly familiar faces...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to your currently stressed hearing, you calmly (albeit sluggishly) tracked the source of all that mechanized racket, which seemed to inevitably lead you outside, where you shielded your eyes a little from the intense change in brightness. Once your eyes had fully adjusted to the sunlit day, you soon took note of the sprawling grassy plains, rolling hills, and the snowy European mountaintops in the distance, along with a small yet quaint countryside town just a mile or two away from here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, the violent shearing sounds soon came to an abrupt halt, as you slowly turned around, only to now bear witness to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you finally got your bearings straightened out, you soon heard a rather familiar female voice speak out a good few yards away from where you stood, speaking withenthusiasmas she quipped, \"...D\u00e4r g\u00e5r vi (There we go)! Should be good to go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecoming rather curious, as well as having a gut feeling that you probably recognized that voice beforehand, you cautiously turned around towards the source, only to see a rather shocking surprise:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wait...Oh my god. ...That's Reinhardt!! Holy shit, it's really him!!\"</i> Your thoughts shrieked, as your eyes widened with great surprise upon seeing the middle-aged member of Overwatch donned in his iconic Crusader Armor! After all, prior to Brigitte being released as a playable character, Reinhardt was practically your go-to character in every match. But then, another thought crosses your mind as you mentally realized, <i>\"And if that's REALLY Reinhardt,  th-then that means...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, your eyes darted a little from left to right, until you ultimately spotted the living embodiment of your playtime on Overwatch: Brigitte Lindholm. Judging from her attire, she was undoubtedly in her mechanic getup, as you noted her tinkering with what appeared to be her own set of homemade Crusader Armor. And yet, as the nostalgic goggles wore off, you soon realize something was VERY off regarding Brigitte:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked rather obese!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon closer examination, she had a rather profound yet overly plump hourglass shape to her physique, with a rather prominent boulder of a belly jutting out a few inches from her voluminous Triple F-Cup breasts, as her extra large tanktop did little to conceal such an obvious gut. Somehow, it felt almost ironic, considering her father, Torbj\u00f6rn, was kind of a heavyset individual himself. Her arms were about as chunky too, along with bearing a fuller face with plump cheeks and a small but somewhat noticeable double chin, as well as a slightly softened jawline to boot. However, that wasn't to say that her upper body was the only expanded parts of her, as her lower half certainly wasn't spared from so much adipose. Her butt, once hard and pert from training sessions with her godfather, had ballooned out considerably, with each buttcheek about a similar size as a yoga ball, which were held up quite well by a thick meaty pair of thunder thighs and cankles. Overall, if you had to wager an estimated guess, you would bet that Brigitte now probably weighed around 500 to 600 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, surprisingly enough, she didn't seem to show the slightest hint of fatigue from hefting around that much girth, minus the sweat on her brow from tinkering with the machinery, as Reinhardt tested his Crusader Armor by flexing his hands and arms in a mere test of articulation, to which he then exuberantly hopped up onto his metallic feet uncharacteristically for someone at his age whilst he cheered, \"Ha Ha!! Wunderbar, Brigitte! I feel like I'm in my prime again!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yep. That's DEFINITELY Reinhardt! Nobody I know gets as excited as him.\"</i> You mentally joked, to which your thoughts were soon abruptly halted when Reinhardt took notice of you, now bearing a rather jovial grin on his bearded face as he exclaimed, \"Ah! Look who's finally awake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing him, you somehow guessed that he was referring to you, just as Reinhardt walked up to you, which easily made you feel small compared to the muscle-bound German in Crusader Armor, as he firmly patted you on the back with a metal hand as he quipped, \"How are you feeling, my friend?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Fine, I guess? Sorry, I had a rough time sleeping.\" You hesitantly answered, trying to make up a good enough excuse to convince the two Europeans that this wasn't out of place, despite your initial shock upon waking up in what you now assume to be the world of Overwatch. Fortunately, it worked, as Reinhardt gave you a hearty slap on the back whilst he jested, \"*chuckle* Wunderbar, my friend! Now, go get yourself some roden (grub). Ve got a big day ahead of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring you'd best take his advice, you calmly walked toward the nearby patio table set up outside adjacent to the RV, which was undoubtedly packed with some foodstuffs as part of a complete breakfast. Some of which you figured was for Brigitte, considering her current size at the moment. From there, Reinhardt soon motioned to the obese Brigitte and quipped, \"Same goes for you as well, child!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm almost done with upgrading my armor, gudfader(godfather). Just need to do one more calibration.\" She chirped, her fattened body jostling ever so slightly with each bit of movement. However, Reinhardt soon pulled her a bit from her position whilst he retorted, \"I know you do, Meine Liebste (my dear). But I promised your Mutter (mother) that you're getting enough to eat. Mach dir keine Sorgen (Don't worry), your \"calibrations\" vill still be here vhen you return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as if right on cue, Brigitte's stomach soon began to audibly growl for sustenance, which caused a bit of a profound blush to appear on her fuller face. \"*sigh* ...I guess you're right, gudfader (godfather).\" She admitted, much to her stomach's insistent pleas. And with that, Brigitte soon lumbered over to the patio table alongside you, sitting down on a stool that could barely contain her large rear end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there, she soon looked upon you with a rather affectionate expression on her fuller face, to which she then proceeded to wrap you in a surprisingly soft embrace. Although, despite not exactly being into fatter women, being hugged by an obese Brigitte felt quite...plush. In a good way, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Did you sleep well last night, s\u00f6tnos (sweetie)?\" She caringly asked, to which took you initially by surprise at how you could understand her when she spoke in her native Swedish dialect. And yet, what stood out in your mind was what she called you by:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Sweetie</i>\". As in like someone who's in a romantic relationship. A romantic relationship with Brigitte!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like hours when you had to adjust your mental faculties upon hearing such a realization. And yet, as your eyes moved to distract your mind a bit to compensate for your shock, you could easily see a good view of Brigitte's signature Crusader Armor. But upon a better inspection, you can clearly see that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>But whilst the rotund Brigitte began to devour her large breakfast with an almost gluttonous gusto and fervor,  you could clearly see the metallic ensemble that was her own set of Crusader Armor, which seemingly wasn't built with a helmet in mind like Reinhardt's was. And much to your surprise...It was actually completely finished, in both mechanical design and paint application, sporting a distinct color palette of bright construction yellow-orange, stainless steel grey, and dark leathery brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/oPajNQyq5RrdmqVu8\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.app.goo.gl/oPajNQyq5Rrdmq...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it appeared that the armor was MUCH larger in size due to Brigitte's now corpulent form, especially in the abdominal region, which seemed to have several segmented armored plates over the less insulated areas of the suit of armor. Suffice to say, Brigitte's signature armor looked stretched out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, much like Reinhardt, Brigitte's armor was equipped with a Barrier Shield, but it wasn't as expansive as her godfather's, only able to shield either herself or to protect a key teammate like Mercy or other healers. However, Brigitte compensates this with a custom-built Rocket Flail, which had a much greater range than Reinhardt's signature Rocket Hammer, due to the Rocket Flail being equipped with a 35 foot long chain attached to the Flail's head, which could be launched at damaging speeds and retracted with quick velocity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, it was pretty much one-to-one with everything you knew about Brigitte as a playable character. Yet, one recurring thought came to you time and again as you blankly stared at the gorging Brigitte:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...Why was she so fat?\"</i> You kept thinking, still attempting to wrap your confused mind as to how and why this happened. However, that train of thought came to an abrupt halt when the rotund brunette momentarily looked up at you, swallowing a whole waffle in the process then asked, \"...Do I got something on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Um...no. I'm just...thinking about stuff, that's all.\" You quickly retorted, attempting to conjure a convincing retort to your current demeanor, to which Brigitte soon gave you an understanding smirk, placing a chubby hand upon her wide adipose-coated hips and replied, \"\u00c5h, jag ser vad som h\u00e4nder (Oh, I see what's going on)! ...You're worried about mig (me) when Winston gave the recall order, aren't you, s\u00f6tnos (sweetie)?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Recall order? Wait... Is she...talking about what happened in Honor and Glory?\"</i> You thought, your mind quickly putting the puzzle pieces together as to <i>'When'</i> in the Overwatch series you currently found yourself in, since you remember before waking up in this world, you were watching the BlizzCon 2019 convention on YouTube when Blizzard Entertainment publicly revealed Overwatch 2, as your thoughts continued, <i>\"And...if this is just after Winston gave out that recall order to everyone from Overwatch, then that means...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before your thoughts came to the inevitable conclusion as to the situation you were now in, you soon felt a large metal hand grasp your shoulder, which promptly made you look behind you to see Reinhardt, now with his Crusader helmet off, thus revealing his entire head and face. What surprised you was it's appearance, as his chalk white hair was now currently tied up in a short ponytail, along with a full-on Santa Claus-esque beard and mustache. And yet, Reinhardt remained as full of energy as ever, where he casually jested, \"Come now, friend! Eat up! You'll need your strength for today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring there was no use arguing with the massive man in Crusader Armor, you started digging into your stack of Belgian waffles with a fork and knife, whilst your thoughts finally pieced together where in the Overwatch timeline you found yourself in, as you contemplated, <i>\"...Brigitte has already completed her Crusader Armor. Reinhardt's hair and beard have grown, yet he's still using the Crusader Armor he wore when he first debuted in Overwatch. If I had to wager a guess, that means...the events of Zero Hour haven't happened yet!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what you knowingly remember of the Zero Hour cinematic trailer, Null Sector, a terrorist extremist group hellbent on achieving Omnic rights through violent means, attacked the city of Paris in force. The reunited Overwatch members Winston, Tracer, and Mei were the first to arrive, followed by Genji, Reinhardt and Brigitte, Echo, and Mercy. Together, they were even able to take down a Null Sector Titan, a massive building-sized bipedal Omnic decked out with an arsenal of ballistic and energy weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, it was a rather climactic battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, one question soon emerged within your thoughts:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...How do you fit in all of this?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before you could even theorize an answer, the portable TV soon came alive, as it showed the city of Paris under siege by numerous Null Sector Nullifiers and several Titans, as a French female news reporter documented the harrowing event, saying only the following:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Nous sommes ici dans les rues du centre-ville de Paris (We're here live on the streets of downtown Paris)!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Comme vous pouvez le voir clairement derri\u00e8re moi, la ville est assi\u00e9g\u00e9e par use arm\u00e9e d'Omnics (As you can clearly see behind me, the city is under siege by an army of Omnics)!\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ils attaquent sans arr\u00eat, alors que les civils fuient les rues et leurs maisons (They're attacking nonstop, as civilians are fleeing the streets and their homes)!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, before the news reporter could continue, a Titan Omnicfired upon her and the cameraman with an energy weapon from it's chest,  as the screen went to black as a result. From there, you soon looked back at both Reinhardt and Brigitte, who now bore a pair of serious expressions, to which the obese brunette swiftly gulped down what she was currently devouring, the n quickly waddled/run over towards her Crusader Armor whilst she exclaimed, \"Reinhardt: Get inside the RV! We're heading to Paris!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Du hast es (You got it)!\" Reinhardt replied, putting his Crusader helmet back on as he rushed inside the RV. Moments later, Brigitte re-emerged, now fully clad in her Crusader Armor, which made her appear almost 250 pounds heavier due to the bulk of the armor. From there, she holstered her Rocket Flail upon her right hip whilst she fastened the Barrier Shield device on her left gauntlet, as she calmly sashayed towards the RV driver's cab, spoke toward you and continued...</span></div></div>",

Your mind reeling a little in confusion as you mentally questioned, <i>\"...What the hell is she talking about?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"She's talking about Us, you moron.\"</b> A voice growled inside your head, which caught you completely off-guard, as you quickly turned your head left to right in a frantic state, yet Brigitte behaved as if this was a normal occurrence, as she then asked, \"Do you think you can do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* I...I-I'll try. Just go! I'll catch up with you.\" You instinctively retorted, to which the rotund Brigitte complied with a single nod.

Just a figment of my confusion?\" You scoffed, where you then unexpectedly felt your body being violently flung back with tremendous force, landing on your back in the process! But then, you suddenly felt this painful pounding sensation in your head, causing you to instinctively grasp your scalp in pain, gasping a breath whilst you groaned, \"Wh-What the flying hell is going on here!?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, you soon felt yourself being flung again,this time towards a natural nearby pond, as you gazed at your reflection, but...it was not truly YOUR reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring back at you, there stood what looked to be some sort of monstrous humanoid creature, bearing a deathly gray pigment to his skin, with extremely shortened hair on the scalp, as well as missing the signs of a human nose, with facial features akin to a brute archetype. What stood out the most were the creature's hulking muscular physique, the black chitin-like skin on the arms and hands, and the blood red eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/nEbzL7f1a7Nxd8H37\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.app.goo.gl/nEbzL7f1a7Nxd8...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, it felt like you were looking at a literal monster, still in shock upon realizing that this could be your reflection, as you hesitantly spoke, \"Wh-What...Wh-What's happened t-to me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly, you felt as if your hand was possessed, as it forced you to look closer at your monstrous reflection as it sneered and grunted, <b>\"Look into my eyes, (Name). The way I see it, We can do whatever We want!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing what your dark reflection wanted due to an eerily familiar situation a had certain green-skinned Marvel character had, you tried shrugging off the mental temptations as you screamed, \"No. No! I WON'T LET YOU OUT!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"...Do you want her to die?\"</b> It inquisitively questioned, cocking a caveman-esque brow as it mentally forced you to look at it. At first, you continued to resist. However, you couldn't help but wonder who this abominable...<i>thing</i> was referring to, as you slowly looked at it and asked, \"...What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"The girl, dumbass! Do you want her to die?\"</b> It asked, this time with a more firm tone to it's grungy voice, asking you a mere question. Initially, you weren't sure about the topic. However, these dark gloomy thoughts of Brigitte being killed in horrific fashion by Null Sector apoeared in your mind's eye, her screams of pain and agony echoing through the recesses of your conscious being. Ultimately, you inevitably knew who the creature was referencing, as you bowed your head in an almost defeated state and lowly muttered, \"...No. I...I want her to live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"...I can help her. We...can help her. All you have to do...is let. Me. Out.\"</b> It explained, which sent a cold death-like shiver across your body, as if allowing something horrendous to outright possess you. At first, you wanted to persevere and continue resisting such temptations. Yet, in the end though, somehow...deep down, the creature was right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, another emotion began to boil within you: Not fear...but rage. Vengeful, unbiased rage. Your brow curled and furrowed into an enraged scowl. You weren't going to let those damned Omnics lay a single claw on Brigitte. Not today. Not tomorrow! NOT EVER!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as your mind was clouded by these violently enraged thoughts, your body underwent a startling metamorphosis! At first, your eyes changed into the creature's. Then, you began to grow and lengthen in size and body mass. From there, as your pants began to rip and tear from the transformation into a set of ripped makeshift shorts, your arms and hands began to become coated into the glistening chitin-esque skin, which stopped when it reached your shoulders!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when it was all said and done, your transformation was complete, as you then stood upright with a thunderous stomp, where you then unleashed a howling roar and screamed, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>\"GRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGHHH!!!!!!\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, you soon headed toward Paris as well, performing a powerful locomotive jump, and then another, and another, along with doing a vicious seventy-five mile an hour sprint!

And as they made it to where Winston, Tracer, and Mei were located, Brigitte made the vehicle perform a 180, thus allowing Reinhardt to lead the assault as he lunged through the RV roof, Rocket Hammer in hand, and let out a warcry as he yelled, \"Hammer...BOOM!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a tremendous force, he slammed the hammer down against a bunched-up group of Nullifiers, while Brigitte quickly dismounted from the vehicle, Rocket Flail in hand, as she decimated several Nullifiers with a good chain swing. Once they were down, she blew a hair out of her face, pulling off a stoic heroic pose alongside her godfather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!! The calvary's here!\" Tracer cheered, emboldened by the reinforcements, where she then Blinked into the fight, as Winston suddenly looked upwards to see a familiar robotic individual soaring through the air whilst blasting away several Nullifiers coming from an intersection. The machine looked at Winston, a cheerful smile adorned it's blue face as it cheered, \"Hello Winston!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Echo!\" Winston shouted, becoming pleasantly surprised to see an old friend. And last but not least, like an angelic figure from the heavens, Mercy descended down towards the injured Mei, putting an arm on her wounded shoulder and reassured, \"Let's get you back in the fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei stared in amazement to see the great Dr. Angela Ziegler in the flesh. However, such a hopeful turn of events suddenly took a dangerous turn, as one of the Null Sector Titans walked toward them, letting out an inhumanly mechanical roar, as it was charging up the energy weapon in it's chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, both Brigitte and Reinhardt locked themselves in a defensive position whilst the corpulent brunette exclaimed, \"Interlock shields!\" But as they felt the energy beam make impact with their combined Barrier Shield, all of the present Overwatch soon heard a monstrously beastly roar as it howled:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\"HYDE SMASH!!!!!\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, they quickly looked up towards the source of the roar, only to see you in your current form, lunging towards the Titan from the air, black hands curled into a set of fists, ready to smash the titanic machine to kingdom come! To most of them, they were flabbergasted, but Reinhardt and Brigitte smiled upon seeing you come to the rescue in the nick of time! The Titan was momentarily stunned from such a powerful attack by it's smaller challenger, with it's primary directive changed to the immediate threat at hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that...thing?!\" Winston yelled, about as surprised as everyone minus the two individuals in Crusader Armor. Of course, Brigitte looked back at them, a reassured smile upon her fuller face and simply retorted, \"...My Boyfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Tracer and Winston looked at one another in confusion and simultaneously said, \"...Boyfriend?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\"HYDE HATE TITAN!!!

In retaliation, it fired several missiles at you, to which you quickly sprinted at 75 miles an hour to avoid them, quickly catch one of the missiles mid-jump, as you then launched yourself at the Omnic with relentless fury, slamming the missile right into the Titan's head, damaging it's optic sensors in the process!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, a second Titan appeared whilst you were fighting the other one, to which Brigitte and Reinhardt did the same move as before, as the Titan opened fire on the group! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we going to stop it?\" Mercy asked, to which Winston looked back towards Mei, realizing what could work against the Titan: Mei's Cryo-pack. In response, he quickly retorted, \"Mei, your backpack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei looked back at Winston, gasping upon realizing his plan and swiftly replied, \"That could work!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Mei quickly took off her Cryo-pack, putting it on the ground to tinker with it so it could be used as a bomb, but she needed a detonator for the payload as she stated, \"Tracer: Pulse Bomb!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go!\" Tracer replied, quickly handing her one of the Brit's Pulse Bombs, whilst you kept pounding at the Titan, but then momentarily looked at Brigitte and Reinhardt to see them struggling against the other Titan! Instinctively, you let out another haymaker, then proceeded to tear off the Titan's massive energy cannon on it's right arm, then tossed it at the other Omnic with such destructive force and inertia whilst you roared,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\"LEAVE THEM ALONE!!!! HYDE SMASH YOU!!!!!\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force from the thrown debris sent the Titan reeling some, as it attempted to reinsert it's mechanized bearings! \"Woohoo!! Come on, (Name)! Hit it with everything you got!\" Brigitte yelled, cheering you on as you fought, her belly momentarily jiggling from such abrupt movement!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Winston looked at Tracer and exclaimed, \"Go long!\" \"Right!\" She chirped, Blinking forward as Winston threw the makeshift bomb at Tracer like a football, to which Tracer grabbed it midair, heading towards the first Titan. However, as the Titan attempted to grab Tracer in it's hand, Genji leapt in from the side, cutting through the Titan's limb in one clean swing as he yelled, \"Ry\u016bjin no kae wo kurae!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracer passed through the opening left by Genji, as she landed into the hole left by Genji from earlier! From there, she gently placed the bomb down inside the Titan, then quickly used her Recall ability to get out of the machine's insides, just in time for the bomb to go off without a hitch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blast of cryogenic energy ruptured throughout the Titan, as it was soon rendered completely frozen solid! Frozen in place, it soon began to crumble into millions of frozen shards, causing a flurry of tiny ice shards to disperse all over as the machine was destroyed on a molecular level! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as the dust settled, you finally demolished the other Titan with destructive ease, where you stood upon it's lifeless form, then triumphantly roared, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\"HYDE STRONGEST THERE IS!!!!! GRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGHH!!!!!!!!\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, it was a tremendous victory for the group. And as you jumped off the dead Omnic you can see Brigitte and Reinhardt interacting with their reunited friends, with Brigitte having her fuller facial cheeks grasped by Tracer, as the cheery Brit quipped about how much Brigitte had grown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as Tracer introduced Mei to everyone, Reinhardt of course had to make an ice-related pun like \"Ice to meet you!\", much to Brigitte's mere embarrassment. And as you soon approached Brigitte and the others...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>World of Warcraft. Out of the many massive multiplayer online role-playing games (or MMORPG for short) that you have played for the past decade, World of Warcraft was always the one franchise you've kept coming back to for years. From it's encapsulating yet complex stories to the overabundance of lore within the world of Azeroth, World of Warcraft was certainly a worthwhile series, despite the monthly subscription.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finished up another play session as a female Worgen Paladin at level 105, stretching your arms outward out of yawning exhaustion, especially since the sun had already set some time ago. Shortly after logging off from your WoW account, you shut down your computer and sluggishly made your way back to your bed, collapsing upon the mattress almost immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, little did you realize at that point, that things were about to change in some unexpected ways...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>======<br>\r\n-- 8 Hours Later... --<br>\r\n======</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groggily stir from your slumber, as if you were experiencing a hangover minus the alcohol. And yet... Something felt off. First off, you remember passing out on your front side, as you now noticed that your lower half was covered by several sets of luscious silken cobalt blue bedsheets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What the hell?\" You whispered, still a tad confused as to what had happened. You placed a hand against your forehead, calmly rubbing it in confusion. And yet, despite just waking from slumber, you soon noticed that your bedroom appeared...different, as if it had undergone exuberant amounts of renovation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Uther. Dear...Uther. I...I'm so...sorry...\"</i> A voice rang out in a muttering hushed tone, which certainly surprised you a substantial amount, almost making you jump out of bed in surprise. However, you soon regained your composure, as you then realize that you weren't the only individual inside the now estranged bedroom, as you can clearly see something large looming underneath the silken bedsheets, outlined by the moonlit sky gleaming through what appeared to be stained glass windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;The song \"Tristram\" from Diablo 2 kicks in&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour curiosity began to take hold, recognizing the voice to be pronouncely female in sound. Carefully, you slowly reached out toward the massive lump beside you, desiring to know who it was you were sleeping with, only for this unknown individual to unknowingly reveal herself before you instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, she was certainly beautiful, despite appearing to be weighing a little over 500 to 600 pounds in size. \"...Who is she?\" You thought to yourself, as your eyes slowly ascended her rotund form, ending at the mysterious woman's head. Judging from her appearance alone, she was without a doubt one hundred percent Human, as she beared a rounded out but heart-shaped face, complete with plump facial cheeks, luscious full lips, and the subtle hints of a double chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you thought it was just an ordinary woman...but then you took notice of her lengthy hair. It was a rather peculiar set of hair. Most of it was colored a stark marble white, save for a noticeable streak of golden blonde running the middle left side of her frontal lobe, as the streak of blonde hair extended from her lengthy bangs to the tail's end of her voluminous mane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you didn't initially recognize who lumbered beside you. That is, until you looked ahead of the strange woman and noticed a distinguished object: An ornate yet intricate staff, which held what appeared to be a bright cobalt blue crystal as thick as a human head and as long as a man's vertebrae, as it bore a finely sharpened point at the tip of the staff. The crystal itself was firmly held within this ornately designed clasp, like a set of golden fingertips clasping a bauble. From there, the clasp was attached to a long but ornately carved staff pole, as a small figurehead was attached to the other end of the staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, from gazing upon the staff did your mind soon come to the realization of who you were sleeping with, as you thought, \"...That staff...It..I-It's the Staff of Antonidas! And...If that's the Staff of Antonidas, th-then that means...\" Upon easily recognizing the staff and it's importance, your eyes soon looked back towards the slumbering woman before you, your thoughts soon connecting the pieces simultaneously, your brow raised in shock as you whispered, \"...I-I was sleeping with Jaina Proudmoore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, you were completely shocked to now realize that the slumbering woman before you was none other than the famed and fan-favorite Jaina Proudmoore, the notorious Daughter of the Sea, a powerful Archmage, the Lord Admiral of Kul Tiras, and many other titles. Out of the numerous important characters within the Alliance faction, Jaina Proudmoore was always considered your most favorite character of the bunch. Sure, you like Varian Wrynn and his son, Anduin, and some of the other Alliance leaders, but it was Jaina Proudmoore that always caught your attention, despite the awful occurrences she has experienced in her life, whether it was witnessing her beloved Prince Arthas turn to the dark side and becoming the dreaded Lich King, or even the heinous bombing of Theramore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, Jaina Proudmoore was the very reason you always chose the Alliance over the Horde every time you boot up World of Warcraft, which made you realize you have a major crush on her. And judging from the contrasting colors of her hair, this meant you were undoubtedly in bed with a post-Theramore bombing Jaina Proudmoore, as the bombing of Theramore was what caused her hair to change so drastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, as you felt your inner Jaina fan beginning to scream internally like a schoolgirl, reality soon pulled you back to the surface, as you soon returned to noticing Jaina's substantially larger physique jutting out from underneath the cobalt silken bedsheets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...weird. I don't remember Jaina Proudmoore being fat, let alone THIS fat.\" You thought to yourself, as you further examined the now rotund Archmage. Below her now chubby but still smooth head, face, and neck, you could clearly comprehend Jaina's newfound enormity. On her torso, her generous breasts had ballooned considerably, jumping from a D-Cup to a gargantuan Double H-Cup, as they were censored by the bedsheets, with only her bustline exposed. Her arms, once lithe, now bore a noticeable thickness and softness on them, complete with somewhat chubby hands and digits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking past her enlarged bosom, Jaina now sported a substantially noticeable paunch of a belly, as it slowly inflated and deflated with each unconscious breath from the sleeping Archmage, as said paunch was easily noticeable underneath the silk-laden covers. But as you gazed further down Jaina's form, you could obviously tell that her lower half was just as bulky, complete with round, bulbous buttcheeks, a pair of burgeoning hips and tubby waistline, and equally meaty thighs, calves, and mildly plump feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, the once slim and lithe Jaina Proudmoore had somehow ballooned up to a whopping 500 to possibly 600 pounds, as she subconsciously shifted her hefty self into a more comfortable sleeping position. Of course, you soon noticed that her hair seemed to be undone, and not in a intricate ponytail braid, as seen in the new Battle For Azeroth expansion that came out some time ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...She's gotta at least weigh over five hundred pounds if she looks like this.\" You whispered, hoping that you don't stir her from her slumber. After all, as much as you felt like this was a dream come true for you to be sleeping with the real Jaina Proudmoore, you couldn't help but feel like there was more going on here than you think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn contemplation, you had two choices laid out before you. One: You could sneak out of the bedroom and investigate some. Who knows? You might've somehow been magically transported to Azeroth for all you know. But then came the second option: If you are now indeed in the World of Warcraft universe, then something in the back of your mind was screaming at you to find a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end though...</span></div></div>",

You looked back at the slumbering Jaina twice or thrice to make sure she was still sound asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or two of tip-toeing your way across the room, you soon reached the wooden door, turning the bronze doorknob to open it, which revealed a large but ornate bathroom, certainly one fitting of Jaina Proudmoore's social status. Your eyes deliberately scanned the entirety of the bathroom, taking in each intricate detail of the hygienic dwellings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar off to the left, there was a downright massive shower stall off in one corner, as the shower walls displayed these custom-made stained glass shower panels, as the stained glass formed a mural in the form of a silver anchor overlooking a shimmering blue sea, adorned by a cobalt sapphire backdrop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanning your eyes to the left, you soon noticed a pair of fantasy-themed vanity stalls adjacent to each other, which had numerous brews and makeup tools upon the vanity tables. Looking further more still, it was there you soon noticed an ornate toilet of sorts. That us, if World of Warcraft had modern day plumbing in it's universe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, you then took notice of a large yet homely sink and mirror setup, jutting out from the wall on the right. \"*sigh* Thank goodness...\" You murmured, relieved to see an actual mirror to use. From there, despite the slowly dimming darkness due to these supposedly magical candles lighting the room a tad, you calmly approached the sink and mirror, slowly but surely making out your reflection in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after progressing your way toward the mirror, you soon wiped the sand from your eyes for clearer resolution to your vision and sight.

Hesitantly, you slowly stood back up onto your feet, as you again approached the mirror. In it's reflection, you saw a bulging paunch of a belly covered in silver gray fur, where a pair of equally bulbous breasts rested upon the curve of said gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking downward, you gazed upon your hands, which were now slightly longer, covered in light brown fur, and adorned with black lupine claw-like fingernails. \"These...Th-These are the hands of a Worgen. I-If these are MY hands, th-then that means...\" You mentally stuttered, your shock affecting your speech some, as you slowly bent down to look at your face in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr rather...to be more specific, your snout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you saw before you was not human nor male, but a rather corpulent female Worgen. In appearance, your head and snout were covered in a light brown coat of short fur, save for the silver gray stripe of fur connected to your lapine nose. Your brown Worgen ears poked out from your lengthy mane of dirty blonde waist length hair. However, besides such distinct facial features of a Worgen, your cheeks were certainly chubbier than the average female Worgen, along with a noticeable curve of a double chin, as well as a plumper neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazing downwards at your reflection, your massive mammaries, which were coated in a tuft of silver gray hair at the bottom half of such mammaries, were easily a J-Cup or a little bigger than that, since you remember Worgens being considerably larger than Humans, as you appeared to be standing at a sizeable 7 and a half to possibly 8 feet tall in height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of size, you definitely were downright obese compared to regular Worgens, as you now bore a considerable paunch of a belly, which was accompanied by a light muffintop and a pair of wide fertile hips, which seemed to be around 4 and a half feet in diameter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning yourself around a little, you soon took notice of your equally rotund buttcheeks, as the silver gray fur appeared to form the shape of a heart on your bulbous fur-covered behind, as your light brown Worgen tail sat atop such an indiscreet derriere. Looking down toward the floor, you soon realized that your digitgrade lupine legs weren't spared from such a weight gain, as you could easily feel your now fatter thighs touching a rubbing against one another. However, your calves bore some rather impressive musculature, which would explain why you weren't suddenly collapsing onto the floor this very moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, you soon came to grips with this revelation, as you were now an obese female Worgen. And yet, as you closely examined the new you in the mirror, you couldn't help but feel like something about your lupine appearance seemed so familiar, as you pulled up your upper lip with an index finger to inspect your sharp lupine teeth. \"...Why does this appearance looks so familiar?\" You mentally questioned yourself, examining yourself further a bit more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut soon, upon gandering at your eyes, where the left eye was a bright violet whilst the right eye was a shimmering yellow, your mind soon realized why your appearance seemed very familiar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, this was the appearance of YOUR female Worgen Paladin! Or at least, when she didn't weigh over a quarter ton. You  were an avid role player, since you spent what seemed like hours creating the backstory for your character. It was there you suddenly remembered your Worgen Paladin's name: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Rayja Silverclaw </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her backstory, you wrote up that she was from a long family lineage of Paladins, starting with her great-grandfather, to her grandfather, then her father, and now her. However, she became a Worgen when she attempted to help defend the people of Gilneas, only to be afflicted with lycanthropy after a fierce battle alongside Genn Greymane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou vividly remember role-playing as Rayja for countless hours on end. Hell, you even remember writing a long fan fiction romance story of Rayja falling in love with Jaina Proudmoore, your favorite character in World of Warcraft! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, despite your internal joy at what feels like a waking dream, you couldn't help but ask how did this all happen, as you subconsciously yet gently traced the open palm of your paw-like hand upon your billowing paunch of a belly.</span></div></div>",

From there, the door quickly swung open, as Jaina surprisingly rushed in, Staff of Antonidas in hand, as if she was ready for a fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rayja?! You alright? I heard you scream.\" She exclaimed, as if checking to see if there were any potential intruders. Once she saw that the only ones were you and her, she positioned the Staff of Antonidas like a walking staff, as you sheepishly retorted, \"Oh! Um...sorry about that, Jaina. I kinda scared myself a little.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing yourself for the first time, you noticed that, despite being in your Worgen form, you actually had a rather soothing feminine voice, which was unexpected, considering that when a Worgen talks, their voice has these growls accompanying their speech patterns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, upon hearing your response, Jaina exhaled a sigh of relief, placing a plump left hand upon her wide hips, where she then let out a brief but light chuckle and jested, \"*chuckle* Is that all? The <i>\"All-mighty and Heroic Worgen Paladin Rayja Silverclaw \"</i> scared of her own reflection?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you obviously couldn't help but blush profusely in response to such unwitting embarrassment, which made the fur around your facial cheeks turn a crimson hue. However, Jaina soon approached you in reassurance, as you can now clearly see the size difference between you and her, clearly making you the bigger woman in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, after leaning the magical staff against the nearby wall, Jaina placed both of her hands upon your own paw-like appendages, which seemed to be effective in comforting you, where she tilted her head to look up at you, but with a bit more regretful tone, and said, \"...Sorry about the jest, sweetie. I know it's been hard for us ever since what happened at Kul Tiras.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Sweetie?\" You thought, confused from hearing such a word coming from the rotund Archmage. \"She wouldn't call me that, unless...\" You continued, only for your thoughts to be interrupted by Jaina, who looked a little suspicious as she raised and eyebrow and queried, \"...Uh, Rayja? Are you feeling alright? You seem a little...off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, me? *chuckle* My apologies, Jaina. I'm just...deeply concerned for you.\" You quickly replied, where you then placed a chubby paw-like hand upon Jaina's waist, clearly seeing that the corpulent Archmage is wearing nothing but a pair of sky blue laced bra and panties, as you attempted to concoct a persuasive excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...In fact, I heard you mumbling in your sleep when I stir from slumber. You were mentioning someone named...Uther?\" You calmly retorted, as you noticed how Jaina now bore this look of regret and heartache upon her somewhat rounder face, which made you instinctively concerned for Jaina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Jaina soon exhaled a deep sigh in response to your previous statement, as you subconsciously pulled Jaina close to you in a loving embrace, which caused your bellies to touch and squish against one another, despite the height difference between you two. Then, you tenderly spoke to Jaina with a loving and concerned tone as you asked, \"...Do you...want to talk about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, you felt Jaina give a firm but tender nod, which you felt as her head rubbed against your right breast. Shortly after letting out another deep sigh, Jaina soon began to speak, but with a somber tone, as she then explained, \"...His name...was Uther Lightbringer. He is...WAS...a dear friend to me. He *sob*...was murdered...by the one I once loved, Arthas. Menethil.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...The Prince of Lordaeron. *sigh* I understand how you feel, my love. I was there amidst both Alliance and Horde during the Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate, and I too lost friends against the Scourge and the Lich King.\" You replied, still holding Jaina in a loving embrace, bearing a compassionate and understanding demeanor, as the powerful Archmage soon began to show a brief semblance of frailty, where she began to shed a few tears of sorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, nothing tragic that Rayja Silverclaw had experienced could never hold a candle to the insurmountable tragedies that Jaina Proudmoore had endured. But as Jaina's tears began to stain and wet your fur, you soon speak once more in a calm and loving demeanor as you continued, \"...I know nothing I've endured would never hold a candlelight to the insurmountable sorrows you've experienced, Jaina. But, should you ever need a shoulder to weep on, I shall be that shoulder, my lovely Daughter of the Sea.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing your kind words, Jaina soon regained her composure, wiping away the tears from her eyes as she did so. From there, she looked back up at you, a small reassured grin adorned upon her rounded face, as she then retorted, \"*sniffle* Thank you, Rayja. It...It means a great deal to hear such kind words from you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime, my love. Now...\" You quipped, where you suddenly hoisted Jaina up into your thick arms, which illicit a surprised \"Oooh!\" from Jaina, her eyes widened from such a sudden act, as you then continued, \"...What do you say we return to our quarters and have a little <i>fun</i>?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* I think...that would be wonderful.\" Jaina answered, bearing a cheeky yet flirtatious grin upon her face, as you calmly carried her out of the spacious bathroom and back into the lavish bedroom, ready and will for some fun in bed.</span></div></div>",

And suffice to say, the past night certainly felt like a mere fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you slept alongside Jaina after some passionate love-making, sleep overcame you both. But whilst the rotund Archmage slept like a babe, your \"dreams\" took on a more vivid experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>In your subconscious,  to began to dream of a mighty battle, between you and your fellow Alliance members along with some notable members of the Horde, and the wretched undead servants of the Lich King. You led the charge, two-handed gilded Warhammer grasped within your claws. You wound up your stance, preparing to swing a mighty blow against the deathly hordes.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Of course, they fell so easily against the combined might of your trained prowess as a warrior, as well as the holy powers granted to you as a Paladin, despite your bestial appearance. Though fortunately, your Worgen physiology certainly contributed to your overall might, as you bashed a wide swath through the ghoulish creatures.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The target of such a battle? It was none other than the Lich Necromancer and devoted follower of the Lich King, Kel'Thuzad. According to Commander Eligor Dawnbringer, Kel'Thuzad was the most loyal of the Lich King's subjects, and if he was struck down for good, it would deal a crushing blow to the Lich King's undead forces, as they would have one less powerful commander in their abominable ranks.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Of course, after smiting a good number of the undead forces, you confronted the Lich Necromancer himself, who raised his skeletal arms outwards, as if to tempt you to strike him down. However, the heroic Rayja Silverclaw was no fool, as you charged up your powers of the Light, and unleashed a torrent of mystical holy energies at the supposedly immortal Lich, temporarily knocking him off-balance. Quickly, you readied yourself to strike the unholy abomination, as you charged at Kel'Thuzad, lunged at him, swinging your mighty Warhammer upon his skeletal form. But as the head of the hammer was about to make contact with the Lich's skull...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>--- *GASP!!* ---</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly jolted up from the luxurious bed in a mild sheen of sweat, rapidly inhaling and exhaling to calm yourself. However, you soon took notice of the sunlight brightening the room, indicating that it was already morning. \"Morning already, huh?\" You thought, only to take notice of your current environs, then of your own person. \"*sigh* ...So, I wasn't really dreaming all of this, after all. But still...\" You thought to yourself, now coming to terms that what you experienced that night wasn't a dream, as you placed a plump paw-like hand upon the outermost curve of your paunch of a belly and continued, \"...How did this happen, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, before you could contemplate on this impossible conundrum, your stomach had other ideas, as it began to audibly growl in impatience, demanding for sustenance to be sated. Shortly after shooting an annoyed glare at your hunger pangs, you gazed to your left and quickly became aware of Jaina's absence, as her side of the bed was rather vacant in appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. She must already be up and about by now.\" You mentally noted, as you then decided to arise from the bed as well, since now seemed a good time as any for a substantial breakfast. However, you soon noticed a nearby full-body mirror before you, which was adorned on the wall with ornate trimmings. Of course, from gazing at your reflection, you soon noticed something you ignored before: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were completely naked, save for the thin coat of fur throughout your lupine form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, you instantly blushed from such an embarrassing revelation, as you tried to look at the positives here and thought, \"*sigh* Well...at least I probably won't have to worry about getting bigger undergarments in the future.\" Your mind had so many questions as to what has happened to you, and how you were magically transported into the World of Warcraft universe as your female Worgen Paladin character. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, such a search for answers would have to wait, as you Doon heard the recognizable voice of Jaina Proudmoore, who seemed to be outside of the lavishly ornate private quarters, as she spoke up and audibly asked, \"Rayja? Is that you I'm hearing lumbering about in our quarters?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah it's me, Jaina! I just got up. Why? Is everything alright?\" You exclaimed, replying back towards the rotund Archmage, wondering if everything was fine on her end. But before you decided to exit the bedroom, you soon heard Jaina once more as she swiftly retorted, \"No, no! Everything is quite peaceful over here. No need to be grabbing for your Warhammer, my love.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Warhammer?\" You thought, as you soon turned your head to the right to take notice of what you assumed to be your Paladin Warhammer. In appearance, it looked exactly like the warhammer that your character wields in World of Warcraft. In fact, you fondly remember which materials were used in it's creation:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lengthy wooden hilt carved from rich Mahogany, wrapped in intertwining leather and decorated with silken blue cloth with stark gold rune etchings on the cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pommel adorned at the lower end of the hilt, which was made from a fusion of gold and bronze, shaped into the form of an intricately detailed head of a Dire Wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to top it off, the warhammer's head was forged from a large chunk of extremely rare adamantine, as the head of the warhammer was forged in the same size as a man's torso, spine and pelvis included. It was held in place on the upper end of the hilt by gilded gold bindings, with Paladin runes carved into the sides of the hammerhead. The runes translated said: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Where There's Misery And Despair, There Is Hope,\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Where There Is Darkness, There Shall Be Light,\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"From Kalimdor To Northrend, A Paladin's Calling Is Never A Burden, But A Sacred Duty,\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"For Who Shall Stand Against Evil, But A Paladin?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reading this as the warhammer leaned against the nearby wall, you knew these etchings were undoubtedly a type of adage that Paladins use, where you soon remember the name you've given for the warhammer:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sin-Burner</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange and alien to you, but...it was as if you could sense the warhammer's holistic essence and power radiating from the weapon, as if it bore a welcoming embrace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as you gently reached out for the warhammer's hilt, Jaina's voice rang in your Worgen ears once more, as she spoke once more and exclaimed, \"Rayja!? Are you coming to eat breakfast?\" Of course, Jaina's voice snapped you out of such a distraction, as you violently shook your head thrice and quickly yet unconsciously answered, \"I'm coming, I'm coming, Jaina! Just getting myself freshened up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh! Well, you better hurry, honey! Your breakfast is gonna get cold~\" Jaina replied, as if she sound like she once did before the bombing of Theramore, which seemed a little surprising considering. But who knows? Maybe the events that happened in your fanfic story might be canon in this version of Warcraft you've awaken in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, shortly after looking back at the warhammer for a brief moment, you soon head into the adjacent bathroom to freshen yourself for the day. First, you immersed yourself in the stained glass shower, rinsing your fur as said fur mildly absorbed the water like a sponge, whilst you washed and rinsed your voluminous mane of dirty blonde hair with a bottle of what you assumed to be homebrew shampoo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you finished with washing yourself, your lupine sense of smell easily caught the mucky scent of wet fur. \"Bleh! Now I know how it feels to smell like a wet dog. Eck!\" You muttered to yourself, where you soon began to dry yourself off with a downright massive towel, though you had a hunch that drying yourself is going to be more difficult as a Worgen with all this fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite such difficulties, you were able to dry yourself off, as you then instinctively put your waist length hair into a beautiful half-braided ponytail. From there, now that you were properly groomed, you soon exited from the bathroom, as you then approached a massive cabinet, which held numerous articles of clothing, such as intricately woven dresses and gowns, along with formal clothes meant to be worn under a set of armor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing through your choices available, you eventually decided to pick...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You tediously looked left to right at the various articles of clothing hung within the cabinet, still deciding on what to wear for the day. However, after a brief minute or two, you soon took notice of an intriguing piece of clothing, which came in the form of a beautifully woven purple gown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, it was a downright massive dress, easily big enough for you to decently wear without feeling like it'll rip in multiple places with just mere step. It shimmered in the small gleams of sunlight, where it bore these intricate golden trimmings and cleanly woven patterns adorned upon the fabric. But in the back, there was a large opening in the back area, which seemed to accommodate for a lack of a hole for your tail, as the open back area was held together with intertwining strings to hold the dress in place, akin to a corset. And to top it off, it bore these loose but flowing sleeves in place of straps around the shoulder area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon examining it in your paw-like hands, you couldn't help but display a cheeky fanged grin upon your mildly chubby lupine snout whilst you thought, \"*giggle* Oh Jaina will certainly lose it if she saw me wearing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rayja! You still in there?\" Jaina exclaimed, obviously wondering if you're still coming or not, as you quickly responded, \"Just a minute~! I'm almost done getting dressed!\" And with that, you soon decided to go with wearing the purple gown in your hands, as you soon tossed the towel aside, preparing to don the beautifully woven dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, you inserted your legs through the opening in the dress, where you carefully pulled the gown upwards, to avoid making any accidental rips and tears in the fabric. From there, as you calmly put each arm through the dress arm sleeves, you put your Worgen tail through the bottommost opening in the string patterns in the back area of the gown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, you casually approached the full-body mirror to examine yourself, clearly seeing how the dress, despite it's beautiful weaves and patterns, easily flaunt about your fatty bulges with little effort, much to your hesitation, as you exhaled a mildly irritated breath from your lupine nostrils and thought, \"...Well, it's certainly better than lumbering around as naked as a wolf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously not wanting to keep the bulbous Archmage waiting any longer, you decided to head out of the personal quarters, as you clearly felt how your thick bulky thighs casually rubbed against one another in your stride, thus creating a minute waddle in your step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I know how women feel when it comes to being conscious about their weight.\" You mentally thought, as you strided down the wide hallway, noting how easily you were adapting to your complete change of species and gender. However, your acute wolven sense of smell suddenly kicked in, as you began to detect these delectable mixture of edible aromas. It seemed so familiar, yet completely new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing your lupine nose, you calmly strutted your way towards the source of the numerous scents, feeling how your hefty Worgen buttocks lightly bounced and rippled with each striding step you made on your digitgrade lupine legs. A few moments later, you soon entered a vastly spacious open interior, which had a complete fantasy theme and design to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRugs and carpets from all across Azeroth strewn about the interior, as well as some mystical and mechanically technological equipment spread into a few parts of the interior. Refocusing on the various scents, you soon looked upon what could only be described as a vast yet ornate kitchen area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you, there was a large wooden dining table, easily big enough to seat a family of 20 people, complete with wide chairs made of iron and adorned with lush cushioned seating. Upon the table laid a eye-catching yet veritable feast, with various delicacies and edibles strewn about upon the finely carved and furnished furniture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, ahead of the table full if foodstuffs, There stood the rotund Archmage, Jaina Proudmoore, who was now fully dressed in her signature garments from the Battle For Azeroth expansion, complete with that trademark braided hairstyle she adorned herself with, as it seemed she was brewing something with several potions in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/rZp1y5aqm9bHZMHM9\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.app.goo.gl/rZp1y5aqm9bHZM...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was there you soon heard the fattened yet still beautiful Archmage calmly singing a haunting yet enchanting tune as she hummed,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Beware, beware the Daughter of the Sea. \"<br>\r\n\"Beware, I heard him cry.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"His words carried upon the ocean breeze,\"<br>\r\n\"As he sank beneath the tide.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Those blood-soaked shores of Kalimdor,\"<br>\r\n\"Where sailors fought and died.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The Admiral fell at Theramore,\"<br>\r\n\"Because she left his side.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing the lyrics the plus-sized Archmage was singing, you instantly recognize what song Jaina was singing her soul out for; It was without a sliver of doubt the iconic <i>\"Daughter of the Seas\"</i> After all, you ARE a big fan of Jaina Proudmoore, so this haunting melody was easily recognizable. And besides, the lyrics itself told the entire story of Jaina Proudmoore, as it detailed about her role in the demise of her own father, Lord Admiral Daelin Proudmoore, who was killed on Theramore Isle, along with the ensuing aftermath following the events of Warcraft 3: The Frozen Throne, the sequel expansion to the main Warcraft 3 game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, it was a rather tragic melody, especially for Jaina Proudmoore, as you could easily hear the depressed undertones hidden beneath her singing whilst she continued, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why this? Why this, oh Daughter of the Sea?\"<br>\r\n\"Why this? Did you forget your seaside days?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Always the pride of our nation's eyes,\"<br>\r\n\"How could she go astray~?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow seeing that Jaina still bore a bit of heavy baggage, you instinctively approached Jaina from behind, where you then wrapped your thick furry arms around her from behind, unwittingly pressing your clothed paunch against her dressed behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, upon feeling you physically, Jaina soon to cease singing the haunting melody, tilting her head to gently rub it against your bulky left arm, feeling the soft light brown fur on your forelimb, which seemed to calm her down substantially, now bearing a noticeable upward curve of her lips, her enchanting eyes closed in reminiscence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Feeling alright, my love?\" You quipped, speaking with a loving tone in your soothing feminine voice, as Jaina soon traced an open palm along the outer side of your thick left arm, feeling how soft and tender your fur was through her fingertips, then proceeded to respond with a confirmative nod and replied, \"...I will live, Rayja. Just as long as you're here by my side~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you've been in this reality for not even a day, you can certainly feel this deeply romantic connection between you and Jaina, as she turned herself around and the two of you proceeded to give each other a brief but passionate kiss on the lips. Or, lip to snout, as it were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Jaina soon noticed the dress you now wore, displaying a mildly smug smirk, placing her hands upon her wide burgeoning hips and chirped, \"Well... I see that a certain Worgen Paladin I know has decided to dress herself like a lady for today. *giggle* It certainly suits you, sweetie.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, well you're lady-like guile was bound to rub off onto me sooner or later, Jaina.\" You retorted, easily bearing a somewhat light blush upon your plump furry cheeks, as you briefly rubbed the back of your lupine head out of brief embarrassment. From there, as she calmly yet lovingly held your paw-like hands, Jaina...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Like a domesticated hound on a leash, Jaina lovingly yet gently guided you along back toward the table, which was still decorated with numerous delectable cuisines. She had you calmly sit down upon the wide iron chair you had encountered before, while she then sat beside you in an adjacent seat, still displaying a doting curve upon her rosy lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, you couldn't help but feel like things were a little...out of place in a way, as Jaina soon grabbed at the meaty leg of a roasted bird, and cleanly tore the leg off from the cooked avian. From there, Jaina uncharacteristically presented the bird leg in front of you and cheekily quipped, \"Come on, Jaina. It's your favorite~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if you were being tempted by gluttony, you unconsciously sniffed at the finely roasted bird leg, your mouth quickly salivating at it's succulent aroma. But then, as if by unrelenting hunger, you carefully took the bird leg from Jaina's grasp, and then, in a contrasting manner, viciously devoured the succulent meat from the bird leg like some wild beast, growling a little as you chewed on the delicious cooked flesh, which seemed ironic, considering you were now essentially the World of Warcraft equivalent of a werewolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomentarily, you looked back at Jaina, who was stifling her laughter from your currently beastly behavior. And of course, you blushed profusely from such an act coming from you. After all, a Paladin shouldn't fully give in to such carnal temptation, as you turned your lupine head in some minor shame and lowly muttered, \"...Sorry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* It's alright, my love. No need to be so high-strung.\" Jaina retorted, casually yet lightly patting the outermost curve of your paunch of a belly, which easily jutted out underneath the fabric of your purple dress. And yet, at the same time, it felt rather soothing, like a dog having her belly rubbed by her loving master, as you began to blush more, yet your now wagging tail told a different tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely, it felt like some weird yet romantic form of foreplay, with you in the role of a pet, with Jaina being your \"mistress\", as your hunger soon took hold and you began to rip and tear at the aforementioned roasted bird, tearing cooked flesh and sinew from bone, your lupine tongue savoring the succulent taste from each piece of cooked meat that entered your maw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, whilst you were preoccupied with devouring pieces of a roasted avian, Jaina began to eat breakfast as well, neatly biting into a freshly ripe and plump piece of fruit, then cleanly cutting a slice of chocolate cake, a complete opposite to one another when it came to proper dining etiquette for the time being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n==================<br>\r\n<b>-- One Hour Later... ---</b><br>\r\n==================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was all said and done, the two of you had finished your morning feasting for today, as you and Jaina leisurely leaned back against your individual seats to allow your stomachs to more easily digest the food you've both consumed. Although she was as stuffed as you were, you certainly had the bigger stomach due to your Worgen physiology. The violet silken fabric covering your paunch of a midriff looked to be straining under the noticeable increase in belly bulge, almost threatening to split down the middle at the seams, which seemed to be fortunate enough to hold together for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*exhale*...I must admit; You've certainly outdone yourself, Jaina.\" You commented, letting your stomach digest all of the cooked meat now churning in your stomach acids. In response to your compliment, Jaina placed a mildly plump hand upon your paw-like hand, holding it in her grasp as she stated, \"I appreciate the compliment, my dear. After all, I know a few excellent Hunters who can seek out prey worthy of your taste buds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*chuckle* Well, they're certainly prestigious, that's for sure, hehe!\" You jest, feeling to be in a rather jovial mood right now just after eating a hearty meal. However, despite your praises, you soon noticed that something seemed to be bothering the stuffed Archmage, as she now bore this contemplative yet mildly mournful expression on her rounded face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, like a hound caring about it's master, you soon took heed of Jaina's fouled mood, lightly squeezing her hand with your own paw-like appendage, as you then spoke toward her, bearing a deeply concerned and sympathetic tone in your voice, and asked, \"...What seems to be troubling you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*deep sigh*...Mother wants me to visit her and Tandred at Lord Admiral's Rest, my family's royal crypt. I... I am unsure if I should go or not, Rayja.\" Jaina explained, which undoubtedly revealed a great deal as to the time period of the Warcraft universe you were currently in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut whilst you keenly and compassionately listened to Jaina's rambling, your thoughts began to connect the pieces as you mentally elaborated, \"Well... This certainly clears up a lot as to where and when I am at in World of Warcraft. Judging from what Jaina has said, she must have already reconciled with her mother, Katherine Proudmoore, as well as the people of Kul Tiras after what happened in Frozen Throne. Then...that must mean that Jaina's now Lord Admiral of Kul Tiras, and the major events surrounding Jaina during the Tides of Vengeance update hadn't happened yet, which means I must probably living with her in Boralus,  Kul Tiras' capital city, most likely in Proudmoore Keep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as much as you were both relieved and completely thrilled at this abundant revelation, your thoughts soon refocused themselves upon the rotund Lord Admiral, who gazed upon you with her radiant sapphire blue eyes, as if seeking you for wisdom. She spoke toward you with a pleadful look in her sapphire gaze, showing her frailty once more as she asked, \"...What should I do, Rayja?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing such a pleading question from the mighty Jaina Proudmoore, you could clearly see, as plain as the sunlit horizon, that you had to make an extremely important and intensely critical decision. On one side, you could tell Jaina to go visit her mother and Tandred at Lord Admiral's Rest, thus safely playing out the events that had occurred in Tides of Vengeance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut on the other hand... You could advise her not to visit her mother and Tandred, thus risking altering ramifications in certain events in Tides of Vengeance and possibly any unforetold events yet to come. In the end though, you knew you had to make a very difficult decision that could change things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after some brief contemplation, you exhaled a deep sigh, then said she should...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Weighing such high profile choices before you, a momentary but prolific thought crept it's at to the forefront of your subconscious: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaina, with all the experiences she's endured throughout the Warcraft universe...was a somewhat damaged individual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom watching her beloved Prince Arthas treading down a darkened path and eventually becoming the dreaded Lich King, to betraying her father Daelin for the betterment of peace between the Alliance and the Horde, gaining the ire and hate of her people in Kul Tiras, to the infamous bombing of Theramore and the countless lives lost in the magically-induced explosion. Overall, in your own words before your current disposition, <i>\"Jaina has gone through a lot of shit\".</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the once optimistic Jaina Proudmoore has indeed endured a lot of tragedy in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, in your deepest thoughts, due to your high amounts of favoritism towards Jaina, you felt obligated -- No, dutiful! -- to be by her side through thick and thin, no matter who or what stood in your way. From there, you then spoke toward Jaina and reassuringly answered, \"...In all honesty, my beloved Archmage... I think you should pay your mother a visit. After all, in my opinion, it is sometimes best to re-mend such withered bonds between your family and your people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And besides...\" You continued, where you then leaned forward and administered a tender peck on her lips and elaborated, \"...I think you've been feeling guilty for far too long, and a reconciliation is long overdue.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing your kind advising words, Jaina's eyes briefly turned to the right before returning to gaze upon you, where she soon queried, \"...Even if it meant falling in love with another woman?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Wait, what?\" Your internal thoughts exclaimed, as you soon realized that Rayja Silverclaw, YOU, were currently in a romantic relationship with the rotund Archmage, which was both shocking yet not. After swiftly refocusing your thoughts, you instinctively but slowly turned yourself to face Jaina, placing your other paw-like hand upon her mildly plump hand, showing her great reassurance as you subconsciously answered, \"...Even that, my Lady. Not a day has passed that I've regretted confessing my love towards you back at Orgrimmar. And if they don't approve, then damn them all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that bold confirmation, despite her still full stomach, Jaina swiftly wrapped her arms around your plump neck and somewhat rounder shoulders, as she then spoke with a tender voice and said, \"...Thank you, my love. This... This means a great deal to me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...It is my earthly pleasure, my Lady. I would rather see you smile once more.\" You replied, wrapping your thicker furry arms around Jaina in response to her loving embrace. In a way, it felt as if you felt more at peace with Jaina by your side, as the loving embrace between you and the now rounder Daughter of the Sea felt like it had lasted for an hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as much as you despised ending such a romantic interaction between you and your favorite Warcraft character, you knew that it would be best that the two of you leave to rendezvous with Katherine and Tandred Proudmoore, as you gazed back upon Jaina, who currently had her head snuggling against your larger bosom, with you easily taking notice of how large your fur-covered mammaries were compared to Jaina's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Rayja, can I request something from you?\" Jaina queried, as you tenderly stroke her head with your left paw-like hand, like a doting mother comforting her child. In response, you curved the lips on your lupine snout to form a caring smile and replied, \"...Of course, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I... I would like you to accompany me when I visit my mother and brother. Would you be willing to do so?\" She asked, obviously not wanting to be alone when she reunites with her blood relatives. After all, when it comes to massive affairs, such as commanding an army or participating in combat with her magic, that's the Jaina Proudmoore you knew and love. But...when it came to such intimately personal affairs, you could easily see the cracks and chinks in the woman's mental armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo of course you were intending on accompanying the rotund Archmage when she visits her mother and brother at Lord Admiral's Rest, as you hugged Jaina a little tighter in response and confirmation, where you then answered, \"...You don't need to request such a thing like this to me, my Lady. You know where my true loyalties lie. With you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to your passionate confirmation, she swiftly hugged you tighter as well, before letting go as she replied, \"...I know. But I wanted to.\" From there, she slowly stood up from the chair, while you did the same. You looked back at Jaina, mildly cradling the undercarriage of your stuffed paunch with one paw-like hand, as you then spoke toward her and asked, \"So...When do you want to leave for your family's cemetery?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I think it would be best we leave as soon as possible. They might already be at Lord Admiral's Rest by now.\" Jaina answered, making a speculative answer of Katherine and Tandred's current whereabouts. However, despite your utter willingness to escort the rotund Archmage through her family's cemetery, your still digesting stomach would have none of it, gurgling in protest whilst you stood up on your thickened digitgrade lupine legs, causing you to give an unamused glare at your churning stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* Well... As much as my stomach is complaining right now, I agree with you. Just...let me see if I can get out of this dress and into a more proper set of attire.\" You retorted, emphasizing on your digesting stomach's bitching and moaning before Jaina, who easily understood your minute dilemma and answered, \"*giggle* Of course, my love. I shall wait for you in the meantime.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, as you watched as Jaina calmly walked away from you, her obviously fatter behind rippling and bouncing subtly under the hems and cloth of her dress skirt, you soon refocused your efforts on returning to the master bedroom, as you somehow remembered seeing a full suit of plated Paladin armor placed upon a robust mannequin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* ...Might as well hustle this fat furry ass of mine back into the bedroom. Though, I'm starting to have doubts if I can even fit into that set of armor at my current weight.\" You contemplated, as you lumbered your way back inside the private quarters of you and Jaina. But fortunately, it seemed to be getting a little easier to be carrying around such heft, which still made you wander how you and Jaina got so fat to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, such an adipose-related topic would have to be put on hold, as you inevitably returned to the personal quarters that was reserved for you and the corpulent Archmage. And there, standing opposite of your warhammer, Sin-Burner, stood an ornately designed yet adeptly functional suit of heavy Paladin armor. Remembering how your character played as a Paladin, you soon remembered that the skills of Rayja Silverclaw you knew and created were...</span></div></div>",

To be a Tank in a game such as World of Warcraft, one must be willing to be the focal point of every enemy, absorbing the damage they dealt unto oneself, thus preventing any allies from being attacked themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, there was the Retribution specialization, which was primarily and solely focused on unleashing insurmountable damage upon one's enemies, with numerous abilities tied to dishing out attacks on either a single enemy, or multiple enemies at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;The song \"14 Years In The Kreisau Circle\" from the Wolfenstein: The New Order soundtrack begins playing&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you casually reached for your warhammer, Sin-Burner, it felt as if the synapses and nerves in your brain were suddenly alight with sheer muscle memory and instinctual prowess, like repressed memories suddenly resurfacing all at once. In response to such a psychological whiplash, you upended your warhammer, twirling the hilt within your clawed fingers, then proceeded to do some test swings of the blunt weapon with surprising amounts of finesse with great ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, as you heaved Sin-Burner upwards, you let the upper threshold of the daunting warhammer rest upon your right shoulder, where you gazed upon the ensemble that you assumed to be your Paladin armor. \"Hmph! Of course the armor would have those big pauldrons on them.\" You mentally remarked, noting how ornately detailed yet seemingly excessive the armor appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe armor itself was forged from the lightweight adamantine alloys only found in certain parts of the world, as it had these bronze trimmings to it's decor. On the opposite left pauldron, it was scuttled in the form of a Dire Wolf's head, with it's metallic snout in a snarling position, sharp metal fangs bare, a completely aggressive contrast to the usual animal symbols that were synonymous with the holistic nature of a Paladin, usually taking a form of either an angelic eagle or the noble Lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* Well, I better not keep my lovely Jaina waiting.\" You cheekily thought, obviously feeling rather giddy that you're legitimately hooked up with the real Jaina Proudmoore, as you soon began to strip the suit of plated armor in individual segments. However, as you calmly yet gently stripped the intricately designed gown from your rotund furry form, you somehow felt as if your whole body was completely turned on to autopilot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn turn, as you began to unconsciously equip yourself with a short-sleeved gambeson shirt and a pair of loose but form-fitting light-armored pants, your consciousness unknowingly drifted into the fathomless recesses of your mind. And yet, you were not truly unconscious, as your aware consciousness floated through the ceaseless voidful depths of your mind, where you began to experience these highly exuberant visions -- No, not visions. More like... memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like hours, maybe even days, as you vividly experience the memories of Rayja Silverclaw, whether it was in the form of the notorious hard-fought battle against the Lich known as Kel'Thuzad, to the fallout of the bombing of Theramore and witnessing Jaina inflamed rage against the Horde for the dishonorable atrocity, to the reignited war between the Alliance and the Horde (courtesy of the Banshee Queen, Sylvanas Windrunner) at the Battle of Lordaeron alongside Jaina, and...well, just about almost every concurring event and questline in between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were unsure of how many of these memories you -- No! Not you, but Rayja Silverclaw -- had watched and participated in, for it seemed as if there was too many to count. In a way, it was as if the spirit of Rayja Silverclaw was pouring all of her experiences she had accumulated whilst you played as her, all of her wisdom, her fighting prowess, and more... into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, by the time these vivid memories had relented, you soon found yourself fully equipped in the wolf-centric Paladin armor. And you must admit: it fits rather comfortably, as you noticed a royal purple silken cloak adorned on your back, with the hood easily away from your Worgen head, as it lopsided against the intricate gilded pattern of the cloak. However, you soon noticed a distinct insignia upon the cloak's fabric: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silver illustration of a wolf's head, with a crescent moon and claw marks intertwining with one another behind the wolf's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, in the words of Will Smith, \"You made this look good.\"</span></div></div>",

And with that, as well as a brief self-examination in a nearby mirror, you felt content with the equipped garments, where you soon lumbered toward the door, grabbing the lengthy hilt of the warhammer midway, swinging it until the weapon was slung along your shoulder like carrying a knapsack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon traversing the doorframe, you cautiously turned yourself to the side for easier passage, then turning back to a forward-facing position, as you heard the subtle clinking and clacking of metal plate and chainmail slowly shifting to and fro with each step forward you made toward Jaina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd whilst you approached ever closer back towards the rotund Archmage, your acute Worgen hearing easily picked up Jaina's mournful humming, alongside the scuttling of several items in the process, you soon came upon Jaina, who had just finished up in packing some necessities in case of a potential assault on Boralus during the visit to Lord Admiral's Rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm listening now...Father.\" Jaina mournfully whispered, where you instinctively approached her from behind to reassure her once more, gently grasping her with semi-gauntlet-covered hands. From there, you calmly whispered into Jaina's ear and hushed, \"Jaina...You don't have to go if you don't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...I know. ...But this is something I must do.\" She slowly retorted, which prompted you to end the affectionate embrace, as the rotund Proudmoore soon grabbed for the Staff of Antonidas, exhaling a deep breath to sooth her hesitant nerves before turning around to face you and firmly complied, \"...Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>===Boralus===<br>\r\n==Kul Tiras==</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoughhewn wooden planks lining intertwining various walkways, terraces, and stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSea-weathered rooftops and awnings adorned on the rooftop of every building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd amber-lit windows and walkway lanterns lending a honeyed tone to the atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was what many could describe when it came to walking the very streets of Boralus, the largest harbor city of the island kingdom of Kul Tiras, serving as the nation's capital city and governing seat of House Proudmoore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was there that House Proudmoore called Proudmoore Keep their home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFound to the far west of the city, bordering the areas of Upton Borough, Unity Square, and Proudmoore Academy to the south and west, it wasn't just the home of House Proudmoore, but also known as a fortress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, it's denizens were somewhat recovering after the harrowing events that led to a siege of Boralus by Priscilla Ashvane and her pirate allies, as well as the return of the famed Kul Tiras Fleet and a long-lost relative, Tandred Proudmoore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you and Jaina waddled down the lavish naval-themed halls of Proudmoore Keep, you noted how both the Elite Guards and servants of the castle worked in tandem with one another to repair the castle grounds to it's previous glory prior to Lady Ashvane's vain siege on Boralus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the mere morbid thought of that bloated arrogant socialite was enough to make your blood boil, along with rousing the bestial side of your Worgen self, inciting a lupine self-snarl, showing your sharp fanged teeth for all to bare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Something the matter, Rayja?\" Jaina asked, noting the physical behavior of your Worgen snout, causing you to calm down somewhat, emitting a blush on your behalf. Quickly, you confessed, \"*sigh* ...My apologies, My Lady. Just thinking back to a damnable Priscilla. To be frank, that woman makes my blood boil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. And here I thought Paladins were above grudges.\" Jaina curiously retorted, stirring up a conversation as a modest distraction from today's errands, to which you calmly interjected, \"--Only when they're not threatening to harm or execute those we care about. If she ever shows that stupid face of hers again, I won't hesitate to bare my fangs around her throat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how you feel, my love.\" She acknowledged, to which she soon momentarily stopped her locomotion, turning around to face you, where she then placed a chubby gauntlet hand upon the outermost curve of your apron paunch of a fur-covered belly, which was suitably covered over by a layer of chainmail, segmented plate armor, and a tabard bearing the crest of House Proudmoore for all to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you couldn't help but blush just a tad deeper by this affectionate action by Jaina's hand, to which the newly-christened Lord Admiral soon continued, \"...But don't worry. Ashvane can run while she's still free, but we'll eventually get our chance to pay her back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But for now, let us meet up with my mother and Tandred.\" Jaina answered, to which an upward curve of your lupine lips appeared on your furry face and snout, nodding in agreement as you complied, \"Then let us not keep them waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the two of you continued down the elaborate halls of Proudmoore Keep, taking several turns whilst you followed closely behind Jaina, akin to a personal bodyguard. Eventually, after much traversal, the two of you soon entered the outdoor family crypt of House Proudmoore, Lord Admiral's Rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSituated in the gardens on the side of Proudmoore Keep, it was where many Lord Admirals were laid to rest, along with members of the Proudmoore family. Due to their occupations as sailors, sometimes the graves were presumably empty, devoid of their respective corpses, most likely due to a body never being found amongst the cold, dark depths of Azeroth's oceans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriginally, Tandred was initially thought to be dead, his body lost beneath the waves, so Katherine Proudmoore, Jaina's mother, had a crypt commissioned to be built to honor the supposedly fallen child of Daelin Proudmoore. And yet, after the events that led to Jaina becoming the new Lord Admiral, the crypt was now a reminder of how relieved Jaina and Katherine were that Tandred still drew breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you and Jaina approached the main area of Lord Admiral's Rest, which bore a large monolith-esque crypt of the late Daelin Proudmoore, you soon discovered that Katherine Proudmoore was already present there, but she was not alone...</span></div></div>",

After all, Sylvanas is one of the most easily recognizable characters from the Warcraft series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, for those who need a refresher on who she is or those who are curious about who Sylvanas is, here is a summary of her backstory:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Lady Sylvanas Windrunner, also known by the titles of \"The Dark Lady\" and most famously as \"The Banshee Queen\", is the Warchief of the Horde and the supreme ruler of the undead masses known as \"The Forsaken\", which happens to be one of the most powerful factions of undead in Azeroth. In life, Sylvanas was the ranger-general of Silvermoon, whose leadership acumen and martial prowess were without equal.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>During the events of Warcraft 3, she bravely defended the city of Quel'Thalas from a Scourge invasion, led by the Death Knight and wielder of the runeblade Frostmourne, Arthas Menethil. Ultimately, however, Sylvanas fell in battle. But rather than honor the ranger-general with a quick death, Arthas ruthlessly ripped out her soul and transformed it into a banshee: a cunning and vengeful agent of the Lich King empowered by hate.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>When the Lich King's control over his minions weakened, Sylvanas broke away from her tyrannical master's control and reclaimed her body. Vowing to avenge her death, Sylvanas gathered other renegade undead and set out to wage war against the Scourge. Thus it was that the Forsaken came to be, with Sylvanas as their queen, and under her command, the Forsaken joined the Horde and later helped bring about the Lich King's downfall in the frozen wastes of Northrend. Afterwards, she seeks out a higher purpose for a people who have already died once.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell then, now that we got to understand Sylvanas a bit more, the more important question remains...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...How big would you like Sylvanas to be?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was in charge of the Principality's Mobile Suit Forces, as well as being responsible for their use against the Federation.In addition, she was responsible for the creation of numerous elite Mobile Suits, including Char Aznable's (while aware of his true identity as Casval), the 300th Independent Corps (also referred to as \"Char's Newtype Corps), the hand-picked Chimera Corps, and the Midnight Fenrir covert ops team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, due to lack of information, Kycilia is portrayed ambiguously during the main series and the various side stories surrounding the One Year War, with her motives often open to question and debate. She is shown to be fiercely loyal to the people of Zeon and to the men under her command. Yet many of her actions, however, can also be interpreted as those of a charismatic but utterly merciless manipulator of the highest order, preparing for a military coup.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor more information on Kycilia Zabi, please refer to this link:<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Kycilia_Zabi\" target=\"_blank\">https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Kycilia_Z...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow then, onto the most important question at hand; How big is Kycilia Zabi?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When the stolen Gundam fires at the space fortress Konpei Island, the Federation Space Force suffers a catastrophic loss.

After the events of Operation Stardust, the Earth Federation establishes an elite counter-insurgency division called the Titans to hunt down the remaining pockets of Zeon remnants. The Titans become overzealous in their mission, start resorting to brutal methods to achieve their goals, and become nothing more than ruthless tyrants with an ambition to rule the Earth Sphere. Two anti-Titans resistance groups, the Anti-Earth Union Group (AEUG) and their earth-bound counterparts Katana (led by Hayato Kobayashi), form to unite the various existing small forces in the struggle against the Titans. Their members consist of renegade soldiers of the Earth Federal forces, former soldiers of the Principality of Zeon, and militia from space colonies.

As Banagher runs through the battlefield in search of Audrey, he has a fateful encounter with a white mobile suit, the Unicorn Gundam, which is the key to Laplace's Box. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What is Laplace's Box? What secret does it contain? The hundred-year curse of the Universal Century is about to be resolved.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, as for Mobile Suit Gundam F91...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The year is U.C. 0123. To accommodate the growing population, the Earth Federation has built new space colonies. However, the Crossbone Vanguard decides to seize these colonies to help establish it's extraterrestrial empire. Now, reluctant hero Seabook Arno and his Gundam F91 must lead a fierce struggle for suvival.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, we have Mobile Suit Victory Gundam...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The year is U.C 0153. Twenty years have passed since the Crossbone Vanguard's assault on the Earth Federation.

You were a humongous fan of the long-running franchise, whether it was from watching the numerous anime series,to the video games, to some of the model kits you've built and collected for the remainder of your childhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you had just finished up a match in the video game, Gundam Battle Operation 2, you decided to call it in for the night after a long day's work of grinding to unlock the Jegan as a playable Mobile Suit. But as you laid yourself down upon your bed and succumbed to slumber, that would be the last time you saw your apartment, not knowing of what fate had in store for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>== 8 Hours Later... ==</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly start to woke up to a feeling of...weightlessness? <i>\"Strange. I don't remember my bed being this soft.\"</i> You thought to yourself, as your eyes were readjusting to the increased brightness within your room. However, as your gaze eventually gained clarity, you soon came to a startling realization: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ARE floating!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened with surprise, as you noted that you were hovering a few inches off of an industrial-style bunk bed. \"Okay, that's totally not my bed!\" You thought to yourself, as you began to examine your surroundings. It was there you realized that you were no longer in your room, let alone your apartment, as you rubbed the top of your head in confusion and loudly whispered, \"...Jesus. What the hell is going on here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attempted to dismount yourself from the bunk bed, noticing that feeling of weightlessness once more. \"...Is it just me...or does it feel like I'm in zero gravity?\" You muttered to yourself, trying your best to maintain your center of gravity in all this weightlessness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as soon as you felt your feet touch the cold metallic floor, you soon heard a rather cold yet feminine voice murmur behind you that muttered, \"...Gundam...Is...My ene...my...\" Instinctively, you quickly turned towards the source of the voice, where you noticed a bottom bunk below \"your\" bunk bed, revealing a rather large young woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, the woman had fiery orange yet silk smooth hair, which reached down a few inches below her shoulder blades, with the end of such a mane put into a loose yet lithe ponytail. However, when it came to the rest of her body,  it was downright corpulent, complete with a pair of smooth fuller cheeks, a plump double chin, and a thick neck. Your eyes gazed downward across her enormity underneath the functional bedsheets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarboring a good estimated guess, judging from how much the bedsheets rose, the woman must to at least weigh around the 500 to 600 pound Mark. But still, even though she appeared to be rather attractive despite all that heft, you couldn't help but ponder upon her spoken words: \"Gundam was her enemy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...No, that can't be right. The Gundam is pure fiction! And yet...\"</i> You thought, looking back at her with curiosity and confusion whilst your thoughts continued, <i>\"...Why does she look so...familiar?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts soon took a backseat, as you soon began to grow curious about your current environs. So, to sate this curiosity, you slowly made your way toward what you hoped was the exit. However, as you made your way toward the metallic industrial door, you felt as if you were taking large leaps in your stride, where you thought that you were going to bump into the door, only for it to automatically slide open upon close proximity, causing you to land outside of the bunkroom area with a soft thud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ow! What's wrong with this place?! Is it in outer space or something?\"</i> You angrily thought, grasping the back of your head in mild frustration, as you slowly got up on your feet, which felt like you didn't weigh a single pound. However, you soon got a clear view of a somewhat vast open industrial area of sorts, with catwalks, industrial machinery, and various forms of equipment neatly organized about the place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Weird. This place looks like some sort of...hangar?\"</i> You contemplated, holding onto the metal railing as both support and to keep yourself grounded from floating off uncontrollably. But then, somethings caught your attention, as your gaze turned towards...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At first, upon looking the outright massive pair of mechanized behemoths, you weren't initially sure what they were. However, upon further inspection, your eyes widened in great shock and surprise, as you internally thought, <i>\"...What the?! Th-That's a Jegan!\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd your assumption was undoubtedly correct. The first machine before you was indeed a Mobile Suit. More specifically, an RGM-89 Jegan, an Earth Federation mass-produced Mobile Suit first used during the movie, Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack. However, there was some distinct differences between a regular Jegan and the one parked before you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst off, the colors were completely different from the usual Jegan color set. Instead of a prominent pale cyan with blue lighting on the head of the Mobile Suit, the Jegan was mostly colored a dark olive-drab green, with clean-cut splotches of chalk yellow on certain areas of the machine, such as the shoulders, feet, and the forehead crest, while the lighting of the Mobile Suit, usually a bright green-blue hue, now had a flaming orange hue, while the Jegan shield was a collage of gun-metal gray, olive-drab green, and chalk yellow, with the two racks of missiles jutting out from the sides of the shield, as per it's manufactured design. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you soon noticed that the arms and shoulder pauldrons weren't that of a Jegan. Instead, judging from the design and angular curvature, the shoulders and arms were from a different Mobile Suit. More specifically, from the newer RGM-96X Jesta. On the shoulder pauldrons, two different insignia were adorned on each pauldron.  On the left facing pauldron, a bronze shield outline with two parallel diagonal lines running through the center, while on the right pauldron, the unmistakable golden yellow emblem of Neo Zeon from MSG: Unicorn, used by the forces of Full Frontal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttached to the right side of the Jegan's booster backpack, was a massive sheathed two-handed blade, most likely made for slicing up Federation ships with one or two swings when aimed at a critical area. And finally, it was holding in it's left hand what appeared to be a Hyper Bazooka, which had a olive-drab green box magazine and barrel tip, with the magazine bearing the golden yellow Neo Zeon emblem upon it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, judging from it's wholesome design and some of the emblems obviously showing it's true allegiance, it must've been a stolen Federation Mobile Suit, repaired and repurposed to fight for Neo Zeon. <i>\"...Gotta admit; This looks like a custom Mobile Suit. A pretty good one, too.\"</i> You thought, admitting that the machine before you looked quite impressive, considering it wasn't originally a Zeon M.S.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you soon noticed a set of words lined along the length of the custom Jegan's right facing leg. Looking at it more closely, you could easily make out what they said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"JEGAN - Z\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Jegan - Z, huh? Has a nice ring to it.\"</i> You thought, admitting it does sound like a better name than <i>Zeon Jegan</i>, that's for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you soon became aware of what appeared to be a second Mobile Suit positioned behind the Jegan - Z, which appeared to be much larger than the machine in front of it. And strangely enough, it seemed even more familiar to you than the Jegan - Z, as you got a little closer to the larger machine. In appearance, it looked like it was in a green metallic cocoon, judging from the four massive wing-like folds adorned upon the machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could easily tell that it was a Mobile Suit, just like the Jegan - Z. However, you soon instinctively jump back in shock upon quickly realizing that the Mobile Suit was. Your eyes widened with surprise, as your thoughts raced whilst you mentally exclaimed, <i>\"My god... Th-That's the Kshatriya!! And if th-that's the Kshatriya,  then I'm onboard the Sleeves ship Garencieres. And if these are actual working Mobile Suits, th-then that means...\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to your shocking self-revelations, you quickly pressed your hands against the sides of your head on instinct, with you knowing the true answer to this conundrum, as you mentally scream, <i>\"...I'M IN MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM UNICORN!!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, you were utterly flabbergasted by this revelation, leaning against the nearby wall, as you slowly slump down onto the metal walkway due to the low gravity inside the freighter ship. From there, you instinctively attempted to snap yourself out of such a glorifying yet speechless stupor, with you refocusing your thoughts as you mentally noted, <i>\"Snap out of it, (Name)! Calm down, calm down. *sigh* Okay, there's gotta be an explanation to this situation I'm in. An yet...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts soon turned to where the rotund, orange-haired woman was sleeping, as you came to terms with who that person might actually be, as you continued, <i>\"...If that's the Kshatriya below me, then...that mountain of a woman has to be Marida Cruz!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any other fantasy of yours, this would be a dream come true. However, you were still confused as to why she looked so obese in this situation you've awoke in. Overall, those questions had to wait for now, as...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"...Couldn't get much sleep, huh?\" A voice rang out, which had an air of stoicism and some hints of jaded cynicism. You could easily tell that it was a man's voice, as you turned your head towards the source of the voice, only for you to find out that it belonged to none other than the captain of the Garencieres, Lieutenant Suberoa Zinnerman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked like he leapt straight out of the anime series, as he was wearing his trademark outfit, which consisted of  dark brown fur-collared open overcoat, doing little to hide the fact he had a beergut underneath a green zip-up shirt, along with a pair of black pants and loose work boots. Overall, his appearance was strikingly uncanny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, as a way not to show your uncharacteristic stress in this new universe you've awoken in, you huffed out a sigh, crossing your arms upon the metal railing and retorted, \"*sigh* I guess. To be honest, I'm not entirely sure how this'll end once we do get Laplace's Box, Captain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, it seemed to work, since you just noticed that the Kshatriya still had all four shoulder binders, which meant you've awoken before the very first episode of Gundam Unicorn. Either that, or you were at the very beginning of the show's events, just before Marida engaged a squad of three Federation Jegans with the Kshatriya in the vastness of space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you were soon brought back to reality, as Zinnerman stopped to stand alongside you, whilst you stared blankly at the parked Kshatriya, where he then spoke toward you, his grizzled hands in his overcoat pockets as he stated, \"...I suppose that's fair, but we're gonna damn well try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* ...How's Marida?\" He flatly asked, staring at the custom Mobile Suit as well, in which you instinctively replied, \"She's still sleeping like a stone. Not that I don't mind, of course.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, it felt rather...strange, to be talking with the captain of the Garencieres, who also happens to be a father figure to Marida in the series. However, you knew you had to play along, otherwise the could ugly real fast. But who knows? It sounds like you're an established member of Zinnerman's crew, as he bore a content smirk, nodding in understanding and replied, \"That's good to hear, I guess. Still don't fully understand why you wanted to have her weigh as much as me and Alec, but...*heh* can't argue with results.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this, the gears in your head soon wound up, which made you come to a realization: You're most likely the definitive cause for Marida Cruz's newfound enormity. And yet, much to your internal surprise, you seemed...okay with this? Sure, you had a mild fantasy involving seeing plus-sized women, but it wasn't something to write home about. However, you looked back at Zinnerman with a cocked eyebrow of curiosity and queried, \"...Results?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Marida seems to be more...<i>free-spirited</i>, as of late. When we're not on sortie, it's as if she has more...<i>passion</i>, you could say. More gusto, like a gunnery sergeant on shore leave. Especially...when she's with you, Ensign.\" Zinnerman elaborated, which subtly revealed another possible revelation to you: You're possibly in a strong romantic relationship with Marida Cruz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, he also revealed something else worth noting; You're an Ensign, which meant that you're a rank lower than Marida, who so happens to bear the rank of Lieutenant Junior Grade, while Zinnerman was a Lieutenant (even though his crew call him \"Captain\" due to being the leader of the Garencieres). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, you couldn't help but mentally smile at this. After all, you somewhat considered Marida Cruz as your personal \"waifu\", even though she's now as real as the Mobile Suits you're gazing upon. And yet, you were still confused as to how you even got here in the first place, but right now...you didn't care for the time being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, whilst you and Zinnerman were staring off into the limited horizon...</span></div></div>",

Can you hear me?\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tossed and turned in your bed, dreaming about what life had in store for you, with it's numerous intertwining weaves and strands criss-crossing with each other in a dizzying manner. And yet, this time however, something felt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Do I... Reach you?\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Are you... Even listening?\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt...as if something-- No! Someone, was calling out to you. Instinctively, you approached the source of the singing, akin to being entranced by a siren's song. Each step forward brought more clarity to such a hauntingly beautiful melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Can I... Get through?\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nInevitably, you reached the source, only to see a white-haired figure kneeling before you, her posture slumped over in an almost somber state. Only one sentence came forth from your lips, feeling a semblance of...<i>familiarity</i> with this snowy-haired individual, as you knelt down on one knee and calmly asked, \"...Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, without a moment's hesitation, the mysterious person put you in a firm chokehold. You tried to fight and resist, only for it to be a futile dream itself. Your arms falling limp into the abyss as the figure then spoke in a hauntingly mellow tune and asked, <i><b>\"Do you...love...Me?\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sudden motion, you quickly shot up from your bed, loudly gasping in response to the vivid dreaming you've just experienced. Fortunately, you were able to regain your nerves through several deep breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInhale, count to three...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhale, count to three...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInhale, count to three...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhale, count to three...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a steady pace, just enough to put you at ease for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ugh... What the hell was that all about?\"</i> You thought, gently grasping your forehead with your left hand, calmly rubbing it in a soothing motion. However, much to your current demeanor, your other hand unintentionally brushed up against something...<i>weighty</i> and <i>soft</i>, which certainly caught you by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, you slowly turned your head toward what or who your hand brushed up against, soon taking notice of a prominent mass erupting from the bedsheets. At first, you thought you were hallucinating, but you soon rubbed the sleep from your eyes to witness what was making such a bulge underneath the blankets:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rather large heavyset woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, she had this somewhat youthful yet elegant aura to her, brandishing a lengthy mane of snow white hair, just like the person in your dreams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...What the hell is going on?\"</i> You mentally asked,your eyes soon glancing over the rotund beauty's enlarged form. Gazing upon her face, you can see a vertical scar going down the left side of her plump face. More specifically, by her left eye. From the looks of it, it was a rather old scar, as if the woman had received it in a duel of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She tells so...familiar. Have...Have I seen her from somewhere?\"</i> You contemplated, your eyes wandering over the rest of her body. Below her rounded face, she had a cute double chin, which perched above a set of plump rounded shoulders and chubby meaty arms. However, you soon took notice of the woman's abundance of cleavage, which had to be a Double or Triple E-Cup, maybe even an F-Cup judging from their volume, as it seemed that her icy blue bra appeared rather snug around the woman's substantial mammaries, bound to snap off with even the sharpest of movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, your eyes continued gazing downwards, looking upon what you can easily say is one of the biggest parts of this unknown woman: Her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a small frail thing either, but rather, it was a humongous blubbery paunch of a thing, as it scrunched up a little into two hefty belly-folds with ease, as the woman laid on her side, thus giving you an ample gaze at her equally plump waistline,  hips, legs, and buttocks, with the faint line of a pair of panties covered up in the front by her behemoth of a gut. Overall, if you had to wager a gamble as to her approximate weight, you'd bet it be a little over 500 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, despite the accumulated adipose upon her physique, you couldn't help but find her to be rather...<i>attractive</i>, in a sense. Though, your mind continued to wonder as you thought, <i>\"...Who are you?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...She's probably not going to give me any answers soon, so I guess I'll have to find them myself.\"</i> You contemplated, left with little to no choice but to...</span></div></div>",

From what you can easily see, the entire room was much more spacious, yet also having this...<i>air of elegance</i>, to it's foundation and construction, consistently bearing a pristine, sterile white on the walls, as well as a snowy white reflective tile floor, with the ceiling forming a series of complex arches, sparsely compensated by golden sconces with blue teardrop beads hanging from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly traversing through the room, you can easily see the entrance area just ahead of you, where it was now three steps lower than the rest of the room, equipped with a pair of white armchairs with gold frames next to a glass coffee table laced with a golden frame.

This place looks rather...intricate, that's for sure!\"</i> You wondered, amazed at how pristinely detailed the place was, akin to a child going to the amusement park for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, looking towards the back of the room, there stood an enormous window, with equally tall, thick blue curtains pulled aside by lighter blue ties. Sitting adjacent to said window, there stood what appeared to be a simple white desk, where to the right of which hung a portrait of sorts. But as the sun slowly lit up the area as it ascended over the horizon, the room had gained more clarity, to which gave you a more definitive glance at the portrait before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching closer, you can make out two figures within the portrait; The first figure you instantly recognized as yourself. However, looking more closely, you can easily see that the second person in the painting was undoubtedly that large woman lying in bed! Only...she looked rather presentable in the portrait, as she looked to be about half the size she was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the longer you looked at the portrait, the more you began to speculate who she could really be. Though, it was not until you noticed a golden plaque adorned on the bottom frame of the portrait, which boldly stated a startling revelation in an elegant John Hancock:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\"(Name) &amp; Weiss Schnee. Truly, Love Eternal.\"</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, just like that... Such revelations hit you akin to a speeding Bullet Train, as your eyes slowly but surely opened wide with shock and realization, now recognizing who the plaque silently spoke of:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss Schnee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe youngest daughter of the illustrious Schnee Family, the owners of the Schnee Dust Company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wielder of the Multi-Action Dust Rapier weapon known as <i>\"Myrtenaster\"</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStudent of Beacon Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccomplished Huntress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd...a member of Team RWBY.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt like the entire world just froze for only a few fleeting moments, with your own brain wrapping around what you have discovered, your thoughts frantically racing as they weaved, <i>\"That...Th-That's not even p-possible!! Weiss Schnee is s-s-supposed to be a fictional character!! A-And she's not supposed to be so...FAT!! What...Wh-What the flying hell is going on here!?!?!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, you felt like you wanted to instinctively scream at the top of your lungs, unsure if it's with extreme delight or impulsive shock. After all, you've binge-watched the entire RWBY series, and out of the many noteworthy characters on the show, the one that stole your heart was the Ice Princess herself, Weiss Schnee. From her overall design, to the inspiration of her character from Snow White, to the turmoil of her being excommunicated by her manipulative father (whom you've hated with an unbridled passion), to even her personality, Weiss won you over, despite some of the missteps that Rooster Teeth had with the series in later seasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, upon closer examination of the chubbier Weiss in the portrait, you can see that her overall outfit was undoubtedly from...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And yet, as your mildly drunken stupor was overcome by the call of slumber, little did you realize at that time...your life would be changed in a great many ways...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>== Some Hours Later... ==</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head pounded as if you just swallowed a still-beating heart, as you slowly arose from where you laid, placing a hand upon your throbbing forehead, rubbing it with an index, middle, and ring finger in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Damn. I had one too many Budweisers.\"</i> You thought under your breath, your vision soon dilating and refocusing with pristine clarity. And yet, slowly but surely, you felt something was completely...<i>off</i>, regarding as to where you've awoken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...What the? I don't remember my place being this dark...\"</i> You thought, quickly noticing how everything appeared, as you turned your head and looked upon the bed you fell upon, only to see that you were now sitting on a Gothic-style King-Sized bed, complete with blood red silk bedsheets. You casually held a minute piece of the smooth cloth and continued, <i>\"...Let alone having something THIS gothic.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that something felt rather off with this place, as you soon felt the cold smooth black limestone floor beneath the soles of your bare feet, standing up to examine your environs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* I better figure out where the exit is before I get in trouble with whoever lives here.\" You muttered under your own breath, about to wander your way out of this foreboding environment. However, you soon smelled something peculiar in the breeze. It smelled almost...<i>metallic</i> in odor and texture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour curiosity getting the better of you, you began to sought out this metallic odor, to find it's source, and hopefully a way out as well. You grabbed a nearby robe to cover yourself, now aware of your current nudity, as you forcibly pushed open one of the monumentally large iron doors, giving you your first glimpse of where you were now at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...Geez. Where the hell am I? This place is huge.\"</i> You thought, noting how downright massive the place was, with obscenely tall walls and gothic archway rafters high above you. Your eyes shifted left to right to see if there was anyone else besides you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, as you followed the metallic scent, you began to hear these muffled slurping and gulping sounds in the distance as you tread closer to the source of such an odor. And yet, as you approached closer and closer towards the source of the odor, you heard the faint echoes of a voice, undoubtedly male in tone, as the voice elaborated, \"...We have managed to cull those troublesome members of their so-called <i>resistance</i>, My Lady. Without the figureheads of this bothersome nuisance, it shall be only a matter of time before they are no more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, you clearly weren't sure as to what this person was rambling on about, but when you finally reached the source of the metallic odor, you peered your head from behind the still-open doors of the adjacent room, and what you had witnessed within the room before you had left you in complete shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the room were several yet absurdly massive women, each of them were fattened up to an impossible yet immobile size, looking more akin to deformed human-shaped blobs of blubber and adipose. However, what drew your gaze's attention was the large pale shape perched atop one of the immobile blobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you weren't sure what to make of such a sight. However, the pale form soon stood up, indicating that it was undoubtedly humanoid in shape, albeit in a corpulent shape. \"...You've only made martyrs out of them, Viceroy. And that will only complicate matters.\" Another voice rang out, which you soon realized that it originated from the pale form, now confirmed to be female in tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was when the wide figure turned herself around that you soon realized who the pale figure was. <i>\"Th-That...That's Carmilla!\"</i> Your thoughts raced, instantly recognizing who she was. From her inhumanely pale white skin, to her sharp cold blue eyes, to her full blood red lips, her sharp angular pointed chin, and lengthy snow white hair, this was, without a shred of doubt, Carmilla from Castlevania. More specifically, from the Netflix animated series of the same name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, you couldn't help but quickly notice some distinct differences with this version of Carmilla from the show. First off, she wasn't currently wearing her signature black and crimson red ombre dress with the golden shoulder plates and matching golden heeled shoes, as she stood upright in nothing, her pale-skinned and completely nude form drenched somewhat in what you could only assume was blood, which coated her long-nailed fingers, along with her mouth dripping with copious amounts of blood, which oozed down her naked physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd second (and the most obvious, of course), was the rather drastic increase in width, size, and girth. Her face had plumped up some, with rounder fuller cheeks, and a developing double chin, though her pointed chin remained intact surprisingly. Looking below her neck, gone was Carmilla's slender and sharply curvy physique, as it had been covered in ludicrous amounts of adipose, giving her a more rotund and rounder curvy body. Her breasts, once a petite C Cup, had ballooned into a bra-busting Triple E-Cup, as such mammaries now rested on an enormous apron belly, which had folded itself into two flabby folds of stomach flesh, which reached down towards her privates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, her hips, waist, and butt had taken a good brunt of such an expanded physique, as her hips jutted out to a noticeable degree, while her butt was big and fat enough that one could stack an object on it. Her thighs and legs were just as meaty as the rest of her, as her thighs noticeably yet firmly rubbed against each other. Though, as for her arms, they weren't entirely spared from such an obese size, complete with thick rounded biceps and forearms, along with a pair of plump hands and chubby fingers, all whilst still retaining her lethal claw-like fingernails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, Carmilla had certainly packed on the pounds, for sure, as you watched as Carmilla calmly and casually licked the still fresh blood from her plump lips, savoring the red liquid's taste, since she's a vampire and all. And yet, now realizing that you were probably in Carmilla's castle estate in Styria, Austria, you were still utterly confused as to how and why you even got here in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before you could even formulate a reasonable answer...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>But then, just before you could even formulate a logical explanation to such madness, you soon noticed that Carmilla had disappeared. <i>\"Where did she go?\"</i> You thought, initially confused as to what you just missed mere seconds ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, your thoughts soon realized where the rotund vampire was now, as you promptly felt a large but soft bump behind you. Your eyes opened the widest you could physically do, feeling like you were sweating lead bullets as to who was now behind you, looming over you like a rounded shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh shit. Ohshitohshitohshit! This is it, I'm dead! She's gonna suck my blood dry!!\"</i> Your thoughts raced on overdrive, your fight or flight instincts screaming to run, yet fear pinned you where you stood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet... Instead of feeling the sharp pain of your jugular being punctured by a pair of vampire fangs as you had fearfully predicted, you...you felt a pair of thick meaty pale arms softly wrap themselives around your torso from behind in a...well, a rather <i>affectionate</i> manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn turn, this caught you off-guard, yet left you on edge as you thought, <i>\"...Don't fall for it! She's trying lull you into a false sense of safety!\"</i> You tried to break free, yet your body wasn't responding at all, frozen like a stone statue. But then, as you braced yourself for the inevitable bloodsucking bite from the nude vampire countess, you soon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Felt a kiss? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly opened your eyes, expecting to see Carmilla's fangs pierce the side of your neck, only to witness something completely uncharacteristic of this incarnation of Carmilla: She was kissing you. On the neck, no less!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...What the? Wh-What's going?! I should be dead now!\"</i> You impulsively thought, rather confused as to what was occurring before your very eyes, as you witnessed as Carmilla tenderly kissed you, moving from your neck towards your lips, turning you around to face her. And yet, as the corpulent vampire began to lock lips with you, you felt rather...<i>calm</i>, despite being in physical contact with someone who should've turned you into a dried-up husk drained of blood or worse, with your body beginning to become sexually aroused by such tender movements from the obese Carmilla of Styria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, you were very familiar as to what Castlevania was, but when the Netflix series came about, especially in the second season, you developed a hard crush on Carmilla, even though she was portrayed as a cunning, sadistic manipulator in the show. And yet, here you were, locking lips and intertwining your tongue with the famed vampire countess from Castlevania. Suffice to say, it was like something out of an erotic fanfic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, just as things were about to get rather steamy, Carmilla slowly severed the kiss, looking upon with something unexpected; Instead of her trademark yet cunning <i>\"I've got some manipulating to do\"</i> expression on her face, she had this uncharacteristic affectionate look on her rounded yet angular face, along with a look in her eyes that showed kindness and romantic affection, devoid of any cunning, deception, and sadism. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Good evening, my beloved.\" She calmly said, her voice it's usual octave and tone, but with a semblance of a loving affectionate undertone to her voice. From there, you could easily tell that she was a good stone taller than you, yet much heavier than you. If you had to wager a guess, you'd guess that Carmilla had to weigh at least a quarter ton to 600 pounds in weight, which was definitely considered overweight for a normal vampire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she administered a quick loving peck on your forehead, you couldn't help but instinctively retorted, \"Um, G-Good evening to y-you too, Carmilla.\" From there, Carmilla looked back upon you with a loving look in her eyes, as you eyed up and down at her overall enormity then (trying to) calmly asked, \"...I can see you've been keeping yourself well-fed then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously noting at how you were staring at her nude, blood-soaked form, Carmilla soon displayed a seductive curve of her plump red lips, licking off some of the fresh blood on her other hand in the process, then trained her cold blue eyes back upon you whilst doing so and elaborated, \"*light chuckle* ...Well,  you know how it is for yours truly, beloved, especially from the quantity of blood I must drink at times.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, as if attempting to arouse and entice you with her nude form, Carmilla slowly circled around you with a seductive jiggling sway in each step befitting of vampire nobility. Though, you had to admit it, it was definitely working, as Carmilla's double-fold belly bobbed some up and down with each rhythmic step she took, where she spoke to you in her signature cold-hearted voice, but now with a aroused seductive undertone as she elaborated, \"...But then again, such sloth and gluttony had come from quite a filthy mind.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a quick motion of her plump hand and meaty arm, she swiftly grabbed a large portion of her flab and briefly shook it in emphasis, causing her pale flesh to quiver and ripple with gusto for a second or two whilst she continued, \"After all, you thought it would have me become more womanly if I indulged with such unbridled gluttony.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with such explicit bravado, she had ultimately revealed that you were the true cause of her newfound girth, which certainly surprised you. Yet, eerily enough, you seemed relatively calm about all of this, with your thoughts contemplating, <i>\"Wow. This certainly explains a lot. Yet...Why am I so nonchalant about this?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, noticing your blank expression, Carmilla tilted her head slightly in mild confusion, cocking a sharp snow white eyebrow in response and questioned, \"...Is something wrong?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Um...No, not really. Just thinking about our future.\" You instinctively, talking as if you were a completely different person, much to your internal surprise. Fortunately for you, it seemed to work in evading any suspicion from Carmilla, where the corpulent vampire countess soon displayed a curved smirk on her full plump lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, she soon put her plump hands into your own, her claw-like fingernails digging a little into your grip, but not enough to draw blood. And after giving you a quick peck on the left cheek, she soon spoke and said, \"*light chuckle* Come, beloved. We have a rebellion to crush.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere it was. The cunning and sadistic demeanor you were familiar with when Carmilla spoke, displaying her vampiric fangs with a sadistic grin on her plump face, but for only a brief moment, as she casually guided you down the lengthy gothic hallway hand in hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she soon showed her romantic affection once more, as she looked at you with a seductively aroused look on her pale-skinned face whilst she quipped, \"But first...\"</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>\"...A Bath? Okay...I can handle that. I mean, what can go wrong?\"</i> Your thoughts pulsated, coping with such a minute yet relaxing task, as you quickly spoke towards Carmilla and retorted, \"Sure. Why not?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" She answered, an almost malicious yet still adoring curve of her luscious lips, as she calmly strung you along down the dark limestone hallway, taking a few turns in between. To you, the place felt like a giant gothic-themed labyrinth, and yet, this was (and still is) the home of Carmilla of Styria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut whilst you were forcefully escorted through the obsidian black pristine halls of the castle, your thoughts momentarily contemplated and recapped on what had occurred within the last few minutes, as you reflected, <i>\"...Okay. Today just got a whole lot crazier than I thought. First I blacked out in my apartment, and now, somehow, I ended up hitched with Carmilla from Castlevania. But...this still doesn't make any sense. I thought Carmilla was supposed to be cunning and an opportunist, not someone who wants intimacy.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, those thoughts woulkd have to take a backseat for the moment, as two vampiric maids opened a set of ebony double doors before you and their pale mistress, thus granting access to what could only be described as <i>\"A Lavatory fit for Nobility\"</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you sat an expansive bathroom, with the same dark limestone tile floors as the rest of the castle interior. However, that was where the similarities end, as you could clearly see what was clearly a large, room-sized insignia, which was colored in Carmilla's color template of crimson red, bronze gold, and a ghostly white.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Steiermark_Wappen.svg\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ste...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn first glance, it looked like some sort of coat of arms only found in anything from medieval times, which made you ponder if you were still in the 21st century or not. Aside from the gold-trimmed furniture that associated with restroom decor, two things stood out in your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, and the most obvious, was the rightmost wall was replaced with several rows of intricately detailed stain-glass window murals lining said wall with an almost eerie symmetry to them. For a brief glimpse, you could swear that each of the individual murals had a story to tell. Yet, you couldn't stand still long enough to get an accurate description, as the rotund Carmilla calmly guided you towards the second obvious decor: A downright massive golden bathtub, which looked to be about the size of an SUV, complete with this innate metallic sculpture of a snarling lion with bat-like wings protruding from the sides of the beast's golden metal mane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it wasn't the golden bathtub figurehead that seemingly unnerved you some. But rather, it was what the enormous tub was filled with....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood. Gallons upon copious gallons of pure, unadulterated, and unfiltered blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, surprisingly enough...this didn't actually phase you as much as you initially expected, as you mentally noted, <i>\"...A Blood Bath? ....Huh. Makes sense, I suppose.\"</i> Made sense some, indeed. After all, Carmilla IS a vampire after all, so who knows? Maybe she took some beauty advice from Elizabeth Bathory or such. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, she let go of your hand and carefully yet calmly inserted herself into the pool of blood, dipping her pale feet in first, then her legs, allowing the thick churning blood slowly encompass her corpulent yet silk smooth physique, leaving only the outermost curve of her upper fold of her double belly, most of her pale voluminous breasts except her nipples, and her breastline, rounded shoulders, chubby arms, and her neck and head the only parts of her bobbing just above the surface of the gallons of blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a relieved and almost aroused sigh, as she let her obese self settle in the obtuse pool of blood, with the churning red life liquid calming in assertion. Once she was truly settled in the tub, Carmilla then swiftly snapped her fingers, causing her claw-like nails to make a loud *CLACK!* noise in the process, where you soon felt the two youthful vampire maids promptly enter and strip you of the robe you were wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like the beautifully haunting Sirens from Greek myth, you felt yourself voluntarily fall under the seductive sway of the rotund vampire countess, who curled her index finger twice and thrice in an alluring gesture, one that called out <i>\"You deserve a nice reward\"</i> in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, this all felt like something out of an erotic wet dream, just as the two vampiric maids bowed before their mistress then promptly took their leave for the time being, while you felt yourself submerging into the thick oozing pool of blood to accompany the opulent yet corpulent Carmilla, who seemed to be enjoying herself quite vividly. </span></div></div>",
