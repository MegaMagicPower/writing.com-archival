            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The town of Noell is a crazy one on nearly every street corner. Though without it's well known past time, one might expect it to be a normal town. It has a movie theater, a Cafe and restaurant, a Post office, high end schooling, and even a mall! Anyone new to the town who was innocent to their culture would have at least a few safe and innocent hours before coming into the inevitable.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough there are a few predators out there that do eat more than one prey at a time, they aren't easy to come by. For the most part preds get their fill on just one prey. At first there was a new board filled with \"missing\" people but it was always full and rarely did someone find that missing soul. The local police estimate that somewhere around 1 in every 30 meals a person is lost. Much higher than before the reformer came around when it was obviously... well... all of them. They also report that vore crimes are down 85% compared to last year with their crack down on the usage of 1st generation reformers. Those types could only reconstitute simple matter and were meant for food or other household objects. Using them now is highly illegal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe current issues up for debate in town is to force predators to ask permission before eating their prey. The issue is very clearly split down the middle as preds fear they may begin to starve and prey simply request that \"no\" or \"stop\" means just that. Until a verdict can be reached on the subject however it looks like we will just have to make due with \"The sheet\". Sorry, we suck at names most of the time... The sheet is in fact an opt-in service to match prey with preds. There is a fee for preds which goes 100% to the prey to help pay for lost time. It's a great way for prey to be more active in their community and not feel unwanted.</span></div></div>",

If you spent a while with her you would see that she also has all of the administration bowing to her whim. She was pudgy, but not massive by any means. She was very efficient when consuming her meals and made sure to only take that she needed and maybe a little bit more if she was in a bad mood. This would lead to extended digestion periods lasting at times over a week before the prey would pass out. Though even at that point they wouldn't be ready for the reformer for at least another week at the earliest.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis fact is exactly why the faculty bends to her will. They still haven't seen or heard from the spanish teacher she ate now almost a year ago. She denies every accusation of course, but some teachers have a good idea on what happened. To say anything however would mean certain demise.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Welcome to Noell. The town where no one sleeps and no one is safe. It's history rich in crime and punishment of ludicrous scales. Pirates and entrepreneurs came from all around to make a buck and a few lived to tell the tale. Pray that you don't need to be somewhere urgently as it's hard enough to get somewhere on time. Thankfully the world seems accommodating to what the world has become since the invention of the reformers. While they still have yet to make being eaten a painless experience, coming back shouldn't be all that bad. Watch your step, and be sure not to run into anyone larger than yourself or you may just end up lower on the food chain.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a world where vore is the norm certain technology needed to be put in place. Put the remains of something inside and it can be reconstituted in a new form, most notably, table scraps into new food. The basics of this technology was used to remove death from the world of vore and allow prey to feed many predators... if used properly..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNO:<br>\r\nMale on male<br>\r\nDiapers<br>\r\nEntries less than a single paragraph.<br>\r\nOption pages within option pages<br>\r\nSudden endings to a developing story unless you created it<br>\r\nBeing happy about being eaten (you can be ok with it, but it will be uncomfortable at the very least.
