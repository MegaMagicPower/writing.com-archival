What a weird life I have led so far. Growing up in \"Hells Kitchen in New York City. Then saving all the money I could earn to travel the Himalayas and study the art of hypnosis from master Q. All those years at the feet of a master Like Q.<br>\r\nNow here I am in this little town as a family therapist. Oh the fun of hypnotizing that clerk at the state office into giving me a license to practice. Practice tomfoolery laughed Zamboni in the typical bad guy laugh we have all heard before. Just then a beep went off in Zambonis office. An office that the hypnotist tricked a real therapist into believing had a heating problem. \"The Clarks are here to see you,\" the intercom buzzed. Zamboni stood. He was a tall man, a dark man, the kind of man that oozes villain. He wore a black suit with a black tie and white shirt. His hair was brushed back and slick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his face was the traditional goatee and in his ear was a gold earring. Zamboni stood behind his desk and adjusted his tie and pulled down his jacket. \"Send in the victi...I mean the family,\" Zamboni coughed. The Clarks entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was Jake the teenage son. Typical teenager age 15. He wore a wife beater t-shirt and baggy jeans. He has on a baseball cap turned backwards. Then there was Cyndi  she was 11 years old and had on some capri length pants, flip-flops, and a pink shirt with capped sleeves. The father walked in next. His name was George and he was an average sized person. He was around 5'8, slim and well groomed. He had on a button down shirt and a pair of brown loafers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was his wife Shelly. Very pretty and well kept. She was wearing a denim mini-skirt,3 inch mules and had shoulder length brown hair. She was wearing a white blouse with gold earrings in her ear. Zamboni welcomed the family in and they all sat on Zambonis black leather couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly was the first to speak. \" Dr. my family is having issues. We just can't seem to see eye to eye anymore.\" The supposed Doctor could see that Shelly was upset. He nodded and signaled for Shelly to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well for instance every time I ask my son Jake to help around the house it always turns into such an argument.\" Zamboni looked over at the young man and could see him stiffen at his mother's comments. Then George patted his wives arm and took over the narrative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Jake isn't the only issue either dear. Cyndi's grades have been slipping ever since you allowed her to have that damn iphone.\" Shelly's face blanched and she looked over at her husband. Then Cyndi jumped in. \" Dad you have no idea what it is like being my age do you know how hard it is to have a dad who is a manager at McDonalds, I mean like I am so embarrassed.\" Then Jake jumped in and pretty soon the family was in a total argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZamboni put his two fingers to his lips and whistled loudly. The shrill sound caused the family to stop and look at him. \" My good people I think I know just how to help.\" Zamboni pulled out a long golden chain. Attached to the chain was an old watch. \" Everyone look over here.\" Then Zamboni started to swing the watch and the family concentrated very hard.<br>\r\nWhat does Zamboni do?</span></div></div>",

He was supposed to catch it however...but missed, and the watch went flying over him and knocked a vase off a small table nearby, smashing it. \"Damn it!\" he grumbled. He buzzed on his intercom: \"Jeanne can you bring a dustpan and brush in please, there's been a slight mishap, nothing to worry about\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then walked over and retrieved his watch and chain, before glancing back at the entranced family sat before him. \"Haha, marvelous, a passing freight train couldn't even wake them!\" he laughed maniacally, before stopping abruptly and looking around. As with all 'unbalanced' scientists and professors, Zamboni was 'slightly' paranoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will be all Jeanne!\" Zamboni uttered to his receptionist, who showed an interest in the family when she came in to clean up. As the woman scurried out of the room, Zamboni thought what to do to 'help' this troubled family out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm!\" he sighed deeply, \"Ahh...I know!\" he then exclaimed. He knew that what he had in mind maybe not be particularly helpful, but it would be definitely be amusing. And he did love a good laugh...at other's expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZamboni....</span></div></div>",

Do you understand?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe husband and wife both nodded wearily as the new commands seeped into their brain.

Shelly went into the passenger side of the van while George took his place behind the wheel, while their kids sat in their normal positions in the back of the van.  Before going home Shelly mentioned to Goerge that she needed a few things at the nearby mall.  In a couple of days they would be hosting some friends over for supper and she was needing a pair of shoes to go with the dress she bought a few days earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge pulled the van into the parking lot and decided that since Shelly would be taking a few moments at Town Shoes, he might as well go and see if he could find a place a battery for the van.  The family had enterted the mall, when Cyndie started to pout and told her parents in a child like manner that she was hunger and needed some \"food\".  She continued with her rant and didn't notice that her parents had spaced out with no experesions on their face.  She was also unware of the hypnosis suggestion given to her parents and how they were about to act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly and George looked at each other for a moment and then without saying a word to their kids or each other.  George took Shelly's purse and then grabbed Cyndi hand. Meanwhile Shelly gave her son a nod for him to follower and the went in the opposite direction.</span></div></div>",

He looked over at cyndi and asked. \"What the he'll are we doing in a shoe store I need to get a battery for the van.\" cyndi had a sign of relief on her face. Thank goodness that her father was acting normal again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying another word George adjusted shellys purse on his shoulder then looked through it as if he owned it.

They were both normal since the key word to snap them out of their personality swap.  But while they felt normal, they didn't realize that Dr. Zamboni had given them  a minor suggestion that each time they would return to normal they would retain a minor portion of their previous hypnotised swap.  In this case Shelly felt normal, but had the desire to drive, while George would rather sit in the passenger seat.  This would also explain why George was carrying Shelly's purse on his shoulder like it was his.  In the van he placed in on the floor beside his seat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would almost get home before the heard the kids in the back seat talk amongst themsleves.  Cyndi was starving and was letting her brother know of all the food choices that she wanted to eat.  George and Shelly didn't hear her say the word food and it wasn't until Jake asked his sister \"What kind of food\" she was talking about that George and Shelly fell back into the trance.  Since Shelly was already driving and George was in the passenger seat there was nothing different that was visible to their kids.  Shelly pulled into the driveway and everyone got out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids rushed into the house while George, who had his wifes purse resting at the elbow of his forearm and hersunglasses on his head, told them to go down to the famly room in the basement while they got changed and would start dinner.  He looked over at his wife and watched Shelly stumble with the help of the 3\" mules that she was no uncomfratble with.  Geroge had the look of discust on his face.  This is a look that he was familiar with, as Shelly would use it on him whenever she thought he was being a jackass.  Shelly turned to him and just shrugged her shoulders and said \"what\".  \"I can't belive that your mocking me, by wearing my clothes.\"  George said pointing to the getup that Shelly was wearing.  She just responded by pointing to a mirror and said \"If you don't like what Im wearing wearing, then what's up with you wearing my clothes.\"  she said  as she walked away leaving George at the mirror</span></div></div>",

A pair of nylon leopard print panties. Feeling the need to get dressed quickly so that she could start getting dinner ready, George slipped his wives panties on.

So, Zamboni decided to try drastic something a bit more drastic\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce home, Miss Pam Littleton finally asked,  \u201cOut of all the boys, you want to date him?\u201d Often, Zamboni would note of Pam\u2019s distrust in men resulting from her divorce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, I love Mike, and he loves me, why can\u2019t you just be happy for me?\u201d the 19-year-old Skylar Littleton replied. Zamboni believed she was trying to grow up too fast and often urged Skylar to enjoy her youth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Why can\u2019t you just be happy for me</i>?\u201d her kid sister Zoe Littleton imitated. After a stern look from Skylar, Zoe scurried off. Unlike her sister, Zamboni noted that Zoe was far too immature and needed to do some growing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are so unbearable!\u201d Skylar gave a frustrated sigh. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be here any minute, please try not to embarrass me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam opened the door and saw Mike holding flowers. \u201cHey, Mrs. Littleton, These are for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy thank you, Mike, I will take them off your hands.\u201d He can't win me over that easily, she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar and Mike hugged each other but kept it PG as they knew others would be watching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were awkward as the four of them sat around the living room waiting for dinner to be ready. Skylar sat next to her boyfriend, giving worried glances hoping he wouldn\u2019t hate her because of her family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you like to kiss my big sister?\u201d Zoe said giggling and making kissy faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYoung lady!\u201d Pam chastised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe looked down. \u201cSorry, mummy\u201d she squeaked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long pause, Mike finally uttered, \u201cFood smells great\u201d. Suddenly, all three girls seemed to daze out. Then, Zoe spoke up, \u201cThank you, it should be ready any moment!\u201d Zoe's words were much colder than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike noticed from across the room that Mrs. Littleton was looking lovingly at him and twirling her hair. Guess the flowers worked, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe went up to finish preparing the meal. She gave Mike a stern look as she left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Zoe left the room, Mike noticed his girlfriend making funny faces at her mom. \u2018Stop, babe\u201d he whispered. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar froze again. Then she came to. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said stop,\u201d Mike said a little louder this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam now froze. When she came to, she was back to glaring at Mike. There was a crash from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMommy, I need help\u201d Zoe called from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat on earth?\u201d Pam cried out. \u201cSweetie, leave the cooking to grown-ups\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe skipped out of the kitchen, licking the pasta sauce off her fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, you are disgusting,\u201d Skylar told her little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I was hungry\u201d Zoe whined.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once again, all three seemed to freeze in time, then started up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe looked down at her saliva coated hands in disgust. She quickly cleaned herself and assisted Pam in the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Skylar sprung up to her feet and skipped to the table. \u201cI\u2019m staaarving\u201d she said holding her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cManners, miss\u201d  Zoe told her older sister as helped the overly excited teen with her dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI made your plate extra big\u201d Pam whispered to Mike and gave him a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, thanks,\u201d Mike said as he took his plate of pasta and sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike had never seen his girlfriend like this. She was struggling to get the pasta in her mouth. Instead, it kept falling off her fork or getting on her face. Normally, she would blush if he even watched her eat, but now it seemed she had no shame at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I be done?\u201d Pam looked at Zoe and Zoe nodded. Pam had hardly touched her dinner and Mike found it strange that Mrs. Littleton needed to ask her daughter for permission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar with pasta in her mouth tried to say, \u201cI\u2019ll have it if she won\u2019t\u201d Pam pushed it over to her. Skylar, who usually hardly ate a thing, moved onto her second plate of dinner and seemed to be getting the sauce all over her face and clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Zoe folded her napkin on the table, and asked, \u201cSo, Mike, do you have a job yet for this summer.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike was ready for the question, but he was not expecting who it was coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, leave him be!\u201d Pam said. \u201cLet him finish his dinner at least.\u201d She saw Mike looked out of sorts and mouthed \u201cSorry\u201d to him. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m ready for dessert!\u201d Skylar smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me clean you first, dear,\u201d Zoe said. Zoe damped a napkin and came to wipe her older sister\u2019s face. \u201cStop moving so I can clean you\u201d All three once again froze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, I am covered in pasta. This is so nasty!\u201d Skylar said and she grabbed the napkin from Zoe. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was funny to see the reaction on both sides, but he wanted to do something special for these two. A mother walking around dressed as a teenage boy would be great only it had been done before. \"Hmmmmm\" the doctor though then snapped his fingers. As he did both mother and son fell into a trance. \"I am going to switch you two but it will not take affect until you are home. Unlike your daughter and husband. You will leave my office feeling unchanged until you enter the house, that's when you will both start to feel very strange and uncomfortable. You will enter the others bedroom and wear their pajamas during the day, and at night when your going to bed, dress in the others day clothes.\" This made the doctor very horny and couldn't wait to see them again for their next appointment.

George's manhood was no match for the flimsy material of his daughters thong and was causing a massive tent to grow in the front of his skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly held George's hand and lead him to the front door where she fished out the keys for the front door. The kids entered the house as their parents did. George adjusted his (daughters) bra and winked at Shelly. \" I will see you upstairs missy.\" Shelly smiled and giggled. \" Just let me pick up a little and I will be right up there lover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time the two children were getting bored. \" Geez, can't you guys tone it down.\" George's daughter said rolling her eyes. Not realizing how bizarre she looked standing in her fathers clothes. She began undoing her fathers belt and walking upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy, that skirt does flatter your figure.\" Cindi stated as they reached the top of the stairs.<br>\r\nMeanwhile a weird feeling came over Shelly and Jake. There clothes seemed to become very itchy. Jake couldn't put his finger on it but he knew he needed to change clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis original thoughts were to turn on the TV and watch the game. Unfortunately, the itching was turning into a mild burning. He darted upstairs nearly falling as he pulled his shirt over his head. By the time he got upstairs he had his pants off and was wearing his tidy whites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncontrollably, he headed into his parents bedroom. Thankfully his father was in the tub. Jake didn't know it but his father was shaving his legs and using his mothers shampoo and soap. George thought,\"I like Shelly's soaps and all, but I really need to check out what Cindi has in her bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jake had gone through his mother's lingerie drawer. He was amazed at how all of a sudden he knew where she kept all of her intimate apparel. When Jake was done he was dressed in a nylon pair of his mom's panties. They were beige or flesh toned. For some reason that Jake could not comprehend, he knew that the beige color would not show through the powder blue gown, that he found himself wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gown was one his mother wore often and it smelled like her. As a matter of fact after he put on the panties he walked across the room and put the same nightie on that was left on Shelly's bed. The gown reached Jakes ankles and for some unknown reason he did a twirl. The swept around him and this caused a pleasurable breeze across his posterior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then slipped on his mothers slippers and headed back downstairs to watch the game. As he walked the gown flowed behind him and he felt his penis stiffen a bit against the nylon of the panties. He spied his own mother coming out of his room wearing his old boxers and his Derek Jetter t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, mom is it alright if I pop some popcorn?\" His mom paused,\"Jake I just finished cleaning the kitchen, make sure you don't leave a mess.\" The two acted as if nothing was unusual about the fact they were both in each others night clothes.</span></div></div>",

He moved closer to Jake, and his eyes began to follow the singing chain Zomboni had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are quite sure that your mother has things easy. Maybe she does, maybe she doesn't. You should learn for yourself what a mother like her has to go through. You will slowly dedicate yourself to acting like a mother should, preparing yourself in the right way of course. When you get home, try cooking for your family and make them feel welcome. Try one some of your mom's clothes and try to see the world like a mother should\" said Zomboni. Jake nodded, and Zomboni then walked over to Shelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for you Shelly, the life of a teenager is rough, especially for a boy. You should learn your son's life and what he goes through on a daily basis. Take a break from your hard work as a mother and enjoy yourself for once. Put on your son's clothes and try to let yourself loose for once.\" said Zomboni, getting a nod from Shelly. He then walked over to George.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"George, you didn't have that good of a life growing up. Your siblings always getting better things than you and everything. Your little daughter has quite the life and you should learn it better if you want to forge a better relationship with her. Try something like taking a bath or watching her kind of TV shows. Maybe even try one of her dresses\" said Zomboni, getting a small nod from George. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZomboni then walked over to Cyndi. Initially, he was going to change her into an older man to complete the set. However, her quote about wantinga cat over a brother gave him an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cyndi, you really like pets, right? It's unfortunate that you don't have one. You'd like the idea of having a cat in your home, correct? Well, if you want a cat, you should try to get inside the head of one. Try to see things from their view and show that your home is a good one for a cat. When you get home, try some of their food if you can. Perhaps even try sleeping on the floor. It will help\" said Zomboni, getting a nod from Cyndi as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is what all of you should do. Once this is over, you will feel the need to come back for our next session next Sunday\" said Zomboni, knowing that today was Sunday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, he snapped his fingers again, bringing the family back to their senses.</span></div></div>",

He omitted the part about him getting all he wanted out of the session, the manipulation of others. He smiled as he saw the family exit his office, Jake in the lead, then his father George with Cyndi walking...and sometimes crawling around his legs, and Shelly at the back, dragging her feet. It hadn't taken long for the family to slip into their new roles, in fact even Dr Zamboni was amazed at how fast it had happened. \"Mom...I can't wear these stupid things!\" Shelly grumbled, as he gestured down to her high heeled mules. She also tugged uncomfortably at the denim skirt she wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it just so happens I don't like what I'm wearing either. What possessed me to put these 'things' on today I don't know!\" Jake responded, pulling on his own clothes. Tell you what sweetie,\" he then said, \"there's an empty room over there, we can exchange clothes and we'll both be happier\" he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool!\" his mother grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, the clothes swap with complete, and although they didn't fit perfectly, they would do. George, now with the personality of his 11-year old daughter Cyndi, picked up their pet (Cyndi herself) and followed Jake and Shelly out of the building and to their car. \"Get in the car you three!\" Jake sighed, as he himself got behind the streering wheel and put the key in the ignition. Usually it was Shelly's job to drive the car, but now that Jake had assumed his mother's role, it was his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive home was uneventful.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The family would wait for him no matter how long it took.  They wouldn't even mind that their session had gone over.  \"Sure,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, There are these two kids at my school, they are from the same family but they are both messed up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow so, well the younger one, Patricia is...well I don't know how to put it easily, well she is the class slut.  She is five foot two and only fifteen years old, but she is build like a brick outhouse.  She has huge breasts and a big round ass.  She has great body and she knows how to use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is the problem with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She flirts constantly with everyone and the way she dresses is a big distraction in class.  Everything she wears is too tight and too short.  Except for her heels, they are way too high.  If she is not flirting the is spending her time fixing her makeup.  It's just awful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Zamboni thought now this is a girl I want to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is this a family problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting to that.  Her brother, William is the class bully.  He is seventeen years old and over six foot two and two hundred and twenty pounds of pure muscle.  He picks on everyone.  He has even stolen from many of the other students but everyone is afraid to say anything about it.  He has sent a couple of students to the hospital, but I can't prove it since no one is willing to testify.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how is this a family problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Patricia prefaced her remarks with, \"in my opinion, it's because of their parents.  I met them, their father, William senior is a failed football star.  He is big like his son, but he blew out his knee before making it big and had to take a job in a factory.  He seems to be ignoring his family.  He married a cheerleader, Serena who isn't very smart and is fighting a losing battle with time to maintain her looks.  Between the two of them they haven't time for their kids who are acting up trying to find the love the can't have at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia is equating male attention and sex with boys fort love and the only way for William to feel good is by putting down other boys.

But that didn't mean he was going to stop.  It made him feel strong as Dr. Zamboni knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that is the symptom not the reason.  The reason you are getting into trouble is because you are looking for attention from your father.  Is that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is, I know it.  But being strong and getting into fights isn't working for you is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't and you have got to stop because you will never get the love you want from your father that way.

You have to use a new tact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to try something else.  You will try something else, something you have always really wanted to do but you were afraid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was afraid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but you don't have to be afraid anymore of what your father thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have to be afraid anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you don't want to be a bully.  You don't want to hurt anyone.  If you can't get the love you want from your father then you can get the love you want from other boys.  You have always wanted that.\"  William was silent taking all this in.  Continuing Dr. Zamboni said, \"You want to be happy and outgoing.  You want to flirt with every boy you see.  You and to have a pretty smile and to show off your body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have such a great body, but you want and need to show it off.  You will pick clothing that is very tight and very sexy.  Men's clothes can't very do that for you.  They cover too much and they are so limiting.  You want to wear a wide variety of fabrics and clothing that will show off your body.  Only women's clothing does this and you have always known that you wanted to wear them.  Men's clothing is too rough for you now.  You had only worn them in the first place to impress your dad, but you don't care about that anymore.  It's time to only wear pretty clothes in he styles you have always really liked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at your breasts,\" William had a strong chest.  \"You are so proud of it.  You want to show them off, but you can't show them off wearing men's clothing you don't have to anymore.  You need slow cut tops with spaghetti straps and everything else.  Your breasts need to be supported by bras.  But no one wants to see your pretty breasts if they are hairy.  You'll have to shave it off.  You hate all the hair on your body, except on your head.  There you want your hair long and stylish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And look at your legs, you want to show them off,  Skirts and dresses will let the world see your shapely legs.  Not only that but heels make make your legs longer with is much better.  You know your legs look great, except for that hair again, it has got to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My hair has got to go,\" William repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Zamboni went over every aspect of William's body explaining why women's clothing would look and feel better on him.  Dr. Zamboni emphasized clothing that was tight, short and would be revealing on a sexy girl's body.  Dr. Zamboni continued, \"You have such a good looking smile and you want to smile all the time because you will feel good.  But your smile will look even better if you wear lipstick.  That is what lipstick is for to make your smile look good.  But if you are going to wear lipstick with you certainly want to, you must go all the way and wear makeup all the time.  You need to start with a foundation with will make your face look smoother and then use blush and makeup for the eyes.  You must check your makeup often, maybe every ten minutes and fix any flaw you find.  Only by keeping your makeup, hair and apparel perfect will you be able to make boys like you.  That is what you truly want.  Do you know how you can tell if boys like you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If a boy goes to bed with you then you know he likes you.  That is the only way to know for sure. You want to know for sure.  Touching, kissing, groping and even licking are good, but the only way to know for sure if if you sleep with them.  You need every boy to like you and will do everything you can to do so.  You will flirt with everyone all in an effort to get all boys to like you. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want all boys to like me,\" he said.  This was true in some sense all his life.  He bullied people because of insecurity not because of strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think of the girls you find sexiest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you see how they walk, hear how they talk and see how they dress?  You need to be just like them...maybe even sexier if you can be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to be like them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get up and show me how you move.\"  William got out of his chair and walked around the room, it looked ridiculous.  \"You don't walk with strength any more, you walk with balance and grace putting one foot in front of the other.\"  Dr. Zamboni gave William some more pointers and his stride still looked ridiculous because of who was doing it but now it looked like the walk of a genuine sexy woman not a parody of one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Zamboni then worked on William's attitude making him avoid all things masculine especially fighting, but if he did need to defend himself he couldn't punch anyone, the best he could do is slap someone with his elbows near his body, or maybe scratch someone with his nails or pull hair.  Anything that resembled how he fought before was gone from his personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Zamboni thought he was done with William.  He was sure that the former bully would now act like a bimbo and want to be class slut of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he turned his attention on Patricia.</span></div></div>",

They had been referred to the office by one of their friends, although neither could say exactly who it was.  They weren't even sure if it was Sarah's friend or Ben's friend.  In truth, Dr. Zamboni had arranged for these two to visit his office himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was a momma's boy to his manipulative mother.  When Sarah's husband died about eight years ago, Sarah convinced Ben who was between jobs at the time to move in with her.  Now the thirty-five year old Ben didn't even think of leaving the house he was sharing with his mother.  Even though he has an MBA he is now working as an assistant manager at a Walmart being paid very little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah who is sixty, doesn't need to work at all since she was taken care of quite well by her deceased husband's life insurance  The two had been co-dependents every since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was wearing his usual attire of a large t-shirt and sweat pants along with sneakers and white socks.  He was taller than his mother of course at five foot nine, but relatively thing.  His hair was much longer than it should be.  He had the look of a person who just doesn't care about anything.  He would rather just do what was easiest than to buck the trend.  This is why he was living with his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was wearing knit pants with an elastic waist and a knit long-sleeved top.  It wasn't stylish at all.  She wore sneakers without laces and nude ankle length stockings on her feet.  She wore a bra more out of habit than out of need and her breasts were just an A cup.  Her hair was longer than Ben's but it hung loosely down her shoulders and was starting to grey.  Much like her bra, she wore lip stick more out of habit than out of a desire to look good.  All in all, she looked much older than her sixty years.  The few stray hairs that grew on her face didn't help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach had spent time talking separately with Dr. Zamboni.  He had put them under in their private sessions and now they were both awake.  Although they both had instructions to listen to the Doctor and when they got home swap identities and follow the suggestions that he made for the other one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ben let me start with you,\" Zamboni said.  \"You are not living up to your potential.  You need to get out of your mother's house and find a new apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I don't make enough money to do that,\" Ben protested on cue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of my patients wants to spend more time with his family.  He is looking for someone to manage his business.  I think that job will be just perfect for you.  You can start with a new job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but you have to give up your defeatist attitude and that will start with a whole new wardrobe.  If you look good you will feel good.  So throw out all the clothes you own and get new ones.  But not the type of stuff you have been wearing, get some new suits.  Get shirts with buttons and collars, you need dress everything, dress suit, dress slacks, dress shirts, dress socks, and dress shoes.  Even when you are relaxing, you need to wear dockers and clothes with style.  Try polo shirts instead of t-shirts.  And look at your hair, cut it short and professional.  With these clothes and a new job and apartment, women will flock to you.  But it all starts with confidence.  Think you are the 'Cock of the Walk' and every one else will too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try,\" Ben said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't try, DO!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, you look and act like an old lady.  You are not an old lady, you are a vibrant mature woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you just have to fix yourself up.  Just like I told Ben, it all starts with attitude. You are a vibrant woman so act like it.  When you are around men, flirt with them.  They will respond.  Of course you will also have to get a new wardrobe too.  Get rid of everything you have and buy clothing for a vibrant mature woman like you. It starts with the lingerie, buy pretty under things.  But besides that there is nothing with with helping mother nature.  Get bras with padding to give your top a little boost.  There is nothing with with a padded girdle to help your lower regions and maybe a corset to smooth your middle.  No more knits, they make you look old.  Buy blouses and tops in smooth and soft fabrics in vibrant colors.  They should be bold like you, but not trashy.  If it's not winter, try tops with shorter sleeves or no sleeves at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy being sixty, if you do people will think you are fifty.  You shouldn't wear pants either, pants are for the very old and the very young.  You should always wear a pretty skirt or dress.  I'm sure you have wonderful legs you should wear some heels to show them off.   But you are sixty, the heels shouldn't be too high.  Also you should always wear stocking or pantyhose.  When was the last time you shaved your legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a mistake, you should remove all your body hair and on your face.  And how can a lady such as yourself leave the house without makeup.  A little lipstick is not enough.  Foundation, powder, rouge, eye liner, mascara etc should always be used.  Not only when you are going out but even if you are staying home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you are right, but I have been so lazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well stop that.  Look at your hair, you need to have it colored and permed.  While you are are the beauty parlor you should have the nails done too.  If you look good you will feel good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it!\" Sarah said enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And once you look good for the world, you should go out and do things.  I speak regularly at a center for mature people such as yourself.  You should come down and join the fun.  Spend time with people your age, you might even meet a man or two there who will like the new you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two left Dr. Zamboni's office full of energy ready to start their new life.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ben and Sarah left the office and arrived home.  They didn't talk much on the way, instead they thought about what Dr. Zamboni told them.  Once inside their home, Ben didn't think he was Ben anymore he thought he was Sarah.  He went up to Sarah's room and then into her bathroom to look at himself.  he didn't like what he saw.  He needed a lot of work. He didn't know how he left the house wearing no makeup at all.  He thought he put on some lipstick, but it must have totally rubbed off by the time he returned home.  Looking at his drab clothing, it didn't do a thing for him.  He took off his shirt and saw his hairy arms and arm pits.  He didn't remember the last time he shaved them but he would do it tonight when he took a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I need so much work, why torture myself,\" he thought.  \"Let me at least take a shower and then go from there.\"  Returning to Sarah's room, Ben looked for something to wear.  There were plenty of tops and pants, but nothing he really liked.  They wouldn't help his figure at all.  It didn't matter that he didn't plan to go out the rest of that day.  It was too late to get anything done.  He wanted to look presentable in case anyone stopped by.  He found some nylon panties.  They weren't the 'sexiest' but it was the best he could do.  He owned a padded bra.  It didn't match the panties he selected, but until he bought something they would have to do also.  He picked a skirt and a blouse in the brightest colors he could find.  Then he took his apparel and went back into the bathroom to take a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce naked in the shower, he took out a razor and shaved all his hair off.  That had to be done first.  He just couldn't stand the hair.  It was all over him and he didn't know why he waited that long to remove it all.  True it couldn't been seen under long shirts and pants, but that was no reason to allow it to stay.  After washing, he realized how dry his skin was and found some moisturizer to spread all over his newly hairfree body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce done he wrapped a towel around himself and again looked in the mirror.  It was better but his hair was just awful.  It was long, but Dr. Zamboni was right, he should color it to a nice blonde and have it permed.  Next he found his makeup and tried to apply it.  He couldn't get it right.  He thought that he hadn't used it in so long that he must have forgotten.  He would have to learn it again.  But with a little foundation which wasn't that hard to apply his face looked much smoother.  Of course he put on too much but it was better than nothing.  He quickly put on some lipstick, blush and eye shadow.  He realized he would have to brush up on how to put on makeup from the Internet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he was done he came down to make dinner.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah entered the house thinking she was Ben.  She went off to her room to look for something 'nice' to wear.  She started to look for a pair of boxers.  But all she found were briefs.  Not only that but most of her briefs were very worn.  It took some digging to find the brief that was the least worn.  At least this pair didn't have any holes in it.  Next she looked for some 'nice' pants but found mostly jeans and sweat pants.  There were also some pants that she wore for work.  She found the best of those and put them on.  They were tight around the hips but loose at the waist.  She had to use a belt to keep her pants up.  Not that that helped much since they were way too long and had to be folded to make cuffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a similar problem when it came to finding a proper shirt.  T-shirts abounded, but shirts with buttons were hard to find.  Dr. Zamboni was right, how was she going to get a job when she didn't even own any proper clothes.  Black socks were the easiest to find but her shoes were too big.  She decided to finish the look with a tie.  It seemed that even the neck hold on her shirt was too big for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her face, she noticed her lips were a bit red.  She reasoned it must have come from something she ate.  She washed the makeup off her face and then looked at her hair.  Her hair was in her opinion very long.  After tomorrow she decided it would never be long again and certainly not as long as it now was.  Her hair was greying, but she thought it would give her a distinguished look for her new job.  She was gong to cut her hair very short.  Probably tightly cut on the sides and no more than a half inch long on the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was dressed, she found some garbage bags and took all her old clothes and threw them haphazardly in.  She saved one outfit for tomorrow when she would buy a new wardrobe, but everything else was thrown in the trash.</span></div></div>",

In the other reality he never helped Sarah do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What has gotten onto you young man?\" Ben said. \"Oh can't a industrious son help his mother set the table?\" Sarah said with a grin. She took the silverware from Ben's hands and placed them where they would sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was so impressed he sashayed back to start serving dinner. Again Sarah surprised him by leading him to the table to sit. \"Look Ma you take a load off I'll start serving us.\" Sarah said. \"Well I do declare.\" Ben smiled. \"Maybe going to a therapist was a good thing.\" Ben said smoothing out his skirt and sitting down in a feminine fashion.</span></div></div>",

I want to find a new apartment.  I want to find a woman and get married.  I have been here too long.  It's time to move on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.  I think the doctor is right.  I just want to say that it was all my fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your fault?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes son.  After your father died I just felt so lonely.  I knew I should have encouraged you to go on, but I just couldn't do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could have left if I wanted to.  It wasn't your fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But a mother should do what is best for her son.\"  Ben said with emotion in his voice.  \"I didn't do that.  I should have kicked you out long ago.  I shouldn't have let you stay so long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, it wasn't your fault,\" Sarah insisted.  The two stood up and hugged each other.  They both knew that this was a turning point in their relationship and in their own lives.  Both would move on from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen would stop acting like an old lady.  He would fix himself up.  Buy new fashionable apparel (clothes appropriate for a middle aged woman).  He knew he wasn't a young girl anymore, he would need help to look good.  He knew he would need a padded girdle to whip his butt into shape.  He would also have to find a padded bra to help with his little girls on top.  He might need a corset to put it all together too.  He didn't care that it might be uncomfortable.  The pain would be worth it.  He would also start wearing makeup all the time.  He didn't quite remember all the tricks he used to know, but he was sure there would be tutorials on the Internet.  He would start to look for new mature friends.  He wanted people to go out with.  People who liked the same things as he liked.  The same 'old' movies and he had always liked crafts.  he didn't know when he quit but he would start anew.  But even more than that card games and socializing with the ladies sounded like so much fun.  He wanted to live again.  The best years were a head of him.  Just because you belong to AARP doesn't mean you are ready for the retirement home and death.  If all went well he would find a nice gentleman caller and maybe get married 'again.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was also making plans in her head.  She would go to the job interview that Dr. Zamboni had set up.  It was in a couple of days and so she had time to get an entirely new wardrobe.  She really had little choice in the matter anyway, she must have lost weight since all her professional clothing was too big for her.  (She didn't consider that they were too long also.)  She would get a professional looking haircut.  She would cut her hair short like they did in the marines.  She liked that look and it would project confidence as she was applying for a managerial position.  Once she had a job, she would find an apartment.  That might take a while, but she was determined to do it.  In the mean time she hadn't remembered the last time she had a date, she would reenter the single scene.  Eventually she would get married, but to start she just wanted feminine company.  She was feeling particularly virile right now and she would probably start with some casual relationships.  She needed to get laid in the worse way.  Sarah had told her son about her plans, but she left the getting laid part out.  The days of telling her mother everything were gone.</span></div></div>",

He thought he had just forgotten since he hadn't done it in such a long time.  He started with the basics and then looked at videos which showed the more advanced techniques.  He stuck to the basics, but every video he saw said that make-up started with foundation.  You would never look as good as you could without putting on foundation first.  It also said on the other hand that putting on too much foundation wasn't good either.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, Ben had to shave his face again and then he put on just enough foundation to hide any stubble that might appear.  Ben resolved to have all the hair on his face removed by electrolysis.  Then he used the techniques that he learned to put on the rest of his makeup.  He had all the supplies, but not the right color for his skin tone.  He would have to go to the dollar store and buy new make-up.  It was best to buy it there because it was cheap and it might take a while to find what worked well on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was done, he made an appointment with the hair dressers.  It was a good thing the appointment was in the afternoon, because he had to go to a shoe store first.  Besides not being fashionable enough, none of his shoes fit him. He spent almost two hours looking over and buying new shoes for himself.  The saleswoman looked at him oddly but Ben didn't mind.  He actually enjoyed looking through the dozens of pairs of shoes he saw.  He wanted something stylish, but nothing for old ladies or for young women.  There was a balancing act in everything he selected.  He didn't want to be an 'old lady' anymore, but that is no reason to dress like a 'kid' either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted his hair washed, colored and permed.  He brought in a magazine article with a picture of what he wanted.  The stylist said his hair was too short for that, but she said if they added extensions it she could make it work.  Ben agreed.  The hair doo took all day, but in the end he loved the look.  There wasn't time to shop for a new wardrobe, but at least he could now walk around in properly fitting fashionable shoes and his hair was very pretty..</span></div></div>",

Not only that but the sleeves on her shirts were too long as well as the length of her pants.  She had to make cuffs for them to fit and wear a belt to keep them from falling down.  She brushed her hair back and left the house to find a new style.  She wanted to have a very professional masculine look.  She started with her hair which she cut very short in a marine style.  Her hair was greying, but she thought the grey gave her a mature dignify look that she liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe haircut didn't take very long and soon she was looking for apparel.  She started with boxer shorts.  She thought that boxers were more mature than briefs.  She never want to wear briefs again.  Next she looked for shoes.  Her old shoes much have stretched since they seemed too big for her feet.  She bought dress shoes and loafers.  All of her shoes had to have laces, she didn't want anything that slipped on at all.  She also didn't want to wear any sneakers.  She preferred loafers instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she found shoes she could walk in, she set out to find some suits for her interview.  That was the most important thing right now.  She bought several business suits.  She would pick them up in a week as they had to be professionally fitted, but she did get one that was off the rack for her interview tomorrow.  All of her shirts had to have buttons and collars even the casual shirts.  The most casual of her shirts were polo shirts.  Her socks had to be black, brown or dark blue.  Everything she bought whether for business or for a more casual setting had to project a strong masculine no non-sense appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day she met with Mr. Newton.  Mr. Newton owned a chain of parking garages.  He wanted someone to manage them.  Sarah in her navy blue male business suit entered Mr. Newton's office.  Mr. Newton was a girl about eight or nine years old.  She was also wearing a suit, but not as expensive as the one Sarah was wearing.  Mr. Newton owned the business, he didn't have to impress anyone.  His hair was combed in a professional matter and he looked a bit haggard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome,\" Mr. Newton said.  \"Dr. Zamboni recommends you quite highly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think a great deal about Dr. Zamboni too.  He is a great doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Newton went over Sarah's qualifications, but it was all a formality.  If Dr. Zamboni recommended her, then she must be good.  Dr. Zamboni's opinion was highly respected by both of them.  After the formal part of the interview was over and Sarah got the job, Mr. Newton started to tell Sarah about himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My family and I were patients of Dr. Zamboni.  I was working too hard.  I wasn't spending enough time with my family.  That is why I am hiring you.  I want you to run the day to day operations of the business and report to me.  I'll spend most of my time at home only coming in once a week or so.  But I'll leave the heavy lifting to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am honored for you to have that much faith in me,\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you are certainly qualified.  My wife has gone back to work and my daughter is in the third grade.  I want to be home to drop her off at school and pick her up.  They are the light of my life, want to see them?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Newton took out a couple of picture from his wallet to show Sarah.  \"This is my wife at her new job.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked at the picture and saw a slightly overweight woman in her early forties.  She was wearing a micro-bikini and pasties and very high heels.  Her face was covered in way too much make-up.  \"Your wife is very pretty,\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes thank you.  She has been complaining about wanting to go back to work for some time now.  After seeing  Dr. Zamboni she has returned to work.  She is a stripper at a club downtown.  She just loves it.  But she works late and that makes it hard for her to take our daughter to school in the morning.  I'll do that.  Want to see a picture of my daughter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked at a picture that Mr. Newton said was his daughter.  It was obviously one of those pictures that a school takes of it's students.  The background was of a meadow.  The figure in the picture was dressed in a white juvenile dress with puffed sleeves and a round neck.  The subject of the  picture was a man nearing fifty.  His hair was parted in the middle with two pig tails hanging down in the back.  He had a big toothy grin which showed not only his upper teeth, but his lower teeth also.  He had a very slight five o'clock shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is the love of my life,\" Mr. Newton said.  \"She is in the third grade and very smart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She looks just like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, she is daddy's little girl.  I love her to death.  I am going to spend much more time with her.  Do you have any children?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No not yet, but I want children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't wait too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Newton told Sarah that she would start on Monday.  The two said their goodbyes.  Sarah left the office happy as a clam.  That night, Sarah got dressed up and headed for a single's club.  She was brimming  with confidence after landing the job.  She wanted to celebrate and if she found some female company to help her celebrate all the better.</span></div></div>",

Ben thought it would be a great idea to meet some new people 'his own age' and so he got dressed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now he had bought new apparel.  He started with panty briefs with a marching bra.  The bra was padded, but he stuffed additional panties in the cups to give him the illusion of a bigger cup size.  Next he put on a padded panty-girdle to help his bottom shape too.  Over that he wore nude pantyhose.  Finally he decided upon a blouse with a matching skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting make-up took him almost an hour.  He wasn't confident in his abilities and sometimes had to wash off what he had and reapply it to get the look he wanted.  He wasn't worried about looking sexy for his new friends, all he wanted to do was look presentable.  He was getting better at his make-up application skills, but that would take time.  Also he had started electrolysis on his face, but that would take many sessions until all trace of stubble would be gone.  Until then he used more foundation than he should to keep this stubble hidden.  He thought he looked pretty good considering, when he was done.  The final steps were a purse with matching shoes and jewelry.  The jewelry was the only parts of his outfit which he had own for several years, although he hadn't wore in much recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe senior center that Dr. Zamboni was referring to was actually the recreation room of a nursing home.  Dr. Zamboni had taken control over the entire nursing home.  He liked it because it was a closed place.   There weren't many visitors and everyone who worked there had a fixed schedule.  He could make any changes he wanted.  The staff could be swapped with the patients.  Men could be swapped with women?  Visitors could come and stay as patients.  he had total control over everyone and no one from the outside would suspect a thing.  It was a perfect testing ground for the good doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen arrived at the 'senior center.'</span></div></div>",

Julia replyed the they had cancelled and in their place was a young couple who had just walked in and the woman was really emotional and wondered if Dr. Zamboni would have some time to help them.  Dr. Zamboni told Julia that to send them in and he got up to receive them at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula was the first to enter with her fiance Tom a step behind.  Paula was dressed in dark denim strech jeans with a flowy flower printed chifon blouse.  On her feet was a pair of flat brown riding boots.

Tom had followed her into the room, he was a year older at 26 and had a similar build to his fiance Paula. He stood an inch and half taller than Paula and was slender for a man. He wore a black blazer over a green t-shirt, and faded jeans and a pair of addida retro sneakers on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey exchanged hand shakes with one another in the center of the room before Zamboni offered them a seat to discuss why they were here.  The words had just left Zamboni's lips when Paula started to ramble about Tom and his lack of understanding about her, her family and their upcoming wedding.  The more she talked the more animated she got and the more upset she became.  Tom and her would be married in less than two weeks and she wasn't sure that she could go through with it knowing that Tom didn't understand what this day meant to her.  She continued telling the Dr that she had looked forward to this day since she was a little girl and it seemed that Tom just didn't care.

She would often have to tell Tom how to dress and she was wishing that he would dress better, as she pointed to his green t-shirt that she reached over and opend the blazer to discover a green lantern screen.  Tom shot back that he was comfortable with his clothing choices and as far as the wedding was concerened he was looking forward to it, but would just as soon go to Vegas for a quick weeding instead of the big wedding that Paula's parents were planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZamboni listened for a few more minutes, and then offered the coupl the idea of hynosis as a form of treatment that may help the couple understand each other more.  In oder for this to work however, he was going to need to see them every 3 days until they're wedding.  Paula agreed right away and was anxious to start.  She elbowed Tom in the ribs for him to speak up and reluctantly agreed that he was on board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple both sat on the sofa with theit hands on the lap and they're feet spread shoulder width apart.  Dr Zamboni talked with a soothing voice and counted down from ten to zero for the couple to be under the influence of Zamboni's suggestions.  He spoke to them about needing to understand each other better and thought to himself that it seemed cleshay, but he was going to have them start by walking litteraly in each other shoes. With each passing day they would become more comfortable with they're new footwear, and by day 3 Tom would wear Paula's highest heels  to the next session.  Tom will obtain Paula's Shoe obsesion, and Paula will start to view fashion like Tom and have no disire to wear high heels or womens shoes in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZamboni was fomulating the plan he had for the couple and kept thinking of what he could do prior to their wedding.  Paula and Tom were still under his spell when Zamboni started to wrap up the session, he told the couple that when they came too that they would imediatley take off their footwear and put on the proper shoes.  He told them that on day 2 they would feel the desire to exchange all undergarment, and then on day 3 before they returned they would exchange all jewellery including Paula's engagement ring.  With that he began to count backward from 10 to 1 and slowly woke the couple up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She thought why am I wearing such painful,and horrible footwear. Paula looked up at the doctor and noticed he was smiling at her. \"Is there a problem my dear?\" Paula wasn't sure but she felt like she needed to ask a question. \"I want to take off these boots.\" the doctor nodded knowingly. \"Why by all means please do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a giant look of relief on her face Paula pulled the boots off revealing a manicured foot with pink painted toe nails and encased in nylons.

Just then Tom looked at the boots on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom smiled brightly and picked up Paula's boots. Tom anxiously removed the black, torn, chuck taylors he wore. On his feet were a pair of white socks with a few holes in them.

She seemed happy that her future husband was going to take a step toward being more fashionable. \"Sure honey go for it.\" then like a kid who is opening up a Christmas present Tom took the boots and slid his feet into them. Surprisingly thet were a little snug but Tom thought that by walking a bit in them they would be \" broken\" in. He then tucked his jeans inside of the boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he asked Paula,\"Well babe are you ready?\" he said this as he was walking around the office breaking in his shoes.

She noticed Paula's shoes and commented that wasn't what she expected a person of such great style like Paula to wear.  Paula just shrugged her shouldera and told Susan that they are comfortable and that's what mattered.  Susan looked perplexed at this coment and looked over at Tom.  He was standing behind Paula making it difficult for her to see what he was wearing on his feet.  The elvevator stopped on their floor and they wished Susan a good day as they left and proceeded to their room.  Susan took a careful look at Tom shoes and was certain that he was wearing Women's flat riding boots, in fact they look just like the ones that she had seen Paula wear.  Susan wanted to say something but the door closed and she was on her way up to her floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened to their 10th floor condo.  Tom went over to the bench and sat down in order to take off Paula's riding boots.  Meanwhile Paula had slipped off Tom's sneakers and went to their bedroom were she took off her jeans in order to take off the nylons she had on.  They didn't feel right, expecially wearing Tom's sneakers.  She walked over to Tom's dresser and grabbed a pair of his athletic socks and put them on her feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom had finished taking off the boots and found a pair of Paula's ballet flat to wear around the house.  He normally would never wear shoes in the house, this was always something that Paula did.  He didn't ask her like he did at Dr Zamboni's office.  He was starting to think that all of Paula's shoes were now his own.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula had her head in the fridge was looking for something to eat.  Not finding anything she grabbed the jug of orange juice and took a drank right out of the container.  Tom looked over at her and rolled his eyes and told her that she's just like a pig.  This comment didn't go over well and caused another argument.  This tim it was Tom doing most of the talking.  Mentioning alot of what Paula had previously said ot Zamboni's office.  Paula did her best to calm Tom down.  Telling him that she was excited to be getting married and was looking forward to the dress fiting she had in a couple of days.  Tom took a deep breath to regain composure and told his fiance that if it was alright with her, he would like to go with her.  In the back of his mind he was thinking that he didn't trust Paula's fashion sense to buy an elegant dress.</span></div></div>",

Tom stood as if to go answer it when he saw Paula trudge into the kitchen to get the cordless phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello\" Paula said speaking into the phone. Tom noticed that Paula had changed into his no that's not right her boxer shorts. God that woman really has no  idea or sense of style thought Tom.  What a bohemian to traipses around in ones underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom sat back down and opened his magazine. He kept one ear open to hear Paula's conversation. As Tom was reading he admired the cute ballet flats that were on his feet. Tom could hear Paula saying, \"Aw mom you really think it's going to take 2hours?\" Tom did a slight cough at hearing that. Doesn't she realize how important a bridal dress is? Tom turned and glanced at Paula. She is so silly not to realize how lucky she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Tom heard Paula say,\" I don't know..white I guess. What? I didnt realize there was so many shades of white.\" Tom was beginning to become very upset plus hus sports magazine did not seem so interesting any more. He placed his magazine neatly into the magazine rack and walked into the kitchen. He enjoyed the sound his ballet flats made as he walked across the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he entered the kitchen he noticed Paula had pulled a chair from the dinning room and was sitting in it. She had her legs spread and was scratching her stomach with her shirt pulled up. Tom walked over to her and put nothin hands on his hips. \"Tell your mother to hold on.\" Paula looked up at him then said ,\" Mom hold on Tom has something to tell me.\"  Tom glared at her and said. \"Paula I cannot believe how you are acting. Do you realize how lucky you are to get the chance to pick out a dress? And not only a dress but a bridal dress, the dress that will define you as a woman.\" Paula stood up with her hand over the phone receiver and said, \" Look Tom I am so board with all this dress business. If you think it is so important why don't you go try on the dress.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Paula handed the phone to Tom and she went into the front room and sat down and turned on the the TV. Tom held the phone to his ear and spoke to his soon to be mother-in-law. \" Hey, darlene.\" \"Yes this is tom. Look I will make sure Paula is ready. No everything is fine we just came back from visiting a therapist.\" before long Tom was on the phone with Paula's mom for about 45 minutes. When he hung up he had a determination to make sure Paula was ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked into their bedroom went over to Paula's side of the bed and pulled out all of her bridal magazines. Two things occurred to him. One he never spoke with Darlene all that much and he just spent forty five minutes on the phone with her. And two his wife would be the most beautiful bride ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom walked into the front room he turned off the television and plopped all of Paula's magazines on the coffee table.

It wasn't that she was bored with the details, she just no longer thought that the dress was a big deal.  She was sitting on the sofa and was flipping throgh the channel trying to find Gossip Girl.  Usually she liked to watch it to see what they were wearing, but today she just wanted to follow the story.  Tom sat beside looking through the magazine, trying to show Paula pages of dresses that Tom thought would look cute on her.  Every once in  awhile he would lift his head to see what was on.  Gossip Girl was never a show that he watched but he found himself looking at the fashions that the actresses that played Blair and Serena were wearing.  In fact he recognized a couple of items that Paula wore being shown on the television.  Tom never new that Paula took many fashions tips from Gossip Girl.  Tom in particular looked at the shoes that Serena had on, and believed that he saw them on Paula before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to Paula's closet and was looking for nude pump that stood about 4\" inches high.  Paula had 100's of pairs of shoes and it took Tom about 10 minutes to find what he was looking for.  He slipped off the ballet flats and went to put on the pumps whne he thought to himself that he should put on some white nylons to help shape his foot.  With his jeans off he decided that he should loose the boxers so they would get bunched upunderneath the panty hose.  Not wanting to go comando he found one of Paula's black boycut panties and put them on.  With the shoes securley on his feet he carefully walked out in to the living room to join Paula and find a dress in one of these maazines.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula made room for Tom on the sofa and told him that she liked the shoes he had on.  This made Tom feel good about his choice. He crossed his legs and kept thumbing through each of the dozens of magazines that Paula had.  He tried to show Paula the 6 different choices that he found but she still was not in the mood</span></div></div>",

It wasn't that Tom kept shoving pictures of women in bridal gowns in her face, that made her so mad it was the fact that everybody was so \" fired up\" about how she should look. \" Tom I agree with you about picking a dress, but I have plenty of time to make up my mind. I get it ok, white and frilly.' with that Paula got up and headed into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom who was busy admiring the gowns worn by the women, noticed Paula get up. He slapped a magazine down and uncrossed his legs. Surprisingly he stood and strode confidently in Paula's heels. With the added inches he towered over his future spouse. He found her making a sandwich. Paula opened the bologna and bit a piece then wiped her hands on her boxers. Tom walked in and said \"Paula, I am only going to say this once, if you don't get your act together and decide on a style or a designer you may be at the wedding alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZamboni's mind control was working. Paula had made this argument just this morning about Tom and his tuxedo choices. Now Tom was taking Paula's views thanks to zambonis suggestions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula responded with what was tom's response. \" I will tell you what Tom. You pick your top three choices then I will decide from there.\" Tom almost swirled with delight. \" ok I will pick three then you get the final word, promise me you will try really hard ok.\" Tom clasped his hands together with delight then added. \"I am going to call Darlene and all three of us will go together Kay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula had finished her sandwich and had taken a bite out of it. Mustard dripped out of her mouth and she wiped it with back if her hand. \" Sure, sure sweetie you do that.\" Tom clicked into the bedroom and Paula could hear him on the phone with her mother. It never seemed odd to either of them how much Tom was sounding like Paula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Paula planted herself on the couch and looked up at gossip girly en picked up the TV remote and mumbled \"That's enough of this shit, god Tom's shows are so boring.</span></div></div>",

More importantly he felt like he only wanted her to do one thing: pick out a gown. How hard could this one task be. With his fashion sense and his mother-in-laws money Paula could easily have gotten an upscale dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus Tom was frustrated because Paula only had one job. Pick a gown. He had to meet with the priest, he had to talk to the caterer, he had to pick out food ,and cakes. My god, it seemed never ending. After trying to get Paula to decide one last time Tom gave up and went to bed. When he walked in their bedroom he sat on Paula's bed side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel the frustration building up. He slid his pumps off and pulled down his nylons very gently. He placed his shoes back in the closet with the rest of his foot wear. He thought he was clever with the system he had for keeping track of his little treasures. Every shoe was under the outfit they went with. Hmmp thought Tom and Paula is always kidding me that I can't keep track of my shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he pulled out his satin cami pj's that had satin pants with an elastic waist.These were the ones Paula wore last night and they were under her pillow. They were black with pink trim. Tom climbed into Paula's side of the bed and pulled out her kindle. He used her password to look over all of the preparations that earlier she made but now Tom thought he should check  to see how things were progressing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about twenty minutes he felt very tired and drifted off to sleep. Paula's alarm went off and fir a brief second Tom was confused. What is going on? Then it hit him he needed to call Darlene and see if he can get some help in getting Pauls interested in picking a gown. After all what girl doesn't listen to her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom got up and slipped on Paula's bedroom mules. They were two inches in heel height. Then he headed to the phone.</span></div></div>",

His job as the manager of an engineering company meant that he had the time during the day to make personal errands.  He used Paula's shampoo andconditioner in the shower and besides shaving his face he also saved his legs.  Thinking that a clean smooth leg would feel better with nylons on.  He finished in the bathroom and was back in their bedroom when Paula woke and walked over to Tom to give him a kiss.  She was wearing his boxers and quickly stripped the t-shirt off exposing her 32B sized breasts.  Tom had gown through Paula's underwear drawer to find a panti and bra set.  True to Zamboni's word, this was day 2 and the couple would wear each others under garments as if they were their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking out a suit to wear was never something Tom liked to do, but this morning he carefully selected a suit and proceed to get dressed.  He stood at the closet wearing Pauls's pantie's, bra and pantyhose.  The suit was the only one that Paula had bought for him.  He found a purple tie, and now all he had to do was find some shoes.  He looked over at Paula's side of the closet and selected a pair of black slingback pumps with a 4\" inch heel.  He tried them on and liked how they looked in the mirror, but decided against them because of all the walking he would need to do today.  He found a pair of heels that had a 1\" kitten heel and a round toe in black, with his black nylons they wouldn't look too girly, although for Tom that would never be a problem.  He went over to Paula to wish her a good day and give her a kiss and found that she had gotten dressed in a pair of old painter sweats and a t-shirt.  Her hair was still messed up from sleeping.  He gave her a list of things for her to get done while he was at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom left and was driving in his car to work, he was getting angier at his fiance and couldn't wait until tomorrow when the would go back to see Zamboni.  Maybe he could help him get Paula to help out with the wedding. Tom also thought it would be a perfect time to go after the therapy session to the bridal /tux boutique.  They could get Paula into a gown and get the tux's finalized, maybe he could select what the bridesmaid where going to wear as well.  Tom was going to suggest this to Darlene when he talked to her.  Maybe she could meet them there.  </span></div></div>",

Today Tom went to work wearing a 3\" inch black leather pump, he was also wearing a few bangles on his wrist, on the other was Paula's watch.  His pieced ears now had a pair of Paula's diamond studded earings.  He was also wearing her engagement ring that he needed to work it on his larger finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom had come home from work to find Paula dressed in a pair of older jeans, and a t-shirt that she had on yesterday.  One her feet was a pair of Tom's brown loafers.  She was waiting for Tom because their apointment was in 10 minutes and they need to get going, she told Tom that she talked with her mom and she was going to meet them at the bridal boutique after the session.  She thought that this might proof to Tom that she was somewhat interested in the wedding adn hoped that it would get Tom of his back somewhat.  Tom did like what he heard, but he was too busy trying to find the highest pair of heels that Paula's owned.  This was Zamboni's instruction and he felt obligated to where them to the session.  He finally settled on a pair of Louiboton 160mm Black Alti.  He also found the pair of shoes that Paula is going to wear with her wedding dress.  Tom thought it would be a good idea to bring them along.  For someother reason he also decided to change his panti's and bra  to the white set that Paula had purchased especially for a strapless wedding dress.  For good measure he put a pair of white stockings in his jacket pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula was getting impatient with Tom and yelled up the stairs just as Tom would have done if Paula was taking too much time.  She kept looking at the watch on her wrist, a larker watch tahnks to the latest swap with Tom.  She would yell again and this time she heard Tom's heels coming down the stairs.  Paula grabbed her purse and the keys from the counter and told Tom that she was going to drive.  tom was alright with this but asked Paula for her sunglasses from her purse for him to wear.  Paula didn't understand how they got into her purse, but was all too happy to oblige her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin 10 minutes they where in Dr. Zamboni's office and talking about the last 3 days with Tom doing most of the talking.  Dr. Zamboni  had an evil grin on his face listing to the couple and how much they were acting like each other.  He decided that was enought talking and told the couple that he would continue with his hypnosis treatment.  In 5 minutes they were sound alseep and open for suggestion.</span></div></div>",

The Dr. was talking in a soothing voice and telling the couple that they needed to continue to experience more of each other world.  He thought that the most immediate suggestion would be for them to exchange names.  Tom, for now on you will only answer to the name Paula, and Paula you will only answer to the name Tom.  You will both still continue to identifiy with your current gender and all of your memories will still be normal.  Just that your names will be exchanged.   The only time you will respond to your old name is when you are in my office and under my spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou will continue to wear the others shoes, jewellery and under garments. If someone suggests that you try on something that you normally wouldn't wear, you will proceed and not ask any questions.  One day 2 you will begin to find it necessary to wear your hair as the other.  That means Paula will need to get her hair cut and Tom you will go and buy a wig that has the same colour and style as Paula's.  On day 3 you will begin to act more like each other.  Tom you will use Paula's purse and Paula you will ask for Tom's wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZamboni counted back from 10 and  when he reached 1 the couple were awake and rubbed their eyes from the length of the session.  Zamboni asked Paula how she felt, he was looking at Her at the time, and herard Tom respond to him.  \"Doc, Im over here\" Zamboni quized the couple on their names to just make sure that the suggestion worked.  Paula had told him that her mom had called her Thomas when she was a little girl.  Zamboni laughed out loud with his evil laugh, this startled the couple.  Tom (Paula) thought to herself that this was getting strange and motioned to Paula (Tom) that they should go, her mom was meeting them at the bridal boutique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom pulled up to the bridal shop, she put the keys in her ourse and they held hands as they walked in the shop.  A sign greated them at the front asking them to remove their footwear.  Paula remover his pumps and Tom kicked off her loafers.  Ms. Feist greeted them and talked about the suggestions that Tom emailed her earlier in the day.  This caused 'Tom' to think back because she didn't remember doing any such thing.  Ms. Feist kept talking and told them that they had a private room just for the 2 of them.</span></div></div>",

She walso told them that she was short staffed today and it would be a few minutes before anyone could help them and that she was needed elsewhere for the time being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Paula' had brought the box of wedding shoes that 'Tom\" had bought for her dress and since Ms. Feist said that the room on the right was for him he entered it with the shoes.

She was happy that her daughter was trying on dresses because she hasn't sounded normal for the past couple of days and was hopefull that this would snap her back.

By the way I would much rather wear your sneakers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom couldn't make out what she said at first.

'Why don't you put my bra and panties on. It will show that you at least understand how I feel.\" Tom lookd at his wife and nodded his head. \"Paula I think you are rght. Wearing your intimates would help me get closer to your view of this situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Paula stod up and git undressed in front of the doctor and her husband. She pulled off her outer garments revealing a very nice beige colored underwire bra and a lacy thong. She slipped out of these and handed them to Tom. Tom had already stripped and was standing there nude. Of course the couple was around the same height so that Paula's lingerie fit Tom. Tom was pulling Paula's thong up his thighs while Paula began dressing again. Tom had Paula help him snap the bra around his chest and soon he was sitting down in the chair with his regual clothes over Paulua's lingerie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next/</span></div></div>",

Both seemed comfortable with the switch and neither gave it a second thought when getting dressed.  They had expanded the switch to include socks and for the first time yesterday they included shoes.  Causing quite the stir when they showed up at church and Tom was wearing Paula's 4\" white sling back shoes with his suit, while Paula had Tom's black dress shoes, complete with black socks pulled up mid calve.  Needless to say that this didn't go well with the beautiful light blue sundress that she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonday arrived with the sound of the 6:00am alarm going of on Paula's night stand.  She sat up bare chested to reach over and silence the alarm.  Rubbing the under side of her breast she reached over with the other hand to wake up Tom.  Her hand rubbing the silky light blue material that Tom wore, causing him to stir and roll on to his other side that now faced Paula.  In the process causing his baby doll lingerie to twist and rise above his matching panties.  \"Get up, sleepy head\"  Paula said as she bent over to kiss Tom on the forehead.  Bringing a smile to Tom's face as he opened his eyes looking at Paula and her bare chest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretching his arms to the head board, Tom began to rustle and slowly began to show some life in this early morning.  Meanwhile Paula had left the bed and was moving about in their bedroom, wearing only the boxers she had gotten from Tom's drawer the night before.  Paula had always gotten up earlier than Tom as it took her longer to get ready and she had a longer commute to work than Tom.  Tom on the other hand always gotten up at the same time so he could enjoy his coffee while reading the morning paper.  So while Paula was starting her shower.  Tom grabbed her blue silk robe that ended just below his bottom to cover up the baby doll he now wore as he made his way to front door to fetch his paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Paula out of the shower and Tom still at the table reading his paper, they both received phone calls that caused their phones to ring simultaneously and at the precise same time they answered and said hello.</span></div></div>",

Jake ordered the shrimp stir fry.  It was mostly vegetables and would fit right in with his diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge was too preoccupied looking at the boy to say anything.  But finally he ordered the triple decker club.  The waitress left to put in the orders.  George got up and headed towards the restrooms.  On the way he purposefully bumped into the boys chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

There just happened to be televisions in the restaurant high above sitting on platforms. The young man's father Ronald said, \"Hey look at whats happening on the television.\" This caused George and the rest of the family to snap out of there hypnotic siggestions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge froze and shook his head like his was waking from a dream. Meanwhile, Jake and Shely were the ones who had the biggest shock. Shely looked at Jake and was horrified. There sitting across from her was her son wearing her purple blouse and lined skirt. Plus he had on her make-up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake too was in a panic as it seemed he was caught wearing his mother's clothes in public. \"Jake\", Shely said. \"What are you doing in my clothes?\" Jake was so embarrassed he could feel the lipstick on his lips and the tightness of his mother's bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time George was headed back to the table and could see the situation between his wife and son escalating. Shely was really berating her son when George sat back down in his seat. \"George look at what your son had gottne into again.\"<br>\r\nPoor George did not know what to say. But he did give Jake a weird look since he was wearing  his mothers clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake get up you need to get out of my clothes immediately.\" Shely demanded and headed Jake back to the restroom so that they could repeat the process of clothes switching all over again.</span></div></div>",

When they got there Shelly said, \"I don't know how you convinced me to swap clothing with you, but this won't happen again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it was my fault?  I clearly remember you telling me I had something on my face and telling me to come in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake remembered that too, but he didn't know why he would do that.  Jake actually felt worse in his mom's clothes than she did in his.  Although she was embarrassed that a woman her age wasn't wearing a bra with a shirt as tight as Jake's was.  \"I don't know what happened.  It just seemed right at the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it certainly isn't right, young man.  Now you take off my clothes right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake did as he was told, his mom watched him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOM!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is nothing you have that I haven't seen.  I changed your diapers you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Jake was naked Shelly said, \"You wash your face while I change.  AND EYES FRONT MISTER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake washed the makeup off his face.  But he couldn't help but to see his mom's reflection in the mirror.  She mostly changed with her back to him, but he could see his mom's shapely naked butt and for a moment the outline of her breasts.  Shelly dressed quickly, putting on her bra and panties first in under a minute and then her blouse and skirt.  She handed Jake his clothes before putting on her shoes.  Jake changed into his clothes as his mom reapplied her makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake dressed quickly.  \"Jake, you head back to the table.  It'll take me a moment to finish my makeup.\"  When the boy left, Shelly locked the door again and went to the toilets.  She removed her tampon and was about to put in another one when she realized she didn't have one.  She would have to use her emergency feminine napkin instead.  It was quicker to put in anyway.  She then checked her makeup one last time and then left for the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly returned to their table and glared at her son.  Jake avoided the glare as best he could.  He didn't know why he was in his mom's clothes.  Then he realized he was in a room full of people who saw him like that.  At the table, Cyndi didn't want the burger she ordered.  It was just too big for her.  She comforted herself by eating the fries instead.  George gave her one of the sections of his sandwich.  They would have to take the huge burger home in a doggy bag.  Jake and Shelly just like with their apparel swapped meals.  But Jake couldn't eat it.  He knew that everyone had seen him in his mom's clothing and that was spoiling his appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly asked George, \"What were you saying about that boy over there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge tried to make up something quick.  \"Ummm, I think I have seen him before.  Is he one of the kids in the neighborhood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turns out he was, and he knew the boys parents who were sitting next to the boy.  Pointing to the boys parents, Shelly said \"You know the Gustersons, they live and Kelly Street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meal preceded quietly.  Cyndi and Jake not eating very much of the meals they ordered.  The Gusterson's left the restaurant before George's family.  George didn't know this and he purposefully avoided looking that way.  He didn't want to look at the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the waitress returned.  \"I see you can't finish your burgers, do you want a container?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you,\" Shelly said for her kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I'll get one.  Would you like any of our home-made deserts?  Or will that be all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Jake looke over at Shely and was shocked that she was wearing his clothes again and his make-up. Not only that, but she was in the seat he was sitting in. What has gotten into that boy. Why is he so determined to wear my clothes Jake thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, George still thinking about the cute boy he saw about 5 minutes agao. \"Shely do you really think he was cute?' George asked. Jake answered. \"Yes honey now get your stuff we need to get out of here.\" Jake stood up and grabbed Shely's purse and slung it over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young man when we get home we are going to have a serious talk about your sudden obsession do you hear me?\" Jake grumbled at Shelly. All Shely could do was meekly reply, \"Yes ma'am.\" With that Jake walked over to the counter and paid for the famiies meal. He dug through Shely's purse and found her credit card and used it to pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family headed out to the car and Jake got behind the wheel. George sat in the passenger side while Shely sat in the spot where Jake normally sat. This made Cyndi mad because she felt that was where she should sit.Jake was berating Shely for wearing his clothes and promised that a family discussion was in order later that evening. Because he was so intend on fussing at his son Jake ran a stop sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere happened to be a police officer nearby and he pulled the families car over. The officer walked over to the car and asked Jake for his identification. \"I am sorry officer, but we are having a family problem and I wasn't paying attention.\" Jake dug through Shely's purse and pulled out her driver's liscense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer thought that Jake was playing a prank. \"Look son I don't want your mom's ID I need yours.\" Jake was shocked a bit at the officers remarks. \"See here sir, that is my ID I am Shely Williams of 564 Parkdrive.\" george piped in and said ,\"thats right officer she is my wife.\" The cop thought the whole family was very weird and just decided to let these crazies get to where they needed to go. After all Parkdrive was only 5 minures from where they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok son just be more careful.\" The cop stated. With that Jake drove off. \"Jake see what your obsession is doin to this family.\" Jake said. With that the family went home.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finally the Williams got home.  There wasn't too much talk in the car.  Cyndi and Shelly kept glaring at each other.  They didn't know why they were in each other's usual seat.  Cyndi actual was in Jake's seat because Shelly was in the dog house since she was wearing her mother's clothes again so she had something else to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt home, before Shelly got out of the car, Jake reminded Shelly to get out of his clothes immediately.  Since they were home and it was getting late, there was no need to swap clothing, Shelly would just put on Jake's night clothes.  Shelly went to Jake's room and found a pair of briefs, a white cotton t-shirt and some pajama bottoms.  Jake actually (both Shelly and the real Jake) would prefer to wear just the briefs and t-shirt without the pajama bottoms, but there were girls in the house so he kept wearing them.  Shelly took the stuff to the bathroom to put them on.  Normally Jake would just put them on in his room, but tonight she had to not only put these things on, but remove the makeup she was wearing.  This included the nail polish on her nails.  It would take a while to get dressed because of this.  Shelly who was still on her period didn't put a napkin in Jake's briefs simply because Jake would never do such a thing.  She started bleeding into the crotch of Jake's briefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Cyndi took off her clothes and put on Jake's briefs and a t-shirt.  The t-shirt actually hung on her like a dress because she was much smaller than both Jake and Shelly.  The pajama bottoms were much too large for her so she didn't bother with them.  By the time Shelly was done in the bathroom, Cyndi was playing the latest version of \"Call of Duty.\"  This was her brother's favorite game.  She hadn't played it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" Shelly demanded of Cyndi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm playing \"Call of Duty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll kick your butt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey if you think it's yours let's see how good you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither was very good, but they both wanted to play and they did.  Both thinking in effect they were Jake. If they were themselves, it would be a great bonding moment.  Before the game was over, George came into the room.  He addressed Shelly.  The game was paused.  \"Look, I don't know what has come over you, but your mother doesn't want you wearing her clothing anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to.  I don't know what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care what happened.  Just quit it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't happen again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It happened twice tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.  I don't know how I get into Mom's clothes. It just seems to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm putting a stop to it right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had better.\"  George left the room and Cyndi and Shelly returned to playing the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge returned to his bedroom.  Now that he was done with talking to 'Jake' he could return to thinking about that boy.  \"OK, I talked to Jake.  He won't wear your clothes again.\"  Jake was wearing one of his mother's nighties with some panties underneath.  George and Jake got into bed and started watching television although they didn't mention the word.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shelly,\" George asked Jake, \"do you really think that boy is cute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I think he was very cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do I.  I think he is the cutest boy I have every seen.  I wish I would have talked to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I went over to his table, but I guess I got cold feet.  Then when I looked up later he was gone.\"  George didn't recognize his 'change of heart' when the word 'television' was mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why who do you have to blame for that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me I guess.  He was just so hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you told me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has such pretty hair.\"  George meant pretty in the most 'masculine' way possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes he had nice hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think he goes to the middle school or is he in high school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he is in middle school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think he is a good kisser?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would I know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't ask if he was a good kisser.  I asked if you think he is a good kisser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I get him to ask me out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake was getting tired of all these questions about some boy.  \"George, it's bedtime.  Let's just watch some television and then go to sleep.\"  George lost interest in the boy immediately.  Jake wondered why he was in bed with his dad.  He got out and discovered he was wearing his mom's nightie.  His mom had told him to stop wearing her clothes.  Besides he thought it was embarrassing to wear girl's clothing.  He returned to his room to get changed again.  When he got there he found Cyndi and Shelli playing \"Call of Duty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow alone, George looked fore something to watch.  He looked though the on-screen tv guide and on TV Land he found a listing for and old episode of 'Home Improvement.'  His thoughts turned to that boy who lives just a few blocks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He wanted to protest but he was wearing a nightie and he had to get out of that first.  Soon he was dressed the same as Shelly: a t-shirt, briefs and pajama bottoms.  \"What are you guys doing in my room.\" Jake questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who says it's your room,\" Shelly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, besides any dork knows we are playing 'Call of Duty'.  Do you want to play?\" Cyndi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake didn't see any reason not to play.  But he thought he would kick their butts kind of quickly.  Then it dawned on Jake, \"You know this game can be played with four, I'll see if Dad wants to play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake left and returned to the room.  \"Dad doesn't want to play.  He is all hung up on that boy he saw today.  I couldn't get in a word edgewise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least he has a boyfriend,\" Shelly retorted.  \"You don't have a girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just haven't found anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you will never find someone if you keep wearing girlie clothing like that nightie,\" Cyndi said sarcastically. The nightie was thrown casually on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was uh mistake.  I won't wear it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you won't,\" said Shelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I won't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bet you like wearing mom's stuff,\" Cyndi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, It'll probably give you a stiffy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I don't\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you do.  You are so girly.\"  At this point the real Jake had had enough and launched himself at Cyndi and Shelly.  The girls who thought they were boys couldn't resist a playful fight and a wrestling match ensued.  It went on for a while until George came into the room.  The three stopped immediately at seeing 'their dad' entangled with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys I just got a call from Dr. Zamboni.  He said we should come into his office the first thing tomorrow morning.  He says we should stay as we are now and that the code words don't work anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Dad.\" the three said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, you can go back to what you were doing.\"  The three went back to their playful wrestling.  George didn't mind.  He knew that boys will be boys.  \"Speaking of boys,\" George thought, \"maybe I should see if my boy has a facebook page.\"</span></div></div>",

Jake was next and went to sleep with her.  He didn't mind it, his formerly annoying sister had become so cool.  She even made a farting joke.  Shelly slept on the floor like a sleepover at a friends house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning they got up and got ready for the day.  All three Jakes pretty much wore the same thing, jeans and a t-shirt.  Of course Cyndi needed a belt to keep the jeans up.  They went down and had some cold cereal.  Even before this incident, Cyndi and Jake loved Frosted Flakes and this time Shelly joined them.  George had spent most of the night looking up his love on the internet.  He found the boy's facebook page and printed out some of the pictures he found there.  He would also cut out hearts on a piece of paper and put the printed pictures underneath.  He also studied everything that was written about his boy.  He was glad there was no mention of a girlfriend for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast they drove to Dr. Zamboni's office.  George was in the front seat as he was the only adult in the car.  In the back sat the three Jakes. They were all fooling around with each other and soon got into a punching contest.  None of the Jakes complained about being hit too hard, not even Cyndi.  George tolerated what was going on in the back.  He was thinking about his boy and everything he had learned about him.  George wanted to find a way to get with the boy.  But he thought about it like a young girl would.  He wanted to be with him, to hold his hand, to hug up close and to kiss.  But nothing past that.  He thought of it in the romantic tones of an eleven-year old.  he wasn't ready for anything more than kissing.  Even the kissing wouldn't be as passionate as it for say Jake and his girlfriend...if he had one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the three Jakes and George were in Dr. Zamboni's office.  Dr. Zamboni had always assumed that they would go into and out of the trances together.  Not that one would come out and the others would stay in.  Dr. Zamboni wanted to talk to them as they were.  He asked George how it was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Doctor, I met this totally hot boy at the restaurant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he is about five foot four inches tall, with brown hair and hazel eyes.  He goes to the middle school and is in the seventh grade.  He likes baseball and boyscouts.\"  George went on and on about the boy.  You could hear the excitement and passion in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you talked to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I looked up his facebook page.  Do you want to see a picture of him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge produced the printed image of the boy.  It was surrounded by a cut out heart which served as the pictures border.  On the heart it said George loves Justin.  It was all very juvenile.  George was indeed thinking like a love sick school girl when it came to this boy.  \"He's cute.  What does Shelly think about him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She says he is OK.  But I think he is just so fine.  I love him so much.  If she knew how much I loved him, she would help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  You know tell me how to get together with him.  I can't just ask him.  That would be sooooo weird.  I have to get him to notice me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shelly what do you think about that?\"  No one answered.  No one thought their name was Shelly now.  \"How about you?\" Dr. Zamboni didn't use Jake's name on purpose but it was clear he was talking to the Jake who was Shelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he's just a little boy.  I suppose he's OK I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you three boys, what have you been up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having a lot of fun,\" Cyndi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were playing video games all night long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we did when we got tired.\"  Cyndi went on to describe everything that happened.  It was hard to tell exactly who did what since they all referred to themselves as Jake.  But Dr. Zamboni thought his experiment was working.  He liked that three of them were the same person.  Although the problem with Cyndi and the over sized clothing would have to be addressed.  Maybe they should go shopping and get clothing that all three could fit into despite their persona.  Dr. Zamboni thought to have the 'three Jakes' have identical identities, but maybe all three should be Shelly or Cyndi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Dr. Zamboni do next?</span></div></div>",

They too are happy with the way things are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everyone happy, Dr. Zamboni decided to leave everything as it is and see what happens. He removed all the trigger words that would change the family's personalities. Then he sent them home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later, Dr. Zamboni received a frantic call from one of the Jakes.  From his voice, Dr. Zamboni surmised that it must be the real Jake that was calling him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Dr. Zamboni you got to help me!\" Jake shouted into the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Calm down.

When he saw the boy and professed his love for him this shit hit the fan. The boy's parents were not amused at a grown man in love with their son. The police were called. George was arrested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon thereafter, the police called George's household. One of the Jakes answer the phone and when the police couldn't find an adult home, they said someone will be sent there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Jakes got together and decided to call Dr. Zamboni.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I'll be right there.

If the police arrived at the Clark residence and found the three Jakes, they would call Social Services. Once that happened, it would be impossible to keep his sessions a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Zamboni looked at his watch, he was happy it was early in the day. Greta Fonzo, also one of Dr. Zamboni's clients, would be home. Greta had been an attorney before she and her family sought counseling from Dr. Zamboni. Greta hadn't worked as an attorney for quite a while.  She had been working and supporting her family as a high-class hooker for over a year. It was time for her to return to her former profession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta's job would be to keep George from saying anything to the police until Dr. Zamboni could speak with him.  She would also have to convince the police that George was under doctor's care.   Dr. Zamboni hoped that he could convince everyone to commit George to a hospital controlled by himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Zamboni formed the plan as he drove do the Clark's residence. He would deal with the police officer, if one was there already. If not, the easiest thing to do would be to return the Clarks back to their original personalities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dealing with the three Jakes, Dr. Zamboni decided the best thing to do for George was to complete George's transformation. George would think, act and tell everyone that he is Cindi an 11 year old girl. They would have no choice but to remit custody of George to his therapist Dr. Zamboni. With this plan in place, Dr. Zamboni felt confident he could make everything right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dr. Zamboni arrived at the Clark residence, a policeman was talking to one of the three Jakes. The police officer was very confused. But after Dr. Zamboni took control of the situation, there wasn't three Jakes in the house, there were four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing hypnosis, the police officer believed his name was Jake Clark, he was 15 years old and living in this house with his family. He would stay there until Dr. Zamboni returned. The four wpuld happily play video games and hang outvas teenage boys do.  They would even order a pizza later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Zamboni would then arrange for the police officer's family to begin family therapy with Dr. Zamboni in the future. But Dr. Zamboni didn't have time for that now. He would have to visit George at the police station and straighten things out. He would also have to visit George's love interest and his family and have them change their story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dr. Zamboni couldn't wait until they returned the next week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day at about 9:15 Dr. Zamboni was in his outer office looking for a file.  When he heard someone enter the office.  He hadn't expected anyone that early.  Dr. Zamboni got up and turned around and was greeted by a hug and a kiss on the cheek.  It was George William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here,\" Dr. Zamboni exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I work here of course,\" George said.  The apologetically George continued, \"I'm sorry I'm late.  I had an awful time trying to get my clothes to fit today.  I guess I must be bloated.  I had to put on an old suit I had.  Do I look OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge had been totally transformed from the way he looked the day before.  His hair had been lengthened with extensions and styled in a professional but pretty manner.  His face was covered in makeup from foundation to eyebrow pencil and everything in between.  He wore a peach colored skirt suit over a pearl colored blouse, nude pantyhose and professional looking sling back pumps with a two inch heel.  Dr. Zamboni wondered how George got his feet into those, it must hurt something awful.  (Dr. Zamboni didn't realize that George had worn sneakers all the way here and just put on the pumps.  His plan was to take them off while he was behind his desk.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look great,\" Dr. Zamboni said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you are so sweet,\" George said taking Dr. Zamboni's hand.  \"You are my second best man, right behind my boyfriend. If I wasn't seeing him, I would go for you,\" George said with a flirty smile never releasing Dr. Zamboni's hand.  \"But, I am here right now.  What can I find for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need the Cabot file.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I'll get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Zamboni moved out of the way and George went to look for the file.  Dr. Zamboni looked at the transformed man as he did his secretary's job.  George knew he was being stared at so he purposefully stuck his butt in the air while bending down to get the file.  He then wiggled it in a seductive and playful manner.  George gave Dr. Zamboni the file with his newly manicured hand and Dr. Zamboni returned to his office to look through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile looking at the file, Dr. Zamboni felt George's hands on his shoulders.  George was giving him a message.  \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You looked tense,\" George purred.  \"I thought you could use a little back rub.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Dr. Zamboni said.  \"But the patients will be here soon.  You should take your place in front of the reception desk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Doctor.  You know where I am if you need me.\"  George left the room to return to his duties.

He had matching red velvet bell bottom pants and a hat.  He wore gold rimmed sunglasses and many gold chains and rings.  On his feet he wore platform shoes.  He carried a decorative cane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind him his wife, Caroll wore a blue stretch minidress with a plunging u-neckline.  The dress was designed to be put on and removed easily.

On her feet where four-inch FM pumps, she had a permanently seductive look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir seventeen year old daughter, Samantha was next.  She wore seemingly two strips of clothing.  A very stretch tubetop in baby blue that barely covered the tops of her nipples and extended to barely below her breasts and a matching 'skirt' that covered from about three or four inches above the fullest part of her hips to the tops of her thighs.  She wore even higher heels than her mother.  Samantha also wore trashy makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally walked in William, the fifteen year old boy.  He was dressed the most conservatively in a spaghetti strapped dress that covered his flat chest to his mid thighs.  He wore fishnet stockings held up by garter belts which could be seen.  His heels were only three inches tall and his makeup while still trashy was put on with care.  He wore a long blonde wig that descended to the small of his back.  It was hard to tell if William was a boy or a girl, but it was certain what he wanted if he walked up to a driver stopped at a light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all the family looked like a pimp and his three hos.  George greeted the Cabots and led them into Dr. Zamboni's office.

Earl quickly found the corner and planted himself in, tucking his muscular limbs in, to make himself as small as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge left his seat and closed the door before going over to comfort Earl. He sat on the chair and ran his hand softly on Earl's head, \"Are you okay ,Sweety?\" he asked the large man in the pink dress<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl shook his head and said quietly \"Mommy and Daddy are yelling and I got scared\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Honey, that happens here sometimes, but it's okay. Doctor Zamboni is helping them\" George advised in a soothing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl continued to cry, as the office door opened. \"I have to help these people, but I will be right back, okay Lisa?\" he said, as he got up and smoothed out his skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, huh\" Earl acknowledged, his head still buried in his hands as he whimpered from the experience of watching his parents argue in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge got up and went to his desk, waiting as the next patients arrived for their session. He watched as an older man in a pink tank top and checkered golf shorts made his way to his desk, while the other figure took a seat not far from where Earl had planted himself on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the couch sat a young blonde woman with her hair slicked back, wearing bifocals, was dressed in a light cotton plaid button down shirt with a pocket and a pair of gray pants, cinched high above her waist, with a pair of well worn brown loafers.

She turned her attention to the figure in the corner curled up and sniffling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Bert\" Back for another session?\" George asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we are, Carry\" The burly older man said, with a bit of lisp and flamboyance in his tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Carl?\"  George asked, looking toward the figure on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No change what so ever. It doesn't matter how many pills he takes, there's just no reaction from him, almost like there's nothing there and I have to tell you honey, I have had just about enough. I mean, I love him and all, but if I have to start looking elsewhere else for some satisfaction, I will\" Bert said, being very animated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't give up on Carl yet. He's a good man and from what you've told me, a great lover. The doctor is excellent. I'm sure he'll be able to get some positive results\" George said, smoothing out his skirt, as he sat in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBert was about to continue, when the phone rang. \"I have to get this\" George said, holding his finger up to stop Bert as her picked up the receiver<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On it showed three people smiling.  In the middle was a large young man with a bald head wearing a dress.  He was holding hands with people on his right and left.  On his right there was a little girl who was wearing a child's representation of a military uniform including shiny black shoes.  The little girl had long yellow hair.  On the left was an old man with white balding hair who was a little bit stooped but also wearing a dress.  On his feet appeared to be shoes with a heel.

There was no chance to do much had happened but they were both Catholic and didn't 'believe in divorce' so they tried this.

I have hypnotized your husband and you have to see this.  He has such a sexist attitude and so I planted some suggestions permanently into his head.  He doesn't know anything is wrong or different.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer followed Dr. Zamboni into an observation room.  She couldn't see her husband but he could see her.   \"Oh my god,\" she said in surprise. Sitting on a chair was her husband.  He wore a white halter minidress that was so tight it looked like it was painted on his body.  It was so short that if Don hadn't had his legs crossed, Jennifer would be able to see that he didn't wear any underwear at all.  He had obviously shaved his chest as well as his underarms and legs.  You could clearly see the bra straps on his shoulders.  On his feet he wore extremely high platform heels.  The most accurate way to describe the makeup he wore was slutty and he wore a lot of it.  Jennifer couldn't  tell but he wore enough perfume to choke a horse.  But it wasn't that he just wore slutty women's clothing, his entire attitude was different.  You could see on his face what he wanted and that he thought he had the body to get it from any man he met.  His new dress and attitude was at odds with both his gender and his strict Catholic up bringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" Jennifer said.  \"But it serves him right.  He doesn't know anything is wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, everything seems perfectly normal to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He thinks he is a woman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he things he is Don.  This is just how Don thinks he has always dressed and how he always acted.  He loves to go clubbing every night and I'm sure he'll probably suck off at least three men while out.  Of course he might do more than that.  I have also arranged for him to have a new job.  He is a phone sex operator during the day.  The bigger money is during the evening, but he prefers to club instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure he doesn't notice anything wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, everything is perfectly normal to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Jennifer doesn't know is how she is dressed.  All she is wearing is a big fluffy diaper and an onesie with stars on it and a snap crotch.  She isn't wearing any shoes or makeup and doesn't know anything is wrong.  She didn't know that just a few minutes ago, she was the one sitting on the floor where Don was waiting now and playing with her toys.  She doesn't even know that her diaper isn't completely dry anymore or that the rest of her life will consist of being spoon fed babyfood, drinking out of baby bottles, playing with toys, early bed times and the constant supervision of a nanny.  Don (who was dresses as he is now) couldn't believe it when he saw her from this vantage point.  He had always said that she acted like a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer watched as Don's date picked him up to take him to the club.  A few minutes later, Jennifer's nanny came and took her to the car and strapped her into the baby seat in the back.  Since their conflict was resolved, neither needed any more therapy from Dr. Zamboni.</span></div></div>",

It was brightly painted like a toddler's bedroom would be with decals of animals stuck to the wall.  The carpet had a 'cow jumps over the moon' design.  The center of the room was dominated by a big seemingly well used playpen that stood in front of a large television.  Only shows that would appeal to a toddler or a small child could be played on this set.  All other channels were removed with parental controls.  There was a changing table and a diaper bucket in one corner of the room and a box full of toddler toys in another.  Some of the toys were liberally scattered upon the floor.  Mobiles were also hung from the ceiling.  There was no mistaking that this room was designed for a toddler.  Although since this is a room that friends, family and guests see, it was pretty gender neutral for the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoug took Jennifer to the changing table and put her up.  She laid upon it while Doug quickly got the clean diaper and changing supplies he needed.  Doug was a professional when it came to these things and quickly had Jennifer changed and put into her playpen and then turned on the TV in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery room in the house was toddler centric.  Except for the smallest room, in which Doug lived, all the rooms were designed for a toddler's needs.  Every room had a changing table, every room had a playpen, every room was brightly painted.and had a different although childish theme. The refrigerator was fully stocked with baby foods, juices, milk and formula.  In the bathroom the tub was designed to make bathing a large toddler easy and was also decorated for a toddler with a nautical decor.  The master bedroom was a toddler girl's heaven.  All in all, the house couldn't be more designed for a toddler than if it was a daycare center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Jennifer was settled, Doug preceded to do the housework that was necessary to run the home.  This included writing checks to pay the bills for the mortgage and other types of necessary paperwork that was now his job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the beginning of Jennifer's first day of permanent toddlerhood.  Days that started when she woke up at 6 am and went to bed at 7 pm.  Days that included at least two naps of at least an hour during the day.  Days where she could walk around the mall, but always wore a harness to keep her from getting lost, that was of course when she wasn't in her stroller.  Days when she could be silenced simply by putting a pacifier in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Not to mention the big playpen in the middle of the room.  In the kitchen, where she sat waiting for the coffee, there were decals of anthropomorphic fruits and vegetables with bright smiles and arms and legs.

At the end of the day a, man with a completely shaved head and scary tattoos came in wearing nothing but a woman's black silk nightgown, a glass of wine, a black heels. He had the worse time walking in them, then didn't ever cross his legs when he sat down. Flashing his panties for all to see, but at least they were pretty. He got very upset at Zamboni and at one point pinned him up against the wall, which only made Zamboni laugh. Unfortunately the guy stormed off strutting like men do, only he's heels were making it hard.<br>\r\n \"Alight Carry, that's it for the day.\" Zamboni said straighting himself up after being attacked. \"That's Mr. Dyson, our first appointment tomorrow. Don't worry about him.\" Zamboni handed Carry her peach sport coat and opened the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually Doctor, my boyfriend is picking me up and he is a bit late. Im going to wait here for him. I'll lock up when I leave.\" Said George after smoothing his skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes the mysterious boyfriend. When will I ever get to meet this man?\" Zamboni said with his ha d on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha, I just don't want you getting jealous! \" George flirted as she watched Zamboni leave. She had her own plans for when her boyfriend Tim showed up.....</span></div></div>",

George grabbed her purse and double checked to make sure she really was alone, they took out some fun evening wear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe undid her blouse and wiggled out of her tight skirt.

After some arguing, on Earl's part, including calling Lisa a \"Meanie\", he accepted the cup rather than none at all, happily spooning the sweet treat into his mouth, as he swung his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce home, Lisa gave Earl some crayons to color with.

He seemed to be a decent guy and wanted to help her and her daughter through the rough patch they were going through. Lisa had decided that she should dress a little better if she really wanted to impress Carry. Rather than her fatigues, she opted for a dress shirt and tie, with a pair of dress pants and loafers. Lisa remembered that Carry had mentioned a certain cologne she liked on men. She knew she had it, so she splashed some on. Checking herself in the mirror, Lisa was happy with the way she looked, but decided that her hair was too long, even with it curled the way she had it. If there was time, she would have gotten it cut. \"I'll have to go to the barber tomorrow\" she said to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Earl ran into the lobby. \u201dCan I push the button?\u2019 He asked, standing by the elevator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead\u201d Lisa replied, as Earl clapped his hands with glee before pushing the elevator call button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got in and the doors closed. Earl looked down at Lisa, who smiled back up at him. Lisa nodded her head. He giggled as he pressed the floor button. Lisa thought about how it was the smallest things that made her daughter happy. The doors opened and the pair got out. Lisa could feel her hands sweat a little bit, and her chest pound harder as they were about to open the door. She knew Carry was just on the other side.

George also had all of Carry's jewelry and earrings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZamboni walked out of the office and smiled at the little girl flirting with a grown man wearing the clothes of his former secratary. Which reminded him that the Williams would be showing up soon. He knew he promised Carry that he would switch her back to her normal life.

Favorite beer, First time she jad sex, etc, etc. Zamboni wanted to expand his hold over the two of them so he decided that when the real Carry showed up with the Williams family he would hypnotize her and George back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twist would be that Carry would give up her boyfriend and fall madly in love with little Lisa as Earl. Of course with the Williams family being a part of his scheme for so long there would absolutely be some role swapping and clothes swaps.\"Well thank you Earl.\" Zamboni said as he stood up. \"I want you to meet the next clinets could you possibly stay for another 10 minutes as they should be on their way up soon.\" Lisa looked down at her manly watch and said, \"Geez Doc Lisa and I were going to the park for some bonding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise this will only take a little while.\" Zamboni began to reach for his watch when Lisa chimed in.\" Oh okay, I guess I could talk to your lovely secratary for awhile.\" So Lisa and Earl head outside and wait for the Williams to show up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They didn't looked mismatched as he expected somehow they had found a way to make it all work.  Carry was the first to enter, she was clearly a woman who was wearing male clothing.  She had cut her hair and strolled in with the strut of a confident man.  Next was Jake.  But he didn't look like Jake anymore he looked like Shelly.  The real Shelly had a youthful and androgynous face.  What made he look pretty and sophisticated was her clothing and makeup.  But now that Jake was wearing these clothes and makeup (especially since he too had his hair styled) he looked perfectly natural as an adult woman.  He even had all his mother's mannerisms down including her walk which was helped by the heels she now he always wore.  Shelly was next and just as Jake looked like a woman because of all the makeup and apparel, without those things Shelly could pass for a boy.  She also had a haircut to make her transformation seem real.  Stripped of all her feminine mannerisms and obtaining the 'arrogance' of a young man, she fit right into the family as a boy.  There was a strong resemblance between Jake and Shelly.  At the age Jake was now, before puberty would make his face more angular and increased his height too much somehow it just all worked out.  Cyndi hadn't changes, she was still Cyndi.  After a little bit of probing, Dr. Zamboni found out what had happened.  Since Carry didn't have the same swap directive as George, she never became Carry.  Cyndi didn't have anyone to swap with so she remained herself.  Plus she was just a young girl, she didn't know how to really act like a grown man.  Somehow the family made the changes that Dr. Zamboni implanted work.  Even the fact that George worked from home helped the illusion.  He never met with clients, he contacted them through messaging and emails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything worked out so perfectly that Dr. Zamboni didn't want to switch anyone back.  Shelly went to Jake's school and no one said a word.  Jake spent time with Shelly's friends and everything was fine there.  Jake loved fashion and knew more of the gossip about the families in the neighborhood than Shelly did.  His friends had told him about their parents and the secrets in their house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Carry and Jake went out, people assumed that they were a lesbian couple with Carry (who called herself George) as the 'bull dyke' and Jake (who called himself Shelly) as the lipstick lesbian.  Jake played his part well since he acted even more feminine than Shelly would have.  Even the family problems that had brought them to Dr. Zamboni had disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Zamboni wished them good luck and and sent them on their way.  He told them they didn't need anymore counseling and they agreed.  But now Dr. Zamboni's problem was what to do with George.  \"The hell with it,\" he said to no one.  \"Let him be my secretary forever.  I just have to get Carry's boyfriend in here\".</span></div></div>",

His strapping son, Michael, 17 years old, who stood 6\u2019 1\u201d, was sitting cross-legged, wearing his mother\u2019s clothes. A black dress which was practically a shirt on him and barely contained his much larger size, peep-toe pumps that he somehow managed to jam his feet into with black hose encasing his hairy legs, several gold bangles on his wrist and watch he had somehow managed to squeeze into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo seats down, his wife, Terri, 5\u2019 4\u201d was dressed in his son\u2019s football jersey, which hung on her like a sack, a pair of jeans that she was swimming in and sneakers that somehow managed to stay on her feet without falling off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeated in between them was Michael\u2019s girlfriend, Brittany also 17 and 5\u20191\u201d, dressed in her cheerleader\u2019s uniform, ankle socks with little pom-poms on the heel and white canvas sneakers. She seemed very happy to see Tom when he walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTerri\u2026 Michael?\u201d Tom asked, looking quizzically at his wife and son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Dad, you\u2019re here!\u201d Michael said, shooting up from his seat to give his father hug, kissing him on the cheek <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerri, who sat with her legs spread open looked at her husband, \u201cGood, you made it. We can finally get this session over with. I\u2019m bored out of my mind here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is all this about?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you about this. I was talking to Mary Sternberger. She said this guy really helped her son, Larry so we were coming in to see if Doctor Zamboni could offer some help with Michael\u2019s grades. He needs to keep them up if he\u2019s going to get that football scholarship\u201d Terri asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019Crazy\u2019 Larry?\u201d Brittany asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t call him that. He's a nice boy\u201d Michael asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMike, he\u2019s nuts. I heard that he moved in with his grandmother, started wearing her clothes and does nothing but garden, bakes cookies all day and goes to play Bingo at the VFW hall at night. He\u2019s supposedly even been seeing some of the old guys from the VFW, like, dating and I heard he\u2019s even sleeping with few of them\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s better than what he was doing: getting drunk, doing drugs and getting in trouble with the police, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Michael asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSleeping with old men... seriously?  But then I heard his grandmother bought a motorcycle, joined a biker gang, and has been going out drinking and has been getting into fights. She\u2019s even got a bunch of tattoos. I even heard she\u2019s got herself a girlfriend, some bimbo from the hair salon with really big boobs\u201d Brittany explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally\u2026 Well, maybe she got bored with her garden, but at least Larry is there to take care of it now.\u201d Michael said thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMichael, his grandmother is 70 years old, widowed, was head of the Ladies Auxiliary and an active member of the church choir\u201d Brittany argued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever mind all that, Brittany\u2026 Terri, Are you kidding me\u2026.the hell with the grades, look at yourselves\u201d Tom said, standing in the doorway, taking in the sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerri had gotten up, standing in front of her husband \"Tom, the doctor saw us briefly, but said he wanted to see all of us about the problem with Michael's grades, he asked me to call you and wait until you got here before he would continue. He must think it's serious.\" Terri said, pulling at her jersey, as she got angry with her husband's seeming lack of concern for their son's future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, sorry to interrupt. The doctor will see you now.\u201d George ushered the four into see Doctor Zamboni.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Michael sat on the couch next to his father trying to be the voice of reason, while Tom was yelling at Teri about a combination of Michael\u2019s grades slipping since he got involved with Brittany and the way she and their son were currently dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease calm down. We\u2019re here to talk about things and see if we can resolve the matters at hand with some degree of mutual understanding. Now, in order to create a peaceful environment, I\u2019d like you all to take a few deep breaths and turn your attention to this watch.\u201d Zamboni asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter listening to the Jameson\u2019s express their concerns while under hypnosis, it came to light that Tom and Teri both felt Brittany, while being a nice, friendly and intelligent young woman, was bad for their son as he had become preoccupied with her to the detriment of his grades by staying out past curfew or hanging out most weeknights instead of concentrating on his studies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZamboni found out a few facts about the Jameson's:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeri owned a local boutique and Tom was vice president of a bank nearby. Both had gone to good schools and wanted their son to become successful, as well. They were upstanding citizens and good neighbors, involved on their son\u2019s activities and with the exception of some experimentation in college, neither had any real vices except for a few drinks with friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter digging deeper into their subconscious, they admitted:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom admitted to being a bit homophobic, flirting with a few women at the bank, watching porn when his wife was out of the house and secretly wishing to return to his childhood. Teri admitted to secretly having a dominate streak, but only acting on it outside her marriage engaging in B&amp;D and D/s with her trusted friends on girls night. She had a shoe fetish, loving the way she looked in heels and also having a \u2018thing\u2019 for one of the neighbor\u2019s husbands, but never acting on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael wished his parents would stop nagging him. He secretly hated playing sports and only did it because his parents pushed him into it. Since he had to play, he didn\u2019t think it was a big deal that his grades had dropped a bit, especially since he was a star on the football team and dating a cheerleader, not to mention, one of the hottest girls in school. He admitted he was still a virgin and that they hadn\u2019t gone all the way yet, but they had fooled around quite a bit. Michael enjoyed it when Brittany forced him to dress in her clothes, though he protested when she made him. He also admitted to thinking a few of his teammates were good looking, especially when they were in the team shower after practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany cared for Michael, and while she liked him, she was dating him more for the status it gave her in school than anything else. She felt guilty about it, but doubted it would last beyond graduation, and while \u201ctechnically\u201d she hadn\u2019t lost her virginity, she had given oral to a few other guys. If she was honest, Brittany would rather go back to being a tomboy. She hated all the clothes and make-up, acting peppy and girly as she actually preferred females, as she had been sexually active with a few of her girlfriends, some of them on the cheerleading squad. Her favorite times were when she was going down on one of them or when it was her turn to wear the strap-on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZamboni was excited with the possibilities of this foursome. He left them under while he went to check on the situation in the outer office. Earl was happily coloring on the table while George and Lisa had acted upon the suggestions he had left with them earlier.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Linda was mad at Bob due to his staying out late with his poker buddies. The couple walked in and Zamboni put them under his hypnotic trance quicky. He decided that they needed to walk in each others shoes literraly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Zamboni snapped his fingers the couple imeediately switched foot wear. Bob had his feet smashed inside of Linda's 3 inch Jimmy Choo pumps. Linda was wearing Bob's tennis shoes which fit her feet more comfortably than Bob's feet in Linda's shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they stood to leave Bob was towering over Linda. Zamboni made sure that Linda and Bob would swicth footwear until the next appointment. This meant Bob would wear Linda's shoes to work which would cause people to talk about him. Zamboni hypnotized Bob to tell people that his wife and him were into kinky sex and that this is what they chose to do. Of course the kicker being Bob was unaware of what he was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple talked to George and made an appointment for next week.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Michael went over to the salon to put his hair in order.  He hated the cut he had now it was just too butch for him.  He wanted something prettier.  He didn't know why he had gotten it cut this way in the first place.  He told the beautician what he wanted and she did her best to 'make his hair pretty.'  The woman working on his hair was a professional and so she didn't say anything about the boy in a dress who was getting his hair styled in a feminine manner.  Sitting in the chair Michael started a conversation.  They started to talk and Michael felt at home in the salon. He found he enjoyed talking about fashion, much more than he ever liked talking about sptorts.  He thought that sports made him hurt all over.  It also got him dirty and sweaty.  If Michael was going to get sweaty there was much more enjoyable ways to do it other than sports.  He had made a decision and he would tell Tom and Teri when he could.  He thought he should tell Tom first.  He knew exactly the right time to tell him, of course his mouth would be sort of full at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeri and Brittany went out as Michael had told them to, he really didn't care where they were, so long as they weren't home at the moment. Michael and Tom settled in for a quiet evening at home. They sat by television watching a movie on cable. Tom wore nothing but his pajama bottoms and his boxers. Michael wore a long nightgown with some silky panties. Michael rested his head on Tom's strong chest, his hand placed softly on Tom's crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom, I'd like to tell you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything, Michael\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom, I have been thinking. I want to quit the team at school.\" Michael advised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Michael playing sports is important. Teri and I both think you are very good and it could help you get a scholarship for college.\" Tom stated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but I don't really enjoy it.\" Michael said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really??? How can you be so good at it if you have never liked it?\" Tom asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say I never liked it. I just don't enjoy it now. I would prefer to do something else I that enjoy and would be good for the future.\" Michael stated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Tom questioned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I could go to work with Teri after school. I would like to learn more about the fashion industry and how to run the business. I think I would be really good at that. You compliment me on my fashion sense, and you know how much I love my shoes.\" Michael added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Tom thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Tom, that might look really good on a college application. too. Besides, we both know I am very good at that type of stuff.\" Michael stressed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are?\" Tom asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am very good at other things too.\" Michael suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Tom grinned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you.\" Michael pulled down Tom's pajamas and his boxers freeing his mostly flaccid penis. Michael then put Tom's penis in his mouth. Tom felt the warm of Michael mouth immediately. The blood rushed to Tom's penis and Michael showed Tom what else he was very good at. Michael took his time and so it took almost a half-hour for Tom to cum. Michael swallowed it all. He ran his tongue over Tom's spent cock, cleaning any remaining sperm that oozed down the shaft. \"Sports takes a lot out of me. I would must rather to save my strength for you,\" Michael said looking up at Tom, his mouth still only inches from Tom's penis. \"So can I quit sports?.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright.\" Tom said. \"But you will have to ask Teri. She might not want you working at the boutique.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinning over Teri was easier than winning over Tom.  Even though she was wearing a sports jersey she wasn't a big fan (yet) of sports.  She could also use the help at the boutique and with Michael there, a person she could absolutely trust, she could leave early and spend more time with Brittany.,  Teri agreed too.  A schedule was made for the times Michael would be expected to work.</span></div></div>",

As expected, Michael's teachers and classmates were shocked by the sudden transformation. He was ridiculed in the halls for the short time he was in school that day, but paid them no attention. Michael was almost a pariah around the building. Michael took more interest in what the popular girls were wearing, since he knew a few of them, along with their mothers, were clients at the boutique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany talked him between their classes, though since their relationship had changed drastically, all she wanted to talk about was Teri. Several times Michael caught himself rolling his eyes or sighing in frustration, as Brittany went on and on about Teri. He was beginning to think that maybe Brittany was bad for Teri and made a mental note to speak to Tom about the matter. Thankfully the bell rang, putting an end to the tedious conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well, bye, Mikey. I'll see you at the boutique this afternoon\" Brittney advised, as she began to walk toward her next class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...? Wait... why?\" Michael asked, holding his books chest high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany stopped to explain. \"Teri and I are going to the game after school. She said I should meet her there, then she's going to drive us. She wants to see me cheer. Apparently, she thinks I look hot in my cheer gear.\" she said, flashing a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... she's supposed to be teaching me. That's what work study is all about\" Michael said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I suppose she feels you're ready to take over all by yourself. You'll have to ask her. Darn, I'm going to be late. I have to get to class. You should, too. See you later\" Brittany said, as she disappeared around a corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael counted the minutes, willing the clock to move faster. He barely paid attention, wondering why Teri would leave him alone on his first day at the boutique. As soon as the bell rang, he went to his locker, grabbed his purse, a few books for homework and headed out to the parking lot. He almost forgot that he had agreed to switch cars with Teri. For some reason, she felt it would be better if she was driving the Mustang, so that left the BMW free for Michael to use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still upset, so he decided to call Tom and telling him about Teri's plans. Tom agreed to meet Michael at the boutique during his lunch break. Relieved, Michael stopped off for a salad and a cup of coffee on the way to his first day at work. Michael parked the car behind the shop, He checked his make-up in the mirror. Satisfied, he grabbed his things from the car and made his way through the rear entrance. Michael placed the books and food on the table in the stock/break room, smoothed out his teal knee length dress, then went to let Teri know he had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at the front counter, Teri was dressed in a black dress shirt that barely managed to contain her unsupported, braless breasts, with khaki slack and black loafers \"Oh, thank goodness. I though you'd never get here. I have to piss so bad. Keep an eye on things while I see a man about a horse\" Teri said, as she bolted out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the jingle of the bells announced the door had opened. Michael turned to see an attractive brunette woman in an off-white designer blouse, wearing a rather tight black skirt with 4\" heels. \"Good afternoon, ma'am. Can I be of some assistance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, thank you. I'm just looking\" she said, as she removed her designer sunglasses and placed them on her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Please let me know if I can help you find something\" Michael advised, as the woman made her way around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will. Thank you\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeri made her way back through the boutique, leering at the customer as she passed by, paying particular attention to her bust and rear. \"Wow, that chick is hot, isn't she?\" Teri asked, as she stepped behind the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, She's attractive, if that's what you're referring to.\" Michael replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really\" Teri said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So anyway, where should we begin. I am here to learn\" Michael advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are correct. I suppose we should start with the register, so you know how to ring up sales\" Teri said, as she looked over at the brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair went over ringing up sales, canceling them, refunds and exchanges. Michael learned the procedure to close out the register for the day. Just then, the customer came up to the register carrying a few items. Teri was about to assist the woman when Michael suggested that he should do it, since he was training. Teri reluctantly agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything else I can help you find today, Miss?\" Michael asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this will be all, for now\" the woman advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeri showed Michael how to use the scanner, running the tags underneath the beam of light. Each successful scan was acknowledged with a beep. After the last item was scanned in, Michael hit the total. The woman handed Michael her credit card. He ran it through, passed her the receipt to sign, along with a pen. Placing the signed receipt in the register, he handed the receipt to the woman. Teri have folded each item, placing them in a bag, then handing it to the customer. She made sure to lightly touch the woman's hand as she took the bad from Teri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Please come again\" Michael said, as the woman exited the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael gave Teri a look. \"Is that what you do all day, leer at the customers?\" Michael asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just the really good looking ones\" Teri chuckled\" it's only looking, and besides, I'm spoken for\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. I picked up some lunch on the way over. It's in the back\" Michael stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. I'm starving\" Teri said, leaving the counter to retrieve lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang again. Tom walked though the door. Michael felt his heart race, and he walked over to him. Without a word, the pair fell into a passionate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've missed you\" Tom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I've missed you, too. Its only been a few hours, but it feels like forever\" Michael said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom just nodded his head in agreement. Michael took Tom's hand and led him to the back room. Teri stood there \" What are you doing here... and why did You buy me a salad?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hello to you, too\" Tom responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, the salad is for me, I picked up a couple of burgers for you and Tom\" Michael replied, as he made his way around the table. \"Here\" he said, pull out the bag of burgers from the things he brought in from the car earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... well, thanks\" Teri replied sheepishly, as she took a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom took a seat and picked out a burger, as Michael sat and opened his salad. They sat in silence for a few minutes, before anyone said anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brittany told me you're going to a game this afternoon\" Michael said, as he picked through his greens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep\" Teri answered, her mouth full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're closing early\" Tom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... Michael will be here, why do I need to close?\" Teri asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's his first day. He doesn't know how to close up the shop\" Tom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show him, it's no big deal\" Teri responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me? You're going to leave him here alone in his first day...?\" Tom questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wants to be treated as a responsible adult, so, I'm giving him some responsibility. Besides, Brittany needs me to take her to the game\" Teri stating, making her case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She could travel with the rest of the team, she doesn't need you to drive her\" Tom replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I haven't seen her cheer for the team yet. Since Michael will be here anyway, things just worked out for us\" Teri replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I say no?\" Tom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, like I need your permission to see my girlfriend? You think I give a shit what you have to say on the matter? You don't want Michael in the store alone, then you leave work early and stay with him, because I'm going\" Teri said, slamming her hand on the table in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang. Michael looked at Teri, then got up. \"I... I'll take care of it\" he said, brushing his dress out, before walking out to the shop/<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Voices were raised quickly and it soon became a screaming match between the two. \"Hey!\" Michael bellowed, slamming several envelopes on the table. \"Enough of this garbage. You can't act like this, especially not here. We're just lucky it was only the postman. Next time we could lose a customer of something like this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right\" Teri apologized, as she took her seat to finish lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang again. Michael was about to sit back down when Teri looked at him and motioned her head, letting Michael know she would see to it this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Teri was out of ear shot, Tom expressed his anger \"She's impossible to talk to. It was never like this before, I can't stand it.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael rubbed Tom's shoulder, then put his hand on Tom's leg. \"It'll be fine. We're working on it, aren't we?\" he asked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure hope that Zamboni guy knows what he's doing because I can't take much more of this.\" Tom said, taking another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down. Now of this is doing either one of you any good.\" Michael said, as he rubbed Tom's leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Michael could feel the heat from Tom's crotch build, as his hand ran over Tom's penis. They looked at each other, then Tom leaned over in his chair. Michael shift slightly to meet Tom's lips, and the two kissed passionately. Michael ran his hand through Tom's hair, while Tom rubbed Michael's chest. Without warning, Michael winched in pain, pulling back from the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\" Tom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess you got me excited and there's not a lot of room down there. It's pinched\" Michael grunted in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom got on his knees and hiked Michael's dress up. He gingerly pulled the silk panties down, taking great care to free Michael's genitals from their clothe prison. The 9\" penis sprung from its confinement. Tom stared at it, placing his hand on the organ, rubbing it gently as Michael gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom shot Michael a look. \"You don't have to do that\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do, You're hurt and I need to kiss a boo boo. Besides, I finished all my dinner, so now I can have dessert\" as he took the head of the cock in between his lips, running his tongue over the lump of warm flesh, flicking the urethra opening several times. The flesh throbbed in Tom's mouth. He could feel the veins against the walls of his cheeks as he drew it deeper into his throat. Tom took the entire length several times, until Michael twitched  a few times, and spasmed, blowing semen into Tom's throat, some running out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpent, Michael splayed himself in the chair, as Tom continued to lap the cum from Michael's shaft and balls. Just then Teri came back in and began to shout \"What the hell are you doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it look like?\" Tom said, as he got up from his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me, giving a blowjob in my back room? You must be crazy. It's bad enough that I had to see it... and Michael, put that disgusting thing away. Tuck it deep. I don't want it to show it's ugly face in front of one of the customers.\" Teri advised  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Working on it\" Michael said, as the blood redistributed itself through out his body, allowing him to walk again. He pulled his panties up and made his way to the sink to clean himself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your problem lately. Teri. I am getting really tired of this attitude you've been throwing at everyone\" Tom said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well I'm tired of you thinking you can run my life and tell me what to do and when to do it. I want my freedom, it's like I'm being suffocated\" Teri said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael finished cleaning himself up. He took a paper towel, patting himself dry, he opened his legs enough to seat his spent penis between them, then clenched the shaft, securing it in place with his panties. He pulled his dress down and brushed it back into place, as the two continued their heated discussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeri turned to the towering figure \"So you're finally ready. Well, I hope you enjoyed your lunch\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. It was amazing\" Michael said, taking Tom's head in his hands, placing his lips on his and giving him a passionate kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes it was amazing.... wow\" Tom said, surprised but happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, great. Now get your ass out on the sales floor, and don't let me catch that penis out again.\" Teri demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael placed a hand on Toms ass and gave it a squeeze, as he walked around the pair to go back to the sales counter. A few minutes later, Tom came out, followed by Teri. They stood for a few minutes discuss different matters when the bell rang and Brittany stepped in. She first greeted Michael, stepping over to the counter, giving him a hug with a peck on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here so early?\" Michael asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ditched last class. It's study hall and I already did my homework. How has your first day been going?\" Brittany asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's, um... it's been interesting, that's for sure\" Michael replied as he watched Tom and Teri seem to heat up again. He tried to figure out what they ever saw in each other, given how bad things have gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brittany...could you join us please?\" Tom motioned toward Brittany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This doesn't look good, does it?\" Brittany asked, as she laid her purse and gym bag down behind the counter<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe skipped over to the pair, Teri reaching for the woman, planting a very passionate kiss on her lips, with Brittany responding in kind. \"You look amazing\" Teri said,\" how was school?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better now that I'm here\" Brittany advised<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom just shook his head in disgust. \"I'm leaving. Have to get back to work, but I will see you, when I get home\" Tom said, leaning in to give Michael one more kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for coming to have lunch with me\" Michael smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best I've had in quite some time\" Tom announced, as he stepped out the door.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You look really cute in that dress\" She said, skipping away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Brittany\" Michael said, as he watched Teri hold one of the changing room doors open for Brittany. They soon disappeared behind the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone rang. \"Exquisite Boutique. How may I help you?\" Michael answered. \"Yes ma'am. We're open until 6. Yes ma'am, we do carry Michael Kors. We look forward to seeing you. Thank you very much\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then several women entered; Two very tall blondes, though neither as tall as Michael in his heels, and a shorter brunette with long curly hair. All had noticeable cleavage, wore tight dresses with designer shoes and handbags. Michael took notice of all of this and felt a few pang of jealousy. \"Can I be of some assistance, ladies?\" he inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're just looking\" one of them advised, as they perused the many items in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael knew that Teri and Brittany had become otherwise involved in the changing room. He tried to discreetly make his way over, in hopes of getting Teri to come out and assist him with the customers. He found the door locked. Gently rapping on the door, he hoped to get her attention, but to no avail. The faint sound of moaning could be heard. Michael hoped the music loop that played on the store speakers would be enough to drown them out. He carefully excused himself, as he ducked into the stock room to retrieve the keys from his purse so he could unlock the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, Miss... do you have some place I could try this one?\" one of the tall blondes asked, holding a halter neck dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Ma'am. Let me open the door for you\" Michael said, walking over to the second try on room. \"Let me know if I can be of any assistance\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael quickly crossed the room and unlocked the other door as discretely as he possibly could. Slipping inside, he saw Brittany and Teri naked on the carpet, pleasuring each other. They're mouths were latched onto the other's vagina, their arms wrapped around the other's legs. He watched for a few moments in fascination as the pair began to shudder and moan, before finishing up. Brittany spun around an curled up next to Teri, as they spooned, gently kissing. Michael cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing here, you pervert?\" Teri said, as Brittany attempted to cover herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have customers waiting for assistance\" Michael said, as he turned to walk away. \"Oh, and by the way, I am not cleaning that up\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitch.\" Teri said, annoyed at the interruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit... look at the time. I have to get to the game\" Brittany said, as she shot up from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeri stood up as well. \"That was amazing. Thank you for that\" she said, as she hugged Brittany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I enjoyed it, too\" Brittany said, giving Teri a peck on the lips, as she grabbed her bag and pulled out her uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair got themselves put back together and exited the try on room, only to find an empty shop. \"Where are the customers?\" Teri asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I took care of them. They were very happy with the service and said they'd be back soon\" Michael said, folding clothes at the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then what was the rush?\" Teri asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rush... they left 15 minutes ago. They were here for almost an hour\" Michael explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Shit. I'm gonna be late and I still have to fix my hair and make-up\" Brittany said, \"Let me have my purse, please.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael hoisted the purse off the floor and handed it to Brittany. She took it and nodded her thanks, before bouncing off to the bathroom. She slammed the door behind her, as Teri's eyes followed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so you proved you can handle the store on your own. That's great because I'm leaving for the day just as soon as she's ready to go. I showed you how to close up. If you have any problems, you make sure to call Tom because I don't want to be bothered. Between that stunt you two pulled in the break room and just now interrupting me and my girlfriend, I really don't want to see any more of you today.\" Teri said, as Brittany rejoined them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All set. Time to go\" Brittany said, as she hugged Teri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. That was fast. Let's get out of here. I'm parked in the back.\" Teri said, as she glared at Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I can get out of clothes quickly when I need to. Bye, Mikey\" Brittany chirped, taking Teri's hand as they walked to the back entrance and out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Michael checked the security camera, then went back to open the door. A man in a brown uniform advised him he had several boxes for delivery, which the man brought into the stock room. Michael signed for them and the man left. As he opened them, he found out why Teri had named the store as she did. They were some of the most exquisite dresses he had seen. He held them up to his chest, as he looked in the mirror, and decided that some of these would have to be his. As he got down to the last box, he found sheer stockings and garters which clicked something in his mind. He found his size and put them aside, logging all the new stock in. As he finished the last item, he realized it was time to close up, he counted out the register, took care of the paperwork, locked everything in the safe. He double checked the locks. Grabbing his belongings, he set the alarm and exited the store, locking the back door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael had to remind himself again that he was driving Teri's car now. He put his things in the back and got into the driver's seat. Buckling up, he pulled the car out onto the main street for the drive home when something caught his attention, so he decided to pull over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the salon, he asked about a manicure. \"She can take you right away, if you just give me a moment, I'll let her know you're here\" the receptionist said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" Michael replied, as he looked around at the products on display. One in particular caught his attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's ready for you. The receptionist said, waiting to show Michael to his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are these any good?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a number of clients who have raved about them. They are easy to apply, and give length and volume. Are you interested, I could have someone show them to you while you're having your manicure.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be lovey. Please\" Michael replied, as was shown to his seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, my name is Carla. Have you given any thought to what you would like today?\" the manicurist asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Carla. I'm Michael. I was thinking some tips and a clear coat.\" Michael replied <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent choice. I think it will look fabulous on you\" Carla said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two made small talk for a few minutes, as Carla prepped and filed Michael's nails. The receptionist came over to show Michael the products he had inquired about. \"Wow, that looks amazing. I can't tell you have extensions at all\" Michael exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman went about putting several of them in Michael's hair, filling it out and lengthening it just past his shoulders. \"You can get them in many lengths and colors, if you want to add a splash of color or maybe lighten things up a bit. They're completely style able, so you can use your curling iron on them and when you're done, you just find the comb and remove each length, like this\" she explained<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness. I love it. I'll take it. Can someone help me with them while I'm having my nails done? I'd love to surprise Tom when I get home\" Michael said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I'll send on of our stylists over right away\" the woman said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom's a lucky man that you'd go through all this trouble for him\" Carla said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no trouble. I like to look pretty, but I'm the lucky one\" Michael said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Been together long?\" Carla asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've known each other as long as I can remember\" Michael replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stylist arrive and began to insert the extensions until Michael was happy with the look. He checked himself in the mirror several times, when he noticed something missing. He asked if they did ear piercing and was told they did, but in another area. The stylist finished giving him additional instructions on the care of his new extensions, and thanked him, as Carla finished up on his nails. After drying, Michael thanked Carla, gave her a generous tip, made his way to the piercing room where studs were put in. He paid his bill and went back to his car, pleased with his new look. He decided to stop off for sushi on the way home. He wasn't a fan, but he knew how much Tom liked it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael pulled the car into the driveway. Checking his watch, he knew Tom would be home soon. Rushing into the house, he put the sushi in the refrigerator, placed his books on the table and made his way to the bedroom to change his clothes. Michael has just finished setting the table when Tom came home. He wrapped his arms around him and the two kissed passionately for a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was your day?\" Michael asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Busy, as usual. How about yours, how was your first day at the boutique?\" Tom questions, as he took off his jacket and loosened his tie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was a lot to learn, but it went well\" Michael said. \"I'm sorry I didn't have time to cook. I picked up some sushi, I hope you don't mind\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I love it. Thank you\" Tom said, as he made his way to the table. \"Only two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Teri is out with Brittany. They went to the game\" Michael said, pulling out a seat for Tom<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she left you in the shop alone even after I told her not to?\" Tom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was fine. I got through it. Besides, now we have the house to ourselves\" Michael said, picking up a piece and feeding it to Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always looking on the bright side, aren't you? Hey, when did you get your ears pierced... and your hair. It looks great\" Tom said, as he took another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like?\" Michael asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I like\" Tom replied, as Michael got up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then maybe you'll like this as well\" he said, taking off his wraparound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom sat in silence, his mouth agape, as Michael twirled around. He wore a white satin bustier with matching panties. sheer white stockings with lace at the top and matching garter belt, and 4 inch white pumps. \"I'm still a virgin, so I thought, \"why not white?\"... So...?\" he asked a stunned Tom<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom swallowed hard, got to his feet, took Michael by the hand and led him upstairs as quickly as he could.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Put on your uniform so I get the full effect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh OK,\" Brittany said and then she started towards the changing rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe, you can change in front of me.  I won't bite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleeeeaaaasssseeeee....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany yielded to her girlfriend's request.  Besides in a strange way Teri wasn't just her girlfriend she was also just another woman and changing in front of her was no big deal.  Soon Brittany was removing her shirt.  Teri started 'singing' stripper music.  Brittany got into the mood and slowed her disrobing.  Taking off every piece of clothing with a flourish.  Teri clapped and sang while Brittany did her thing.  There was a big smile on both their faces.   Soon she was completely naked.  Her clothes scattered around the floor.  Brittany then put on her uniform, while Teri picked up her discarded attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany went through her routine to the great enjoyment of Teri who loved every bit of it.  After she was done, Brittany said they should go.  \"Just a minute, let me change of of these things and put on something more comfortable.  Something that'll look better in the stands.  Now it was time for Teri to strip.  Just as Teri had done before Brittany sang the same stripping song as Teri had just done.  Brittany didn't expect Teri to strip out of her underwear too, but she did.  Then Teri started to put on Brittany's discarded clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey those are mine,\" she said in a mock protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they look great on me,\" Teri said as she continued to dress.  After Teri was completely dressed in everything that Brittany had been wearing (including her low heels), Teri and Brittany exited the store and continued onto Teri's car.  They drove to the stadium and Brittany took her place with the other cheerleaders and Teri took a seat in the stands.  Teri looked like everyone else in the stands and she clapped wildly at the team, but really just for one member of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the game, Teri drove Brittany home complimenting her on all her moves.  Teri invited Teri into her house telling her her parents were away.  The neighbors who had promised to look in on Teri didn't see anything wrong with Teri entering the house.  If it was Michael they would have come over.  It didn't take long for Teri to phone home and say she was spending the night with Brittany.  Michael reminded Teri that she had to be at work in the morning.  \"Yes, Dad.\" Teri said sarcastically.</span></div></div>",

She was dressed like a seven-year old boy in a jungle cats t-shirt, jeans , sneakers and white socks.  But even dressed down as she was she looked like a hot woman.  The curves of her body and large breasts made any other conclusion impossible.  It is true that she didn't wear any makeup, she didn't have any sway in her walk and her hair had been hacked off and was now combed in school boy part on the left but she still looked like a hot woman.  But despite that her face looked very innocent and fresh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya ran out of the office into Jason's arm.  \"Hey honey bunch,\" Jason said to his mother.  \"How was it in there with Dr. Zamboni?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a lot of fun.  Dr. Zamboni has all these wonderful toys.  He let me play with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here he gave me one to take home.\"  Tonya pulled a huge realistic looking dildo out of her back pocket and showed it to Jason.  \"Isn't this great, were were just playing with this one.  I told him I really liked it and he let me take it with me.\"  A few minutes ago before coming out here, Tonya was indeed playing with the dildo.  She was completely naked and sticking the dildo in and out of herself.  They had also played with some vibrators and other sex toys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that is great honey.  What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya dutifully told Dr. Zamboni, \"Thank you, Dr. Zamboni.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your welcomed.  Well that is all for today.  Make an appointment before you leave.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and Tonya drove home.  Jason watched TV while Tonya played with her toys in front of him.  Tonya liked to play naked as many young children do.  She played with several toys some used to belong to Jason, but most were her own toys or those given to her by Dr. Zamboni.  Jason thought it was cute when Tonya would play with her vibrator or when she sucked on her dildo like it was a real penis.  Tonya has a wide collection of toys and she innocently played with them all naked in front of her son.</span></div></div>",

Tonya was on the ground grinding one of the sex toys the doctor provided her with. She had a 8 inch dildo plowing in and out of her vagina and was about to have an incredibel orgasim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was happpening Jason got a great idea. \"Tonya would you like to invite one of your friends over for a playdate.\" Jason asked Tonya. Tonya was sweaty from the incredible release she was experiencing. \"Oh that sounds great.\" Tonya replied. Jason went into the kitchen and doug out the family phone book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason dialed up Nick a playmate from his from school. Since school was not in he figured Nick would have some free time. Nick answered the phone call and Jason asked to speak to Nick's mother.  Nick found this to be rather strange and asked him why. \"Well I was hoping you could come over tomorrow and play with Tonya.\" Jason replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I come over and play with your mom?\" Nick replied. Jason did not understand why Nick did not understand his request. \"Look can I talk to your mother sweetie.\" Jason said. Ellen Nick's mother was then   put on the phone and at first could not understand why Jason was asking for a playdate with his mother. Ellen was a good friend of Tonyas and asked to speak with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was getting frustrated and blurted out. \"Look Ellen I just want to set up a playdate for the boys.\" Elen was speechless for a second and then said.\"Look, Jason we can both come over tomorrow, but I will be hanging out with your mom and you and Nick can play together.\" Jason took this as a victory and agreed to the arrangement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went back into the family room to tell Tonya about the activity that he planned for them. Tonya was deepthroating a realistic dildo that was at least 12 inches long. She mumbled her approval as she contined to suck the plastic toy.

Dr. Zamboni made a special house call to the Parkers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ellen and Nick arrived the next day there was no problem at all.  Tonya was playing naked on the floor.  She had her strap on dildo on but she was mostly playing with her titties until Nick arrived.  Nick took off his clothes when he saw Tonya and Tonya took out some KY jelly and lubed up her friend's butt.  Soon the two were playing together totally naked on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was watching Sesame Street when Ellen arrived.  She sat herself down besides him and the two started a conversation like they were old friends.  In front of them, Tonya and Nick were moaning in ecstasy.

I'll bet you were a real cutie.\"  Jason blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's Hal?\" Jason said to change the subject.  Hal is Ellen's husband.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's doing great.  He is spending the day at the salon today.  He is going to leach his hair blonde, just like yours I think.  He plans on getting extensions and then perm it with lots of curls.  He also wants to wax his body including a complete Brazilian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH GOD OH GOD.\" could be heard from Tonya's room.  Tonya had given Nick the strap-on to play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys can you keep it down in there,\" Jason shouted.  Then to Ellen, \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it should take him a while.  He is bummed he can't go shoe shopping after, but he has to get home and make dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screaming and shouting from the other room continued.  \"Maybe we should look in on the boys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they are having too much fun.  It's time for mommies to slow them down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pornographic seen that greeted Jason and Ellen would have a hard time being shown on cable but Jason smiled.  \"Ellen was right,\" Jason thought, \"To be young again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

She then got dressed to go out.</span></div></div>",

He said you and I would make a great couple together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Zamboni is very wise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason, and Tonya got into Lisa's car and they drove to drop Tonya off at Nick's.  Jason took Tonya to the door and then returned to the car.  \"Where are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Zamboni arranged for reservations at Chuck E Cheese for the couple.  Dr. Zamboni was hidden in the restaurant in case he was needed, but other than talking (not influencing) the hostess and waitress about the couple no changes were made to the staff at the restaurant.  The staff thought it was co cute for the two to play dress up and go out on a 'real date.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa believed she was Earl the tough as nails marine.  Jason's personality wasn't as cut and dried.  Jason thought he was a blonde bimbo although just like Tonya he wouldn't call himself one.  But he still had many tendencies of a little boy.  He loves Sesame Street and drinking chocolate milk with grilled cheese.  The edges had to be cut off the sandwich or he wouldn't eat it.  There was a bunch of other child-like behaviors to his personality.  Such as liking Chuck E Cheese.  Lisa considered these girlie behaviors and she would put up with them in order to 'get some' at the end of the evening.  Lisa knew that Tonya was out for the entire night so that was a good indication if she played his cards right, she and Jason would end the night doing some loving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two was expected by the staff and shown to a table in the corner.  The staff thought it was so precious how Jason and Lisa had dressed up for the occasion.  At their age, there was no way to tell that Jason was a boy and Lisa was a girl, they just assumed the proper gender depending on their attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two ordered a pizza and talking like adults.  Lisa told of her service in the marines trying to impress Jason.  She didn't give Jason a word in as macho guys often do.  But the bored look on Jason's face made Lisa know she went to far.  Lisa had to suffer on listening to what Jason thought was important.  It was worth it, if Lisa could get a hold of Jason's enormous melons (that he obviously didn't have, but both he and Lisa thought he did.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa found an excuse to put her hand on Jason's thigh.  When Jason didn't protest, he became even bolder.  The staff just loved watching the lovebird (children) act like they were having a real date.  Jason and Lisa dated like adults without anyone in the restaurant knowing.  But soon it was over, Lisa paid for the meal and the two left to go to Jason's house for a nightcap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Zamboni was pleased that the two could come out in public without anyone having to be influenced by him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The entire family was unhappy because in their hearts they couldn't do what they wanted to do.  Society and their upbringing made it impossible.  Dr. Zamboni assumed that this was true with lots of people, but for this family it was definitely true.  Dr. Zamboni for the first time ever decided to actually help by removing all the societal restraints put on the family and let them live their lives as they wanted to.  Dr. Zamboni told them to come back in a month to see how they were getting along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne Month Later....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeri wanted to be in charge and she now was.  She walked in dressed completely in black leather and was completely in charge of her family.  Tom wanted to be younger and Teri took charge regressing him even farther back than he wanted to be.  Tom wore a onesie over a diaper.  His hands were covered in thick mittens making them nearly useless and on his feet he wore thick slippery booties which made walking difficult.  If Michael hadn't been holding his hand, Tom couldn't have walked into the office (he would have to crawl like he usually did.)  He had a pacifier in his mouth that was tied in place so he couldn't take it out and made anything he said difficult to decipher.  Teri had taken over his life.  Teri decided everything for him.  Even though everything Tom wore looked 'babyish' it was closer to bondage since each article of clothing was designed to limit what he could do.  Tom had to submit to any demand from Teri which satisfied Teri's S&amp;D streak.  Of course Teri would only give Tom permission to to only the most babyish things.  His days of working, flirting and watching porn were over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael had be thrown out of school for an incident that happened in the locker room some of his teammates.  He didn't want to be on the team any way.  Teri was very disappointed in her son and tried petticoat discipline to snap her boy back into the straight and narrow.  But Micheal liked that.  She tried more and more extreme measures, now Micheal isn't her son anymore.  Not really, he is her maid and nanny to Tom.  It is Micheal's job to make sure the house is clean, Tom is kept safe, well fed (spoon feeding of course or by a bottle) and entertained watching bright colorful children's shows (for Tom, even Sesame Street is too advanced.).  Michael is usually dressed in his maids uniform, although when he goes out on occasion, he wears the clothing that Brittany used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany was thrown out of her house by her parents when they found out what a slutty lesbian she was.  She now lives with the Jamesons.  She had become a bull dyke and is 'dating' several of her former friends from cheerleaders.  She is also dating several other women.  She doesn't want a full time monogamous relationship with anyone.  Micheal owns all her old clothes but doesn't have the opportunity to wear it often.  Brittany (who now goes by the name Brit) picked through Micheal's old clothing and only selected his sports jerseys and button down shirts and dress pants.  The rest of her attire she took from Tom's closets and drawers.  She also watched the porn that formerly belonged to Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Zamboni mused to himself, \"Like the Brady Bunch, this group had finally formed a family.\"  The Brady bunch theme song continued to plague his thoughts for the rest of the day.  Maybe Dr. Zamboni should leave the family as it is.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once inside his office, Dr. Zamboni ascertained what have happened exactly.  The first thing he found out was the Tom was now totally miserable.  He didn't want to be how he was in anyway.  Teri had become dominant in the relationship and when Tom said that he wish he could quite his job and return to the days of his youth Teri hatched a plan.  Tom did indeed quit his job but he found that soon Teri had taken over his life and had put him in the baby costume he always wore.  She had started with the mittens that make his hands useless.  Then through strict physical discipline and a little planning, she had him in his diapers and stuck in a completely infantile life.  He was completely dependent on 'his caretakers' now.  He couldn't do anything without help.  Even playing with blocks was a struggle.  With his hands bound in mittens he couldn't release the snaps of his onesie, let alone get his diaper off.  With the pacifier in his mouth he couldn't speak and when it was out, his mouth was so sore he still couldn't speak for quite a while.  The shoes were so slippery it made walking almost impossible unless he could hold onto something.  If he refused to play along, Teri delighted in spanking him with her paddle.  It didn't take long before Tom's resistance was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael enjoyed the release of his femininity.  In the end, he found his life as a nanny and a maid as perfect expressions of his inner womanhood.  It tapped on his domestic and motherly instincts.  At first Tom tried to appeal to his son, but Michael had resented all the things that Tom had done to make 'a man out of him'.  Now he enjoys the payback of making a baby out of his dad.  Michael actually enjoys putting headphones on Tom's head that he obviously can't remove and having baby and toddler music playing full time that only Tom can hear.  Tom's life is strictly regimented into periods of time.  He has to wake up at an exact time and goes to sleep at an exact time.  There is nap time, bottle time, breakfast, lunch and dinner time, play time, TV time, bath time.  Every second of Tom's like is accounted for and it never changes. Dr. Zamboni recognized that if something isn't done, Tom's mind would revert to mush very soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeri is the boss at work and the boss at home and the boss of her friends.  If a person doesn't submit to her, they will be thrown out of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany has become the family handyman to pay for her room and board.  She has been working out religiously and has become pretty strong.  She painted the guestroom which is now the nursery.  She also discovered she is quite good at woodworking and actually manufactured the crib that Tom now sleeps in.  She has many projects around the house.  She wants to make all the furniture in the nursery.  She is painting the rest of the inside of the house and will do so to the outside too.  If there is a problem with an appliance she takes care of it or anything else that requires a tool to fix.  In the short time since the last visit, Brittany's muscles have become hard and her hands have become calloused.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Zamboni wanted to do something to put his own imprint on the family, but they seem to be perfect with out him.  It was driving him nuts since he wanted to be the one to make changes to the family.  But he didn't feel like he did anything.  Dr. Zamboni couldn't think of anything.  He decided to send them home and have them come back later.  Maybe he would think of something then</span></div></div>",

She was no longer bound by the priorities of society on a woman.  She could go wild as it were without the concern of modesty.  She looked down at her chest and removed her tank top, exposing her bra and boobs.  She then tore off her bra (she pulled it off like she pulled off her shirt, not by unfastening it in the back) and started to play with her boobs.

He wanted to show this person she couldn't do that with his body.  He was also very turned on.  Bryan approached Lauren determined to attack her sexually.  He reached out and grabbed Lauren by her upper chest, touching her breast somewhat.  But before he could get there, he realized that it was in effect his body he would be attacking.  He would be raping himself.  He couldn't do that.  What if this was temporary, would he want to return to a body that was raped.  Besides he was a woman really (he thought) how could he do that to 'another woman.'   It was very confusing and that snapped him out of it.  He couldn't rape himself so he couldn't follow through on the next part of Dr. Zamboni's instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren said, \"You attacked me.  My lawyer will be hearing about this.  I'll get you fired.  I'll sue you for millions.  When I get through with you not only will I have your body but I'll have all the money you possess.  Make that I'll have all the money both of us possess.  Besides it your fault for the accident.\"  With that Lauren bounded out of the office screaming.  Setting things up for her future lawsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was back to sobbing.  He had lost his body (or so he thought) now even the life he was forced to lead would be ruined.  All because he got into a little accident.  He didn't know how this had happened or what to do about it.  Then he looked at Dr. Zamboni.  \"Doctor, you saw I didn't do anything to her.  You will tell them won't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see what I can do.  But for now, I have patients upstairs.  Here is my card, call me tomorrow.  You probably should get back outside.  The police should be here soon.  You don't want them to think it was a hit and run.\"  With that Bryan scampered outside.  If you can say a person over 300 pounds can scamper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Zamboni went to return to his office.  But on the way there, he saw George and Earl in the hall.  \"What is going on here?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge told Dr. Zamboni that \"Lisa had to use the little girls room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

The husband was named Joe and the wife was named Kelli. The two young boys were rather rowdy and that was why the family was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe husband was taken a back when he saw George walk over and greet them. Joe was not the kind of man, who was open minded about crossdressing or anything out of the norm. He was a smaller sized man and this gave him trouble in the self image department. Joe was very sensitive about his height and when George walked over to greet him he towered over Joe in his heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe was dressed in a polo style shirt and khaki brown pants and loafers. His wife, Kelli was very attractive. She looked like Colleen Lopez from the Home shopping channel. Her hair was styled just like Colleen. If you are unsure of what that looks like then please google her picture. She was wearing a cute blouse that was sleeveless and some jeans that wear rolled up at the ankle. She also had on some pumps which cause her to be about an inch taler than Joe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys were running around the office and Kelli was having trouble controlling them. Joe was grumbling to Kelli about the freaky looking secretary who was clearly a man dressed like a woman. \"What kind of nut house is this?\",Joe said rather loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course his comment made George feel bad and he turned around and entered Zamboni's office to announce thier arrival. Zamboni could tell that his secretary was not her cheery self and decided Joe needed to experience a little feminie liberation and he devised a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family entered the office and immediately Zamboni put them under. He decided that Joe needed to dress more appropriately. He hypnotized Joe to wear all of Kelli's clothes. The caveat was that he would know that he should not be dressed this way, but could not help himself. This would further crush his self esteem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the two young boys they were hypnotized to become focused on what there father was wearing. Whenever they saw their dad dressed like mom they would calm down and make fun of him. They would call him a freak or a nut job. Of course this was done behind Joe's back. They would also take pictures of him dressed like mom and post it on thier facebook page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe would become very angry about this but could not fight the compulsion to wear his wife's clothes. Kelli would allow Joe free access to her wardrobe and would assist him in learning fashion tips and even buy him a wig so that his hair would be like hers. She would treat Joe like a sister and they would go out together as sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZamboni really liked this idea.</span></div></div>",

The boys were calmer and the family thanked Zamboni for his help. Joe was impressed with how fat the doctor's methods worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow doc that was quick\", Joe stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As the family was getting ready to leave he asked his wife a bizarre question. \"Hey honey can I wear your bra and top.\" Joe looked stunned. He looked around the room to see if someone else was talking but realized those words came from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay sure,\" Kelli responded and the two went into the restroom. When they returmed Joe was wearing Kelli's blouse and bra. Kelli was now in Joe's polo and braless. Her breast swayed underneath the shirt. His two sons began laughing hysterically at there father. Little Timmy looked at his brother and said, \"Wow! what a nutjob dad is becoming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe's face turned bright red as he knew that he should not be wearing his wife's top much less her bra. He wanted to go back and put his shirt on but instead asked Kelli to swap shoes with him. He explained to her that her 3 inch heels might give him a little height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Kelli compensated with his request and the family was heading home with Joe halfway dressed like his wife.</span></div></div>",

But when he got into a complete outfit he just didn't have the right shape for a woman.  It was true that with the right makeup his face could look somewhat feminine, but the rest of his body despite his lack of height didn't look womanly.  Joe couldn't fight his compulsion so he resolved to only dress at home.  No one wanted Joe to lose his job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe would sacrifice all his outdoor activities to be home as soon as possible and put on the clothes he felt he needed to wear.  He stopped going out with friends.  No more drinks with the staff after work.  Dinner parties with other couples were out too.  Joe became a homebody in his wife's apparel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelli hated seeing her husband like this so she helped him with a few changes.  The first thing was that he had to shave all over.  At first Joe was reluctant but Kelli said since he wore a suit to work everyday who would know.  Since Joe's legs weren't as shapely as a woman's he would compensate but always wearing pantyhose with his outfits.  Something Kelli rarely did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was more than just hairless legs and arms (well the whole body) to make Joe passable.  He needed falsies and padding for his hips and butt.  Kelli loved her husband's tight manly butt, but to fit into a dress any other womanly clothing he would need something  more shapely.  Kelli found silicon pads for Joe's butt and hips and falsies to be put into Joe's bra cups.  She even ordered one of those Genie Hour Glass waist cinchers she saw on TV.  This gave him the proper shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found him a wig and soon, Joe was passable but he refused to go out anyway.  This disappointed Dr. Zamboni who was hoping Joe would be dressed up pretty when he visited the office the next week.  Joe explained that his son's made so much fun of him that he didn't have the confidence to be seen in public.  Kelli assured him that he looked great, but Joe couldn't do it.  It seems the boys had become 'just as rowdy' as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Zamboni said that maybe the kids needed a private session.</span></div></div>",

Dr. Zamboni started, \"When you make fun of your dad it is very hurtful to him.  You don't want to hurt him or hurt anyone if you can help it.  You hate all sorts of conflicts this includes playing games which have a winner because it will make the loser feel bad.  You prefer activities where everyone can feel good.  You love to dance.  That is one of the things you find the most fun.  You love to twirl around and be graceful.  You would rather be graceful than to be strong.  You prefer delicate movements to powerful ones.  You want to flow with the rhythm.  That is why you also love rhyming clapping games and jumping rope rhymes.  You would prefer to skip than to run fast.  You absolutely hate fighting of any kind.  You are concerned with people's feelings and you want people to feel good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything you like is soft and gentle not hard or rough.  You love to color but the colors you prefer are all pastels.  You tend to avoid primary harsh colors.  You love to make things pretty.  Adding bows, ribbons and everything cutsie makes things look better for you.  You find boy's clothing and the things boys do too rough and harsh for you.  You prefer the things that girls do, from their pretty soft panties to the ribbons in their hair to the cheerful music they listen to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to spend time with the nice girls, not those dirty disgusting boys.  You are embarrassed that you are a boy.  You can't let the nice friendly girls know you are a boy so you will act twice as girly than they do.  It is only by being very girly can you find yourself worthy to being friends with girls.  You can't let anyone know you are not a girl.  You won't do anything a boy would do so you can disguise yourself as a girl.  You will refer to each other as my sister or use feminine pronouns to help him keep his disguise with everyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Zamboni continued giving the boys instructions that would turn them into complete pansies.  Once Dr. Zamboni finished with Morgan and Taylor, their parents had been brought into the office.  \"OK,\" Dr. Zamboni said with a big smile.  \"I have talked to the kids.  I don't think they will be a problem again.  But you should transfer them to a new school.  The old school is a bad influence and they could relapse.  You should also buy them some new clothes for their new school to have a fresh start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family left Dr. Zamboni's office after making another appointment.  The paperwork to transfer Morgan and Taylor to a new school would be done immediately then they would go shopping for a new wardrobe.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Joe is wearing a pretty light blue knee length dress with short sleeves and a square neck.  His makeup de-emphasized the angular features of his face and his hair in long waves and bangs hides the rest of his manly facial features.  His arms, chest, back and legs had been shaven, but one Dr. Zamboni could tell because he had seen him before.  Taupe pantyhose and blue pumps completed his apparel. The padding underneath his clothing was expensive and impossible to detect.  He looked like a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys were dressed in dresses with the same design but differing colors.  Morgan's above the knee length dress was in a pale blue and Taylor wore a pale peach colored dress of the same design.  Other than that they were identically dressed, from the white tights and shoes, to the ribbons in their hair and the earrings in their ears as well as the cutsie purses they carried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe was bubbling up with enthusiasm.  \"Everything is great now Doctor.  Now that Morgan and Taylor have stopped fighting, Kelli and I can go out.  We have such fun when we are out.  We go out to dinner and movies and this weekend we even went out to a museum.  We don't have to worry about the babysitter calling to tell us that the boys are getting into fights.  Of course your secretary Carry comes over whenever we need her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad, but I think I should talk to Morgan and Taylor alone to make sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan and Taylor were always close, the doctor decided to make them even closer.  He put them under.  \"Morgan and Taylor you love eachother don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" they said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, but now you are going to love each other even more.  I know you sleep in the same room, but from now on you will sleep in the same bed too.  You love to snuggle up and hug each other while in bed.  You enjoy holding hands whenever you are together and it is quite common for you to give each other's pecks on the cheek when you are out in public.  It is perfectly normal for you to touch each other by giving hugs, touching each other's shoulders or backs to show support and closeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when you are alone you know that you share a secret that no one else knows and that brings you closer.  Only you know that you both have penises.  You both hate your own penis but you will never do anything about it since you know that each of you loves your siblings penis more.  When alone, you enjoy kissing each other on the mouth and even sticking your tongues into each other's mouths.  You enjoy the feel of each other's skin on in your hands.  You think each other's penises are so pretty that you want to look at it, touch it and even kiss or lick it.  You will do all these things to show your love for each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The extensions took a long time to put in, especially since they would have to be colored and styled after applied.  Becky couldn't wait that long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to get home,\" Becky told Mike.  \"If I'm not around, my husband starts acting like a little girl.

Never in his life did he realize how much fun it was to be in women's clothes.<br>\r\nHe carefully walked toward the door in confident strides. He tried desperately to imitate the way Becky taught him to walk. On his way he grabbed Becky's purse with all of her personal items in it and slung it on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I am ready to party.\" Mike beamed. With that he confidently walked out into the waiting area. It was a sight to behold a grown man dressed fully as one of Dr. Zamboni's female patients.

You are in my dress...and my heels??? How did you fit in my tights??? Jake please don't tell me you have my panties on.\" He was horrified. How could his son be so perverted.

He walked over and spun around. \"Help me out of this dress.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake walked over to her son and pulled down on the zipper reveling the un-nerving fact that he was wearing Jake's bra. Shelly stripped off his mother's dress and pulled down the tights he awkwardly wore. \"My word Jake\" Jake said seeing her son in just in her panties. These were her favorite pair too. They matched her bra with Shelly now wore and hugged his breasts perfectly. \"Doctor, is there a changing room. I need a private chat with my son over here.\" Jake said holding up her shoes dress and tights will he son just stood there in her bra and panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Shelly\" He said to Jake. \"The restrooms are just down the hall.\"......  </span></div></div>",

One couldn't just snap one's fingers and all would be fine, there needed to be planning.  Everyone would have to become involved.  Everyone would have to fulfill their part.  So he got them all under his hypnosis and gave them instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge was the head of the household and so Zamboni started with him first.  \"George,\" he said \"You must buy some new furniture for your guest room.  Will spend the next week, picking out a large playpen, a changing table, dresser and mirror, chest, nightstand and a large comfy chair that rocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly you will get the rooms accents.  Get a rug, bed linen, curtains and wallpaper in a style for toddlers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake you will come home everyday right after school and wait for the stuff to be delivered.  You will place the furniture around the room, hang the curtains and put up the wallpaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyndi your dad will give you money and you will go everyday to drug stores and buy baby supplies.  You must buy diapers (Zamboni explained which sizes), bottles, baby food, pacifiers, bibs, toys for toddlers and anything you think babies need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZamboni then had a decision to make, who should he give this final assignment too.  But there was only one choice, \"Shelly your body will start producing milk.\"  This would take some time, her brain would tell her body to produce hormones.  The body does anything the brain tells it.  It wouldn't happen over night but soon, Shelly breasts would be producing milk.  Cyndi really couldn't do it, at 11 she hadn't started puberty yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will all return in two weeks.  You are happy, you all feel like you are finally doing something to help.\"</span></div></div>",

Jake was a strong back and put the room together and hung the curtains and the wall paper.  Cyndi wasn't embarrassed in the least to buy all the baby stuff.

In two weeks the room was ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it takes more than two weeks to start producing milk, so they weren't totally ready when they visited Zamboni.  Zamboni then gave them some more commands.  \"You all must spend at least two hours a day watching Nick Jr together.\"  Nick Jr has programming for the youngest children.  \"You will all enjoy the closeness of being together as a family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"George, Jake and Cyndi when you get stressed, you will find that putting your thumb in your mouth and sucking very soothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome back in two weeks.\"</span></div></div>",

This was going to be a total group event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that special day, all of the guests were seated in the large hall.  A buzz was heard from the guests as they anxiously waited.  Soon the music started and everyone looked to the back of the room.  There stood Shelly and George.  Shelly wore a handsome blue pin-striped suit.  She wore a white button down shirt and a blue tie.  She work dark blue socks and black oxford shoes.  Even though she didn't wear any makeup she did look very good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge had on a full length strapless junior dress with a matching belt at natural waist and subtle high-low hem which showcased his hairy legs. It had a pleated skirt and a straight neckline that was fitted to stay up on the flat chest of a younger girl.  On his feet he wore light tan ballet flats.  The only makeup he wore was a hint of blush and pale pink lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly and George walked down the isle in unison.  First the right foot then feet together, then the left foot and then feet together again until the yreachesd the stage.  Then they split off with one moving to the left and the other moving to the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyndi was next.  She was dressed in a tuxedo.  She was very dapper looking with her ruffled shirt and bow-tie.  She also wore oxford shoes on her feet similar to those that Shelly wore.  Once she got to the stage, she took her place by her mother, in front of the priest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the music changed to \"Here Comes The Bride\" and Jack appeared.  He looked elegant in his thin spaghetti strapped wedding dress with draped chiffon bodice and full tulle ballerina skirt.  Feathered flowery details were at the waist.  A long cathedral train trailed behind him.  With his hair done up elegantly and his flawless makeup only the people who knew him, knew he was a boy not a woman.  There was a broad smile on his face, he felt like the luckiest woman in the world on her wedding day.  He slowly glided down the aisle towards the priest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd was too shocked and embarrassed to say anything.  A pin could be heard in the hall as the priest began, \"Dearly beloved we are gathered here to....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
