            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the Beginning there were, but two races. The tainted and the Archerian. One, demonic, yet peaceful and honorable. The other, angelic, yet waring and forgiving.<br>\r\nThe two races co-exested for a time. Until one day a Tainted and an Archaian had found true love in one another, A forbbiden love. This was forbbiden, because of a pact made when everthing began and this pact stated, \"one of Demons and one of Angels shall never bare child or love for if this happens life as we know it will be altered forever and a new more powerful race shall see life.... this race will worship us for a time and then forsake us leading to our inevdible demise should this happen.\" Yet these two did not care for their love was stronger than any existance had ever seen. <br>\r\nThe two bore a child and they named this child Human. Human was shunned and hated as were Human's parents. They were cast out of their home on to a new land. This new land would be home to Human. Though do to the outrage of the two races they seperated the lovers from each other and their child. One cast into the heavens above and the other to the earth below. The parents cried day and night creating water and land. Their sorrow created the plants which only wanted them to be happy. Their anger created the mountains as they cried out in rage. Their love created the animals so that their child may be happy.<br>\r\nHuman found these animals usefull. Human used them for food, entertainment, and for clothing. The parents saw that once the animals were just \"utensils\" and not company they showed Human how to make more of Human's self. Human cristend this forsaken race Humanity after Human's self. Humanity grew and took over the world. Though the people longed for something new to do other than cultivate and eat. So the parents decieded to make them some friends. The tainted brought the dead back to life so that they could live with there families though the tainted left Human's corpse alone. Humanity grew bored with this and found that it was quite creepy in fact so they forgot about them and these undead left to a place were they could wallow in their self pitty.<br>\r\nAfter this failure the Archaian created an amazing race called the Draconians. Humanity found the Draconians to be amazing and beautiful like their creator. Humanity and the Draconians became great friends and found many kinships together. The parents were happy that their children thrived so well.<br>\r\nThe tainted attempted to create life once more and accidentaly morphed a childed into an infected beast. Humanity was terrified at this and began shunning them just as they were shunned by their former family. These blights as Humanity would call them were cast out of socitity. The infected found there homes in the woods, the caves, and the mountains were no one would ever find them. <br>\r\nThe tainted was upset that the tainted could not create life as well as the other parent could. The Archaian made a sub-race just for the tainted so that the tainted would no longer be upset. These sub-races were called elves, dwarves, orcs, ect. The tainted thought this a wonderful gift and swore that they would be protected. Thus they were crisined the Proteceterate.<br>\r\nThough there came a time were the parents wanted affection more than the other. So to keep things from turning violent they compramised that the good children would go to the heavens for a reward while the bad children would go down into the earth and be punished for their wrong doings. So this worked out in the end, because they were getting the same amount of affection from the children now.<br>\r\nThe parents saw that after this last compramise the children were finnally happy and thus no more races were created. As time went on the children came up with names for the parents and the good children and the bad. The good were called angles while the bad demons. The parents excepted these names. The parents now thought that the children who now call themselves the originals were finally well of enough that they didn't need them any more so the parents entered a slumber.<br>\r\nWithout their guidence the races went out of control and began wars and fighting claiming they were the strongest. These race then formed factions called the Originals, the Draconians, the Proteceterate, the Blight, the Forgotten, and the Forsakers. The Forsakers were ones who believed they have always existed and that there were no parents. Everyone hated them, but they were very sligh with their words and quickly became a formidibale power. <br>\r\nThen one day the tainted awoke to the sound of war and death. The tainted saw what had happend and then the tainted saw the Forsakers. This was an outrage to believe that some children believed that there were no parents the tainted to matters into the tainted's own hands. The tainted cursed the leader of the Forsakers wife to bare a child, but not just any child a pure demonic child that would punish the children for all the things they have done.<br>\r\nWhen this child was born the leader saw that it was a demon and ripped of the wings and cloked the child for the rest of the childs life. The child hated his father for how he treated him, but he loved his mother for how accepting she was. One day the father was being questioned about this rumor of a demon child, he then proceded to remove the comment from the metting. Once he got home he found his child and took him to a lake were he proceded to throw him into the depths. The child was dieing and he kicked and thrased yet he could not swim. The mother saw this and jumped in after her son to save him. The father yelled, \"No dont do it its an abomination!\" The mother stilled did it though she was able to save the child, but at the last moment she was caught in a draft and swept under and she died. <br>\r\nHaving seen this act of pure love and acceptance the tainted regrets what the tainted had released upon this world. The tainted had only one option and that was to post pone tell the other parent had awoken. So the tainted took the childs power and put into a magical amulate which the tainted then threw to the heavens. The rightouse ones would defend this artifact until the other parent awoke.<br>\r\nNow we tell the story of this child after his almost all of his powers were stripped from him and his quest to regain it and those who would apose the childs rise to power.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Draco (The child) lived a terrible life after his mother died. His father was determined to be rid of him yet he respected his former wifes wishes to much to do this. Through the years Draco's demonic features began to come back. By age 7 he was turning a darkish color almost black (I mean the color black not the race black) His father so ashamed of him hid him in a cloak. Draco never took this off because of what his father told him. \"This cloak was your mother's and I want you to wear it and never take it off.\" By age 8 Draco had begun to farm with his mother's old scyth while his father was off working trying to convert those who were \"deluded\" as his father said. One day his father came home drunk after succefully converting a whole town. His father came up to him got on his knee's and cried \"Why, Why did she have to \"hick\" go and save you \"hick\" DEMON!\" Draco still didn't understand why his father called him a demon when he didn't believe in the parents. \"Why do you call me that father?\" asked Draco. \"I call you that because your a DEMON you are not of this world you are not human!\" His father screamed at him. This was something the father would regret later on. Draco now having learned the truth had a bit of a mental break down where his personality split in to three other beings. These beings represent the feelings he had at that moment (guilt) [rage] {uncarring knowledge} After the mental breakdown Draco picked up his father and tossed him into the wall instantly knocking him out. Draco says \"Oh my gosh what have I done!\" (You should be ashamed of your self) [What no you should be proud] {Really don't care just know that it will cause problums later on} <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this little repercusion and Draco's father awoke Draco was severly punished forced to do all possible chours and having a sever beating. By age 9 Draco had a seed planted in him. A seed of vengance. Draco had been thinking on his fathers words that unfortunet night and had come to the conculsion. \"He wanted me dead, my own father wants me dead!\" Draco felt betrayed by this relisation. He began ploting every day from that day forth how to kill his own father. \"It wasn't my faulght my mother died it was all HIS!\" was what kept going on in Draco's mind. By age 10 which was the day Draco was old enough to get his own job or become an aprentance. Even though his father resented him he wanted his child to make good money so that he could leach off of him. Though still oblivious to the sething haterade Draco felt towrads him he sent his child to a blacksmith to become an aprentance. Draco spent the next three years froging a single blade to show his worth to his master. The blade was long slick in appearance. It glistend in the sun light as if it were made of chrom. The blade had wiered markings (the ancient language of the gods and goddess) that enchanted the blade with a dark aura. The blacksmith was astonished by the blade itself not to mention the dedication put forth on it. The blacksmith said to Draco \"This blade is so beautiful that I can not take it from its forger no you must keep it.\" Draco now 13 thought to himself \"This man was more of a father than his real one was.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco left on a quest to return to his home. He traveld through the towns of the Originals taking in the sights along the way. \"Dear lord these people are evil, are there truely only a select few good people.\" he wispered under his cloak. Once he reached his home he desided to actually take the time to explore it since he never actually left the house since it was forbidden. He found that his home was just a small hamelt nothing more nothing less. \"I thought this was a busseling city full of converts the way father alwaysed talked about it.\" Then that reminded him why he had come here. He had come to pay his fare wells to his soon to be dead father. \"This is the time I will finally be rid of that slimy bastard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco went into the tool shed to find his mothers scyth. He finds it and walks into the house and began waiting for the moment he would stike. In his head a morale debate went one (No don't kill him hes your only family!) [Do it he tried to kill you and he's what got mom killed!] {I am going to have to agree with guilt on this one you kill him you will have nothing left} Draco wasn't listening though just waiting biding his time. At around sun set his fater retuned home to find his son there with his former wifes scyth. \"Wha-what are you doing here son?\" He said with an almost fearful voice after looking at Draco's glowing red eyes under his cloak. \"Just remembering the good old days.\" Draco said as he moved his bluish-black hand with his red claws over the scyth practicly sharping it. \"O-o-ok then well its...\" \"Oh I am not done yet dear father I wanted to show you something\" Draco said interupting his fathers words. \" Whats it you want to show me.\" his father said practily shaking with fear. \"I wanted to show you mom.\" \"what...\" was all his father could get out before he let out a blood curdeling scream as his head was sliced of. Draco dropped the scyth. \"What did I just do.... NOOOOOO!\" Draco dropped down and began to cry for his now dead father. The neighbors heard the screams and came running over quickly when they oppend the door they saw Draco and his dead fathers decapetated head. \"By the infinte!\" one screamed. They quickly aprehended an emotinaly destroyed Draco. They took him to the \"new\" hamlet leader since Draco had killed the former one (His father) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat madness is this a child murdering his own father! shouted someone from the crowed. Draco still emotinaly destroyed said nothing just stared out into the nothingness that was this world. \"Quiet, Quiet, I and the other elders believe that this man should be cast out of society and forever forced to live of the lands, since he is to young to be executed.\" They all cheered as they tossed him out of the village into the Blighted forests. \"My family is dead, My home is taken, My reason is lost..... no I have a new reason, To gain my vengence upon these blasted humans for their hainess crimes against order!\" As Draco traveled through the Blighted forest he came to a Draconian town of Draconis Verxis. This was home to the exiled Draconians and was Draco's refuge for the next ten years. (the exiled only existed in draconia because that was the only land were the taint had spread and were demons were born the only exception being Draco.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow we begin Draco's rise to power over this town and the beging of his revenge upon humanity!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Draco wnader up into the town of Draconis Verixs.  As he walked upto the gate he noticced something odd.  He had noticed a drunk man banging on the gate yelling, \"Your nothing, but a bunch of demons you ugly tainted fools!\"  This man reminding him of his father had quickly infuerated Draco.  (now lets be rational he might be drunk) [go for it do it do it bash his head in] {no comment}.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough as these alter personas raged in argument excluding one,  The guard had walked up to the man and said, \"Sir I may ask you to quickly and quietly vacante the land effective immedatly.\"  The drunk responded, \"Pffft and what are you going to do about it tainted one kill me? HA that start a war I think not.\"  The guard was helpless knowing what the drunk though delodid said was true.  Draco walked up to the man and said to him \"Please sir could you leave?\" in the most soul crushingly childish way he could (this man dosent know does he?) [unfortunatly not] {well it will be easy to trick him then}.  The drunk looked down sympathetically at Draco and said, \"Oh you bloody children sympathisin with demons ugh fine I'll leave, but if I catch you up here again young one I will report you to your parents.\"  and with that the drunk left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine work, fine work young one, its not very often one of the humans decides to side with us.\" said the guard.  Draco said back, \"well you see I am not exactlly one of the crowd if you know what I mean.\"  The guard only laughed, \" Aye I know all to well, but I guess you better be getting of to your village then.\"  Draco sighed, \"If I only had one.\"  The guard stared and said, \"wait what do you mean by that were you kicked out or was it destroyed?\"  Draco said, \"Like I said I am not one of the crowd, but in other words I was exiled form my home into the blighted woods.  I've been wandering here for atleast two years now, heck I dont really remember.\"  The guard gapped at this, \"Well your a special case then... hmmm gues I wil have to let you in since this is a town for out cast and such.\"  Draco couldn't believe this hospitallity he was reseving form those who he was raised to hate and despise for being diffrent.  \"Why thank you sir.\"  But as the guard was about to open the gate something or someone had flown in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are the eliet Imperial Draconian Hunters sent to exterminate this town for its crimes against the Archeaon, and the harboring of tainted ones surrender now and all of your deaths would be swift.\"  Yelled a booming voice form the forshaddows.  The imperial hunters stood aobut 20ft high, wearing the best armor in all of the world as Draconians were renowned for their armores and weapon smiths.  They wore a cloak over their shoulder hanging down the side and on it was the Draconians royal ensigniuia.  On their other half their were scratches, one for each Demonic that memeber had slane.  They carried on them a 12ft. Spear that was sharper than a diamond and harder than adimantium,  it was indestructable, un bendable and would never fail to kill if it even grazed you.  Their wings stuck out like giant platforms of death as they could fly at speeds of 100 mph.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard was terrified and yelled to Draco, \"Look kid I have the gate open you best get in, I will hold them off ok.\"  Draco dashed for the gate diving in  and was now withen the towns walls.  The guard through a switch and the gate began to close.  At this outrage the Leader of the imperial hunters charged with his spear stabbing it straight through the guards body.  This man Draco had only known for moments who had saved him form death, and sacrificed himself for the sake of a city had just died.  \"And they call his kind monsters if any one were monsters it would be those who killed that man.\" Draco said with a firery anger.  \" Well that man was one of our best, its a dmaned shame we wont be able to get the body for a good couple of days seeing as these bastards keep the city under raps for a week or so.\"  Said a man who was right behind Draco.  immmediatly Draco spun around to glare at this man.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was odd about him, mabey it was the fact that he wasnt a demonic so to speak.  Draco asked him, \"Ummm sir who are you?\"  he replied, \"Well I might ask the same to you, but seeing as your new here I will answer your question, I am Acreum Arcanous, former Draconian Royal  Guard and chief of defense of this town.\"  Draco was interseted by this and asked, \"why did you come here then if you used to be part of the Royal guard?\"  Acreum replied, \"well I'll answer, but after this you'll have to give me your life story to,  I came here and helped found this city with my brother who was infected with the taint,It happend after the greate war between the Originals and Draconia,  which is around the time the first greate Tainting began.  I couldnt stand for them treating my brother like an out cast when he was a bloody war hero who save the King,  so I moved with him to the middle of the Blighted forest and we founded this town and apperantly the only safe haven for Demonics these days.\"  \"Now you have alot of taking to do your self before I get you wrote down as a cittezen ok.\"  Drack thought that was quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Draco told the Draconian his life story, Arceum only stood and nodded waiting for the end.  \"Well I'ld say you had one screwed up life,  hmmm form what you tell me your a blacksmith or close to one..... well after we get you certified iwith and identificational card and a certificate of citizenship  you could go to work as a blacksmith along with our town nut Arma.\"  Draco didn't really shound to thrilled about working with the  town nut as Arceum put it.  \"Well if thats all I would be glad to help in any way.\" Draco said,  \"ok so please remove your cowl so I may get an image of you so you wont be stopped at the gate every time you come here or leave.  Draco removed his coowl letting this Draconian take his time with the sketch.  \"well if I hadent of heard your side of the story I ould of thought you were playing a practical joke on me, ok that should do it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese would be the days that Draco would rise throught the ranks of prestige in thiss town and become the leader of it eventually but you will have to keep reading to find out how he does it.</span></div></div>",
