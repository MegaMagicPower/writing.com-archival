The blue shining Houndoom stares at you with concerned eyes. \"That was a nasty fall,\" it says. \"You're lucky I happened by...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow...</i>, you think to yourself. <i>It's a girl...</i>. The blue Houndoom pushes some berries over to you. \"Here, eat these sitrus berries. They'll give you strength,\" she tells you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...Thanks...\" You gratefully lap up the berries. At once you can feel your energy returning to you. Feeling rejuvenated, you stand up and give yourself a good shake.  The blue Houndoom gives you a nod. Then she turns and trots off through the trees. So...</span></div></div>",

Cool!</i> The fire temporarily startles the Tyranitar but not for long. It unleashes a Hyper Beam attack at you. Dodging at the last second, you spin around and leap on the Tyranitar's back. You use your Bite move on it but that only seemed to make the Tyranitar even madder. It throws you off its back and uses its Earthquake attack. The move knocks you off your feet and leaves you gasping in shock. The next thing you know, you are surrounded by a whirlwind of sand. \"No! This must be Tyranitar's Sandstorm attack!\" <i>At this rate, I'm not gonna last much longer...</i> </span></div></div>",

What are those!?</i> Powerful flames burst through the sandstorm. In that brief moment you catch a glimpse of several black pelts with bone-like horns sticking out of their heads. <i>Those are Houndoom!</i> The gang of Houndoom attack the Tyranitar at once, blasting it with their flamethrowers. The Tyranitar roars aggressively but the Houndoom stand their ground. \"Get out of my territory!\" snarls one of the Houndoom. Tyranitar responds by unleashing a massive dark pulse attack. At the same moment, the Houndoom pack unleash their dark pulse attacks. The two moves collide with eachother, creating a huge firey explosion. You watch, wide-eyed, as the all the Houndoom then lunge at the Tyranitar and sink their fangs into it. <i>That looks like a Crunch attack!</i>. Tyranitar screeches in pain and throws all the Houndoom off him. The Houndoom tense up for more fighting but the Tyranitar decides that he's had enough. Letting out a defiant growl, the Tyranitar retreats into the depths of the forest. <i>Phew...that could've been much worse...</i> you think to yourself. You shakily stand up as the Houndoom pack approach you. \"Are you alright?\" one of them asks you. <br>\r\n\"I think so...thanks for helping me.\" you reply, \"If you guys hadn't come along i would have fainted for sure.\" <i>or worse...</i> <br>\r\nThe Houndoom who spoke nodded understandingly. \"Those Tyranitar can be troublesome, indeed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here take this,\" another one barks as he drops a blue berry next to you. \"This oran berry should make you feel better.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...thanks...\" Trying not to feel self conscious, you quickly lap up the berry. Almost immediatly, you feel your strength returning to you. Thats when you begin to notice the Houndoom around you murmering amongst themselves with hushed voices. You stare at them questioningly. <i>Are they planning to chase me out of their territory too?</i> you wonder nervously. The Houndoom then exchanged a glance at one another and nodded. As they turn back to you, one of them speaks up. \"Its dangerous wandering around here by yourself.\" he tells you, \"Would you be interested in joining our pack?\"</span></div></div>",
