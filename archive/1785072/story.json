Do not laugh, unless someone has said something particular witty, then sparingly.  Do not curse or shout, even in the face of violence.  Do not cry, even under the most painful of conditions.  You have thus far upheld these principles with great success.  If you were to open a dictionary to the word dignified, you would find a picture of yourself there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpecting today to be as sober as each that has preceded it, you awoke at a respectable hour, attended to you morning ablutions, and dressed yourself smartly before embarking outside and into the city.  Finding that you have the time, you decide to enjoy a pleasant walk through the park.  Gazing around as you hike, you take in the vibrant colors afforded to you by the flowers on the ground, the leaves in the trees, the pond by the path, and the clown in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomentarily nonplussed by the unexpected presence of the clown, it takes you a moment to realize that he's speaking to you.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\"><br>\r\n\"Heya, buddy, could you do me a favor?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...,\" you deftly reply.<span class=\"cnavy\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could really use some help if ya got the time.

Thanks so much chum!  There's actually three things I need to get done, but if you would just help me with one of them, I could take care of the rest.  The first thing I gotta do is rehearse a new routine I'm working on for my show, but my regular partner isn't here yet.  The second favor would be helping me move some stuff I need to get to a party.

A pair of baggy pants with suspenders, a pair of white gloves, and a pair of clown shoes or the largest pair of shoes you can find.  Also, a clown nose.<br>\r\n2.  A small bag of flour.<br>\r\n3.  Three cream pies.<br>\r\n4.  A dozen eggs.<br>\r\n5.  A large cream cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou will see that item between asterisks like so: <span class=\"cgrape\">*item*</span> when the story directs you ready or place them somewhere,  and then read a <span class=\"chotpink\"><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">*</font></span> symbol each time one of these items is to be employed.*</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no desire to walk into a circus ring with a clown, and you're not a dating agency.  Therefore, you will oblige the clown his favor by helping him move his \"stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty then, my samaritous crony, just hop into my clown car and away we'll go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't considered that aiding the clown might mean riding in his ridiculous little car, but after having already agreed to help, you can't back out now.  The fool directs you to sit in the back, as the front passenger seat is over flowing with various props.  In the back, you find your position rather cramped and dark as much of the back windows have been painted over on the outside with clowns performing circus themed antics.  When the clown takes the driver's seat and closes the door, you can no longer see your own clothes, only the street over the driver's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I gotta warn you, this favor you're doing for me could get just a little messy and there could be some heavy lifting, but before you object, let me offer you some protective gear for the job.  If you check near your feet, you'll find a pair of work <span class=\"cgrape\">*pants*</span> you can wear instead of those nice slacks, and under them, you'll find some work <span class=\"cgrape\">*boots and gloves*</span>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you can't see them, you can feel each of the items he's listed, and so you take advantage of the dark and change into the gear he's offered you<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><span class=\"chotpink\">*</span></font>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car comes to a halt and the clown gets out, opening the way for you to do the same.  As you make your exodus from the little car, you notice that you've pulled up in front of a rather nice looking bakery.  You also realize that the so called \"work gear\" you've changed into are really a baggy pair of clown pants, white clown gloves, and a long pair of floppy clown shoes.  From the waist down you look ridiculous, and all you can do to retain some of your dignity is hold the baggy pants up to keep them from dropping and exposing your underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking much better,\" says the duplicitous dupe, \"you just need your face protecting rubber <span class=\"cgrape\">*nose*</span> guard, and we'll be all ready to get to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile your hands are busy holding your pants up, he shoves a glue laden clown nose over yours, then pulls the suspenders attached to your pants up over your shoulders<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><span class=\"chotpink\">*</span></font>.  You're marginally grateful that he's freed your hands, but that little bit of gratitude evaporates when he playfully pulls your suspenders forward and lets them snap back to your chest painfully.  You reach for his open car door to retrieve your discarded normal clothes, but the buffoon pushes it shut and locks it before you can grab it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to drive anywhere else, what we're moving is in there,\" asserts the clown, indicating the bakery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResigned and rubbing your smarting chest, you follow the clown into the bakery.  Inside, you behold racks and stacks of pies and cake in every variety imaginable.  You feel a growing sense of dread considering the dangerous mix of such a setting and your present company, but you are considerably distracted when you realize that your company has just been increased by one;  A waitress in a pretty pink uniform leans lazily over a counter full of colorful pies.  She glances at you and smirks, and your cheeks burn as you try to hide behind the clown who dressed you in this distressing attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doin' back there, my mum mate?  Fixing to become a mime? \"  the clown doesn't bother to turn around and addresses the waitress with a greeting, \"Don't mind him, he's just a tad shy, we're here to pick up the big cake we ordered earlier for the party this evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress nods lethargically and extends an indicating finger toward the kitchen in the back.  Considering her job done, she turns her attention back to the front window and ignores you both completely.  The clown opens the door to the kitchen and ushers you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it looks like we're going to have to build this cake on our own.  Go get me some flour, friend, we're going to have to hurry if we're going to have it ready before the party starts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clown pushes you towards a tall rack with a ladder leaning against it, way up at the top of the rack, you spy a bag of <span class=\"cgrape\">*flour.*</span>  You make it about halfway up the ladder, when it starts to wobble.  You throw out your arms to grab the rack and in doing so shake the rack enough to cause the bag of flour to lean forward above you.  Gingerly, you put your hands back on the ladder and very slowly continue your ascent towards the bag.  You are haldly more than an arms reach away from it when you hear the clown call for you from below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How you doin' up there, cousin?  Found that flour yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo ensure he's got your attention, the clown bangs on the ladder a couple times, shaking it terribly.  You instinctively grab the rack again for support, and the bag of flour tips forward and pours out all over your upturned face<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><span class=\"chotpink\">*</span></font>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou descend the ladder and confront the clown with a face as white as his own makeup.  He does a quick take when he sees you, then shakes his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, never mind about the flour, I found another bag.  Could you get me some eggs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, fine then, I'll get them myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clown strolls over to a large refrigerator and pulls out a <span class=\"cgrape\">*carton of eggs.*</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, was that so hard?  Honestly, I don't know what the fuss was about.  Here, I found em, you crack em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clown tosses a couple eggs right at you before you are ready and they splatter over your head<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><span class=\"chotpink\">*</span></font>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta catch em, now.  Theses things are fragile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou desperately try to grab them out of the air as he tosses them, but fail utterly, those eggs that don't splatter against you manage to land in your pants, with too many to carry and many already in your pants, you stuff a few into your underwear before they can fall down your pant legs.<span class=\"chotpink\"><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">*</font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't stuff em in there!  These eggs are supposed to be food, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clown gives you a reprimanding kick to your backside, which crushes all the eggs inside your underwear.<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><span class=\"chotpink\">*</span></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem,\" the waitress has entered the kitchen and witness your humiliating debacle with complete disapproval.  She also appears to be pointing at something on a rack beside her.  It's the cream cake you came for, long since finished and waiting for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops,\" mumbles the clown, \"didn't see it there.  Guess we won't have to bake one after all.  Sorry about the mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress just crosses her arms and waits, glaring at you both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go get the cake, won't you?\"</span></div></div>",

You see, I already know exactly where to get a date, I just need someone to go get her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clown directs you to a local salon &amp; boutique where he says you can find this mystery date of his, and you obligingly depart to meet her.  When you arrive at the threshold of La Payasa Beauty and Fashion, a cute little hole in the wall of a twenty floor building, you know immediately that you've come to the right place; the decor is a mad semblance of bright colors, polka dots, and stripes, as you would expect of clowns or those who would associate with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there!\" the effervescent stylist at the reception desk greets you, \"Do you have an appointment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to explain what you are here for, but immediately after you've uttered both the words \"clown\" and \"date\" you are interrupted but animated squeals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're going on a date tonight!  How exciting!  But she's not here yet; she won't be in for at least an hour yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to tell her that she can just relay the message as you inch turn toward the door, but the receptionist/stylist stops you before you take your first step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no.  You have to tell her in person, she'd never believe it coming from me; I have a bad habit of making things up.  We don't have any chairs out here, we pride ourselves on never let a customer wait very long, so you'll just have to wait in the salon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes your arm and all but drags you to a styling chair, where she sits you down and throws a barber's cape around your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you're here, the least I could do is give you a free haircut and beauty treatment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attempt a protest, but when she starts to pout, you concede and let her get to work on you.  It's been a while since your last haircut anyway.  You have some misgivings about the pickle slices she puts over your eyes, but have small concerns about a beauty treatment from a professional.  You relax so thoroughly that you begin doze, unaware of the <span class=\"cgrape\">*makeup*</span> and <span class=\"cgrape\">*hair accessories*</span> she applies to you.<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><span class=\"chotpink\">*</span></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done!  Don't you look handsome?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remove the pickles from your eyes in time to see the hand mirror she was holding being put away in a drawer.  For the first time, you notice a complete lack of wall mirrors in the salon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she's still not here yet, but I got an idea for what else we can do while we wait for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make an effort to look at your watch, but before you can get a glimpse at it, her hand is over it, pulling you further into the shop, towards the fashion boutique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can pick out a dress for her to wear tonight!  Don't get all MALE on me and roll your eyes, bucko.  You just got a free haircut, so you can indulge me with a little looking at dresses time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls you over to a short rack of the most eccentric dresses you've ever seen.  Well, since Lady Gaga, perhaps not the Most eccentric, but it does appear that several of these creations were frankensteined together by a cadre of insane bridesmaids.  Your captor takes one of them from the rack and pushes it into your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh in resignation as she continues to pile more strange articles of <span class=\"cgrape\">*clothing*</span> into your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That ought to do it.  Now to try them on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expect to have to wait outside the changing booth, but she pushes you right into it, and follows you in, latching the door behind her.  In the confined space, you don't even have room to turn around.  Questions of propriety come to mind, but before you can ask them, she's removed your pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for being okay with this, I'd model the dress myself, but it's not in my size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite protests, futile attempts to turn around, and endless squirming, she systematically removes your clothes and replaces them with tights, a brassiere, a dress, and high heels.<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><span class=\"chotpink\">*</span></font>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's almost perfect, except for the fact that haven't got any boobs, of course.  These should do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mad little force-feminizing girl slips a pair of <span class=\"cgrape\">*water balloons*</span> into your bra and jiggles them around for good measure.<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><span class=\"chotpink\">*</span></font>  You hear her undo the latch and step out of the changing booth, but by the time you manage the same, she's in the little service elevator by the dress rack, holding all of your clothes in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That dress looks great on you!  See, I told you so.  I'll see you upstairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to reach her before the elevator doors close, but the heels she's slipped on your feet make running difficult.  The elevator leaves without you and dings its way up to the twentieth floor.  You search around for the call button, but find only a keyhole, and she undoubted took her key with her.  With no other options present, you hobble over to the stairwell.  At the base of the stairs, you try to remove the troublesome heels, but find tiny locks on them and feel another at the back of your dress;  looks like you're stuck like this until you find the little clothes stealing wench, nineteen floors up.  Using the handrail as best as you can, and favoring the balls of your feet, you slowly ascend to the top of the building.  As you crest the last step, you can here music from the other side of the door.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At first, you believe the fourth mirror must be similarly difficient, until you recognize that your proportions are correct, and get a good look at the makeup and crazy hair styling the pranksterish beautician has inflicted upon you.  While you are busy examining your face in the mirror, you feel the slight rustle of your skirts being lifted from behind, followed by a sharp pinch to your backside and the honk of a bicycle horn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn in bewilderment, pushing down your skirts behind you.

Unfortunately, the first thing you find is a banana peel, which you slip on, sending you head over heels over the table.  Midway through the journey, your head find the dip bowl, and as you come to a seated rest on the other side of the table, the upturned bowl remains perched on your head, dripping down your water balloon cleavage.<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><span class=\"chotpink\">*</span></font><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your most raggedy set of clothing (preferably with oversized pants) and the largest pair of shoes you can find.  Also, some black makeup.<br>\r\n2.  A tall glass of water.<br>\r\n3.  A chocolate cream pie.<br>\r\n4.  A bucket of porridge, beans, thin oatmeal, or similar treacle-like substance that we'll called sludge.<br>\r\n5.  A large cream cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou will see that item between asterisks like so: <span class=\"cgrape\">*item*</span> when the story directs you ready or place them somewhere,  and then read a <span class=\"chotpink\"><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">*</font></span> symbol each time one of these items is to be employed.*</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow dare this buffoon bother you with talk of favors?  The cheek!  The very idea!  You snub the clown and walk around him as if he wasn't there.  Thunder rolls ominously in the distance, and you feel obliged to hurry your steps in seek of cover.  Odd, it certainly hadn't seemed like it would rain a minute ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn a corner around a large hedge and run smack into a tough looking gang of local youths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what have we here?\" queries the leader of the group, \"Some poor fool appears to have wandered into our territory without paying our most reasonable toll charge.  Collect it from him, boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang descends on you with frightening celerity, but subject you to but a few small smacks and kicks, as their objective isn't violence; it's your clothes.  In a trice, they've stripped you of everything but your tighty whities, and made off with your possessions.  Nearly naked and fearful of further loss and degradation, you duck out of the park and into a secluded alley.  By a stroke of luck, you come across the very thing you most desire at the moment: <span class=\"cgrape\">*clothes!*</span>  You happen to find yourself behind a salvation army store, and within the dumpster are a myriad of very ragged, but relatively clean clothes that the charity group was unable or unwilling to subject others to.  You even find a pair of shoes, though they are comically oversized, you know they are far preferable to bare feet in the city.  After all, beggars can't be choosers, not that you would ever stoop to begging.  You put the ensemble on and immediately begin to feel better<span class=\"chotpink\"><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">*</font></span>.  That is until you take two steps, trip over your new shoes, and land face down in a black puddle.  You scrub at your dirty face, but are until to clean away the <span class=\"cgrape\">*black smudges*</span> around your mouth and the tip of your nose<span class=\"chotpink\"><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">*</font></span>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully make your way out of the alley at its far end, and find that sunlight brings with it a cacophony of marching bands and cheering crowds.  You've managed to stumble upon a parade of some sort, and lo and behold, a troupe of clowns come capering down the street in front of you, one of them pops up right beside you and takes your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great hobo clown getup, man!  What are you doin' on the sidelines?  Get out there with your own kind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clown drags you out into the street with the other buffoons, heedless of your protests, which he cannot hear now for the marching band behind you.  Surrounded now, you have no choice but to march along with them.  You look and feel about as miserable as you ever have, but the crowds only believe its part of of your hobo clown persona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead, you catch sight of something in the road that vague resembles a <span class=\"cgrape\">*chocolate cream pie.*</span>  Upon closer inspection, you discover that the pie in question is not chocolate, but in fact of the type that is produced by the backside of an elephant.  You wrinkle your nose in disgust, and are about to straighten up away from the foul object when a prankish kick to the behind from another clown sets you off balance.  You hang for a moment, with your arms pinwheeling out of control and land face first into the pie shaped dung<span class=\"chotpink\"><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">*</font></span>.  Your first reaction is to shake your head violent to escape the creamy mess, but that only smears more of it from ear to ear until you can plant your hands on the ground and push yourself out of it.  Those of the crowd who aren't disgusted by your predicament are pointing at you and laughing uproariously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you've cleaned the mess from your eyes, nose and mouth, you stalk away as fast as your troublesome shoes will let you.  As you reach the sidewalk, you come upon a large puddle of <span class=\"cgrape\">*water*</span> that your must take a long uneasy step to cross over.  As you are straddling the puddle, you here a loud honking horn behind you.  No sooner do you pull your foot away from the street than a group of Shriners in mini-cars come racing down the street through the large puddle.  Small wheels send the puddles water rushing up to meet your face with a great splash<span class=\"chotpink\"><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">*</font></span>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrenched and depressed, you slink down another alley with intent to throw a pity party for one.  You find an inviting box to sit on, with a nice comfortable stretch of wall to rest your head against.  You relax and have nearly started to doze when a bum comes puttering down the alley and offers you a comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't want to sit there, mack.  That's the <span class=\"cgrape\">*sludge*</span> spot.  It's filthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around you for a moment to find some indication of the filth he's spoken of, but a quick examination tells you that while, you are moderately filthy, the bum is overwhelming dirty, and the spot where you are sitting is surprisingly clean.  Theorizing that this bum is just trying to scare you off so that he can claim the spot, you ignore him and lean your head back against the wall.  The bum shrugs and moves on down the alley to join an apparent friend of his.  After a minute passes by, you feel something drip onto your forehead<span class=\"chotpink\"><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">*</font></span>.  You open your eyes to see a deluge of sludge cascade down through a drainpipe directly over your head.  With catlike reflexes, you lean forward in time to avoid taking most of the sludge over your head.  Unfortunately, this offers the sludge an open path down the back of your pants and into your undies.  The pair of bums sitting further down the alley are cackling wildly at you as you struggle to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSodden and sticky, you make your way back out to the street.  The parade has passed and the crowd has left now.  You discover a bakery that you weren't able to see before, and inside it, you see a great variety of tantalizing sweets that set your mouth watering.  Stepping outside of the confectionery, a waitress comes wearing a cute pink uniform dress and bearing a large <span class=\"cgrape\">*cream cake.*</span>  Your stomach rumbles and you drop to your knees in front of her.  Discarding your last shred of pride, you beg her for something to eat.  She sniffs at you in disapproval and walks around you.  Thunder rolls.  In your peripheral vision, you spy the waitress stepping on a greasy banana peel, and shrieking as she slips and tosses the cake high in the air.<br>\r\nYou smile to yourself your take comfort in the knowledge that your curse of bad karma has finally gone on to someone else.  Then, the cake falls onto your head<span class=\"chotpink\"><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">*</font></span>.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
