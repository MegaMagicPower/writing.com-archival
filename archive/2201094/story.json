I knew it was never going to happen but I kept the dream alive in the hopes that somehow it might happen one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tomorrow was the first day of high school and I decided to get in bed early. That night I couldn\u2019t fall asleep, I was tossing and turning for hours before sleep found me. I had a strange dream where I was lying on a bed but their was a huge weight on me that made it impossible to get up or even breath. I felt like I was going to suffocated but I was suddenly woken up by my alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUgh\u201d I mumbled as I rubbed my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My breathing was still a little hard as I lay there on my back, I hoped that I wasn\u2019t getting sick on the first day of school. I allowed myself a minute to lay there before I got up. I tried to roll over but something stopped me, I opened my eyes for the first time and what greeted them almost made me scream. I was huge! My once petite body had swelled up with a ridiculous amount of fat. I probably weighed over 400 pounds. My heart began to race and my brain began to process this. My shock and terror started to be replaced with excitement. I had always wanted to be fat but I never actually thought it would happen. I didn\u2019t know how this had happened but I wasn\u2019t going to question it right now, I just wanted to enjoy the moment. Maybe it was just a dream and I was about to wake up, every moment was priceless.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a lot more effort this time, I rolled over on my side. The weight of my belly was transferred to the bed and off my lungs, I gave a sigh of relief. The next step was to sit up which required a lot of work and awkward shifting. Finally, I was able to stand up. Damn I was huge, with more difficulty than I would expect, I made my way over to the bathroom where I regarded my reflection in the mirror. I was even bigger than I had thought. I pulled off all my clothes to get a better look. I couldn\u2019t even see my dick in the mirror, my belly completely covered my crotch. I noticed some differences right off the bat from my normal body. I was pale, really pale like I had never gone outside before. My skin was white and extremely smooth almost like the skin of a baby. My hair was a little different too, first of all there was none on my body. The only hair I had was on my head and it was very blonde. It looked very well kempt like I went to the barber frequently and took diligent care of it. I ran my hands through it and looked at them for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The fat had gone everywhere in my body, including my fingers which looked like sausages. The fatness continued in my forearm which was so fat that it had formed a little roll where it met my hand. My elbows were almost completely hidden but for a little patch of wrinkly skin where one would assume an elbow was buried somewhere below. The upper part of my arms was even thicker, thicker than the thighs of most people. Even my shoulders had fat on them. My face was round. My cheeks were puffed out and I had the world biggest double chin. In fact, like my elbow the only indicator that I had a chin was a little bit of wrinkled skin. My second and much larger chin went down all the way to my chest and what would have been my neck was so thick that you couldn\u2019t tell where my head ended and neck started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next thing that I noticed was my chest. Where once it had been flat and bony, there were two man boobs. They were both quite large and wrapped around into rolls of fat to my sides which were wider than any other part of my body other than my shoulders. They were so wide that when I dropped my arms to my sides, they were pushed out by the rolls. My chest was flat in the middle where it slowly filled out further from me and became my belly. My belly was rather unusual in how perfect and uniform it was. It flowed out from under my man boobs in a smooth arc reaching past my crotch and almost halfway down my thighs before folding around and returning to my waist. It was almost perfectly round, the only inconsistencies in it we\u2019re two small love handles where my hips would have been and of course my belly button. Other than those two things it\u2019s looked remarkably like an overfilled water balloon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I backed up in the room to get a better look but was stopped prematurely when my ass hit the wall. It was much larger than I expected. It looked like to large beach balls, it was round and huge. I looked back in the mirror and reached under my belly. I lifted with all my might and was able to get a glimpse of my crotch, I didn\u2019t really have much of a fat pad and there was no hair there to speak of. I let go and my belly dropped, causing it to wobble around immensely before settling down. Though I couldn\u2019t see them while looking down, in the mirror I saw that my thighs were huge. They were very smooth and shapely with no rolls or sagginess to them. They were so thick that they touched each other all the way to my knees. My calves we\u2019re very thick too but tapered nicely to my ankles. Even my feet weren\u2019t safe from the fat and looked very puffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At that moment my stomach gave a massive rumble, I was overcome with a hunger like I had never felt before. It ached and I needed food now! Just then I heard my mom downstairs,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAidan! Breakfast is ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShit! What if I go downstairs and she sees me \u201cI thought,\u201d How would she react?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I stood there for a moment worrying but the hunger in my belly was getting worse so I decided to do it. First, I needed to put some clothes on. I waddled back to my room and open my dresser. My clothes were different than usual. I pulled out a pair of underwear that was the size of a towel and pulled it on. It fit perfectly which gave me a little more confidence. I then pulled out a pair of black shorts and pulled them on. They were a little tighter and got caught on my ass. With a lot of grunting and swearing I got them on, the waist was extremely tight. I then grabbed a white button up shirt, I had always liked to dress up and I was curious to see how it would fit. It was huge, like the size of a bedsheet. I pulled it on, the short sleeves hugged my arms, if they had been long sleeve they probably would have stopped my arm from bending. I tried to button up the top button but it was squeezing my neck so I left it open and buttoned the second one. The collar only made it around half of my neck, the rest was from the area between the first and second button. I started doing up all the other buttons. They got progressively harder until I was sucking in my belly to do the last few. When I released my stomach, the shirt stretched skin tight over my body. The space between a few of the buttons stretched out revealing pale skin between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luckily the shirt was extremely long allowing me to make it wrap all the way over and under my belly back to my waist where I tucked the shirt into my pants. This made them only tighter and as a precaution I put on a belt to help out the waist of my shorts. Putting on socks was more of a challenge. First, I had to sit down on my bed which creaked in protest. Sitting also stretched out my clothes even further, I was surprised that they didn\u2019t bust. Then I had to lean down to put on socks and then shoes, which was made rather difficult with my belly sticking out in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally, I was completely dressed. The process took me five times as long as it normally would have and left me slightly out of breath and sweating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGurgle!\u201d I was reminded of my hunger and swiftly headed downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Going down stairs was particularly hard with the weight of my belly putting me off balance. In addition, every step that I took created a large thud that shook the whole house. When I reached the bottom, I braced myself for how my mom was going to react. I stood there for a moment until she looked up at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAre you just going to stand their or are you going to eat?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was met with another surprise; my breakfast was huge. Four, ten-inch diameter pancakes drenched in butter, sugar, and syrup, ten slices of bacon, and a massive glass of milk sat in front of me. I didn\u2019t know what to do, I would never be able to eat this much food. My mom had moved into another room leaving me alone with this mountain of food. My hunger was killing me so I decided not to wait any longer and I sat down. The food began to disappear, slowly at first but fast as I began to realize how hungry I was. I noticed that after the third pancake, I still wasn\u2019t feeling particularly full. One more and the huge hunger finally started to go away. I couldn\u2019t leave the last pancake sitting there though and with very little difficulty I was able to put that one away too. The bacon was gone just as quickly along with the cup of milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was starting to feel a large amount of discomfort but it wasn\u2019t from my stomach. It felt more like something was trying to cut into me. I looked down to see the source of the problem and realized that my already massive belly had swelled out a little further with all the food and was causing my shorts to dig into my waist. I pushed my chair back and stood up, using my hands to push myself up with the table. I then reached under my belly and found the button on my shorts waist. I unhooked it and then unlatched my belt. A huge amount of pressure was relieved and I actually let out a little moan of pleasure. I realized that if I didn\u2019t want to be in pain all day, the shorts would have to remain unbuttoned. I sucked in my breath and tightened the belt until it was holding my pants up. Luckily you couldn\u2019t tell that my pants weren\u2019t buttoned because my belly completely covered that area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I grabbed my backpack and walked to the front door, \u201cGoodbye mom!\u201d I yelled inside, \u201cGoodbye sweetie, have a good first day of school.\u201d she replied.</span></div></div>",

The bus stop was three blocks away, an effortless walk for me usually but the task seemed daunting now. After one block I was starting to breath pretty heavily. The weight on my body was immense and made every step difficult. Another block and I was starting to sweat and gasp for air. I could see the bus stop now and I rallied all my energy and waddled to it. When I arrived, my clothes were a mess. My shorts had ridden up on my thighs and my shirt was untucking in areas. I tucked my shirt in and pulled down my shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was no bench at this bus stop, only a sign post. I grasped it and leaned against it trying to catch my breath. I knew that being this huge was going to be difficult but I didn\u2019t realize that it would be this hard. You might think that I was hating it but that couldn\u2019t have been further from the truth. With every heave of my body that sent a jiggle down it, or every time that a piece of clothing was too tight it felt amazing. In fact, it felt more than amazing, it was arousing. I think I had been hard for a majority of the morning but it was difficult to tell since I couldn\u2019t see my dick without lifting my belly and looking in a mirror. Still, it felt wonderful and I enjoyed every moment of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Just then I heard the bus coming up. I heaved myself off the pole and walked over to the bus. I had to climb up three tall steps to get inside which took a lot of effort. The bus was fairly empty but the people that were in it didn\u2019t seem to be surprised by my size. It seemed that whatever had happened to me today had affected everyone else too, they all acted like I had been huge my whole life and it was normal for them. I found and empty pair of seats and sat down. My body took up almost the entire row which was nice since no one could sit next to me and bother me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The bus drove on and after a few more stops it got to the school. I let everyone who needed to leave get off before me since I knew it would take a little while to get out of the bus. I stood up and waddled down the aisle, my waist brushed up against the chairs as I walked. If I had been a few inches wide I probably would get stuck. Using both handrails, I slowly lowered myself down the stairs before exiting the bus. It was going to be another long walk to get to the center of the school so I paced myself taking short breaks where I barely moved.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I saw Alex, one of my best friends who I have had a secret crush on for years. He was an average height with tan skin and light brown hair. In the last year he had started to go to the gym and was starting to look a little more built. It was particularly noticeable in his shoulders, chest, and arms which were all looking rather large in the tight T-shirt he was wearing. He wasn\u2019t intentionally showing off; the shirt was just one he had owned for over a year before he had started filling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I made eye contact with him, he smiled and started making his way over. God, he had a cute smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAidan! What\u2019s up?\u201d he bellowed over the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNot much, just trying to pretend that summer isn\u2019t over.\u201d I joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNow you\u2019ve reminded me, thanks a lot.\u201d he replied. \u201cHave you looked at your class schedule?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYea\u201d I showed it to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDude, we have all the same classes!\u201d he exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I felt a slight flutter in my chest and a sense of relief. Having Alex in all my classes was going to make this year a lot more fun and easier. Alex had always been there for me in school. In middle school I was constantly bullied for being little and nerdy. Alex would always comfort me and it was him that helped me through those years. I wasn\u2019t sure if being large would make people more or less likely to pick on me. With Alex there I didn\u2019t feel too worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Just then the bell rang.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
