My mom was a very creative woman. Well if she wasn't then she wouldn't be a very good artist. She paints the most beautiful things. Once she even made her own book full of drawings. You could also tell by her wardrobe that she was artsy. She wore a green silk top with laced with blue ribbon and drawings of lipstick, orange juice, and all of the most random items you could think of. She wore long flare jeans that were covered in paint stains. Her hair was placed in a neat blob up on her head, that was finished off with a butterfly clip.<br>\r\n\"Okay mom, just let me finish my cereal.\" I said. She grinned and looked through the window studying something closely. I watched her as she twirled a strand of loose hair. She looked so peaceful.<br>\r\n\"I hope it snows. That would be just wonderful to paint!\" It was my mom's voice, but strangely her lips didn't move a bit. Then I heard it again. \"Oh my! Look at that, I think I saw a flake!\"<br>\r\n\"What was that mom?\" I asked suspiciously.<br>\r\n\"I didn't say anything.\" She said looking at me. \"Now hurry up! You're already late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day at school was the weirdest. I seemed to know what everyone was thinking. I knew all the answers to math problems and could hear the other students' thoughts. And I thought it was funny to know who liked who.<br>\r\nJulia liked Dan who liked Catlin who liked Seth who didn't like anyone. But unfortunately I liked Jamie, who didn't like anyone either. I could tell when someone was lying, or daydreaming. It was so cool. But Jake, my best bud, knew that something was up. I knew I would have to tell someone about my \"secret powers\". But should I really? Would it freak him out?</span></div></div>",

He could tell anyone. He was just like that.<br>\r\n\"Um, Jake.\" I began, sitting next to him at the lunch table. He nodded which indicated he was listening. His mouth was stuffed with a turkey sandwich. \"Can I tell you a secret.\"<br>\r\nThat excited Jake and he quickly swallowed the sandwich. He mumbled a 'yeah' in the process. He was grinning widely. I thought of what I should say. It was hard to think though, hearing everyone else's, too.<br>\r\n\"You can't tell ANYONE!\" I said with emphasis. He agreed, still smiling. I listened to his thoughts and saw he was telling the truth.\"Alright... I have su-.\"<br>\r\nThe person who interrupted me was my other friend, Kati. That wasn't her real name, which was Kathleen, but she liked this name better. She shoved me deeper into the seat and sat next to me.<br>\r\n\"As you were saying.\" Kati grinned.</span></div></div>",

But I could hardly move from my locker when Josiah Walters appeared in front of me with two of his buddies. Josiah was this big grade four guy who bullied people all the time, including me. He's got black hair and this mean looking face, like he can't smile. His buddies are just silent muscle, I don't know if I've ever heard them have a full conversation with anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there blondie, ready to pay your hall taxes?\" he asked aggressively. I didn't respond and I didn't even try to hear his thoughts, I didn't want to. So I ducked past him to try and get going but his buddies moved to stop me. He came up to me and shoved me against the locker roughly \"Where ya goin' Carter?\" he asked, spitefully using my last name. \"I asked for money, now give it to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" I finally murmured. He shoved me hard against the locker and I could feel a little pain coming now. \"Go away!\" I shouted and started trying to get away when I shoved him to try and get him off me. Josiah let go alright, let go and flew across the hall into the lockers on the other side. His bodyguards ran over to help him up and I took that moment to run to the cafeteria, but they followed me and grabbed me before I could get out of the even emptier halls. I gulped as his friends grabbed my arms while he started pummeling me all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think you can do that to me and get off?\" he asked furiously as he stops to take a breath. I can't help it now, I start to cry from both pain and anger. I struggle against my captors and easily wrench my arms free and punch Josiah in the shoulder; which is followed by a cracking sound leading to him dropping to the floor crying and holding his shoulder. The only thing I can do is run off and grab a teacher and I try to explain what happened so I won't get in alot of trouble and I can tell the teacher was surprised to hear that I broke the shoulder of someone older than me and bigger. Josiah went to the nurse and I went into the cafeteria, for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I really had to tell Jake what's going on. Mind-reading AND superstrength in one day? It's cool, but I had to talk about it.</span></div></div>",

BEsides I think he was worried about me, so I figured it couldn't hurt. So I sat down opposite to him and opened my lunchbag giving him a 'hi'. Almost immediatly he folded his arms on the table and said \"What wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we can eat and talk at the same time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I told him what had happened when I got up and what had happened in the hall, his mouth was hanging open by the end of my story and I kept eating while he thought of something to say. I knew I'd have to talk to mom about this too when I got home, but for now I was contented to let Jake know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is so cool!\" Jake said with barely controlled awe and excitement. \"Can you show me super strength?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't really see an issue with that and I agreed to show him after school the rest of which passed without event. So when we got out we walked to Jake's house which was close by, with his mom who came to walk us there. Jake's brother has all this weightlifting stuff and he's really big so he was saying I should see how much I can lift. So when we got there we were instantly down into the basement where the weights were all sitting, currently not in use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said the bar was itself about seventy pounds and I laid down under it and found it extremely easy to lift. He put on first ten, then twenty with each being scarcely heavier than the last for me and lifting them proved to be boring. I had to help him put the weights on eventually as they got too heavy for him to move, but I found them easy to lift. Eventually the barbell had all the weights on it and I still lifted it, and the entire bench, with relative ease. Jake was just standing there with his mouth open at the last feat of strength and once again was barely containing his excitement. \"That is so cool! You know what else? I think your muscles are a little bigger, look at yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at my arm and flexed and saw a little bit of bicep and lifted up my shirt to see I was flexing faintly visible abs, which was insane cause that morning I bad a bit of a tummy. \"I wonder why this is all happening all of a sudden,\" I mused to Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno, think your mom would know something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should go talk to her. It's cool being really strong though.\"</span></div></div>",

I had absolutely no idea what was going on, but I figured I could try to help, being superpowered and all. I ran after the car and was scarcely surprised when I started running twice as fast as I usually did. I guess after the superpowers I had so far, superspeed hardly seemed odd. So I ran, keeping behind the car enough to not be noticed, but close enough to keep track of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took perhaps five minutes for the police and me to arrive at what could be described as a battleground. It was a downtown four-way with lights, fire hydrant, and so on. However there were great craters in the street, chunks of dirt and asphault lying around, a broken fire hydrant spouting into the air, and several crumpled cars, some burning and apparently already exploded. There, in the middle of the street was a massive man in hi-tech armour. When I say massive, I mean he was like seven feet tall and all muscle covered by the battle armour. As I watched he shot a rocket at a police car, which exploded and sent several police men flying. \"I will find town hall,\" the man shouted. \"This city will bow to me, the Steel Lord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so horrible I had to dodge into an alley to make sure he didn't see me. \"He's scary,\" I mumbled to myself. Then I realized that if he saw me, he might be able to come back for revenge, and he might hurt mommy. There went my hopes of being a celebrity with the powers, because if I wanted to help out and not put mommy in danger, I'd have to use a disguise. Then I remembered mom always packed my balaclava so I wouldn't forget it in the winters. So I took it out of my back pack and put it on, and left my backpack in the alley. I took a deep breath then ran out into the streets at high speed, jumping over the police and their barriers and charged right at the Steel Lord. He was facing the other direction and I charged into his leg and threw him down where he landed with a crash into the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped in the street and turned to face him as he stood up. \"Well aren't you a strong little pipsqueak,\" he scoffed. \"But I have plenty of tricks to deal with you.\"</span></div></div>",

I think it\u2019s so cool that you got these powers\u2026\u201d Jake began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, man\u2026\u201d I whispered to him. \u201cPlease\u2026. Don\u2019t tell anybody, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 I won\u2019t! But, it\u2019s gonna be hard keeping this a secret!\u201d Jake said, as he led me out to his garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we walked out of the living room and into the garage, we saw his dad\u2019s SUV standing there. Jake pressed the button on the wall, which opened the garage door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam\u2026 Try to lift the car\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just sighed and rolled my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, come on, Jake\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust try it!\u201d he said excitedly. \u201cI wanna see how strong you are!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you saw me lift all those weights just now!\u201d I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake just let out a deep sigh of frustration. I stared at him and I was able to read his thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Sammy just do it?\u201d Jake was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, alright\u2026. Just to make you happy\u2026.\u201d I said, as I walked over to the front of the Suburban and reached down by the front bumper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I slowly raised up my arm, lifting the front of the SUV along with it. To be honest, I couldn\u2019t believe it myself. I was standing in my best friend\u2019s garage, and I was lifting his dad\u2019s SUB with just one hand. The front tires of the large, brown car were hanging suspended in the air, about six inches above the ground, as I held on to the front bumper. To my great surprise, the SUV just didn\u2019t seem that heavy at all! It was like lifting a big balloon. In fact, it felt like I was lifting one of those inflatable giant balloons. The only difference is this thing was REAL! It was a real vehicle, made of metal, rubber and plastic! It must have weighed several thousand pounds, and I was lifting it with just one hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWowww!\u201d Jake gasped. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how strong you are!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 I can\u2019t believe it, either\u2026\u201d I said, as he bent my knees so I could set the SUV back down on its front tires. \u201cI mean\u2026 I can\u2019t feel its weight at all\u2026. I must be getting stronger and stronger\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to your house!\u201d Jake suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walked out of the garage and onto the driveway. The sun was out, and it was over ninety degrees outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, it\u2019s so hot out here!\u201d I grumbled. \u201cI wish I were home already\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I found myself standing in my bedroom, in my house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly crap!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cHow did I get here so fast?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought for a moment and realized that I must have teleported from Jake\u2019s house to mine, in a blink of an eye!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I realized that Jake must be freaking out right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pictured Jake in my mind, and I wished to see Jake standing in my room at this moment as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, out of the blue, a bright flash of light appeared in my room, and when the light faded, I saw Jake standing before me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Holy CRAP! How\u2026 What\u2026 How did I get here?\u201d Jake wondered out loud. \u201cSammy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I think I teleported us from your house to my bedroom\u2026\u201d was the only explanation I had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 But\u2026 How? How did you do that?\u201d Jake wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno!\u201d I shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve never done it before! I guess\u2026 I just discovered a new power!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!!!\u201d Jake gasped. \u201cYou teleported us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ve heard from my mom that puberty changes the body, at least that\u2019s what she says when she\u2019s talking to my sister about it, but this, this is insane, but then again from her talks I don\u2019t think I\u2019m old enough to go through puberty, I am only 7years old, but either way seemingly in one day I\u2019ve developed two super powers. I could read minds, and now I have super strength. I need to talk to someone about this before I lose my mind, for god sakes I broke a guys shoulder. Josiah was a jerk, but not even he deserved that. I was going to tell Jake, after all he is my best friend, but the last thing I wanted to do was scare him, heck I was having trouble not scaring myself. I decided to wait, to tell my mom, but the only problem with that plan was that I had to wait after school to talk to her, AND I NEED SOMEONE NOW! Well I\u2019m just going to have to suck it up and wait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchool was nothing but torture. It was like my whole body was waging war on itself. If I wasn\u2019t  concentrating on not reading minds, then I was concentrate on not breaking my fragile pencils and desk, and making sure I\u2019m using the necessary strength when it comes to opening doors and giving my friends high fives, I don\u2019t want either of them to go flying. I\u2019ve already broke a door today, I was able to convince my teachers that it was because of poor workmanship, that the door went flying off its hinges, but I don\u2019t think that lie will last forever. I could hear the thoughts of every person in the school, I swear does this thing have a off button. It was almost getting to the point that I could not hear the actual words coming out of people\u2019s mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome how I was able to make it through the day, with very little teachers mad at me. I wasted no time getting home as soon as school was out. I had to tell my mom right away of the things that had happened to me. I soon make it to the apartment complex. Me and my family live in a three bed room apartment, as far as apartment complexes go our apartment was pretty big, and was a good place to call home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI run up to the door and open it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBang!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door goes flying off the hinges, with small pieces of wood falling everywhere. Ah man I forgot my mom always kept the door locked, so that situation was like a unstoppable  force meeting a movable object, the door didn\u2019t stand a chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door had been right next to the living room, which was the area my mom was, sitting on our brown leather couch watching Tv, so she got a front row seat to my little display of strength, and she looked at me surprised as ever. Well the bright side was that I no longer had to explain as much, also she would probably believe me when I tell her my story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m home.\u201d </span></div></div>",

It wasn\u2019t a look of surprise, nor was it a look of disbelief or shock, no it was a look of acceptance, a look of secrets. The point is that my story didn\u2019t shock her, which only meant two thing she knew what was going on in my body, and she was hiding something, and by the looks of things it was something big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time I was done telling my short and brief story, silents fell over the room. I swear it was so quite that I could hear the crickets outside. I looked at my mom who was to busy staring at the floor to look at me.

Me and your sister were just having a nice drive, then it happened.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom stops talking for a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething bright, something burning fell from the night sky, crash landing right in front of my car.\u201d Mom says with a little smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt first I thought it was a meteor, or maybe a satellite, but when I got out of the car to take a closer look, I knew it wasn\u2019t any of those things. It was some kind of alien spacecraft.\u201d She said looking at me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA spacecraft, like aliens?\u201d I said with doubt in my voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted I\u2019m 7 years old, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m a idiot, nor does that mean I\u2019m going to believe everything that I hear. Heck even when I was young, I could never get myself to believe in Santa clause, let alone aliens. I really didn\u2019t believe what my mom was saying, but deep down I couldn\u2019t help but think, could this story really be true. My eyes had never left my moms face, she was not lying. All of a sudden I felt sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know how it sounds but the technology looked to advanced to be man made. The alien craft glowed with a purplish hue and their were a few symbols on the surface. Symbols that I couldn\u2019t understand.\u201d Mom says putting on her thinking face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was about to call the police or something, but I was stopped, I stoped when the craft began to open, and inside I saw a beautiful little baby boy. Inside the space craft was you.\u201d Mom says putting her hand on my cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn\u2019t true, it couldn\u2019t be. I was a alien, That was what my mom was basically telling me, that I was some kind of alien freak. Tears flowed from my eyes, as I started to realize the truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, why didn\u2019t you tell me!\u201d I yell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a Angry, hurt. Was my whole life a lie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you because I didn\u2019t want you to feel the way you feel now, what was I suppose to say, how was I suppose to tell you that you, you are not human, how was I suppose to tell you that you would have to live your whole life different from everyone else?\u201d My mom asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom made a good point, but that still didn\u2019t stop the pain, it still didn\u2019t vanquish my anger. Mom reaches for my hand but I pull away. I couldn\u2019t control my strength when I was in the right state of mind, there was no way I could control my strength when my mind was clouded by anger. The last thing I wanted to do was break my moms hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have a huge burden to carry Sammy.\u201d Mom says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll I wanted to do was lessen that burden as much as possible.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does this make me?\u201d I ask, not knowing what to call myself, human, alien p, freak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are the answer Sammy, the answer to are we alone in the universe.\u201d Mom says grabbing both of my shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, I don\u2019t want to be, I don\u2019t want this.\u201d I say trying to stop crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I wouldn\u2019t want it either. I know it\u2019s unfair but this is the paint you must walk.\u201d Mom says looking me straight in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC, can I still be your son?\u201d I ask with a little fear in my voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but think, what if she says no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will always be my son, I will always be your mother. I love you.\u201d She says giving me a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile hugging me I saw something moving in the corner of the hallway. My 14 year old sister Bianca was standing by the wall listening in on me and moms conversation. I didn\u2019t mind, after all Bianca knew everything about me being a alien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca slowly walks over to both me and mom, who still had me in a huge bear hug, and rapes her arms around us. She knew everything, and she still saw me as her little brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI truly was blessed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mom opens up the top Dresser drawer, and brings out something that looked like a crystal the size of a baseball. The crystal was almost clear as glass, but had a crimson aura surrounding it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour space ship evaporated like mist as soon as I had picked you up. Their was nothing left except this small crystal.\u201d Mom says holding the crystal right in front of my eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is, but it is yours.\u201d Mom grabbing my hands gives me the crystal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the crystal touched my skin, it\u2019s crimson aura turned azure blue like the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d I ask, realizing that the crystal is starting to vibrate in my hands. It kind of tickled, but the last thing I wanted to do was laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know?\u201d Mom said realizing the sudden change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of fear I drop the crystal, and watch it fall to the ground, but before it hit the carpet floor it started to levitate in mid air, and start to ascend up to my face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy son.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard a voice emanating from the crystal. I couldn\u2019t help but take a step forward, the voice it sounded familiar to me, and seemed to calm my nerves. Deep down in my soul I really wanted to trust that voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the crystal disappears, and is replaced by a man. The man had short brown curly hair, and short trimmed beard. The man wore strange white clothing, that made him look like a holy saint. But the thing that drew me in more than anything was his eyes, which were blue and green like the sea, yet seemed peaceful, gentle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo see you there my boy, is the greatest blessing I could have ever received.\u201d The man says with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d I ask with very little strength left in my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep down I already knew the answer, but I had to hear him say it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Sharal Etregal, and you Sammy are my son.\u201d The man says with a warm smile on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you know my name is Sammy, and how are you here right now?\u201d I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo answer the first question, when you touched the Essence crystal all of your memories your very essence was absorbed. I know everything about you Sammy, as for the second, I am standing before you as nothing but a hologram, I believe that is what humans call it.\u201d Sharal says having to think about it for a little while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll of who I am, all of who I was, was recorded and put into the crystal, along with all of the knowledge and research of our race. I am here as a guide to help you along your journey my son. You have questions, the time has come to provide answers to those questions. So ask.\u201d Sharal says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom leaves the room, giving me and my hologram dad alone time in her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease tell me where do I come from.\u201d </span></div></div>",

I stood completely still as I stared at my supposed father like a hawk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease tell me where do I come from?\u201d I asked, my voice shaking as if my very words were about to break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou come from the planet Edora.\u201d Sharal says looking at me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEdora? That\u2019s the name of our home planet?\u201d I asked making sure that I have a the facts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't believe it, I was actually a alien, even after my mom had told me the whole entire story, deep down I didn\u2019t really believe it, but it was all true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking out of my thoughts, I soon realize the room begin to change. I once stood inside my mothers bedroom which was filled with a queen sized bed two nightstands and one large closet containing different outfits, now it looked like I was standing in the middle of space, with a myriad of stars surrounding me, in all directions. In front of me was a humongous green planet that completely filled my whole vision. I would be lying if I were to say I wasn\u2019t terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFear not Sammy, I am showing you a hologram of the past.\u201d Sharal says as if we were reading my mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes this is the planet Edora back when it was in its prime, my son this is where you were born .\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t revert my gaze, right at this moment I was looking at my birth planet in all of its glory. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I?\u201d I asked looking at Sharal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are Zorge.\u201d Sharal says as he looks at me, with eyes that were no longer as kind as they were before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZorge, what is Zorge?\u201d I asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZorge is the name of our species, it is what we are.\u201d Sharal says coldly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you say that like it\u2019s a bad thing?\u201d I asked as I look at my father configured and worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy father looks at me with sadness in his eyes, he looks me dead in my eyes and I look dead into his, what was he hiding from me? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Zorge Empire covered more than 1000  planets my son, planets from all around the whole universe.\u201d Sharal says with even more gloom than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that father, it sounds like the Zorge where pretty successful.\u201d I said with a little \ud83d\ude00.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe problem with that my son is that those planets where conquered.\u201d Sharal says, not being able to look me in the eye anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConquered?\u201d I asked hoping I heard wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy son the whole Zorge Empire was built on war itself, the planets we owned were our trophies as we expanded throughout the universe.\u201d Sharal said as if he were in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean.\u201d I said not being able to except the truth, heck I couldn\u2019t even understand the truth let alone expect it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me start at the beginning.\u201d Sharal says putting his right hand up, which was indication to stop talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Zorge, ever since their earliest days have always been a race of war and violence.\u201d Sharal says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hologram of the planet Edora started to disappear, actually the whole scenery began to change drastically. I soon found my self standing on solid ground, surrounded by super tall building, every building had its own unique shape. Looking up I could even see flying vehicles, flying at different altitudes. Observing my surroundings even more I could see wide tubes coming out of the ground, these wide tubes surrounded the building and seemed to spread out everywhere around the strange city. People wearing strange clothes were inside these tubes, each person being carried to a certain destination. I knew seemingly by instinct were I was. I was on the planet Edora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Zorge race was not known for its wisdom nor was it known for its intelligence, but we still possessed far greater technical advancements than most species, and we used that technology to wage war on those we saw as inferior, and in doing so we formed the Zorge Empire. The one thing we Zorge where known most for was our battle hardened instincts that we develop at birth.\u201d Sharal says with a lot of shame evident in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t believe, I didn\u2019t want to believe it, was this really where I came from. I didn\u2019t want to be a Zorge anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait are you saying that the Zorge, killed people to be successful?\u201d I asked, hoping that my father was joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes my son, we killed billions, simply to prove our superiority.\u201d My father says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait does that mean you also killed people.\u201d I asked feeling disgusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharal goes quit, he says nothing, he does nothing but stare at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have never once approved of the way, our race has dozen of skilled warriors, I on the other hand am a scientist \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udd2c.\u201d Sharal says with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have never once killed another living being.\u201d Sharal says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were a scientist?\u201d I asked feeling a little relived that my father was not a mass murder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. I am one of the very few Zorge scientist.\u201d Sharal says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy were their so few?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Zorge are a race that only think with their fist, therefor scientists were highly looked down upon in our society.\u201d Sharal says, with a little frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more I heard about these Zorge the more I strayed to hate them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere the Zorge really that horrible as a society father?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes my son. The Zorge are a race drenched in blood.\u201d Sharal says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that why you left me on earth?\u201d I asked, barley able to hold my curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Sharal says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am no longer in this world my son.\u201d Sharal says with a sad smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heart seemed to stop as soon as those words where uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean father.\u201d I asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, along with every single Zorge in the universe is dead son.\u201d Sharal says looking at me with ocean blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur people, our empire, even our home planet no longer exists my son.\u201d Sharal says looking at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was one surprise after the other, and really I wasn\u2019t sure that my have art would be able to take much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to them, what happened to you.\u201d I asked, wanting to get to the bottom of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharal stays quit as he looks at me once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am sorry, but that information is still classified, till further notice.\u201d My father says sounding more like a robot than a actual person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t know why I couldn't find out the truth, I didn\u2019t like being kept in the dark, but for know I was going to have to let my father slide, for the moment. I still had more questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Apparently I come from a war like race called the Zorge, who travel around the cosmos conquering planets, these planets became part of the Zorge Empire. Sounds impressive, doesn\u2019t it? Well spoiler alert, the Zorge are pretty much extinct. I\u2019m the last Zorge, the last of my race. I really didn\u2019t think it was possible for me to feel even more alone than I did before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFather please, I have to know what happened to my people.\u201d I say looking at my father Sharal in his sea green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence echoes throughout the whole entire room. Me and my father lock eyes with one another, both of us determined. I was determined to get answers, my father on the other hand was determined to hide the truth from me, this I couldn\u2019t allow. I continued to stare at my father not saying a word, crossing my arms to make it clear, this subject wasn\u2019t going to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll I am permitted to say at the moment, is that our planet was destroyed my son.\u201d Sharal said with sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole entire back ground that was disguised to look like The surface world Edora, once again started to change. I was once again standing in the middle of space, the planet Edora floating right in front of me in all of its glory. The planet that had A green like surface that as time past began to change, to transform into a mottled rock filled with fire and magma. Large Cracks appeared around the planet, cracks that glowed from the lava that  Rose from the depths of the planets core. I who stood far away from the planet, in outer space could see gigantic volcanoes \ud83c\udf0b spew out rivers of lava. The planet looked horrible, and it seemed to be getting worse. It soon looked like the planet was collapsing in on it self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBOOM!!!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe planet after going through so much destruction finally exploded. Large chunks of the planet Edora floated off into the empty void of space. I knew that I was looking at a hologram, but it looked so real. It was so real that I could have sworn that I felt the whole room shake from the explosion. The background once again begins to change, I was once again standing in my mother\u2019s room, everything reverting back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that the Zorge empire had 1000s of planets that they controlled.\u201d I asked turning to look at my father, hoping that he had forgotten these simple facts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is true, the Zorge race had collected countless planets, but Edora was different.\u201d Sharal said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDifferent how?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEdora was the birth planet for all Zorge, it was a holy land so to speak, and even if this wasn\u2019t the case, every planet that the Zorge had conquered in the past was destroyed as well.\u201d Sharal says, shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand, planets don\u2019t just disappear, and explode for no reason. So what was responsible for all of that destruction?\u201d I ask, not being to except what I had just witnessed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry my son I can not tell you anymore about our planets destruction.\u201d Sharal says, defiance in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?!\u201d I yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are not ready for the answers, at least not yet.\u201d Sharal says, acting like a father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to argue, I didn\u2019t want to except being in the dark any longer, but the look in my fathers eyes told me that he wasn\u2019t going to change his cyber mind any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d I say feeling a little annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you at least tell me why My body is going through so many changes so suddenly.\u201d I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy son your changes are caused by your Zorge DNA \ud83e\uddec.\u201d Sharal says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharal wasn\u2019t telling me things I already didn\u2019t know, I mean it wasn\u2019t like human DNA could produce people who where able to read minds and  have super strength. I didn\u2019t want to call him out on his obvious answer, he was my father after all and I didn\u2019t want to seem rude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy son, the Zorge have the ability to evolve.\u201d Sharal says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvolve?\u201d I ask, wondering what he meant by those words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes evolve. It has come to my understanding that the human race is no stranger to the process of evolution. They themselves are in a constant state of evolution, but the Zorge have the ability to evolve at a alarming rate.\u201d Sharal says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know about evolution father, but evolution doesn\u2019t give super strength, nor does it give the ability to read minds.\u201d I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI in truth didn\u2019t know a lot about evolution, just the bare minimum I had learned in my science class at school. The last time I checked I was correct. I mean evolution could do many things, allow a aquatic species to walk on land, or give a land base animal the ability to breath under water \ud83d\udca7, and even allow a Flightless animal to fly in the sky with their wings, but mind reading, super strength, human evolution cannot do those things, at least that is what I think \ud83e\udd14. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is not true my son.\u201d Sharal says as if he were reading my mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe possibilities that evolution provides are endless, especially when it comes to the Zorge.\u201d Sharal says sounding very smart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I have told you before the Zorge are a war like race, our evolution has helped us wage those wars, and not only win, but come out even stronger.\u201d Sharal says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStronger how.\u201d I ask <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe process of evolution for most species is a process to help them survive and grow as a species, for the Zorge it is different.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widen from my fathers words <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDifferent how?\u201d I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Zorge did not evolve in order to survive, they evolved in order to fight.\u201d Sharal says with a dark voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur evolution was designed to turn us into the ultimate warrior, providing us with strength and power able to rip apart entire worlds.\u201d Sharal says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing, could any one being be that powerful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe more we grew the more powerful we became. We as a people didn\u2019t even have to be fighting for our bodies to evolve, the only requirement was that we had to be alive.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo did you also have the ability to read minds, and where you also super strong like me?\u201d I asked, complete taken back from what I had just heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, every Zorge experiences their own evolution. Some are almost the same, some are very different.\u201d Sharal ways with a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy abilities included, enhanced knowledge, and telekinesis, after I had reached my prime I no longer evolved.\u201d My father told me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy enhanced intelligence was the reason I wanted to be a scientist, to better help my people evolve into something better.\u201d Sharal says with his eyes closed, his smile growing even bigger. I could tell that he was thinking of something beautiful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo is this it for me father, will I stop evolving.\u201d I asked sounding a little hopeful. My fathers evolution had stoped at two powers, maybe mine will be the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do not know my son. As I have said before everyone experiences their own type of evolution. Their have been some Zorge with around 10 abilities, some with even more.\u201d My father says feeling sad, as if he knew he would be disappointing me with his answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA Zorges evolution doesn\u2019t just happen out of no were though.\u201d My father says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe one thing we scientist were able to find out over the years, is that a Zorges background, their environment matters when it comes to their evolution, and of course the situation.\u201d Father says rubbing his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean the situation?\u201d I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor example the Zorge were a war like race, therefore when ever a Zorge went into battle that would come about of that battle stronger than they were before. I myself didn\u2019t like to fight so I wasn\u2019t as strong as most of my brethren.\u201d Sharal says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was beginning to understand a little more about my people, and why exactly they were so powerful. The ability to constantly grow and develop more and more super powers, that was a OP ability, but I still had one more question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy now, why did I start to evolve today of all days?\u201d I asked curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy son all Zorge begin their path of evolution around the ages of 7 and 8. My father says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all made sense. I was 7 years old therefore I was old enough for my Zorge DNA to be awakened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe only thing that a Zorge child has at a young age before the ages of 7 and 8 are a greater intelligence.\u201d Sharal says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could understand that logic. Ever since I was a smaller child than I was now, I had always been smarter than all of the children. My mind seemed think like a computer. Math and even Science came easy to me, therefore I hardly paid attention to my teachers. They always hated me for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo let me get this straight, their is a slight possibility that I will evolve to be even stronger?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a slightly possibility but quite a large possibility my son. Zorge are bred to fight, so it is very rare for a Zorge to obtain a ability not suited for combat.\u201d Sharal says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh great.\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I stood in my mother\u2019s bedroom listening to my father Sharal talk about my very origins. I apparently come from a war like race called the Zorge, who travel around the cosmos conquering planets to add to the Zorge empire. You may be asking yourself what made the Zorge so powerful and special, well apparently the Zorge had the special ability to evolve, and gain greater abilities, so yea even now I am still processing that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared into my fathers sea green eyes as he stared into mine. I didn\u2019t want to evolve, to be something other than human, to bad I didn\u2019t have a choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo your saying I\u2019m going to keep getting more powerful?\u201d I asked hoping my father would say the answer I wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes my son, their is a high probability that you will develop even more powers as time goes by.\u201d My father says with a sorrowful tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to start pacing around my mothers bedroom, with both hands on top of my head. What was I going to do, how could I ever go to school, I wouldn\u2019t know when a new power would develop putting people in danger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing a strange sound in the corner of my ear, a sound that sounded like a glitching computer I began to stop pacing around the room. I looked towards my father and realized the strange sound was coming from him. The image of my father began to fade away slowly, he soon became transparent enough that I could not only see right through him, but I could see the crystal that aloud me to speak to my father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d I ask feeling a little concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that our time is at a end.\u201d Sharal says with a small smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I ask with fear in my voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis form that stands before you is nothing but a hologram, my true self had already died a long time ago. The essence crystal that aloud us to meet was never suppose to last forever and now that it\u2019s done it\u2019s job it is time for us to depart.\u201d Sharal says staring at me with peaceful eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo... no I can\u2019t lose you, what happens if I have more questions, what happens if I need help?\u201d I ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have faith in you my son, deep down I know you will find a way to handle any problem that you may face. No o be knows what the future holds, but one day I have a feeling we will meet again.\u201d Sharal says nodding his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears fell from my eyes. I had just found my father and now I had to say good by to him. Truly life is not fair. Looking at my father I soon realize the smile that he wore soon disappeared, as he stared at the ground and not at me. The room falls quite for what seems like a eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy son, I know that this is not the life you wanted. You are so young and yet already burdened with a huge responsibility. But know this I am proud of you. Sharal said disappearing even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe in you......\u201d Sharal had almost disappeared at this moment, I could hardly see him at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I will love you always.............\u201d with that declaration Sharal had completely disappeared the essence crystal falling to the carpet floor, no longer glowing crimson red or azure blue, or was complete gray, which was evident to me that it was completely dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood completely still, not knowing what to do, what to say. After a few minutes I soon walked outside of my mothers bed room and walked into the living room. My mom and my sister where sitting on the couch waiting for me to come out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing me appear from the room, both mom and my sister run over to me and look at me with concerned eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did it go?\u201d  Mom asks grabbing my right shoulder with her right hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy fathers gone and I have a story to tell you guys.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night I told my mother and my sister Bianca everything that my father Sharal had told me. I could tell that my mom and my sister where taken back by the information I shared, and as I finished explaining the room fell quite, my mother and sister where struggling to form words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSammy....\u201d mom says with a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at my mother with a little worry in my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter where you come from. You are my son, it doesn\u2019t matter where you come from that will never change. You are a good person, and are not defined by your people. Understand?\u201d  Mom says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea.\u201d I said with a shaky voice tears once again falling from my face. Me and my mom and sister once again shared a family hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night I didn\u2019t eat dinner. I wasn\u2019t even hungry, my mind was to  occupied with overwhelming thoughts. I simply went to bed to  prepare tomorrow. The next day of school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The next day) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly open my eyes feeling strange, as if something was missing, but what? It took me about a minute to figure out the problem.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t I feel my bed?\u201d I ask no one in  particular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n By angling my body I was able to look down to see my bed on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m floating. Oh my god I\u2019m floating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, this was just great. I have developed the power to defy gravity itself now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSammy come on! Your going to be late for your first day of middle school!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly open my eyes as my room fills with light from the sun. Today was a day I had dreaded since the beginning of my summer vacation. Today was my first day of middle school. I never needed to sleep as time passed much of my human needs vanished as if they had never existed, needs such as eating, and breathing also became inconsequential. I wasn\u2019t surprised when my body first became this way, my father Sharal warned me what was to come, what my life would be like. You see, I\u2019m not actually a normal human being, in fact I\u2019m not human at all. I belong to a super powerful race called the Zorge, a race which is now pretty much extinct. I\u2019m the last one, the last Zorge in all the universe. I\u2019m 12 years old and today is my first day of middle school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be down in a minute!\u201d I yelled down to my mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t even know why she even bothered yelling, I have super hearing, which in most cases is nothing but a pain in the ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly get out of bed \ud83d\udecc feeling the way I always do, like a million bucks. Never being tired at times can be a blessing, but then I remember that the reason I feel the way I do. You see the Zorge have the power of evolution, which in turn makes the Zorge super powerful warriors. So the reason my body evolves is only so that I can fight and defeat my enemy\u2019s, which makes me feel like this so called gift is nothing but a curse. But like it or not it is a curse I live with everyday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stare and look at my alarm clock that stood on my small dresser next to my bed, a alarm clock that  literally doesn\u2019t work, at the moment it was 8:10 and my first day of school started at 8:30. The school was only a few blocks away so I really wasn\u2019t worried about being late, but I really needed to get dress, fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world soon starts to slow down as if time it self started to slow down, at this moment my body had entered the realm of super speed which allowed me to move at inhumane speeds. If a regular person were to see me in that brief second then they would only see a blur of color moving around my room like a wild wind. It only took a nano second for me to get dressed and make my bed. I wore a white and black shirt and black jean pants, with black and white Nicky shoes on my feat. My white back pack rested on my back, filled with binders with blank line paper inside them and note books for notes \ud83d\udcdd. I had everything I would need for school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked down the stares and saw my mother were she always was in the morning, in the kitchen making coffee and breakfast. My mom was the only person in the house at the time, my sister Bianca had already left the house at 7:30 for work. As I walked down the  stares I could smell the sweet aroma of toast and Bacon, which I wanted to eat, to bad neither were done cooking yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally your up sleepy head.\u201d My mom says noticing me approach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah sorry I was having to good of a dream.\u201d I said with a smile, which wasn\u2019t a lie. It was true I didn\u2019t need to sleep, but that didn\u2019t mean I wasn\u2019t able to do so. What can I say it had become a habit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk over to the counter and grab a apple \ud83c\udf4e which rested in the middle of a basket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry mom no time to eat.\u201d I said biting into the sweet fruit, walking towards the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Sammy but please remember you are not like everyone else.\u201d My mom says with a worried look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could tell that she was just as worried as I was, going to a new school, hiding this secret, all of this had taken a tole on my whole family. I really didn\u2019t want to worry any of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.\u201d I stayed with a smile hoping it was enough to reassure my mom I would be careful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI step outside my house \ud83c\udfe1 and let out a breath of fresh air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look around to make sure no one was around and once again I entered the realm of super speed. I had to say super speed was a handy ability especially when it came to traveling to far off places. I run down the sidewalk passing  pedestrians and cars moving on the road. I was moving so fast that no normal person would be able to see me. I loved moving at such fast speeds, l loved feeling the air run past my hair, and seeing the world move at such a slow paste, a second to a normal person was a whole life time to me. Without a doubt this was my favorite power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take me long to get to the middle school \ud83c\udfeb. I stood before the front gate which bore the name Charleston middle school. This was the beginning, my brand new start I just hoped nothing bad happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWish me luck.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Powers Sam has so far)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.Super strength<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.Mind reading<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.Super hearing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.flight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.Super speed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.Self sustaining body/ self Sustenance <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Authors notes)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hoped you liked the new story. I decided to skip 5 years of Sammy\u2019s life to make the story much more untrusting.

But for now I should think about it later. But right now I could see Josiah Walters in front of me with two of his buddies. Josiah was this big grade four guy who bullied people all the time, including me. He's got black hair and this mean looking face, like he can't smile. His buddies are just silent muscle. I have he ears of them the day I came here, but this is becoming a common occurrence. And yes I sometimes do get away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there chocolate hair, ready to be our punch bag of the day?\" he asked aggressively. I didn't respond and I didn't even try to hear his thoughts, I didn't want to. I knee he and his friends were behind me at a safe distance, so I began to run.  \"Where in the world do you think you are goin' Carter?\" he asked, spitefully using my last name, like for all little kids like me. \"I asked for you to be our punch bag, so come back immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" I shouted back. He and his friends began to chase after me. \"Get away from me! I do not want to be beaten up!\" I shouted back at them, I am nobody's punch bag, Why didn't bring his own? Man, what a bully he was. Josiah and his buddies are nearly on my tail, fortunately I'm at a sane distance, which makes it the good news. I found the cafeteria, which was always spacious, so I took the chance and hid there. Its size made it a great place to hide, since the bullies had to take time to search. The bullies ran past the cafeteria, boy was I safe, for now though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think you get away from me like that?\" he asked furiously as he tries to find me. I took a peak where he is, then he turns around and looks at me. \"There you are!\" he shouts, \"do you ever, ever think you might get a way from me?\" I shocked, I had to find a place to hide. I began to hide behind the tables. The bullies soon appeared. \"Where are you?\" he shouted. he and his friends began to search everywhere, as they were searching for me, I found a ladder in the janitor's closet. I dunno why there's one, but it should help me escape \"O.K.\", I said to myself, \"I'm gonna make a run for it in 3, 2, 1!\" I began to run for it. That's the time the bullies caught me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are!\" he shouts. as I climb up the ladder to the roof top, the bullies started chasing me. as I reached the rooftop, the bullies began to climb up the ladder. Finally, when they reached there, I had no place to hide. The bullies saw me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you were ever able to escape?\" he asked. As the bullies crept closer to me, I slipped off the edge, and began to fall I believed to my death, but then surprisingly, I was literally standing in mid-air, just only a few inches from the ground. \"How can you-?\" he asked. I soon was able to fly around to escape him. Surprisingly, I can fly, with the bullies starring at me with awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finally landed safely on an area the bullies won't find me. I got away, for now. Now I really had to tell Jake what's going on. Mind-reading AND flight in one day? It's cool, but I am unsure weather I should talk to Jake about it or not.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The itchy feeling turned into a burning feeling, and it seemed to go right through him. Sammy leaned against the wall, sliding down, his head in his knees.<br>\r\nHis skin was hot, and his mouth dry. Suddenly, there was a tug in his gut, and a spurt of water hit him straight in the face, sizzling against his hot skin. He stood up and looked in the mirror. His skin looked normal, but his eyes changed from blue to green, then back to blue.<br>\r\nConfused, Sammy stared at himself. Then, all the burning and itching was gone, imediatly following a scream from outside, insanly loud.<br>\r\nSammy grabbed his backpack (which had been laying outside, thanks to his friend, Cody) and the two ran down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was raining. Hard and fast. Lightning had struck the tree and the rain seemed to spiral around.

He knew it would be a relief to tell someone; it was a secret that was too large for a kid like him to handle, but he knew better. He didn't want to freak his friend out or lose him. He had enough problems at the moment. No need to add another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchool let out, and Sammy had convinced his mother to let Cody and Jake come over. They picked out a movie and sat in front of the television munching popcorn.<br>\r\nCody threw a piece at Jake's head as the movie began. Jake turned and responded with his own barrage. The three boys laughed, and finally started watching the movie.<br>\r\nIt was the Incredibles, and Sammy's mind began to wander. If he had super powers, was he a superhero? And just how many powers did he have? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movie ended, and the boys ran outside. After several games had passed, they flopped down on the grass. Cody and Jake were arguing over who won the last game of tag, when Sammy interrupted. <br>\r\n\"If you had a superpower, what would it be?\" <br>\r\nCody responded immediately. \"Flying.\"<br>\r\nJake snorted. \"Don't be stupid. Super strength, or fire. C'mon, wouldn't it be cool to shoot fire out of your hands?\"<br>\r\n\"Or lasers out of your eyes?\" Cody put in. <br>\r\n\"What about names? I would be...\" Jake started. \"Dark Lord Spartan Tiger King.\"<br>\r\nCody pushed himself up on his elbows. \"'Dark Lord Spartan Tiger King?'\"<br>\r\nJake looked put out. \"Well, you do better.\"<br>\r\nCody grinned. \"Captain Talon or Captain Sparrow.\"<br>\r\n\"What about Sage or Phoenix?\" Sammy suggested. <br>\r\n\"Awesome!\" Jake and Cody said. <br>\r\n\"But... what's a Sage?\" Jake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Sammy asked his older sister to make him a superhero suit. In the back of his mind, he wondered if his sister had superpowers too. To his surprise, she had rummaged through her desk and pulled out a piece of material. \"So Mom finally told you, did she?\" <br>\r\nSammy's eyes widened. \"So are you like me?\"<br>\r\nHis sister (whose name was Ashlynn) unfolded the material revealing a pretty cool superhero costume, just Sammy's size. \"Yeah, but not as powerful. I only have telekinesis and super speed. So kid, what's the name you are gonna have?\"<br>\r\nSammy shuffled his feet. \"Um...I was thinking Sage or Phoenix.\"<br>\r\nAshlynn pulled her sewing kit from her desk as well. \"Hmm... lame. Based on Mom's prediction, I'd call myself ' the Temporal Shadow' or 'the Time Lord' or...\" Ashlynn smiled and tapped her lip. \"This is my favorite... 'Iridium'.\"<br>\r\n\"Iridium?\" Sammy asked, crinkling his eyebrows.<br>\r\n\"It's a type of metal that we can only get on Earth through asteroids and tin.\" Ashlynn explained. \"It's the strongest, rarest, densest, expensive, lightest metal we can get. At least, that's my opinion and-\"<br>\r\n\"Older sisters know best.\" Sammy droned, repeating the phrase Ashlynn was so fond of. \"Iridium sounds cool.\"<br>\r\nAshlynn grinned. \"Good, because that's what I put on your supersuit.\" She picked up the suit and tossed it to her little brother. \"Oh, and by the way, you should be more careful with your powers. I'm guessing the storm was your fault?\" <br>\r\nSammy blushed, glaring at his sister. \"Bye. Thanks for the suit.\"<br>\r\nAshlynn waved her hand. \"Someone has to do the work in this house. See ya, kid.\" She turned to her desk, paused, then tossed a mask at Sammy's head.<br>\r\nSammy left, heading towards his room to put on his new alter ego. </span></div></div>",

They were looking forward to a weekend of fun and relaxation, with just a little bit of homework as long as they had no classes and teachers to deal with until Monday morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey dude, whatcha doing this afternoon?\u201d Edward asked Kody. Kody and Edward were almost like twins. Both were the same height and weight. They were about 5 feet tall, both were twelve years old, and they both had blue eyes. The only difference was that Edward had slightly dark brown hair while Kody\u2019s hair was jet black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can come over later to play some games\u2026 If mom lets me!\u201d Kody replied. \u201cYou know how mom is\u2026 I gotta finish my homework first!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me about it! Well, send me a text message or IM me on Messenger when you\u2019re done!\u201d Edward replied, before he walked into the front door of his house. \u201cSee ya later, Kody!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody quickly jogged back to his house, which was right next door to his own. Kody and Eddy were neighbors, which was nice, since they loved to get together to play video games. Alex lived right next to Eddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody was an only child living with his mother. His dad passed away when he was only one year-old, so he never knew him. Their house was located right behind a large lake, which was where he enjoyed to go fishing with his friends occasionally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Kody got into his bedroom, he tossed his backpack on the floor next to his bed. Then he ran back to the kitchen and enjoyed the snack that his mother had left in the refrigerator to eat, to hold him over until she came home from work. She worked at a large office building downtown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finished his ham-and-cheese sandwich, he ran back into his room and pulled his math textbook and his notebook out of his backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me get this over with so that I can chat and play my video games\u2026\u201d he mumbled to himself. \u201cAnd maybe take a nap\u2026 I\u2019m getting sleepy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody worked on his sixth-grade math problems and finished them off. Then he changed into his shorts and t-shirt, before he crawled onto his bed. He closed his eyes for a moment before drifting off into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t get to sleep for long. When he woke up, he had a pounding headache. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooh man\u2026\u201d Kody groaned, as he rubbed his hand over his head. \u201cWhy does my head feel like it\u2019s about to burst? I never get headaches like this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill feeling groggy, Kody just stared at the wall before him. His room was facing Edwards\u2019s house, and there was a window just a few feet away from his bed. However, Kody just had a wall before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the white wall, which had posters of race cars and fighter jets hanging from it, appeared to become transparent while Kody continued to stare. Then, Edward\u2019s house suddenly became visible. As Kody continued to stare, the walls of Eddy\u2019s house also began to become transparent for his eyes as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment, he was able to see Edward sitting at his desk in his bedroom! Then Kody closed his eyes and blinked. When he opened his eyes again, everything appeared to be normal again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck was that?\u201d he wondered out loud. \u201cDid I just see Eddy, or was I dreaming?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody walked over to the window, which was a few feet to the other side of the wall, and verified that his wall was indeed facing Eddy\u2019s house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must be seeing things\u2026\u201d he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then put on his socks and shoes and got ready to run out the house to go to Eddy\u2019s to play some video games for the rest of the afternoon\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I got a new game!\u201d Eddy said to Kody, as soon as he opened the door and let Kody in. \u201cCome up to my room!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys ran upstairs to Eddy\u2019s bedroom, where Eddy ran up to his large dresser. Kody just stared at the large, wooden dresser as Eddy started opening the top shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d Kody asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI left the game in its plastic bag and I put it in one of these drawers. Darn it! I forgot which drawer I put it in\u2026\u201d Eddy replied, as he frantically searched through the large, wooden drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kody stared at the large wooden dresser containing five large drawers which were stacked on top of each other, suddenly the wood became transparent to Kody\u2019s eyes, and he was able to see the contents of each drawer right before him! Then, he spotted the plastic bag containing the game in the third drawer from the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think the game is in the third drawer, dude\u2026\u201d Kody said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddy has just closed the top drawer and he had now opened the second one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 I think I put it in here!\u201d Eddy said, as he rummaged through the second drawer, which was filled with books, papers, pens, and small toys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, man\u2026 Look in the third drawer!\u201d Kody grinned. \u201cI\u2019m serious!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddy closed the second drawer and finally opened the third one. Then, right before him, he spotted the plastic bag, containing the new video game. He pulled the game out of the drawer and held it right before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! How did you know that my new game was in the third drawer?\u201d Eddy asked. \u201cDid you put it there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way, dude!\u201d Kody shrugged. \u201cI just got here, remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddy gave Kody a suspicious look. There was no other way Kody could have known where the game could have been, so he just though that Kody had made a lucky guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh well\u2026 Lucky guess!\u201d Eddy said, as he took the game out of the bag and inserted it into the video game console.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys then started playing video games, when the phone rang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shoot! I bet that\u2019s my mom\u2026\u201d Eddy grumbled. \u201cShe always calls when I\u2019m in the middle of a game\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddy stood up and walked out into the hallways and strolled over to the kitchen, where the telephone hung from the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d Eddy said, as he answered the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kody was sitting on the floor, in Eddy\u2019s bedroom, playing a video game. To Kody\u2019s great surprise, he was able to hear the entire conversation between Eddy and his mother, word-for-word!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s weird\u2026\u201d Kody thought to himself. \u201cWhy is it that I can hear everything they\u2019re saying?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody heard Eddy\u2019s mother telling him that he had to finish his homework and that Kody wasn\u2019t allowed to spend the night because they were expecting company over for dinner around 7 o\u2019clock that evening. It was already after 6 o\u2019clock, and Eddy still needed to finish his homework.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Eddy walked back in the room, he had a very downcast look on his face. He didn\u2019t say anything at all, but Kody already knew everything that was said in the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026\u201d Kody said. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, dude\u2026 I don\u2019t want to get you in trouble\u2026 I\u2019d better get back home since you guys are having company over, so you can finish your homework\u2026\u201d Kody said, as he switched off the video game.\u201dI\u2019ll come over again tomorrow, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? How did you know all that?\u201d Eddy gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm\u2026 Lucky guess?\u201d Kody shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had several lucky guesses today! How do you do that?\u201d Eddy asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know! I just pick up on things\u2026\u201d Kody sighed. \u201cThe look on your face kinda gave it away\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, dude\u2026 See ya tomorrow\u2026 I gotta finish my stupid homework before my mom kills me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee ya!\u201d Kody said, as he walked out the door and returned home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kody walked out the door, he began to wonder how he was able to see the contents of Eddy\u2019s dresser. That was the second time he was able to see through a solid object that afternoon! And, to make things even weirder, how was he going to explain the fact that he was able to overhear the entire telephone conversation between Eddy and his mother?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore question filled his mind, as he walked back into his house. What else was he going to discover about himself?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could now see through things and he could suddenly have the listening skills of a bat? Not to long ago he was having the hardest time hearing what the teacher was saying in English, and all he had to worry about was understanding what was written on the white board. He turned the knob to the door of his house and was surprised when instead of just opening the door, he fell backwards with the door knob still in his hands. He looked up to see the door of his house now laying on him. He scrambled out from under the door and struggled with managing to get inside and attach the door back to his house. He heard his phone ring and he looked at the caller ID. It was Mr.Jones. He lived a few houses down. Kody answered to hear Mr.Jones, with a serious tone, as he said,<br>\r\n\"I saw what you did to the door.

That was close. Kody walked upstairs to call his mom to tell her about the door, and maybe if he got the courage up, to tell her about the strange powers he had just experienced. Kody walked up to his room and looked at his closet. It started to blur and than suddenly became transparent. He squinted and the wall in his closet faded to transparency to. He saw a room with a desk and a computer. He saw a big file cabinet and a small television. On the screen of the television was a figure. Kody tried to focus it out but felt a big push back and the closet was no longer transparent. What was that? What should he do?</span></div></div>",

It came from the Anderson\u2019s house, which was right across the street from his house. He knew Karen, a girl from school, and he also realized that her parents were very strict. It seemed like Karen\u2019s parents were shouting at each other. Kody stood there, frozen on the sidewalk while standing right in front of his own house, staring at the house across the street. His x-ray vision and telescopic vision kicked in, while his super-hearing allowed him to hear everything that was being said behind the walls of the house, over one-hundred feet away from where he was standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow come you didn\u2019t pay for her school supplies?\u201d Jack shouted and MaryAnn, who was Karen\u2019s mother. \u201cDo I have to come home from work just to get handed a bill from my daughter\u2019s school for over forty Dollars?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI used the money to buy her cheerleading uniform!\u201d MaryAnn shouted back. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Jack! Let the child enjoy her time in middle school, will you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s going to school to get an education, and not to wear a skimpy uniform just to dance around a bunch of football players! I forbid it! I want you to get that money back, and to pay for her school supplies, do you hear me?\u201d Jack shouted, as he tore the bill in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom! Dad! Stop it! STOP!\u201d Karen begged them to the point of tears. \u201cJust stop! I can\u2019t take this anymore! I hate it when you two fight over me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren turned around and ran into her bedroom, slamming the door shut behind her. Then she jumped on her bed, face-down and clung to her pillow while she covered her pillow case with her tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kody stood outside, and he witnessed the entire spectacle from a distance, thanks to his strange, emerging powers, which he couldn\u2019t yet explain or control. Just at that moment, Kody\u2019s mother, Pam, pulled into the driveway with her car. Right away, she spotted Kody standing on the sidewalk, while he was staring at the house across the street. She parked the car and walked up to her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKody? Kody?\u201d she asked him. For a moment, it seemed as if the boy was in some sort of trance, for he didn\u2019t respond. He stood there, with his mouth open wide, and his eyes fixed on the house across the street, in a cold stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKODY!\u201d Pam shouted, as she got closer. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, son? What are you looking at?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody was startled by his mother\u2019s voice, and he turned to face her right away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry mom\u2026 I was looking at something\u2026 Poor Karen\u2026\u201d Kody said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you staring at Karen\u2019s house?\u201d Pam asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKaren\u2019s mom and dad were having another fight. I feel so sorry for her\u2026\u201d Kody said sadly, as he bowed his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKody?\u201d Pam asked the boy calmly. \u201cH-How do you know that Jack and MaryAnn were having a fight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saw it, mom\u2026\u201d he whispered. \u201cAnd I heard it\u2026 I heard every word of it\u2026 It was ugly! I-I don\u2019t want to talk about it\u2026 Can we go inside now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam embraced Kody and hugged him. She didn\u2019t understand what he was talking about, or how he was able to see and hear things from such a distance, but she realized she needed to comfort him. Kody was obviously feeling upset, and she tried to make him feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go inside, okay?\u201d she said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Pam and Kody walked inside through the garage door. Pam made sure she closed the garage door behind her, so that Kody wouldn\u2019t see or hear anything from the Anderson\u2019s house across the street. Little did she know that Kody would start picking up sights and sounds from much farther away now, than the Anderson\u2019s house\u2026?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He couldn\u2019t find it, but I helped him find it in that big dresser of his\u2026\u201d Kody explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, did Eddy tell about the company he was having?\u201d his mom wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 It was really weird\u2026 I just overheard their phone conversation\u2026\u201d Kody responded. \u201cI-I can\u2019t explain it, but ever since I woke up from my nap this afternoon, I\u2019ve been seeing through walls and I\u2019ve been hearing things from very far away. I mean, is that normal, mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam just stared at her son in silence for a moment, while maintaining a serious look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 I guess you just have very sensitive hearing, Kody\u2026 It\u2019s a gift!\u201d she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, mom\u2026 How do you explain the fact that I can see through walls? And how was I able to see the contents of Eddy\u2019s dresser drawers without even opening them?\u201d the boy wondered. \u201cI mean, isn\u2019t that kinda weird?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re discovering some new talent or gift, Kody! I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, mom\u2026\u201d Kody continued. \u201cHow is it possible, that I\u2019m standing in front of our house, and I can see and hear everything that\u2019s going on in the Anderson\u2019s house, which is across the street?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know, Kody\u2026 Just calm down\u2026 Maybe you need to go to bed early\u2026 We\u2019ll see how you feel in the morning, alright?\u201d Pam replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m a little scared, mom\u2026\u201d Kody said softly. \u201cI feel different\u2026 I feel like, something about me is changing, and I don\u2019t know what it is\u2026 What\u2019s happening to me, mom? Suddenly, I feel like I\u2019m seeing everything\u2026 I\u2019m hearing everything\u2026 It\u2019s so weird\u2026 It\u2019s growing stronger\u2026 Every minute, something inside of me is growing stronger\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Kody\u2026 You\u2019re going to be alright\u2026 Don\u2019t worry\u2026\u201d Pam assured her son, as she leaned over and gave him a kiss on his forehead, hoping it would calm him down and put his concerns to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they were done eating dinner, Kody cleaned up the table and put away the dishes. He loaded the dishwasher and took out the trash. Pam then went to her bedroom, and Kody went to his. He changed into a t-shirt and shorts, which he normally wore when he went to sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kody had taken the comics page from the daily newspaper with him to his room, so he could read it before going to bed. As he sat on the edge of his bed, reading the comics, his attention was suddenly drawn to the sights and sounds coming from the Anderson\u2019s house, across the street. Since he was facing the other way, not facing Edward\u2019s house, he began to pick up everything that was happening in the house across the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, it came almost automatic. Without even wanting to listen in on what was going on, his super-hearing picked up on the conversations between Jack, MaryAnn, and Karen. Then, as he looked up and stared before him, the wall in front of him disappeared. And then, the outside wall of the Anderson\u2019s house disappeared as well. Finally, his vision sharpened tremendously as he was able to see the action in the Anderson\u2019s house up close, as if he were standing right there in their living room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Kody was holding the newspaper in his hands before him, he was hearing all the arguing and shouting that was going on at the home across the street. It was bothering him, to the point where it was upsetting him. He became angry, as he stared at the newspaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarn it! I want them to stop\u2026 I want them to STOP!\u201d he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, anger burned inside of him, as he heard the shouting across the street intensify.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t they just STOP?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, in a blink of an eye, red laser beams shot from Kody\u2019s pupils and struck the newspaper, setting it on fire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody gasped and froze, as he watched the paper, which he was holding in his hand, burn from the center. The flame started to spread, as it grew and slowly continued to spread towards the edges of the sheet. However, the smoke, which came from the flames, triggered the fire alarm in his bedroom to go off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPWEEEETT! PWEEEEEEETT!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it dawned on Kody, that he had started a fire, which had set off the smoke alarm! He took a deep breath, and quickly extinguished the fire, leaving behind the charred and burned paper, that he was holding in his hands, along with pieces of burned paper, which had fallen on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam immediately ran into the bedroom to see what was going on. She froze when she saw Kody holding the burned newspaper in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKODY! Kody Hart! How DARE you set a newspaper on fire in the house?\u201d she shouted at him. \u201cHaven\u2019t I told you NEVER to play with matches? What were you THINKING?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t playing with matches!!\u201d he shouted back. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to tell you all day, but you don\u2019t believe me! I\u2019m seeing things! I\u2019m hearing things! Weird things have been happening to me all day long!\u201d But you won\u2019t believe me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen how did you set the newspaper on fire, Kody?\u201d Pam asked him, standing right before the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith my EYES!\u201d he shouted, almost to the point of tears. \u201cI was upset because I keep on hearing the shouting from Karen\u2019s house! I did it through my eyes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT?\u201d she replied. \u201cKody! You better not be lying to me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFINE!\u201d he said, as he stood up. Then he held one piece of newspaper in his hand, which was not yet burned. He focused his eyes on the newspaper, and then two laser beams shot from his eyes, setting it on fire. He then held the burning piece of newspaper before his mother\u2019s face. \u201cHow do you explain that? Is that a gift, too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam froze when she witnessed her son setting the newspaper on fire with his eyes. Her mouth dropped wide open, as if she couldn\u2019t believe it had she not seen it with her very own eyes. Her son\u2019s super-hearing, his super-eye-sight, his ability to see through objects, and now the ability to start fires using just his eyes were putting her in the situation where she had to tell him the truth about his birth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you explain all this?\u201d Kody sobbed, with tears rolling down his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m turning in to a freak! I\u2019m a FREAK! What\u2019s happening to me? And why? Why are all these weird things happening to me? I see everything! I hear everything! I can see through walls! And now I can start fires with my eyes! What\u2019s next?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh Kody\u2026 I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u201d Pam whispered, as she wrapped her arms around the crying boy. The boy was hopelessly confused. She knew it. It was time to answer his questions. Or try to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A little over thirteen years ago, I moved here from our own planet. In fact our planet's a lot like Earth, one of the reasons I came here. We look exactly like the people on Earth. You can't tell us apart. But the chemicals and minerals and the atmosphere on our planet means we're born with special powers. It means we can do stuff that normal earthlings can't.\"<br>\r\n\"It...It does?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam nodded. \"Normally they don't come around until you're well into your teens, but in rare cases, kids develop these powers early. It usually comes after puberty's set in,\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" said Kody. He looked sad. Pam smiled and gave her son a hug, \"Now honey, don't worry! You'll still be able to lead a perfectly normal life!

And any kids we have inherit our powers, which is why you have them, sweetie,\" she said, and gave her son a kiss. Kody cringed, he felt he was getting a bit old for kisses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" said Kody again. \"Well...this is pretty cool...\"<br>\r\nHis mother smiled, \"It is, but be careful with your powers honey. And don't tell ANYONE. Not even your dad knew before he died. If you tell someone...well who knows what might happen.\"<br>\r\n\"What other powers do I have?\" Kody asked. <br>\r\n\"Depends,\" said Pam. \"You'll discover more as you grow up, or they might come to you all at once.

Many people in our city died from the epidemic, and we were afraid we were going to die as well. We were especially afraid for you, and we wanted to make sure you would survive here on earth, so we gave you the serums of all the main superheroes of Korasow.

Use them to help other people! Use them to help your friends and use them to help those in need! Soon, we\u2019ll make you a special costume you could wear, when you go out as a young teenage superhero.

For some reason, he had more energy now. He wasn\u2019t feeling that sleepy anymore. He figured it was probably because of his new powers, he didn\u2019t need much sleep anymore. He chatted and surfed on the Internet before he crawled in bed. Then, he drifted off to a deep sleep until morning.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When he looked out the window, he saw both boys outside, and he was able to hear every word of their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody quickly got dressed and ran outside. He joined up with the other two, and the threesome walked over to the forest where they spread apart a great distance so they could throw the football to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point, Alex threw the ball too hard at Kody, and the ball landed in one of the trees behind him. In fact, the ball got stuck between one of the branches of the trees just behind the spot where Kody was standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get it, you guys!\u201d Kody said, as he turned around and walked into the woods to retrieve the lost football. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking around a few moments, Kody looked up and spotted the ball, stuck between two branches of a tall tree. Obviously, the ball was out of his reach. At first, Kody grabbed a few branches, which had fallen to the ground, and started tossing them at the ball, hoping to be able to knock the ball loose. When this didn\u2019t work, he started looking for some rocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKody!

He became frustrated, and he almost wanted to try to leap up in the air and see if he could try to reach the branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething very weird happened! Kody extended both arms in the air and willed to reach the branches, where the football was located. Suddenly, completely by surprise, his body began to rise up off the ground! Kody was suspended three feet in mid-air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d he gasped. \u201cWhat the heck?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody couldn\u2019t believe it! He was hovering in air!

He was flying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly crap! I\u2019m flying!\u201d he cheered. \u201cI can fly! I can FLY!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody flew over to the branch and stopped, hovering right over the football. He then reached down, and pulled the ball loose from the branch. Then he flew back to the outer edge of the woods, with the ball in hand, when he suddenly heard Edward\u2019s and Alex\u2019s voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKody!

Cool, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat else can you do?\u201d Edward asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see and hear everything for miles away! I can see through walls and objects. And, now I can fly! Soon, I\u2019ll have super strength. I can also start fires with my eyes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat! No way!\u201d Alex replied in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody picked up a small branch from the ground and held it before him. Then he focused on the tip of the branch with his eyes, and concentrated on setting it on fire. Suddenly, red beams of light shot from his eyes and struck the tip of the branch in one spot, immediately setting it on fire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook!\u201d Edward grinned. \u201cHe set the branch on fire with his eyes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is so cool!\u201d Alex laughed. \u201cDude! You\u2019re some sort of super-kid!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody then blew on the branch and extinguished the flame, before he tossed the branch on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 Mom says I should become a super hero, but not until I discover and figure out how to use all my other powers first\u2026\u201d Kody explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOther powers?\u201d Edward asked him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 I should get the powers of about fifty superheroes from my planet!\u201d Kody shrugged. \u201cNot only that, but I should become super strong and I\u2019ll be able to run really fast, too\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we help you out?\u201d Alex said excitedly. \u201cI wanna train you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 sure\u2026 but don\u2019t tell ANYONE else!\u201d Kody said in a stern voice. \u201cEspecially not in school!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you gotta practice flying, first!\u201d Edward chuckled. \u201cI want to train you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three boys huddled together for the second time, with their arms wrapped around their shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys\u2026 I just found out about all this superpowers stuff\u2026\u201d Kody whispered to them. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m really scared\u2026 I\u2019m scared to death\u2026 the guys at school are gonna freak! What if they find out I\u2019m an alien? You guys gotta help me! I need you guys\u2026 I\u2019m serious! Every day I\u2019m finding out I got some new weird power-thing, and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing\u2026 You know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude! We\u2019ll protect you!\u201d Edward assured him. \u201cYou got the powers, but we are your loyal friends! We\u2019ll cover for you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! We\u2019ll help you, Kody! But you gotta show us all your cool powers!\u201d Alex added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, guys\u2026\u201d Kody said, with tears rolling from his eyes. \u201cI-I d-don\u2019t know\u2026 What to say\u2026 I-I\u2019m really scared\u2026 I\u2019m becoming a\u2026 a freak\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO! You\u2019re not a freak, Kody! You\u2019re a super-dude!\u201d Edward whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna be a HERO!\u201d Alex cheered. \u201cA superhero! That\u2019s fantastic!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we help you make a costume?\u201d Edward asked him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Kody replied, as he wiped the tears from his eyes. \u201cOf-Of course\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you take us flying?\u201d Alex wondered. \u201cAnd will you be able to teleport us to school? And will you be able to lift heavy things? And walk through walls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I think so\u2026 Soon\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou gotta show us ALL your powers when you learn how to use them!\u201d Edward instructed Kody. \u201cWe are your trainers!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, you guys. I need you\u2026\u201d Kody replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three boys then walked back to the field in the woods, where they started out playing football earlier.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You got all the powers, but you must do everything I tell you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Kody replied humbly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn return, we will cover for you and we will protect you and help you learn all your cool powers!\u201d Alex added. \u201cIs that a deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a deal!\u201d Kody replied with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys stood in the middle of the open field, which was surrounded by tall trees and bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKody! Take off and fly a few circles in the air so you get used to flying above us!\u201d Edward commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay!\u201d Kody responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody then extended his arms above his head and straight into the air. His body slowly rose off the ground, before leveling off into the horizontal position. Kody quickly ascended higher and higher, while flying in a wide, lazy circle around the area where Edward and Alex where standing, while he was waving down at them with his right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoohoo! You guys!!\u201d he cheered, as he slowly flew in a wide circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so cool!\u201d Alex said, while looking up at the flying boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazing!\u201d Edward grinned. \u201cOur best friend can fly!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody extended his arms sideways as he banked to his right, making several turns and forming the number eight in the air, about twenty feet above the boys, who were looking from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so much fun!\u201d Kody cheered, as he descended and flew right over them, almost brushing their hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody circled around and came back, this time coming straight for Alex from behind. This time, he dove further down, and aimed for Alex\u2019s waist. Just before he was right behind Alex, he grabbed Alex from behind, and lifted him off his feet and pulled him into the air with him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhaaa!\u201d Alex shouted. \u201cKODY! What are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m taking you flying with me!\u201d Kody said, as he carried Alex in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody flew a wide circle around the forest before slowing down and gently setting Alex down on the ground. Then, he took off again, and flew straight up into the air before coming straight down for Edward. He grabbed Edward from behind, and pulled him off the ground by his waist as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHOA!\u201d Edward gasped, as he was lifted into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaving fun on Kody Airlines?\u201d Kody chuckled, as he carried Edward with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! You\u2019re going so fast!\u201d Edward said, as he looked down at Alex, who was standing on the ground, looking up at the two flying boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody and Edward flew high over the woods and then circled around their house. Alex saw that, and started running towards Edward\u2019s house. Since Edward had his bedroom window open, Kody flew into the room through the window. Luckily, Alex wasn\u2019t far away, so it took him only a few minutes to catch up to the flying boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Kody slowed down and hovered over the center of Edward\u2019s room, before landing on his feet. He set Edward down, right in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere! That was easy!\u201d Kody laughed. \u201cNow I know how to fly!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex had just walked in the house and he entered the bedroom, closing the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat an amazing sight, seeing you guys flying like that!\u201d he said to Kody and Edward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s take a break and watch TV or play some video games?\u201d Edward suggested, as he turned on his PC and his video game console.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex and Edward started playing a video game as Kody got on his bed, and started watching a movie on Edward\u2019s PC screen. Since Edward had two large dual monitors, it was easy to watch a movie on his computer. Kody was feeling a little tired from all the excitement after all the flying so  he grabbed one of Edward\u2019s pillows and quietly dozed off while laying on Edward\u2019s bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward and Alex didn\u2019t pay any attention to Kody, since they were busy with the game and they heard the sound from the movie playing in the background. However, after ten minutes had passed, both boys had begun to notice something strange. When they looked up, they saw Kody floating almost six feet above them, in the center of the bedroom, hovering like a balloon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly smoke!\u201d Alex whispered to Edward. \u201cLook!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys got up and saw Kody floating in the air, but sound asleep, while clenching a pillow with both arms wrapped around it, and his head resting on the edge of the pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like our superhero now flies in his sleep!\u201d Edward whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is so weird!\u201d Alex whispered back, as they stood there, at Kody\u2019s head. \u201cHe\u2019s almost like a balloon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward then walked to the other end of Kody\u2019s body, which floated in the complete horizontal position, and gently grabbed hold of his right tennis shoe. Then he slowly pulled Kody towards one end of the room, where his bed was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! When he flies, he weighs the same as a sheet of paper!\u201d Edward noted. \u201cThis is awesome!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to watch him\u2026 Always!\u201d Alex stated. \u201cEspecially in school!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll use cell phones and earpieces\u2026 I have them! That way, we can always talk to him!\u201d Edward noted. \u201cBecause we don\u2019t know where he will go, now that he knows how to fly!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! He\u2019s ours! And nobody else\u2019s!\u201d Alex stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys couldn\u2019t help but feel proud of their alien superhero-to-be, and wonder what strange power he would discover next\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A couple of days later, Alex, Kody and Ed were heading off to school. The school-bus broke down so they found themselves walking the last few blocks to the campus. They talked in whispers about Kody's powers. Flying, heat-rays out of his eyes, X-ray vision, supersonic hearing... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh, that would be so cool!...\" said Kody. Eddy grinned. The three boys started crossing the street. Kody tugged out a ten-dollar note his mother had given him as lunch-money. He fingered it in his hands when a slight breeze tugged it out from between his fingers. It fluttered to the ground a couple of feet from him. Kody walked over and picked it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So anyway, I thought that perhaps you could...Kody?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddy turned around. Kody was gone. Alex looked behind him to see Kody bending down to pick up his ten-dollar note. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kody!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah just a minute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody was having trouble picking up the smooth, flat note which was lying on the ground. His fingers just wouldn't grip it. COME ON! Kody tried again, but the note refused to crinkle up into his hands. He tried pinching one of the edges. Got it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KODY!\" Alex was screaming! Kody looked up and yelped! A truck the size of a blue whale was charging towards him! <br>\r\n\"Oh God, I wish I wasn't here!\" Kody whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, everything went blurry. Then white. Then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody felt something soft underneath his feet. He opened his eyes. He wasn't standing on the road at all! He could feel grass under his feet. He looked around. He was standing behind a tree, next to the road. Alex and Eddy were staring after the truck. Kody felt dizzy. What the HELL just happened!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys!\" he shouted. Ed and Alex jumped about two feet in the air and turned around. They yelped in relief and ran over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT DID YOU DO!?\" Eddy screamed. <br>\r\n\"I don't know!\" Kody panted, \"I...I...\"<br>\r\n\"You didn't...\" Alex whispered.<br>\r\n\"Didn't...what?\" Kody asked, nervously. <br>\r\n\"You can teleport!\" said Alex. \"You can move from place to place! Oh man that is awesome!\" <br>\r\n\"I...I can?...I CAN!\" Kody said. \"Woah...\"<br>\r\n\"How did you do it?\" Ed asked. <br>\r\n\"I...I'm not sure yet...\" said Kody. <br>\r\n\"Well think about it. It'll come to you,\" said Ed. \"Come on, we're gonna be late for school.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>During lunchtime, Kody, Ed and Alex had more fun with Kody's new powers. They smuggled a magnifying glass out of the science-labs after their chemistry experiment and they were sitting in a quiet spot behind one of the larger buildings on campus, with Kody pretending to burn pieces of paper with the glass. He wasn't, really. It was too shady, and to burn stuff with a magnifying glass you need really strong sunlight. Kody was holding the glass up to his eyes and looking through it. He narrowed his eyes as if he was trying to concentrate on something really small. He was actually concentrating on fire. He was thinking...FIRE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFhwoomp!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex and Ed watched as Kody's eyes turned blood red, glowing like traffic-lights. A laser-beam-like light shot out of them, passing quite harmlessly through the glass, and hitting the paper which Ed had scrunched up and put under the glass. It smouldered, then burst into flames! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww man!\" said Alex, \"This is awesome, okay, my turn next.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ripped a piece of paper out of an exercise book, scrunched it up and put it under the glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OUCH!!\" Alex yelped. Kody blinked and the red in his eyes vanished. \"Oh Jeeze, sorry man, did I get you?\"<br>\r\n\"A bit...\" said Alex. He was rubbing the back of his hand and Kody saw a small burn-mark there. Kody grinned, \"Sorry,\" he said. He turned back to the paper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naughty naughty naughty, you little boys are gonna get caughty!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody nearly smashed the glass into his face. He turned around to see three figures standing in front of him and his friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody, Alex and Eddie were sitting on a low, brick wall, about three feet high. In front of them were the back walls of the art-classroom. The space of the passage between the classroom walls and the lower, brick wall which they were sitting on was perhaps three or four feet wide. It was a shady, lonely spot in the school, perfect for such activities as burning paper with your eyes. Unfortunately, Kody and his friends had decided to do this activity at the corner of the building and wall, where the paved passage turned at right-angles. One figure stood at one end of the passage, another at the other end, and one, right in front of them, leaning against the angle in the classroom's outer wall. Eddy gulped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam, Greg and Kaydan were huge. They were in their senior years in highschool, they would be leaving next year. But before leaving, they were damned sure they were gonna make life living hell for just about everyone else. Including, it seemed, the three amigoes sitting innocently on the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want, Kaydan?\" Alex said, trying to sound more confident than he was. The three bullies were huge. They were your stereotypical highschool jocks. About six feet tall, muscular, tough, popular and stupid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We noticed that you guys haven't had LUNCH yet,\" said Greg. \"All that money in your pockets must be burning a hole there, huh? Why not give it to us?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" said Alex, standing up. <br>\r\n\"I don't think you have a choice,\" said Kaydan, moving closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody grabbed his two friends and pulled them back. \"Let me handle this...\" he whispered, \"give me your money...\"<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" Alex hissed back.<br>\r\n\"Just do it! You want another bleeding nose to explain to your mother? How many times can you walk into a door?\"<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends dug their money out of their pockets. Kody handed over the crumpled five and ten-dollar banknotes. Kaydan pocketed it. \"Good boys,\" he said. And turned to leave. Kody watched him carefully. He watched which pocket he put the money into. Then he watched Kaydan take out a box of matches and light a cigarette. He watched him put the matches into the same pocket as the money...perfect... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kody...what are you doing...?\" Alex whispered. He saw Kody's eyes turn red. <br>\r\n\"Stop talking, I need to concentrate...\" Kody hissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take much. There was a pause, and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrrrumph!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe matches in Kaydan's jeans did a hotbox and all the little splinters of wood caught fire at once! It was like a miniature firework! He screamed as smoke and flames rushed out of his pocket! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RUN!\" Kody screamed. Alex and Eddy took off, with Kody just behind them. Kaydan screamed and threw himself on the ground, rolling from side to side, trying to put the fire out. Adam threw his coat him and finally beat the flames out. Kody and his friends watched from behind a bench nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man that was AWESOME!\" said Alex. \"How did you do that?\"<br>\r\n\"The matchbox made a pretty obvious shape inside his pocket,\" said Kody, \"I just concentrated on it...sorry about your lunch-money...\"<br>\r\n\"Dude, it was WORTH IT!\" said Alex, laughing. Eddie grinned. </span></div></div>",

It was Mr. Arden, the maths teacher. <br>\r\n\"I saw you and your friends running just now,\" he said. \"You knocked over the rubbish bin over there. I want you to clean it all up.\" <br>\r\n\"Yes sir,\" said Kody. \"Come on, guys.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bin wasn't too heavy, and Alex and Ed tipped it right way up again. Kody started flinging rubbish back into the bin. He was furious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do those jerks think they are!?\" he shouted as he tossed empty yogurt cups and clingwrap into the bin. \"ONE DAY I'm gonna get them!\"<br>\r\n\"Dude, you nearly roasted his balls right off!\" said Alex, still laughing, \"I think that's revenge enough.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but they make me so ANGRY!\" Kody said. He picked up a glass bottle and held it in his hands. \"All of them do! They think they can just bully people and get away with it and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK! CRUNCH!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody let out a yelp of surprise. Alex and Ed looked up. The bottle in Kody's hand was gone! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...what just happened?\" Ed asked. <br>\r\n\"I...I don't know!\" said Kody. <br>\r\n\"It's another power!\" said Alex, excitedly, \"What did you do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody thought for a minute. He was ranting about Kaydan and the other bullies, he had a bottle in his hand. It was a glass lemonade bottle. He was squeezing it because he was so angry and...and then...and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody looked at his right hand, which was still clenched in a fist of rage. No way, he thought. He did not just..he didn't just...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwalking over to the bin, Kody held his right fist over it and slowly opened his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowdered glass, as fine as the sand it was once made of, sprinkled out into the bin like dust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" said Alex, he grabbed Kody's hand. \"You didn't even cut yourself! There's no bleeding or anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody looked at his hand. Sure enough, there wasn't anything there!...Well, apart from a bit of crushed glass. Carefully, he dusted his hand off. \"What the hell is going on?\" he mouthed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd finished binning all the rubbish, and then he picked up something else. \"What about this?\" he said. He handed Kody a brick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" said Alex, \"He can't!...\"<br>\r\n\"He just turned that bottle into dust!\" said Ed, defensively.<br>\r\n\"Yeah but that was hollow!\" said Kody, \"Anyone could do it...\"<br>\r\n\"Go on, give it a shot!\" said Ed. Kody sighed and took the brick. He clasped it in both his hands and thought for a minute. Then, he tensed his body and twisted his wrists outwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brick shattered as Kody snapped it clean in half!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay THIS is weird...\" said Kody, \"It didn't even feel like a brick!\"<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Alex asked. He was examining the brick which Kody had just destroyed. It was a clean break right through! <br>\r\n\"It was like...Like I was...Hold out your hand.\" <br>\r\n\"Wh...\" Alex goggled. But, he held out his hand. Kody slapped one half of the brick into his friend's hand. \"What's it feel like?\" he asked. <br>\r\n\"A brick? What else?\" Alex asked. <br>\r\n\"Feels like a cookie to me,\" said Kody. \"Feels like a potato chip!\" And as if to make his point, Kody crushed the remaining half of the brick with his other hand, as easily as if he was crunching up a single potato chip. Reddy-brown dust trickled out of the bottom of his clenched fist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duuude...\" said Ed. \"What's this mean?\" <br>\r\n\"It's super-strength!\" said Alex, quickly, \"that's what it is!\" <br>\r\n\"I think he's right,\" said Kody, \"How many people can crush bricks to dust?\"<br>\r\n\"That is cool...\" Ed said. \"I wonder what else you can do?\" </span></div></div>",

Quickly, the boys headed back to their classroom and sat down. It was time for English. Kody sat down at the back, with Eddy and Alex. Their English teacher Mr. Matthews entered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay boys, now today's class is a double-period before we all pack up and go home, so let's just have a bit fun, hmm? I want you take out some paper and a pen and do a bit of writing. Whatever you like. Make it creative, fantastic, scary, mystical. Work on it during the week when you can, and hand it in next Monday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down at his desk, Mr. Matthews took out a book and started reading. Kody and his friends took out their notepads and pens and started writing. Kody struggled...then he got an idea. Why not write about his super-powers? Pfft. Nobody would believe him. And if they asked him to prove it, he could just fake it and say that it was an 'off day' for him. But then...perhaps he should change the kid's name? Yeah... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody started writing. He'd covered two or three pieces of paper on both sides before someone tapped him on the shoulder. Kody was angry. He was working on a totally ass-kicking story about a kid named Lance who was the Blue Flash, super-kid who could do anything, when he was forced to acknowledge the interruption. It was Alex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" Kody growled, although not very loud. <br>\r\n\"Are you paying attention to what you're doing?\" Alex whispered. <br>\r\n\"Huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex picked up the pen which Kody was writing with and pressed the tip to the desk and then picked it up again. A small, black burn-mark was left there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Kody hissed, \"What gives, man?\"<br>\r\n\"You're writing so fast you're melting your pen! Look!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody looked. Sure enough, the hard, ballpoint tip of his pen and the plastic sleeve were smoking! What the...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody thought for a minute. Was this a new power?...Not that writing super-fast could be considered a 'power' but...Then Kody thought a bit more. He ripped a blank sheet of paper from his notepad and scrunched it up and aimed for the bin on the other side of the room and threw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK! PANG! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex watched as Kody's arm flashed through the air, catapaulting the ball of paper across the room. The ball hit the window, cracking it, and then fell into the bin, hitting the side and denting it. But that was normal, sorta. Kody had just acquired super-strength. But then Alex saw Kody moving. He was FAST! REAL FAST! Alex decided to do a test. He snatched up Kody's book and threw it across the room, aiming right for Mr. Matthews' head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody jumped up from his seat, whizzed throgh the room, grabbed the book and zipped back, quicker than the time it took the second-hand on the clock to move! The two friends looked at each other. SUPER SPEED! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrring!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, dismissed!\" said Mr. Matthews. \"Have those stories in by this time next week.\" </span></div></div>",

The electricity is going from the outlet to my fingers, but I don\u2019t feel anything!\u201d Kody wondered out loud. However, when Kody turned towards the window, he noticed that all his hair was standing straight up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhhhh! My hair!\u201d he gasped. \u201cI\u2019m loaded with an electrical charge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody quickly pulled back his hand, so that the electricity would stop going from the outlet through his fingers. He then reached down, and picked up the end of the power cord, which belonged to the lamp, which stood on top of the TV set. As soon as his thumb touched the metal tips of the electrical power plug, the lamp lit up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh cool! I\u2019m like a power source!\u201d he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he removed the thumb, and the lamp turned off again.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kody, Edward, and his little sister Katie walked around the park a little longer, when Eddy and his sister went back home for dinner. Kody decided to leap in the air and fly home for a change, after making sure that nobody was around to see him from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of flying, Kody landed on the balcony, and walked in the second floor of the house. Then he strolled into his bedroom, where he began to change into other clothes. He was about to change into his sweats, when he was overcome by a sudden, intense stiffness in his joints and his muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh oh\u2026 I feel strange\u2026 I feel like I\u2019m changing!\u201d Kody wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Kody began to notice something really strange. His feet no longer felt natural. His feet began to feel like they were made out of\u2026 metal! After a few seconds, his toes, his ankle, and his heal had turned to solid steel!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! I\u2019m turning into steel!\u201d Kody gasped, as he looked down. He quickly stumbled to the full-body mirror in the bathroom, making a thump-thump sound as his steel feet hit the floor. His legs began to feel heavier and heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis skin began to change as well. His skin began to change gradually, from his ankles going up to his calves, changing from his smooth skin to thick, smooth metal. His calves slowly converted to metal, then his knees, and finally his quads began to convert to solid steel as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man! Am I becoming some sort of a robot or cyborg?\u201d Kody began to wonder, as he saw his legs completely transform to steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody tried to move, and he was pleasantly surprised that he was able to walk on his metallic legs. In fact, his legs felt heavy, but powerful. They were thick, and strong. He could tell that his legs were now built to last! Not only that, his legs were slightly longer than they were originally, making Kody stand a few inches taller. He was all light metallic-gray, almost like silver-colored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the strange transformation began to creep further upwards across the rest of Kody\u2019s body. The change felt good, though. First, his waist, and then his abdominals changed into a steel plate of muscle. His chest then morphed into two spheres of metallic pectorals, sticking out like armor protecting a mighty warrior in battle. Then, his broad shoulders and his upper arms and his biceps converted to light gray metal as well, as the skin disappeared and changed to metal. Finally, his hands, his wrists, and his fingers turned to thick, solid steel. This gave him a grip of steel as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow! I feel so\u2026 strong!\u201d Kody chuckled, as he raised his metal arm and flexed. He then made a fist and closed his fingers. He marveled at the way all five fingers moved so smoothly. Still, his arms felt thick and heavy, but he also felt as if his skin had become like armor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe metallic transformation continued to creep upward as Kody\u2019s shoulder blades turned to steel. Then, his neck and lower jaw started to change as well. Finally, his cheeks, his chin, his lips, his nose, and his eyes began to transform into metal, although Kody still retained his ability to breath, speak, look, and smell. Within moments, his entire head had changed to metal! Even though he had turned to steel, it was still easy to recognize him as Kody Hart. His face still retained all his features, just; he was now completely made of steel!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody walked into the living room, where Pam was just watching TV after coming home from work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, mom! Look what happened to me!\u201d Kody chuckled, as he strolled in the living room. With every step he took, he made a loud, deep \u201cthump\u201d sound on the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my goodness!\u201d Pam gasped. \u201cI was wondering what that noise was! You\u2019ve turned into a boy of steel!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody walked up to the couch, where Pam was sitting, so she could examine her metallic son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I feel great, mom\u2026 I just feel really heavy\u2026 I\u2019m all metal!\u201d Kody laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I bet you must weigh a ton!\u201d Pam observed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel really strong, too\u2026\u201d Kody grinned. \u201cI want to show my new look to Eddy and Alex\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo for it, iron-boy!\u201d Pam laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t scare them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody closed his eyes and began to concentrate on contacting Eddy and Alex telepathically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys! You guys want to see what I look like now? I\u2019m all metal!\u201d Kody thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys replied excitedly \u201cYes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody then concentrated on teleporting both boys to his living room. Then, suddenly, both Eddy and Alex appeared standing right before him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys!\u201d Kody smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Alex and Edward stood there, gawking at their metallic friend, who now looked like a teenage robot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d Alex shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I changed into Iron-Boy!\u201d Kody replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward walked up to Kody and tapped his finger against Kody\u2019s metallic chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTONK! TONK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 What do you think, huh?\u201d Kody laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you still have all your other powers?\u201d Eddy asked the metallic boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d Kody shrugged. \u201cI teleported you guys over here, didn\u2019t I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s take you out to the city!\u201d Alex suggested. \u201cYou\u2019ll be like a Robo-Kid!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex, Eddy and Kody then decided what to do next\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His arms and hands returned to flesh, as well as his chest, his abdominals, and then the rest of his torso. The changes continued to make their way further down, and his waist, his legs, and finally his feet finally changed back as well. Kody was now completely back to normal!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Come in!\" Alex shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't!\" Kody shouted, \"I don't know how to swim.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh come on! You can stay up the shallow end!\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah but..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kody knew what happened, he felt two hands at his back, pushing! He tripped forward and fell, head-first right into the deep end of the pool!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\" Eddie shouted, and cannonballed in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody hit the water and gasped. He kicked towards the surface, but for some reason he couldn't get there! He thrashed wildly with his arms and legs but the moment his head reached the surface, it went under again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU IDIOT!\" Alex screamed at Eddie, \"Get a pole to get him out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie jumped out of the pool and Alex swam over to Kody, who was going down fast. Alex dived and tried to grab Kody, but he couldn't pull him up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody was panting and gargling under water, water filled his mouth, his throat, nose, lungs...He gurgled water out and gurgled more in...and out...and in...and out...and in again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody could breathe under water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody plunged deeper and deeper until he was just a few inches from the bottom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KODY!\" Eddie screamed. <br>\r\n\"Hey chill!\" Alex shouted, \"Look!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie stuck his head underwater. Kody was sitting, quite calmly, on the bottom of the pool, as calmly as if he was lying in bed! His black hair swirled around him, but he seemed to be perfectly fine. There were no oxygen bubbles anywhere, but he didn't seem to be having any trouble breathing. Suddenly, Kody stood up at the bottom of the pool, and started kicking...faster, faster, faster, fastser, faster...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody broke the surface and flew three feet into the air before hitting the water again, drenching everyone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" he coughed and spat out water, \"I can breathe under water!

Kody grinned and he went to get a rubber floaty-mat. he threw it into the pool and climbed on. The mat wobbled and rippled and Eddy and Alex watched. Eddie tugged the mat to try and make Kody fall into the water, but he had surprisingly good balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get get me!\" Kody shouted. And it was true. No matter how hard or which way Alex or Eddy tugged the floating rubber mat, Kody stayed on it perfectly. Then Alex got an idea. Grabbing the broom which Eddie had tried to save Kody's life with, he pushed it between Kody's legs. Eddie grabbed one end of the broom and Alex grabbed the other. Together, they dived, taking the mat DOWN with them! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey'd gone down perhaps three feet when they realised they hadn't heard the loud 'splash!' which they thought they should. They kicked around in the water and looked up. They could see the soles of Kody's feet through the water...and he looked perfectly still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, they kicked back up to the surface! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody was standing on the surface of the pool, as easily as if he was standing on land! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" Alex gasped. He grabbed Kody's ankle and pulled. Kody stumbled...but remained on the surface of the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way...\" Eddie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody jumped. He hit the surface again...and stayed there. He took a few steps foward...back, side to side...he stayed on the water! He ran! He stepped out of the pool and jumped in again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRIGHT DOWN! Kody gasped and swam to the edge again. This time, he put one foot out over the water and stepped down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the other foot. He was standing on the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody tried this several more times until he discovered that if he wanted to walk on water or pretended to walk on water or made to walk on water - He would.

He unddressed and looked at himself in the mirror. A young, slim boy with black hair stared back.

They each put on their sun glasses, and got on the chairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey left their towels next to them, on the floor. Since Kody had just discovered that he could become invisible, he decided to have some fun with his new power. Kody then stood right between the two lounge chairs, where Edward and Alex were laying down, and decided to tease them, while completely unseen by either boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked up the towel, and tossed it on top of Alex\u2019s chest. At first, Alex just brushed it off, and pushed the towel back on the ground. He did it the second time as well. Then, the towel raised up from the ground, and magically floated back on to his chest for the third time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Alex said to Edward. \u201cQuit it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuit what?\u201d Edward wondered. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kody walked up to the edge of the pool, and used his hand, to splash a little water over Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do that for?\u201d Alex said, while getting annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo what?\u201d Edward wondered. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just splashed water over me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Edward gasped. \u201cI haven\u2019t moved from my chair! What are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex just folded his arms and stared at Edward for awhile. Then he closed his eyes. A few seconds had passed, and water was splashed all over him again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Alex got up from the chair; he walked over to the edge of the pool, and started splashing water over Edward, using his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! What\u2026 What are you DOING???\u201d Edward shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward got up and ran over to the other edge of the pool, and started splashing Alex.

Poor boys. Does your father know when it'll be repaired?\"<br>\r\n\"Naw,\" Alex said. \"This heat's playing havoc with all the electricity around town. People running their fans and air-con so much it's overwhelming the powerboard.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you boys can sleep here tonight,\" said Pam, ushering Eddie into the same room, \"Our house is always nice and cool in summer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody helped Alex and Eddie roll out their mattresses on the floor of his bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice of your mom to let us stay overnight,\" said Eddie. \"You think the power's gonna fail totally?\"<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Alex asked. <br>\r\n\"A blackout! We can use candles!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex giggled. Eddie loved playing around with fire. Closing the door and turning off the light and drawing the curtains to keep the heat out, the three boys lay down on their beds and mattresses, chatting about nothing in particular. Outside, it began to rain. A real summer downpour. The boys kept talking, louder and louder, trying to make themselves heard over the rain. A thunderclap echoed around and the house shook! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to bed, boys!\" Mrs. Hart called through the closed bedroom door, \"Try not to make too much noise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay mah!\" Kody shouted, \"Come on, let's get to bed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling over, the boys tried their best to fall asleep. It wasn't easy. The falling rain echoed through the house, drumming on the roof and gurgling over the gutters. Alex groaned and rolled over. And over. And over. He fell off his mattress onto the floor and grunted in pain. He got up and laid down on his mattress again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething creaked. Alex sat up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother creak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex stared around the room. \"HOLY!...\" he yelped and stuffed as much blanket into his mouth as he could to stop himself from screaming. Two bright, white ovals of light were hovering in mid-air above Kody's bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-k-Kody?\" he whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\"<br>\r\n\"Wh...what's that?\" <br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex got up and felt his way to Kody's bed and sat down. Now he realised that Kody was awake and sitting up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tha...\" Alex reached out for the two white lights...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OUCH! Jesus man, what gives!?\" Kody snapped, shoving Alex's fingers away, \"That HURTS!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...\" Alex was speechless. Kody blinked, trying to get rid of the pain. He blinked and blinked until the sudden pain was gone. He sighed, \"Ouch,\" he said. He looked up again. Alex's mouth dropped. Kody's eyes were shining in the dark! Kody blinked and Alex yelped, turning away! Two, twin beams of light shot out of Kody's eys, lighting up the entire room! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eddie!\" Alex hissed, shaking Eddie on his mattress, \"Eddie, man! Wake up!\"<br>\r\n\"Turn the light off!\" Eddie groaned, \"I want to...woah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie sat up, shielding his eyes from the light coming from Kody's, \"What the hell!?\"<br>\r\n\"It's kinda cool, huh?\" Kody said, he stared around the room, his eyes lighting up everything. Kody drew back the curtains of his bedroom window and stared outside. His friends joined him. Kody's \"eyelight\" shone right down the road! They could see to the end of the street, as clearly through the pouring rain, as if it was daytime! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is...weird!\" Alex said. Kody blinked, and his lights went off, \"Yeah...cool, though.\" He opened his eyes again. He started slightly. Everything was green and yellow...wha...Kody stared around his pitch-black room. He could see everything! Everything, as easily as if he'd just turned on his bedroom light. Experimentally, he turned on the light. Nothing happened. He guessed the power really was out, due to the storm, but he could totally see everything! He had night-vision too! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody sat on his bed, blinking, his eyelights went from weak all the way to headlamp, searchlight, ligththouse-intensity brightness! And then, he could see in the dark, too! This was awesome! Kody couldn't wait to try out his new powers... </span></div></div>",

Kody noted with supreme satisfaction that the place where Kaydan's right blue-jeans pockets were, had disappeared, replaced with a singed, frayed area which showed off his boxer-shorts underneath. Did he go around the rest of the school day looking like THAT? What a jerk! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got lucky, asswipe!\" Kaydan said. He seemed to be singling Kody out for some reason. He was advancing steadily towards him and the three boys started backing away until they hit a fence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had been walking home from school, when they were accosted, and Kody had led them all down a side-street. Right now they found themselves in an alleyway, with no-where to go. Alex looked around for something to defend himself with, and picked up an old, rusty pipe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't do anything!\" said Kody, calmly. \"It's stupid to keep matches in your pocket. My mommy always said that...\"<br>\r\n\"STUFF YOUR MOMMY!\" Kaydan roared. He dived for Kody, who ducked and backed out of the way. The other bullies closed in. Alex swung the pipe and clouted Greg on the jaw, knocking him back. A sickening 'Crack!' told Alex that something - possibly Greg's jawbone, had been broken. He grunted and fell over, hitting his head and falling to the ground in an unconcious heap. Eddie tried to defend himself but he was pinned against the wall with Adam beating the living daylights out of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaydan was swinging left and right, trying to nail one, but Kody kept ducking and weaving. He remembered all those old martial-arts films that they showed on TV, and he copied all the movements. Finally, he decided he had to do something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want something?\" he panted, \"Sure!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody jumped up and swinging back his fist he hurled it forward! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound would've made anyone throw up. Blood and teeth spurted out as Kody's right fist hit Kaydan in the cheek, smashing his jawbone. He let out a scream and fell back. He could feel blood inside his mouth and he spat out a couple of broken teeth. \"You...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody kicked him between the legs and Kaydan toppled back onto the ground, one hand grabbing his face, the other one nursing his tortured goody-bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex had managed to knock Adam out with the pipe and, finding themselves without any opponents, the boys grabbed hold of Kody, who teleported them out of there as fast as he could. </span></div></div>",

Kody opened the door and saw Eddy and Alex standing there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" said Kody, \"what's up?\"<br>\r\n\"Well we finished our work and we wanted to...I dunno...hang out?\" Eddie asked.

He shuffled to the kitchen, his mind on the tubs of ice-cream in the fridge...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFwunk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe freezer door swung open completely of its own accord. Kody stopped. Huh? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe licked his lips again...then he nearly screamed when he saw three tubs of ice-cream float out of the freezer in front of him! No way! Kody wondered what kind of new power this was. He grabbed the ice-cream and put it on the counter in the kitchen. He took out bowls and then wondered what kind of spoons he would need. The cutlery drawer sprang open and three dessert-spoons and one large serving-spoon floated out. Kody paused and thought about what was going on...Everything he'd thought about had floated out towards him. What did this mean? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody thought about three drinking glasses, and sure enough, they floated out of the cupboard and onto the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm onto something here,\" he said softly to himself. He imagined a bottle of lemonade pouring fizzy cold soda into the glasses. The fridge door opened and the bottle came floating out. The door slammed shut and the bottle landed with a 'clunk!' on the counter. Kody unscrewed the bottle with his mind and thought about filling up glasses. The bottle swayed and nearly fell over. Perhaps he needed more practice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing his mind, he thought about filling up the glasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fill...tip...come on...come on...\" Kody whispered. The bottle rose into the air! It tipped over and lemonade sloshed out. Alex turned around on the sofa and looked into the kitchen. He saw the bottle floating, upside down in mid-air as it filled the glasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOAH COOL!\" he shouted and jumped off the sofa to have a look. Eddy followed him quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFilling the glasses, Kody put everything on a tray and carried it into the living room. No, he levitated it into the living-room, and put it on the coffee-table in front of the TV. Using his new telekinetic powers, he scooped out the ice-cream, filling up the bowls. Alex and Eddy watched as their friend served them food and drink as if it was normal to have a bowl of ice-cream soaring towards you. They watched it as if it was some kind of cool magic show. </span></div></div>",

It doesn\u2019t bother me if they bully me\u2026 They can\u2019t hurt me\u2026\u201d Kody said out loud. \u201cBut, it really bugs me when they mess with my friends! I need to teach those guys a lesson they\u2019ll never forget!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh man\u2026\u201d Alex groaned. \u201cMy arm hurts\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody got up and walked over to where Alex was sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me see, dude\u2026 Let me see your arm. Are you alright?\u201d Kody asked him, obviously feeling very concerned about his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex extended his right arm, which contained the ugly bruise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kody saw it, something inside of him told him, that all he had to do was to just run his fingers over any wounds or bruises or cuts, and they would be healed, instantly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, just hold still, dude\u2026\u201d Kody said calmly, as he slowly and gently ran his hand over the bruise on Alex\u2019s arm. As soon as his hand passed over it, the bruise had disappeared! It was completely gone! There wasn\u2019t even a scar!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh\u2026 That felt good\u2026\u201d Alex grinned. \u201cWhat did you do to my arm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just healed it! Your bruise is gone! Now show me your right hand!\u201d Kody ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex extended his right arm, revealing his hand which had a nasty cut on it, which was still bleeding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna patch you up, dude\u2026\u201d Kody said, as he gently rubbed his hand over the cut. Instantly, the ugly cut on Alex\u2019s hand had disappeared as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Kody placed his finger over the cut on Alex\u2019s lip. Instantly, the cut healed and disappeared. The bleeding stopped, the cut was gone, and it didn\u2019t hurt anymore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly smoke!\u201d Alex gasped. \u201cIt\u2019s gone! All my cuts and bruises are gone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! What about me?\u201d Edward asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody walked over to Edward and placed his hand over the cut on Edward\u2019s arm, healing that instantly as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! That was awesome!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Pam came home from work, carrying a bag of groceries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you with those, mom!\u201d Kody offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, this is gonna be fun!\u201d Alex said, knowing that Kody was going to use his powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the grocery bag hovered in mid-air and floated to the refrigerator. The fridge door opened on its own, and the carton of milk and some other items floated out of the bag and into the fridge. Then the bag set down on the kitchen counter, and everything else that was still in it, came out and floated on the counter. Then, the door to the kitchen pantry opened, and all the canned items flew to the shelf for the canned goods, the items for the cereals and grains flew to that shelf, and all the cleaning supplies and soaps flew to the bottom shelf. Finally, the empty grocery bag flattened out and folded up by itself, before floating inside of one of the closets. And, all this happened while Kody just remained sitting on his chair at the dining table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can take out the two cans of chili, son\u2026\u201d Pam said. \u201cWe\u2019re making chili tonight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! Can Alex and Eddy stay for dinner, mom? Please?\u201d Kody asked his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, why not?\u201d she replied. \u201cAs long as it\u2019s okay with their parents!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody then used his powers to levitate the cordless phone to Edward\u2019s hand and he dialed the number to his house. Eddy then asked his parents for permission to stay for dinner. Of course, Kody heard the entire conversation, thanks to his super hearing. Then, he did the same for Alex. In the meantime, Pam prepared a big pan of chili for the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody then commanded four ceramic bowls to float out of the cupboards and to land right before them on the kitchen table. He allowed four sets of silverware to land on the table, along with four glasses and four napkins. Finally, a large pitcher of lemonade flew out of the refrigerator and landed on the center of the dining table. Kody then used it to pour some for everyone in their glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finally enjoyed their chili, they were able to taste the hot and spicy ingredients. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, mom\u2026 This is good!\u201d Kody said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Miss Hart! This is delicious!\u201d Edward added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEspecially on a cold night like tonight, a hot bowl of chili will warm you up, huh?\u201d Pam chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got that right, mom!\u201d Kody responded. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to feel really warm on the inside\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, come on, dude\u2026\u201d Alex laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody took a couple of deep breathes through his nose. Then, he opened his mouth wide, while aiming his head a little towards the ceiling, and a large, thick, red flame of fire burst out of Kody\u2019s mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSSSSWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOSSSHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhaaaa!!!\u201d Alex shouted. \u201cKody has dragon-breath!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOohmygosh!\u201d Edward exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody then closed his mouth and gulped down a big glass of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBUURRRPPPPP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhew!\u201d he cheered. \u201cThat felt great!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKody! That was rude!\u201d Pam said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, mom\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, both boys just couldn\u2019t hold in their laughing\u2026 What would their super-powered friend do next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The pitcher pitched the ball, and he swung the bat with every ounce of strength he could muster. The bat connected with the ball, and sent the ball flying over the baseball field! In fact, the ball soared high over the outer fence! It was a home run! The crowd went nuts! Alex dropped the bat and started his leisurely run over the three bases until he passed over home plate.

The clock disintergrated under the force of the blow, and Kody swore. He got up and stretched. The bed creaked. He stood up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground seemed a lot further away than usual. Kody groaned and rubbed his eyes. What was going on...He stepped forward, towards his closet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRIP! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody stopped, what was that? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously, his hands crept down to the level of his crotch. Uh-oh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody felt the frayed and torn seat of his PJs and stared down. He was wide awake now and his mind was swimming. He was huge! Quickly, he shuffled over to the door and checked the marks cut into the door-frame where his mother measured him. Four foot nine, five feet, five feet two inches...that's where it stopped. Kody grabbed a ruler from his desk. He was a LOT taller than five and two, he knew that. Placing the ruler against the doorframe, he started measuring, up...up...up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way...\" Kody whispered. He checked the new cut-marks he made in the door-frame and counted them all up...Seven feet, six inches! NO WAY. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody was HUGE! It was now he realised he couldn't even get out of his room without bending over, first! And, none of his clothes fit him! Damn! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOM!\" he shouted, \"A little help here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam bustled along the corridor and stopped outside her son's room. She opened the door and giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeell!\" she said, \"I see you had a growth-spurt!\"<br>\r\n\"I feel like a freak!\" he said. <br>\r\n\"Oh you're not...I think it's really cute!...Oh honey, you've got a new power!\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, but how do I get back DOWN?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"You'll have to figure that out by yourself, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I don't have anything to wear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam went to her son's closet and tugged out some of his clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give them a shake,\" she said. \"I kinda guessed this would happen one day. I've been using a special powder to wash your clothes to make them more stretchy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExperimentally, Kody shook out a pair of jeans and a T-shirt. As if there were hidden folds in the fabric, they expanded and tumbled out, longer and wider until they were big enough to fit him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now put them on, you better get going to school.\" <br>\r\n\"I can't go to school like this!\" Kody said.<br>\r\n\"Hmm...I guess not! Well then you better stay home today. Do some experimenting!\"</span></div></div>",

He was trying to bend down, compact his body AND move through a doorway barely large enough to take him, all at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, he made it down the corridor and into the kitchen. He sat down at the table and his mother started preparing breakfast for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, what's wrong, honey?\" she asked. <br>\r\n\"My...\" Kody rolled his head, \"...NECK!\" he groaned. \"All this bending and ducking...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam smiled and gave her son a kiss, \"You'll get used to it, honey.

Then he had another vision of Edward, watching TV in his living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to send you guys over to my room in order to show you something\u2026\u201d he thought. Right away, both boys heard his voice ringing in their ears.

As soon as he rose up, the boys realized what had happened to their best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow! You\u2019re HUGE!\u201d Eddy gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 I\u2019m over seven feet tall!\u201d Kody stated. \u201cI\u2019m a giant!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you get so big?\u201d Alex asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI woke up this morning and I was huge! I think I discovered a new power! I can make myself grow big!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but\u2026 Can you shrink back?\u201d Eddy asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I had better\u2026 Or else I\u2019ll be a giant for the rest of my life!\u201d Kody groaned, as he bent over while trying not to bump his head against the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Edward and Alex just gawked at the giant boy, who was standing before them. He already had so many powers, so it was funny seeing him trapped at this size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have to be able to shrink! If you can grow, then you should be able to shrink back!\u201d Alex insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright\u2026 Let me concentrate on shrinking\u2026\u201d Kody said, as he closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Kody\u2019s body began to shrink! His arms and legs and torso began to dwindle a bit! He lost about a foot or so in height, until he was over six-and-a-half feet tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay! It worked!\u201d Alex cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody walked up to the two boys, although he was still standing over a foot taller than them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhew! At least, I don\u2019t have to bend over anymore!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! You have to shrink back some more! Concentrate harder!\u201d Eddy stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 I should just keep my eyes closed\u2026\u201d Kody replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody closed his eyes and kept them shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright!\u201d he shouted. \u201cCome on, Kody! Shrink down\u2026 Fast!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, right before Eddy and Alex\u2019s eyes, Kody shrunk and shrunk and shrunk\u2026 From 6 foot 6 to 6 feet\u2026 5 feet\u2026 4 feet\u2026 3 feet\u2026 2 feet\u2026 1 foot\u2026 Until he was just about 3 inches tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly---! Kody!\u201d Alex shouted. KODY!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did he go?\u201d Eddy wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys kneeled down on the ground, where they saw three-inch-tall Kody staring at them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops!\u201d Kody groaned. \u201cI shrunk myself a little too much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex reached down with his hand, and Kody walked on to his palm. Then Alex got up, and Edward walked right next to him. Both boys were amazed! Kody was so small, he was standing in the palm of Alex\u2019s hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!

Disappearing objects through finger snaps? He shook his head. He didn't think anyone would have such a powerful ability, and his came from other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd and Alex softly said, \"Cool\", almost in unison. All this power viewing was losing its intial amazement factor and was now merely cool. While still an unusual thing to see, they were kinda getting jaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex said, \"A 'vanishing trick'. I must say, Kody, you have quite a variety, what with what else you have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJody puzzled over this a bit. \"I don't think that's it.

But I still think...\" He held a fist, aimed in the general direction of where the trash can was. Slowly as possible, just to make absolutely sure he was right, he opened his hand. It seemed to emerge from a small point on the floor. But it was unmistakable. The trash can went from too small to see to the right size, as did the trash inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex said, \"Oh, I see. Size changing. That's almost as cool.\" But he sounded slightly disappointed that Jody was not powerful enough to simply snap an object gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd added, \"Hunch, huh? Do you think you have super-vision and saw the thing at the smallest size?\" He was also, with Kody, trying to figure out how these powers worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJody said, \"Let's not jump to conclusions. But my guess is that snapping a few times makes it that small, so fast it looks like it went missing. And...\" He looked at the clock. \"I'll explain later. Class is in just two minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they hurried over to their classroom.

Okay\u2026 Let me think of Eddy\u2019s bedroom\u2026 Think of his room\u2026 I have a picture of Eddy\u2019s room in my mind now\u2026 I want to be in Eddy\u2019s bedroom right NOW!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a blink of an eye, Kody vanished from his bedroom, and he appeared in Edward\u2019s room again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook!\u201d Alex exclaimed. \u201cHe\u2019s back!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYay!\u201d Kody cheered. \u201cIt worked!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, let me guess: You just figured out a new power!\u201d Edward reasoned. \u201cYou just learned how to teleport!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! How did you know?\u201d Kody chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you suddenly disappeared from the room!\u201d Alex said angrily. \u201cThen, you popped up two minutes later!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! It\u2019s a great way to travel!\u201d Kody shrugged. \u201cAnd nobody saw me flying!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder if you could teleport us along with you?\u201d Edward wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! Teleport me home!\u201d Alex chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you need to hold on to me\u2026\u201d Kody said, as he held on to Alex\u2019s arm. \u201cNow, let me think of your bedroom for a minute\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, well see you guys later! Kody, just pop in anytime now, dude!\u201d Edward said to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody and Alex then disappeared from Edward\u2019s bedroom, appearing a second later in Alex\u2019s room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude! That rocked!\u201d Alex chuckled, as he let go of Kody\u2019s arm. \u201cThat would be one awesome way to go to school in the morning!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up on Monday, okay?\u201d Kody whispered to his friend. \u201cWe\u2019ll teleport to school together!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotta go, dude! See ya!\u201d Kody waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kody concentrated on his own room again and disappeared, only to appear back in his own bedroom. He was going to love this newest power of his a lot!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His mother opened his bedroom door and turned on the light. \"What's the matter!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody groaned and rubbed the back of his head. He rolled over and looked at his clock. 2:34. He picked it up and held it to his ear...No ticking. His clock ran out of battery-power! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...Mah, what's the time!?\" he asked. <br>\r\n\"Seven forty-five!

This HAD to happen on a MONDAY. On a MONDAY, the FIRST day of SCHOOL for the week. On MONDAY, the day when all bad things have to happen...Kody stalked around his room, throwing on his clothes and stuffing his keys and other things into his pockets and into his bag. It had to happen on a MONDAY when...When he was supposed to teleport to school...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody stopped. Yeah that was right...Wait...There was something else...He was meant to do something...Oh yeah, Alex! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody slung his schoolbag over his shoulders and then, standing in the front hall of his house, fully-dressed and ready, he closed his eyes. \"Alex's room...\" he thought, \"I want to be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you a bit LATE?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody opened his eyes. He was standing in Alex's bedroom. His friend was sitting on his bed reading a book. <br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" said Kody, \"My alarm-clock packed up on me. So...uh, you wanna...try this thing out?\"<br>\r\n\"Totally...Wait...can you do MORE than just me? Can you take two people? Like me AND Eddie?\"<br>\r\n\"I...I dunno,\" said Kody, \"I can try. Hold on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex tugged on his backpack and grabbed Kody by the arm. Kody closed his eyes and thought of Ed's bedroom. He felt a slight tugging and a breeze on his face. Then he opened his eyes. Kody and Alex were in Ed's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ED! YOU'RE GOING TO BE LATE!\" his father shouted. <br>\r\n\"GO WITHOUT ME! I'LL JUST WALK!\" Ed shouted. He kicked open his bedroom door, just as his dad got into his car and drove off to work. Ed stopped and gwaked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the middle of his room, and checking out the models of cars and boats on his bookcase, were Alex and Kody. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...how...\" he began. Then he remembered Kody's new power. \"You teleported here?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Kody. \"Alex wants to know if I can take you to school as well...by teleportation.\"<br>\r\n\"Uh...Hold on,\" said Ed. He rushed to get his shoes. He came in, sat down, tied them up and then grabbed his schoolbag. \"Okay...Hit it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody grabbed Alex's arm and Ed's arm and then closed his eyes. \"School...school...school...\", he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBEEP-BEEP!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three boys opened their eyes. They were standing outside their school, in the parking-lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you can,\" said Alex, \"It's like so long as we're holding onto you, you can take us with you.\"<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" said Kody. \"We better get to class...\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Alex. He turned around to go and then stopped. \"Kody, we're all in the same classes.\"<br>\r\n\"Right,\" said Kody. He grabbed Alex by the collar and, still holding onto Ed's arm, they vanished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And so by building the Suez Canal, the French allowed sailing times between Europe and Asia to be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir history teacher turned from the blackboard after hearing three chairs scraping across the classroom floor. Kody, Alex and Ed had just sat down and pulled out their books. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehm...Kody, Alexander, Edward, when did you just come in?\" he asked. <br>\r\n\"In...?\" Kody asked back. \"We never left! Ain't that right, guys?\" he asked, looking at Ed. Who nodded. \"Besides,\" said Kody, \"We're right at the back, we couldn't get into the room if you didn't see us, right? Probaby just looked over our heads when we all came crowding in at the start of class.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Alex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir history teacher scratched his temple, \"Well...well don't make too much noise, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody looked at Ed, then, he wrote something on the page of his book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I didn't think that our sudden appearance might seem weird to others, I think I gotta watch how I use this power.</i></span></div></div>",

Then he said, to no-one in particular, \"I wanna go back a hundred years!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a blue light appeared in front of him. Kody felt himself drawn towards it...he felt himself lift into the air slightly. Suddenly, the light enveloped him! It sucked him away, faster, faster! He was surrounded by the light! Faster! His hair blew around him, faster! He was having trouble breathing! His clothes ripped off him and new ones formed around him. Faster! He coughed and wheezed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHUMP!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woooaaah there!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody rolled over and screamed. A horse and carriage pulled to a halt in front of him and the driver of the coach jumped down from his box. \"You there, boy! Get up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody scrambled to his feet. Woaaaaaah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was broad daylight and Kody was standing in the middle of a bustling street. Horses, carts, people, trolleycars and bicycles clattered, rattled and whizzzed past. Tall, elegant buildings and men in suits and ladies in dresses were all around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Kid!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody turned to see the driver of the coach, \"You okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah,\" said Kody, \"What date is it today?\"<br>\r\n\"July ninth!\"<br>\r\n\"What year?\"<br>\r\n\"What are you?

He was wearing a brown flat-cap, a brown pair of trousers, black socks, brown shoes, a white shirt, suspenders, a brown waistcoat and brown suit-coat over the top of that...he tugged at his clothes. They were surprisingly comfortable. What was he going to bring back? He thought...what was really common a hundred years ago? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey kid, you have the time?\" a man asked. Kody tugged back his wrist. His watch was gone! <br>\r\n\"What are you? A dame?\" the man asked. He looked at Kody's waiscoat, \"Huh, no watch. Never mind, I'll ask someone else.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody watched the man disappear into the crowds of 1909 Broadway in the middle of Manhattan. What was he going to bring back? Wait, what did the man do? He looked at his waistcoat...why? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody looked at it too. It was an ordinary brown waistcoat, made of wool and cotton. It had half a dozen buttons and two straight pockets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPockets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody felt the pockets. They were empty. Pockets...time...no watch...Kody grinned. Of course! He'd bring back a pocket watch! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn 1909, and for the roughly 400 yeras preceeding it, men wore pocket watches. Wristwatches didn't come into fashion until the 1920s or even the 1930s. Kody wondered how he could get one. Even if he could find one, he wouldn't be able to pay for it! They must've been real expensive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" someone shouted. Kody turned around. A smashing of glass, people shouting. Someone running. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP THIEF! POLICE, POLICE!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody searched for the noise, then he saw a man running towards him with a bag under his arms, about six people were running after him. A policeman on his beat saw the man running and he dashed across the street, pulling out his service-revolver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP! STOP!\" he shouted. He drew his gun level and fired! The gunshot was deafening and Kody covered his ears! The bullet missed him by an inch! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No stop!\" one man, obviously the victim, said, \"You'll hit someone!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thief was getting closer and closer, Kody stared around and looked for something to defend himself with. He snatched up a broom lying on the ground and stuck it out! The man tripped on it and hit the footpath hard, the bag flew out of his hands and hit the footpath, it burst open and rings, necklaces and watch-cases spilled out. Before the man could get up, Kody jumped on him and forced his head onto the pavement. The policeman skidded to a halt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work, kid!\" he said. He tugged out a pair of D-shaped Darby handcuffs. Solid steel, shiny and unbreakable. He shackled them roughly around the man's wrists and hauled him up. \"Alright buddy, let's move it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jeweller rushed up to Kody, panting. He looked about middle-aged. He was balding and wore glasses. He had brown trousers and a white shirt and a yellow waistcoat on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thankyou!\" he gasped. He bent down and picked up the bag. \"He didn't take anything, did he?\" <br>\r\n\"I, I don't think so!\" Kody said.<br>\r\n\"Good, good...come with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody followed the man back to his jewellery shop and helped the jeweller put all the stuff back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much!\" he said, \"Anything at all that I can give you! I...I...\" he collapsed into a chair, still panting. \"So terrible!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody stared around the shop. \"Can I have a watch?\" he asked. <br>\r\n\"A...a watch?...Well since you did save about a thousand dollars worth of merchandise...Pick what you want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody stared at a display cabinet filled with watch-movements, intricate little machines. He picked out a large, 21-jewel Hamilton and then stared at the watch-cases. A large, solid gold one stared up at him. He made his selection and the jeweller put the two things carefully together. He tightened the screws and wound the watch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" he said. He held the watch up to Kody's ear. It ticked loud and fast. The jeweller clipped a long, gold chain to the watch and put the watch into Kody's waistcoat pocket and affixed the chain to a buttonhole on Kody's waistcoat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aah, doesn't that look nice?\" the man said, \"Thank you so much! Have a nice day, young man.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" said Kody, and he left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody paused outside the shop and tugged the watch from his pocket. It was a huge thing and it was dazzingly golden. He put it back in his pocket... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Trolley-cars, horses, carts, carriages, bicycles, and the occasional motor-car, drove past him in the bustle and hurry of the morning. It really was a fascinating place. Kody was hungry. He realised he hadn't eaten anything yet, and wondered where he could get a bite to eat. But first he needed money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople in a hurry forget things. Especially when they don't expect to forget them, like leaving banknotes fluttering in the wind. Kody had no idea where the banknote came from, but it was being whipped through the air towards him. He grabbed it. Five dollars. Kody wondered whether or not this was enough to get something to eat. He headed into a likely cafe, filled with suited men and dressed women. He headed up to the counter and sat down, looking at the cakes, sandwiches and pies on offer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you, young man?\" asked a middle-aged bartender. <br>\r\n\"I just want something to eat,\" Kody said.<br>\r\n\"Yes I'm sure,\" the man said, \"Well, we have sandwiches here - cheese, ham, bacon...then there's some freshly baked pies, and over here is our selection of cakes and muffins,\" he said, pointing to various glass-fronted cases underneath the counter, or to pretty display-stands on the dark, marble countertop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I get for five dollars?\" Kody asked. <br>\r\n\"You want to spend THAT MUCH?\" the man asked, raising his eyebrows, \"You taking something home to mommy, huh kid?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh, no,\" Kody said. Inwardly, he cursed. He should've known that things used to be a lot cheaper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...\" Kody said, scratching his temple with a hand, \"I'll have...two...no...four...ham and cheese sandwiches and...two tuna sandwiches and...can I have some milk?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure kid,\" said the bartender, he counted up everything. \"Thaaaat's...seven cents\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody handed the five dollars over and the bartender ran it through the old, clanking cash-register and gave Kody the change. Then, the drink, and the sandwiches. Kody found a quiet table near the back of the cafe to eat. He took his time, counting the change and fiddling with the coins. Four dollars, ninety-three cents. Kody munched on one of his sandwiches while he rubbed a one-dollar banknote between his fingers. He laid it on the table. A sudden breeze caught the note and blew it up against the cruet-stand. Kody picked it up. Then he gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't one dollar. It was two dollars. Two, one-dollar notes. Kody looked at them. They were identical. Except for the serial-numbers. Kody rubbed one of the notes in his hands again and looked at it. A minute tear in one corner appeared. Kody tugged at it. Another banknote appeared in his hands. He kept rubbing. And another, and another! What was going on? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody pulled out his new watch and rubbed it. His hand grew heavier. He opened his cupped hands to see two watches. His eyes narrowed as he tried to make sense of what was going on. He seemed to have been given the power of duplicating things with his hands. Kody tried it on other stuff. He rubbed the sandwiches, they too, fell apart into duplicates of each other, each one just as tasty as the other. Kody grinned, this was getting fun...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Putting the seeing through walls incident out of his mind, Kody got dressed and left the house. When he got to his friend's, not far away considering it was next door, he was hardly thinking of the incident. Eddy invited him in with much joking and laughing between the two. Video games occupied little of their time that day for it was sunny and warm as a late spring day should be. So within an hour's time they grabbed their skateboards and were off to the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they skated there and talked about various things, Kody's head began to hurt. He tried to ignore it and focus on what Eddy was saying and their skating, but the pain soon became almost unbearable. So much in fact that he actually lost his footing and tumbled to the ground. As suddenly as it had began, it left and Kody looked around to see himself laying on the ground with his skateboard on the grass of someone's lawn just beside the sidewalk. \"Are you okay?\" Eddy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, what happened? I just had this mega headache, but it went away like, just after it came.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looked bad. you just sort of toppled over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I'm fine. Come on, I wanna see if you can grind those rails yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnthusiasm restored and the headache being put aside, the two boys were soon at the skatepark and performing their various tricks for the judgement and ridicule of each other. Being the slightly less skilled, Eddy always made extra sure he could rub in any mistakes his friend made, jokingly of course. Eddy's attempts at grinding were better, but he wasn't very good at ending them and that was when he would fall. On the actual park he wasstill trying to do something that involved being in the air, anything at all would be good if he could master it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when wierdness event number three happened for Kody. His friend seemed to be getting the hang of it. He was up in the air and then on the ground again. Then he was doing a number of random things in the air, not really tricks, but at least he was doing something. Then Eddy actually tried to do a trick and to Kody it was as if in slow-motion. There was his friend, in the air, trying to flip the skateboard while moving, but he ended up kicking it away by accident and it crashed to the ground across the park. He hung there in mid-air for a second and then he was falling, his arms flailing and it was a height enough that something would probably be broken. Kody kept thinking of trying to stop the fall if he could to prevent injury to his friend. Then, to his surprise, his friend stopped. Just for a couple seconds and inches from the ground his friend stopped and hovered before landing on the ground much more lightly then he would've done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody's head felt weird now. It was like something new had started working in his brain and he couldn't explain what. He saw his friend stop in mid-air before landing and Eddy came over and noted the event as well. \"That was so weird. I just stopped, did you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah. I think... I think I might've done that?\" Kody said carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, but I just wanted to stop you from falling and then you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What so... moving things with your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Kody said. He looked over at his friend's skateboard and thought about moving it in the air. It suddenly floated into the air and with another thought it moved towards them. His friend watched with awe and nervously looked around and saw that there wasn't anybody else nearby who would see. Kody set the skateboard down in front of Eddy and looked up nervously. The two exchanged looks and finally burst into laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cool!\" Eddy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it! Maybe I'm just like a superhero or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like Superman, only cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he sucks so much it's sad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody grinned. \"And I am sooo showing this off. Think about it, why is there any reason to hide it? I could be famous I bet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might get put under tests or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh, not a big deal. They're not allowed to be cruel. Let's go, I so have to talk to mom about this.\"</span></div></div>",

Well... Which game we should play?\" Kody said trying to hide his dizziness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddy and Kody talked a bit, then they chose one of their best videogames. Eddy turned on his videoconsole and sat on his bed next to Kody, who already picked up his gamepad. Both kids started playing, Kody tried to bear the cold that now was starting to feel on his feet and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody finally sneezed and, when he opened his eyes, he saw something strange. His legs were different!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ed... Eddy... take a l... look... at...\" he said scared pointing to his legs. His best friend looked at Kody's legs. He could not believe what he was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody's legs were not human anymore. His human skin was gone. Now his legs seemed to be made of ice. He tried to move them, and fortunately he was still able to move like any human. He quickly took off his shoes and socks and discovered that his feet were already made of ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude... You are getting frozen!\" Eddy said worried. \"What are we going to do!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't feel cold anymore, at least. In fact, I'm feeling very good now.\" Kody said. It was true, now Kody was feeling better than ever, and his freezing body wasn't worrying him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about!? We should call your mom!\" Eddy said and ran to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout knowing how, Kody pointed to the door and a strange ray came out from his finger. When the ray touched the door, it instantly froze! Eddy became amazed, he tried to open the door but it was stuck there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How... How did you do that!?\" Eddy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kody finished talking, he felt a strange tingling all throughtout his body. He looked down and noticed that the rest of his body was freezing too. The new ice-skin was taking over all his body slowly. Eddy stayed quiet while he looked how his best friend was becoming an ice-boy!<br>\r\nWhen the transformation was almost finished, Kody's hair disappeared going inside his body turning him into a bald boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I think it stopped...\" Kody said and started to look at his new body. He touched and rubbed his new frozen arms and legs. Every part of his body was now made by a crystal blue and white ice. He was even a bit transparent. Eddy could see his reflection on his best friend's bald head! Kody's eyes were totally plain, he had no pupils nor corneas, but he was still able to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kody. Can... Can you hear me?\" Eddy said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You totally rock, dude!\" he said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Kody wondered. His best friend didn't look scared anymore, now he was happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what happened to you. But it's obvious that if you froze the door with your hand, you're a superhero or something like that! You have superpowers! You have the power of ice!\" he said. But Kody didn't seem to like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you so serious?\" Eddy asked his best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a monster.\" Kody feel ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not! You always will be my best friend, no matter if you are an iceboy, a flameboy, a stoneboy or whatever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth talked for some minutes and finally Kody accepted his fate. After that, he started to practice his new superpowers. He was able to freeze anything he wanted shooting his ice ray from his fingers. He was even able to freeze the air, he could make ice roads on the air and skate at superspeed over them. Eddy loved to see his best friend so changed.<br>\r\nFinally, Kody decided to take off all his clothes except his briefs. Then he touched them and froze them. He seemed to be naked because he was not wearing any human clothes, but the ice-briefs now were part of his ice-body and they protected his dignity.<br>\r\nHe continued and discovered that now he was able to return back to his human form again! After some practising, he could switch between the human body and the ice body easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a thing that I still don't like...\" Kody said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Eddy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude... I'm bald!\" Kody said ashamed, but his best friend laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter playing for some hours, both kids decided to continue playing their videogame. Kody stayed on his ice form, because Eddy enjoyed seeing him like that. He knew that now his best friend was a superhero, and he felt protected being next to he ice-boy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... I should go back home. Mom must be there already.\" Kody said when he noticed that it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't ask me why, but I feel that I must tell the truth to mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck, bro. Please tell me as soon as possible how went the conversation with your mother.\" Eddy said and hugged his best friend. Kody controlled his temperature so he could hug Eddy without freezing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you later!\" Kody said. He took his clothes, made an ice bridge between Eddy's bedroom and his own bedroom, and walked over there. When he arrived to his window, he made disappear all the ice in the air. Eddy watched amazed everything from his window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. Let's go...\" Kody said.</span></div></div>",

What if she became scared? He knew that it could be shocking to see your son as an ice superboy. But he had no choice, his mother had to know the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he went downstairs, he decided to admire himself a bit more. He opened his wardrobe, that had a mirror at the back of the door and smiled. It was the first time that he saw his own ice-face, because at Eddy's bedroom there was not any mirror. He looked at his bald head. It was not so bad after all! looked at his new eyes. He had no pupils nor corneas. He even didn't know that he didn't have eyelids!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he started to some superhero poses! He smiled. \"I'm Frozen Boy, the superhero kid!\" he said laughing. He loved to see his new ice-body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while he was staring at himself, he started to feel the strange tingling all throughtout his body again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! I'm going to lose my powers now!? No, please!\" he thought as he felt dizzier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to open his eyes, and when he saw himself reflected on the mirror he stared astonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't the ice-boy anymore... Now he was made of fire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" he exclaimed even knowing that he was alone in his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll his skin was red-hot. All his body was giving off flames and smoke. There was no doubt: now he had the power of fire. He knew that he could shoot fireballs with his hands, burn anything he wanted, absorb any fire around him... He felt great! He smiled again. His eyes and mouth were now bright yellow. His briefs were not made of ice anymore. But fortunately they were red originally, so they disguised very well in his red-hot body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then he became serious again. He closed the wardrobe and went downstairs. He was a bit scared at first because he thought he could start a fire by simply walking on the floor, but then he noticed that his flames were not burning the parquet. Finally, he arrived to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom...\" he said scared, \"I must tell you something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Kody! You were upstairs? I thought you were at Eddy's home.\" she said before turning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom...\" Kody said when his mother already saw him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody's mother stayed amazed for some seconds then smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... You finally got your superpowers!\" she said looking at the flame boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? Did you already know this, mom!?\" Kody asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course...! We must talk, son.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she explained why Kody was suffering those changes. His father was an alien, and he even more superpowers than his own father. She didn't know when Kody was going to be able to use them, so she never told him anything about it. Kody felt sad at first, but then he understood that he was now the heir of his father and he had to use his superpowers to save the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some chatting, Kody's mother asked him about what happened that evening and if Eddy knew something about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry mom. But I suffered the transformation when I was on Eddy's home. I couldn't stop it.\" Kody said sadly. His mother then approached and gave him a hug. Kody became scared, he thought that his mother could burn herself. But she knew that there wasn't any danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, Kody! You must share your secret with your best friends, they must know the truth. But please, try to hide your superpowers to the rest of people, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay mom!\" Kody grinned. \"Well... Can I show myself as Frozenboy and Flameboy, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. But never reveal your real identity!\" she said. \"So... You got the power of ice and the power of fire... You must know that you will get more powers from now on, so be prepared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More powers? Cool! I can't wait to show them to Eddy and Alex!\" the burning boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go and show them your burning body now if you want. I must still finish your favourite dessert. But can you show me your ice form before that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Kody said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe switched to his ice form easily now that he knew that he could do that. Kody's mother stared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are bald like your father was when he was on his ice form.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind. In fact, I like being like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are so cute, my ice boy!\" she said rubbing his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww... Mom! I'm not a little boy anymore!\" he said laughing and switched again to his fire form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay mom. I'll come back on some minutes.\" he said and started walking to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way... Why are you walking? Do you know that you can FLY at superspeed while you are in your fire form?\" she said when he saw his kid walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" he said amazed. \"Cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody left a red blur in the kitchen and disappeared almost instantly.</span></div></div>",

At first he felt very ashamed when he played with Eddy and Alex, but quickly he loved to stay like that, he felt like a real superhero!<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Kody was not able to use his superpowers to save people yet.

Oh this was cool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mommy, look!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody stared down to see a little girl with her mother, looking at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He looks cute!\" she said. Kody grinned and jumped down. He scampered over to her. The girl bent down and petted him. Ooooh that felt good. Right behind the ears...Awww don't stop...scratchity-scratchity-scratchity...Kody scrambled up around her chest and shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe...Mommy, he's cuddly!\" she said.<br>\r\n\"Now be careful, sweetheart, he might be dirty. He could have rabies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody looked shocked. He was the most handsome, adorable squirrel ever! How could he have...RABIES!? He snuggled up against the girl, who hugged him. \"Awww, he's fuzzy...Can we keep him, mommy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a squirrel, dear, not a kitten. Let him go, now.\" <br>\r\n\"Bye Mr. Squirrel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody jumped down and onto the grass. He waved a left forepaw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, mommy, he waved!\"<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly, squirrels can't wave...\"<br>\r\n\"But he did! Really he did!\"<br>\r\n\"Come on, honey, or we'll be late.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody watched them go. Scarpering back to his clothes, Kody climbed into them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I was human...\" he said. Suddenly, he felt himself growing taller, slimmer. His clothes filled out. He looked at his hands and arms and legs. His fur disappeared...he was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey kid, coolin' off in the shade, huh?\" said a policeman, walking by. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, hot day, officer,\" Kody said back. <br>\r\n\"You better run on, we gotta look after this smashed car. Go on!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody got up and jogged home. He turned around at the end of the street and watched the policeman examining the crashed car which had caused his body to discover its new shape-shifting abilities. Oh this was going to be fun! </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Kody got home, he ran into his room and closed the door shut, locking it behind him.  \"I wonder what all I can do,\" he thought to himself.  \"Let's see, what would be a good thing to try...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind thought back to watching TV the other day where he saw a show that had a talking toilet.  He thought that was hilarious at the time, and he would love to try to duplicate that.  \"I wish I was a toilet!\" he said aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes, preparing for change.  After a few seconds of nothing, he opened them again, looking down.  His body was still the same old Kody.  \"Oh, well,\" he thought, \"I guess I'm limited to just animals and people.  What else should I try...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he thought, his eyes looked around the walls of his room, landing on a poster of a tiger leaping in midair.  He had always liked big cats; he found them majestic and powerful.  \"It would be cool to be one,\" he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he felt his lower back begin to forcibly bend over, as he instinctively got down standing on his hands and feet.  His hips shifted, until his legs were perpendicular to his spine, which lengthened a few feet.  He felt a weird feeling at the base of his spine.  He turned his head and saw that a new appendage was growing out; he quickly realized it was his tail   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody's thigh and upper arm muscles began to thicken, and his hands clamped together.  His skin suddenly started itching badly, and he tried to scratch it, but noticed that he was sprouting hair all over his body.  Within a few seconds, he had grown a nice full coat of orange, black, and white fur all over his body.  His hands--check that, paws--now had a smooth black pad where his palms were, and his fingernails and toenails had grown out and formed into sharp claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, his nose and mouth began to jut out and form into a muzzle.  Whiskers sprouted out, and his teeth elongated and were now much larger.  His ears shifted from the side to the top of his head, and stuck up and out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn thirty seconds, it was all over.  Kody looked down and saw that his shirt and pants were in tatters on the floor.  He quickly trotted to the other side of the room and looked at his full length mirror, and he liked what he saw.  He now was a beautiful tiger, the king of beasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter admiring his new body for a short while, he noticed that his boxers were still on, if barely.  It was a ridiculous sight; a majestic, noble creature like himself wearing a pair of underwear.  He put his large paws up against the top of the mirror and tried to balance on his two hind legs, but he didn't have a great handle of his new weight distribution.  He lost his balance and fell to the floor with a loud THUD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaken up a little, Kody quickly jumped back up to four feet.  He was about to try again when he heard footsteps in the hall.  \"Oh, no!\" he thought, \"Mom must be home!\"  He held his breath, hoping she would leave him alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo such luck.   The footsteps stopped in front of his door, and then Kody heard three loud knocks from it.  \"Kody?\" his mother's voice called out.  \"Are you alright?  I heard the sound of something falling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody opened his mouth to answer, but instead of words, a growl escaped his lips.  He quickly stopped; he had forgotten that as an animal, he couldn't speak.  He hoped against hope that his mom's stellar hearing somehow missed that noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth?\" his mom said.  \"Kody, are you playing video games?\"  After a few seconds, she knocked again, louder this time.  \"Kody, I'm coming in!\"  Kody heard the doorknob jiggling; he knew that his mom could open his bedroom door from being locked in about twenty seconds, using her hair pin.  He had to do something fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quietly wished aloud, \"I wish I was human again!\"  He felt his body beginning to change, but it wasn't going fast enough!  He didn't want his mom to see him like this; as supportive as she was, this probably would freak her out.  He had to buy some more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly turned towards his closet; luckily he had a walk-in and the door was already open.  As he hid behind some clothes, he felt the burning in his skin again as the fur was magically sucked back into his body and his legs begin to straighten.  His claws and his teeth recessed, and his face straightened out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bedroom door suddenly opened.  His mom walked in, looking around.  \"Kody, where are you?\" she asked.  She looked at every corner, finally spotting Kody's feet in the closet.  \"There you are!\" she said.  She walked over and slid the clothes that Kody was hiding behind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody looked at her, with a sheepish smile on his face.  \"Hi, Mom,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kody,\" she asked, \"what are you doing in your closet half-naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I had just taken a shower,\" Kody mumbled as he tried to make up an excuse, \"and I couldn't find anything to wear, so I was going through the clothes in the back here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKody's mother looked at him with a questioning gaze.  \"I heard a loud banging sound.  Did you fall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, I was looking for something on the top shelf, so I was standing on this box here,\" he said, pointing to a cardboard box in his closet, \"and I lost my balance and fell to the floor.  I'm alright, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" his mother said.  Kody looked at her eyes, knowing that she knew he was lying, but didn't have any way to prove it.  \"Well, just be more careful next time, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mom,\" Kody replied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mom walked out of the room, and Kody breathed a sigh of relief.  \u201cThat was a close one,\u201d he thought to himself.  \u201cBut it was cool!  I wonder what else I could do.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His stomach warned him of upcoming nausea and he swayed before tilting his head forward and started vomiting. Did the colors of that boring painting on the wall that his mother had bought dirty cheap seem brighter? No, it was just an after effect of the puddle of vile green vomit that contained chunks of the brownie he had eaten earlier bobbing in it. <br>\r\nWhen was mom coming home again? Oh right, she was working late at the police station tonight. Kody (still slightly trembling) went over to the home phone and dialed 890-768-3651, praying that his mother would answer. <br>\r\n\"Hello, this is Julia White at the Fishers Police Station. Who would you like to contact?\" <br>\r\n\"My mom...\" Kody's voice was scratchy and rough. <br>\r\n\"Name please.\" <br>\r\n\"Kody...\" <br>\r\n\"Well Kody, what is your mom's name?\" <br>\r\n\"Julie.\" <br>\r\n\"Last name please.\" <br>\r\n\"Uhh...\" Kody tried to remember, but something was blocking it all out. He slammed the phone onto its place on the charger and began to realize that the world was a big cloud of bright colors and only after did he realize that he couldn't concentrate did he flop onto the couch and close his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julie, will you please take the time to consider this?\" <br>\r\n\"No, I am tired of considering!\" Kody sat up from the coach realizing that both his mom and his dad were home and arguing. This did not surprise Kody in the very least and he trudged over to the place were his parents stood bickering like animals. <br>\r\n\"Peace!\" demanded Kody. All of a sudden there was a change, mom looked happy and dad seemed to relax. What had he done? <br>\r\n\"Uh, you guys can go back to arguing now!\" In the blink of an eye, Julie was raising her voice over her husband's and the argument started up again like it had never started. Neither parents looked at Kody how he glanced absentmindedly out the window thinking about what he had done with a glint of mischief in his eye.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I pushed against a wall but it didn't budge. Their had to be a easy way out, or else I would'nt be able to breath. I looked to the other side of this room and saw small holes, just big enough for my thumb, scattered about three feet apart. I peered in one and all I saw was darkness. My best guess would be that was where my air was coming from. I backed up and felt the cold bricks against my feet. I looked down to see I wasn't wearing shoes, or socks for that matter.

I expected less. A lot less. I felt a surge of energy fly through me and the bricks that were once stacked in front of me, were pushed away and hit the ground in the distance with a loud crash. The bricks fell to pieces and I found myself in a hallway that had many doors. It was not entirely like the room I was just trapped in. The floor was paved with bricks but these all seemed gray and old. I could see cracks running through most of them. The doors were wooden though and it appeared they had copper door knobs. I looked up to see the ceiling but just saw darkness. It must be extremely high. But than I realized something. I was in a box of bricks earlier with no light source and I could still see. I than pushed against the wall to see that I pushed and broke a brick wall. I looked around but still found no light source or any clue of to why I was here. Suddenly I saw a giant burst of green light in front of my eyes. Where was it coming from?<br>\r\n     I hurried down the rusted metal ladder and hit the ground with a thud. I ran and through myself against the rock wall in front of me and broke through it. I was now in the grass at night. A full moon was in the sky and I heard loud voices behind me. I tripped and hit the ground with a thud. The cold air wrapped around me. It sent chills through my bones. I felt something hit my back hard.<br>\r\n    The green light faded away. I was back in the hallway with the brick floor and endless high ceiling. What had just happened? I needed to keep moving on. But where did these strange abilities, or powers come from? Where would I go next?</span></div></div>",

TRY and set a RECORD for NEXT week and get NONE!\"<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am!\" Skander wheezed. He stuffed the ticket into his jeans and ran off to his locker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander slammed the locker door shut and shackled the battered padlock into place. He grabbed his books and charged into English class, a full twenty minutes late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very nice of you to join us, Mr. Jones, take a seat up the back,\" said his English teacher, lazily. \"Take out your copy of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee, and try and answer the questions on the sheet given to you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander collapsed into a chair at the back of the class...which promptly collapsed onto the floor, throwing him back against a bookcase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And Mr. Lawson, please would you take this to Mrs. Ashbury? It's a note telling her to send some maintenance men to this room to fix that broken chair...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessir,\" said a black boy about five and a half feet tall. He grabbed the note and left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW, MR. JONES,\" his English teacher said, \"Perhaps if you can find a CHAIR that won't COLLAPSE under you, we can get on with the lesson!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir,\" said Skander, \"Sorry sir.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander grabbed another chair and sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, what gives!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander stared at his friend.

I'm just going through hell right now, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJase rose his brows. \"How did you hear that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?

His eyes were on his book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Skander walked into Geometry, he felt even worse. His head was pounding so hard he thought he might scream at the pain of it. He could hear so many voices; the girl he sat with at lunch kept telling him over and over again what \"odi et amo\" in Latin meant for her quiz next period; the boy near him in the bathroom stall was screaming curse words as he wrote them with Sharpies on the walls. They were everywhere, and he couldn't take it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skander,\" Mrs. Woods said in her calm, sweet voice, \"are you all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe immediately nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't look well. Maybe you should see the nurse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he left. Just like that. But he didn't see the nurse, he decided to go home instead. He massaged his temples, walking down the hallway. Behind him, he could hear the faint murmur of a boy's voice. It was low and threatening: \"They won't know. They'll never know who it was. Oh, God, I can't wait...I can't wait this out, I can't. I have to do it, now! I have to blow up the school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander watched as the boy passed him, running down the hall. He was wearing a black hoodie that he pulled over his eyes. He looked furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander stood in horror...what was this boy going to do? How could he stop him?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Again and again he thought about the face of old Mr. Graham, who scolded him every time he messed up in class. He hated that office secretary: Miss Payne. Why did she always give him attitude? Why did they have to be so cruel?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander tried to forget the pain in his head. The whole day, he had tried to make himself believe this wasn't real. But he couldn't fight it anymore. He swallowed the fear inside him. \"I can read minds,\" he whispered. It was unbelievable, but he accepted it. Of all the things in his life that had affected him to this point, by far this was the greatest. He could hear if a cute girl thought about him, if he passed the class he thought he'd been failing in, if his parents were really in love and not putting on an act to ruin his life. It made people so much easier to trust...and he still could not believe how his \"friend\" had treated him. Was everyone like that? Friends in words but enemies in thoughts? Now he knew everything...and it was only the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP!\" Skander shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy skidded to a halt. \"Who are you and what the hell do you think you're doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I on to you. You think you're the only one who knows?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe furrowed his brow and waited for Skander to explain himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Skander didn't do that; he pounced on him. The boy tossed Skander from his shoulders, cursing. Skander came back, this time with a punch. It hit the boy's cheek and his face curled around the fist. Skander stared at his hand in shock. He'd almost broken the boy's cheek bone under the strength in that single hit. He stood still, wondering if this was a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting off the pain, the boy jumped the last step and ran for the gymnasium. No one had ever suspected this of him; why would they? He was only a baseball player. More like a bench-warmer, actually. They'd never guess that he'd keep this in his locker; he'd decide to kill everyone who had ever wronged him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept a close watch on the class in there. They were caught up in a good game of dodgeball. One girl threw her body to the right, picked up a bright pink ball and tossed it at an enemy. The ball hit her belly hard and she fell back, slamming her head against the floor. A whistle sounded. The coach sprinted onto the court. \"Sheila, go get the nurse!\" She cradled the girl's head. \"Cara, are you all right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe his luck. He slithered into the locker room and made his way to the bomb sitting secretly at the bottom of his locker.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Okay, this was it! He pulled open his locker door and smiled devilishly. He bent down, squeezed the scissors in his hand, and cut the little green wire. A clock started to count down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In just about three minutes, this whole place is gonna blow up,\" Skander heard. Immediately, he shook out the shock in his hand, and turned around. His feet pounded against the upstairs floor. His heart raced, he opened his mouth, and started to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Woods stood from her desk. \"What in the world is that noise?\" She walked towards the door, \"stay here,\" she told her students. But before she could open the door, Skander pushed it so hard it almost slammed into her forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET OUT!\" he shouted. The students panicked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is wrong with him?\" One girl asked her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET OUT, NOW! THERE'S A BOMB IN THE SCHOOL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone scurried from the room. They ran down the stairs and outside of the building, through the parking lot, until they reached the softball field. Other students from other classes followed them. A herd of cattle, they made their way outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy hurried from the locker room and ran into a frantic mob of people. He knew what was happening, but he didn't care. Not everyone could escape, not in this crowd. He had trouble finding a way out, but he made it. He ran to outdoor track, sat on the hot asphalt, and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET OUT! EVERYONE GET OUT! THERE'S A BOMB!\" One by one, the class doors opened and people ran to freedom and safety. When he was sure everyone had heard him, he hurried downstairs and outside. Then he noticed the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a football field away from the school, the students and faculty stood, waiting. They didn't know if it would reach them. The uncertainty was unbearable. They huddled like a huge football team. They were on the farthest part of the softball field, where the bases were about a hundred feet away from them. A fence enclosed them in. They were as close as they could come to the edge of the land--where it stopped and the ground fell around the huge trees--and almost hugging the holes of the metal fence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to know one thing,\" Skander said. He couldn't believe his bravery at this moment. This guy had tried to kill everyone, but he was saving them. Skander, of all people! He was the one they had ignored on a daily basis, but now he was their hero. \"Why would you want to murder innocent people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy stood. \"They're not innocent. They're evil. I'd laugh at seeing the face blown off of a fifteen year old girl. You're blocking the view. I can't wait to see this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're disgusting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy lifted his arm to punch him, but Skander grabbed a hold of him. He twisted the boy's arm back and listened to his high-pitched wail. \"Let me go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? So you can try to kill off another nine hundred people?\" He heard sirens in the distance. Someone had called the police.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy wriggled free when Skander tried to hear if the police were coming closer to them. He socked Skander in the eye, kicked him between the legs, and watched him writhe in pain on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Skander wasn't done. He grabbed the boy's foot before he could shove it into Skander's side. He flipped him over and the boy's face hit the pavement. Skander got up to dust himself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it happened. The noise almost knocked him down. Flames licked the sky and ashes sprinkled the ground. The school he'd known, the school his parents had attended, was dead. The boy quietly crept up behind him. He wrapped his spaghetti arms around Skander's neck. From his left pocket, he pulled out a gun. \"Look at it, ain't it beautiful?\" Skander tried to push the boy away. \"Not so brave now, are you, big shot? Do that again and I'll put a bullet in your head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not the way it was supposed to happen. Skander was a simple boy, possibly an alien with supernatural powers. No one was supposed to get killed. No one was supposed to be hurt. But with every hero there is a villain, and with every story there is an end. Skander was listening to the boy's uneven thoughts, and the sound of fire trucks and police cars and ambulances. He closed his eyes and prepared himself. But what he thought was his pounding heart was actually the hurried steps of a police officer. \"Put it down! Now! Put the gun down!\" The man drew his own gun and aimed it at the boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god,\" the boy thought. He dropped his gun and Skander let the officer rip him away from the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer put away his gun, wrestled the boy to the ground, and slapped handcuffs onto his wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up at Skander, standing like the small and weak boy he always were, but with a power so strong that if he wanted to, he could take a bullet and sustain his life. \"You did good, kid,\" the officer said. He pulled the boy to his feet and walked to the police car, dragging the villain away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander decided to go home and rest for a while. It was tiring being a superhero. He thought it was all over, but when he started to walk home, he discovered not only did he hear thoughts and have super strength. His hands rose to his face, but he did not see them. Oh, Skander thought, a little less scared of this one: he could become invisible too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In just one day, his whole life had been turned upside-down. <br>\r\nThis morning his only worry had been about being late to school and now...now had to deal with all those strange new abilities. Not to mention the fact that the whole school by now probably only consisted of smoking ruins and ash.<br>\r\nSkander was beyond glad that nobody had gotten hurt, even though he couldn't help but wonder if he could have prevented the boy from setting off the bomb in the first place. <br>\r\nHe should have talked to him first. He should have tried to find out what would cause someone to attempt to murder so many innocent people.<br>\r\nSkander shook his head and ran a hand through his hair. Getting all worked up would do no good.<br>\r\nLooking down to where his feet were supposed to be, he noted with rising panic that he was still invisible. His eyes widened and his breath grew faster as he realized that he had absolutely no idea how to control his powers.<br>\r\nHe couldn't imagine living with these voices in his head for his whole life and what if he accidentally injured someone with his super-strenght?<br>\r\nAnd he definitely couldn't stay invisible his whole life.<br>\r\nFirst things first. He needed to get home and tell his parents that he was okay. They were bound to be worried after what happened. He just needed to find a way to tell them that he was invisible without shocking them too much.<br>\r\nSkander hurried down the streets, trying hard to ignore the thoughts of the people passing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe unlocked the door as quietly as possible, hoping his parents wouldn't notice anything. A door opening by itself might not be the best way to greet them.<br>\r\nSkander put down his bag and hesitantly made his way into the living room.<br>\r\nHis parents were sitting huddled together on the couch, their eyes fixed intently on the TV. Just as Skander had expected, the news were filled with reports about the bomb. He was relieved to see that they didn't mention him. He had enough to deal with without the added pressure of appearing on TV.<br>\r\n\"God, I hope he's okay.\"<br>\r\nSkander looked at his mother, who had buried her face in her husband's neck and seemed to hold back her tears.<br>\r\nHis father was stroking her back soothingly in a circular pattern, while murmuring reassuring words in her ear.<br>\r\nSkander felt guilty for making them worry so much and wondered what he should do now. He couldn't just start talking, could he?<br>\r\nA voice from out of nowhere would surely freak them out. Maybe he should try to reverse his invisibility before doing anything else, even though he had no idea if it was going to work.</span></div></div>",

Quick as lightning you placed your other arm in there and using a lot of your might you helled its great jaws open, the bear enfurated, smashed into you, you lost your balace, and fell to the ground, fortunatly your arms went with you and were out of its mouth, before its mighty jaws seeled, the bear in all it fury jumped, but you had seen this coming, you just as it was landing, you using both legs, you kicked it backwards with all your might, and sent it flying through a bush, you got to your feet and ran through the hole you had created, the bear had also got its feet, it turned and limped off leaving you alone, looking round you saw the most beautiful sight, a abandoned barn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran in, it was in quite good shape, clearly someone had been living here at some point, there were two beds, several chests and boxes against the walls, on the far wall hung a sawn-off shot gun, a Hunters rifle, a Winchester Model 1897 and several diffirent knifes, and many other things including a mooses head mounted on the far wall, it was perfect, you brought your stuff in and started unpacking, this would be a good base till you had won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you finished you turned to the next task, if you were going to succed, then they couldn't know you were here, you had to change your apperance, first thing first your hair, you got out of your bag a pair of sissors and a mirror and started snipping, your mom used to be a hair dresser before she quit for a better job and she had taught you most of what she knew, in minutes your long black hair, was transformed into a shorter, cooler version, you hadn't finished yet thoug, you searched your bag till you found what you were looking for, you grabbed a bottel of water and poured the hair dye into it, you then covered your whole head, in minutes your black hair was changed to dark brown. Next your eyes, you searched your bag again till you came to the lenses, you carefuly inplanted them on your eyes, the made your green eyes blue, looking at your self, you were surprised at how different you looked all ready, you contiued with this process for half an hour, till you were sure it would be almost impossible to tell that you were the same person, as final thing you stood up straight, you liked to boast that you were six foot tall, when you were really only five foot ten, to stop any one noticing, you bended over at lot and rarely stood up straight, it was a bit unconfatable but it worked, you were sure that even your own mother wouldn't recognise you know, exhausted you collapsed onto the bed and in minutes you were asleep.</span></div></div>",

Your different from most humans, don't get me wrong were still humans, we just have, well talents\", you stared at it in shock. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nSuddenly, giving a great pull, the thing broke free of your grip and shot up into the air, you gasped and looked at it, smiling it muttered \"Suppose, I might as well set your mind at rest.\", you and Jason, stood there amazed, \"well want to here are tale?\", you stared at it, you didn't know if you could trust this thing, but you were all ears now. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe thing began \"It all started during world war two, in 1942, Hitler highered several of his best scientists to started work on researching mutants and mutations, in response the Americans and British started similar projects however due to the lack of knowledge in genes and DNA, they didn't get far, and after coming up with no results of any use, all the projects were closed down, the cornetists left there organisation and some how wound up together, they formed a group and continued researching in this field, but they didn't have any breakthroughs for another twenty six years.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"In 1968, they finally, after years of work, found the way of creating mutants and how to increase beings, then in 1972 they tired of working on only laboratory animals, started secretly experimenting on people, they took people from all other the world and tried to infuse them with strange attributes, but all of which were filers, or so they thought.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You see, when there test subjects had children, it was discovered that they carried the genes, some started intently others took years to produce, any way the fact of the matter is that's how we all started, not all of us are as interesting as you or I, most are either just people with slight differences, like people with extra fingers, or are just ordinary humans who are exceptionally gifted in some sport or subject, to be blunt, most are just artificial makings of things that occur naturally.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"However\" it paused for breath smiling still \"Every so often you gain on of use, there three classes, Ls, Ns and Ms, the Ls are basically normal humans who have one unusual ability, normally not something powerful, Ms are beings like me, creatures that posses more and usually more powerful powers, however we are also always severely mutated and unlike the rest of them can't fit in with normal humans, and finally there Ns, which are basically Ms only they lack the serve mutations, most only have minor or no mutations\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"The powers you have are measured in classes, from one to thirty, the majority don't go above ten, in fact less than one percent go above ten,\" you stopped him, \"what do these classes mean?\" He gave a odd chuckle and replayed \"they mean the level of powers you gain, they basically go something like this\" he then handed you a rolled up piece of paper, you unrolled it and found it was a information sheet, it read: <br>\r\n <br>\r\n1-3: Basic physical powers, (Superhuman strength, speed, endurance, agility ect) <br>\r\n4-6: More advanced physical powers (Contortion, elastication, invisibility, higher levels of the previous level ect) <br>\r\n7-10: Mixture of advanced physically powers and low level mental ones (Telepathy, energy blasts [see note at the bottom], limited clairvoyance, astral projection ect) <br>\r\n11-15: Much higher mental powers (mind control, emotion control, telekinesis (Only on level fifteen and above) <br>\r\n16-20: Mixture of advanced phial powers and advanced mental powers <br>\r\n21-25: Great control over certain things (The wind, dirt, clay, germs ect) <br>\r\n26-29: Control over the elements them selves (earth air, fire, water, energy, plants, weather, animals, dreams, form, life, fantasy, darkness, time, ect) [can only be one being for each element at a time] <br>\r\n30: Near unlimited power (Note there is only one creature who is a level thirty and there can't be another) <br>\r\n[Note: colour of energy blasts determine the level, yellow is 7 (normally), green is 8, blue is 9-14 (normally), pink is 15-21, dark red is 22-27 and bright red is 28-30] <br>\r\n[as to insert occasionally lower levels have energy blasts on the level of higher levels] <br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou turned towards him, he however had not finished, \"sadly there is more...\" he said</span></div></div>",

He still had your parents, though, that was the important thing, you need to get them back, but before you could do that, then you needed to find Necros, and you only knew one person who knew his location, The Captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning while Jason made the breakfast, you talked about what you were going to do, after a long discussion, you agreed that the most important thing was to find this captain, but neither of you knew who the captain was, so after breakfast, you walked into the village and started making enquirers, after a fruitless search, you were just turning to go back to the barn, when you noticed, down the street an old army club, you turned to Jason and the two of you agreed that, maybe they would know something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked in, the place was full of men, somewhere playing cards, somewhere drinking, on man was playing the piano according to the banner on the wall, it was dedicated to the 42 infantry division, you walked up to the bar tender, he looked at you with an odd look on his face, \"What do you want kid\", you turned to face him, \"I'm looking for someone who was possibly a member\" you said, \"Alright\" he said \"Who may that be?\", \"The captain\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in an instant the room fell silent, everyone looked up towards you, men dropped the cards and drinks, everything halted, the Bar tender was about to speak when, another man cut in \"Sorry, kid there aren't anyone in this club who held a captains rank, well Lieutenant Jameson did for three days, before being depremoted\", you looked at him in disbelief, \"Are you sure\", you asked, \"Positive\" said the man, \"But\" you started, but the man cut you off, \"Listen kid, there was never anyone who held a captains rank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, who is that?\" asked Jason, he had somehow found his way other to the far wall, and on it was a picture dated 1989, on it he was pointing to a man in his twenties, with two bars on each shoulder. You turned to him \"well?\", in an instant another man grabbed you from behind, the first man, rose his fist and swung for you, quickly you pulled forwards and broke the second man\u2019s grip, the first man\u2019s fist collided withe second man sending him sprawling, you then turned and clobbered the first man in the chest, then the head, knocking him out cold, a third man jumped up and grabbed a rifle hanging above the fire place, it wasn't loaded, but it had a bayonet on the end, quickly he turned an charged at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting up a table next to you, you smashed it down on the man\u2019s weapon and with a swing of your fist, knocked him out cold, you tuned and said \"I guess we're not wanted here, come one Jay\", the two of you turned to leave, when the bar keeper, carefully through a piece of paper at your feet, you picked it up, then left, after unravelling it you found it said, \"Captain John Kingsly, 1934 west wood, on the edge of town\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to Jason and said \"Well we have are address, let\u2019s get going\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Quickly managed to grab hold of the window ledge, then you effotlessly managed to pull your self in and exited the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked over to the stairs, and slowly crept down them, quickly you edged your way to the door, looking inside, the man was still sitting their, his eyes still fixed apon his book, you slowly closed the door, then ran into it, the door went flying off its hinges, the man jumped to his feet, he darted for a revolver on his desk, but you were quicker than he was, grabbing him, you lifted him, by his neck, he strugled but, you were stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright talk\" you said, \"were is necros\", the man stared at you for a momment, before replying \"I don't know, which are you?\", it was your turn to stare in confusion, \"Which are you?\" you reapeted his question, making it clear you didn't know what he was talking about, he sighed and to explain replyed \"The organisation or the Count? or is there a new one that they haven't told me about yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Third option\" you said, he sighed and then said \"okay what do you want?\", \"Where is Necros?\" you repeated, \"As I said before, I don't know, all I know is he is trouble\" he replied, you stared at him in confusion for the second time, \"But you work for him, don't you\", he again looked at you in confusion \"What in this universe would give you that idea, I would work for that, repulsive, overgrown pile of slime, if he was the only boss in the history of existance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then who do you work for?\", \"No one\" he shoughted, \"I don't work for anyone, I just happen to know what's what\", \"And that is?\" you asked, he sighed, \"That there are beings out there, that are different\", you look at him still confused, \"So if you don't work for them, why did you think I did?\" you asked, \"A lot of both sides members come to see me, I'm the one who can tell them if they are in danger, don't ask me how, I never squeel on my conections.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly he was going to be no help to you in your quest to find Necros, you put him down, you were about to go, when something occured to you, the count? Hadn't that winged monster said something about warning you about some count, what was his name again Montis? Monstrus?  Mortalicus? Yes that was it, but could be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned back to him, \"Which Count?\" you asked, he stared for a fourth time in confusion, \"What?\" he asked finally, \"You said somethiong about a Count, what Count\" you said, \"Dracula\" he said in a mocking tone, \"Which count do you thing Mortalicus\", it was, \"Who is Mortalicus\" you asked, he stared at yet again in confusion, \"What kind of person are you, everyone has heard of Mortalicus, the leader of the Excentrics, one of the most powerful and dangerous Ms alive, perhaphs second only to that infernal slime ball Necros, still if I must explain\" he cleared his throught, you were about to interupt, but he then said \"And I guess you don't know about the Ecentrics ether\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The eccentrics are a sort of group of assasins, they opperate, killing those who are troubleson, to others, in there own uneque way, there mercenaries though, they get paid for there services, they work sort of like, behind the scenes conqures, making dessitions that will help them in the end, there are only ten members of there group at one time mind you, and they are led by The Great Count Archibal Douglas Henry Agustas Julius Wolfgang Issac Von Edward Heinz Van Mortalicus, or as I and every one else in this world like to call him The Count, still that he is no worry to you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at him surprised, \"why not?\" you asked, \"Because\" he replied \"You won't live long enought, to meet him\" and with that he pulled a gun out from behind his back, he smiled looking at you, \"Sorry matty, I'm the captain, and rule number on, you don't threaten the captain, and live\", you gulped, if you moved then he would shoot, you could only think of one idea that might save you, but you would need a mircule, for it to work, and sadly there was little chance of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled and then said \"see you in the underworld\", suddenly the glass window smashed, as a bick went right through, the captain turned, you were to far away to get to him withought him fireing, and there was no cover around, that left you one option, and you sure hoped it work, quickly you started consentrating, and luckly it started working, the captain turned round just in time to see the last of you disapear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly he started fireing, you doged and jumped, you managed to grab him, he felt your invisible arms grabbing him, quickly you through him, he smashed right through the wall and into a room full of keroseen, he landed and the full spilt, just as the gun went off, in a second he was dead, the explosion was quick and to small to hurt you, the house burst into flames, quickly you turned to run, only to find your self exhaugsted, you tried to run, only to colapse, your vissible returned, to tired to move, you layed there as the flames ingulfed the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Jason jumped through the window, running over he helped yu to your feet, half lifting half dragging he managed to pull you out, and together you started the long walk back, you lloked at Jason and smiled, to think only a few days ago you were argueing over some stupid matter of lateness, now he had saved your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventuall made it back, \"So\" said Jason, \"the Captain didn't help us, we don't know anything more than we did before we met\", you had recovered by this point, and said \"Yes we did jason\", he turned towards you \"What's that?\", \"well I learned that being invisible quickly tires me out and about the cont\", Jason nodded, \"Any way thanks for saving me, twice\" you said, Jay nodded, and you both got into your beds and were soon asleep.</span></div></div>",

Quickly you turned and ran back to the barn, you were just starting to get up, \"Morning Jay\" you said, \"What time is it?\", you then noticed that he was panting for breath, he dropped the wood and cloapsed into a chair, \"What's the matter, bump into that bear again?\", once Jason got his breath back, he told what he had seen, as soon as you were dressed and had had a quick breakfast, the two of you made your way down to carnavel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you walked through the gates, the air was full of music, people laughting, things working, people talking, but appart from the two of you, not a sole could be seen, slowly you walked around, it looked like a real carnavel, with rides, stalls and exibits, but appart from you two not a single living sole was in sight, listening you heard the noise geting lounder, the two of you followed it till you came to a stage, and in the coner was a old record player, you walked over, turned it off and pulled the record out, it read Carnival sounds, you crushed it between your fingures, when the show started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the stage lit up and a loud voice shoughted \"Ladies and Gental men, Children of all ages, know the moment you have been waiting for\" and suddenly figures started emurging from the door, Two men came out, one was dressed like cowboy in the movies, with a cowboy hat, a bandana, two revolvers hanging on his belt, the other was dressed in a blue pantilumes, a third figure appeared, but it stayed to the shadows, then voice started again, \"Come, Come, see sights that have amazed man from the dawn of time, and for all you willing people out there I present this\" there was a puff of smoke and a crown appeared in middle of the stage, \"The crown of emporers diloris of boer, lost for two hundred years, rediscoved only six months ago, and to be given to who ever wins a small challange, come come are there no one willing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided that if you wanted to get ahead, then you needed to play along, bravely you stepped up, \"Good Good, we have a challanger, dear sir, to win this unique treasure you must accomplish one small task.\" in a small explosion a hyuge man appeared before you, \"Defeat the Mighty Titan\", and with that the man chargaged at you, he hit you with the force of a stampiding rhino, you were knocked back, he then rammed into you again with his shoulder, then lifting you through you into the floor, he turned round to cheer himself, assuming he had knocked you unconsios, you however had got a lot toughter over the last few days, you jumped to your feet, you tapped him on the shoulder, \"Oy fatty\", he turned round and you clobbered him right in the face, he was knocked back, before he could recover, you gave him a left hook in the stomic, while still dazed you gave him a final knockout punch the head and sent him flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly he to was very tough, he lept to his feet and moving with remarkable speed for a man his size, he rejoined the fight, the two of you put hands on hands and using for full strengh pushed back, but this did not work, the two of you were gridlocked, you were as strong as each other, quickly you started thinking, if you couldn't push him, maybe you could pull him, then it hit you. Quick as lightning you grabbed hold of Tiatan and pulled him folward, quickly you got under him, and lifted him into the air, and then hulled him, he landed off the stage out of eyesight, the figure in the shadows pointed, the guy dressed as cowboy jumped down, and a shot rang through the air, the two of you turned to run, but it was to late, in a second you were gone.</span></div></div>",

Holding on with only one hand he dangled there, he tried to put his feet on something, but the slopes were as completely even, not a single leg holder, he tried to grab another brick with his left hand, but it to just fell down, he was couldn't climb up and if he fell it would kill him, he was trapped, and he couldn't hold for much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou needed a plan, and fast, looking you notice the chain that had held him was still on the floor, grabbing on of the veins you tied them together and thought up the chain, he cult it, \"Jason\" you shouted \"Attach the chain to your leg\", he \"What?\" he screamed, \"Just do it\" you shoulghted back, with his free hand he attached the chain, grabbing a lose boulder you tied the vine and rock together, you crossed you fingers and hulled the rock into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbelievably, it went right through the wooden cover and pulled his leg up with it, he was hurdled on the solid stone floor, he looked down smiling \"I knew running away with you wasn't crazy, you know what you\u2019re doing\" he called, you didn't hear him though, \"that actually worked?\" you said, carefully he grabbed a rope and passed it down, in seconds you were out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked over to the door, only for voices to meet you, clearly the count was as smart as he looked, he had posted guards outside, you went to the other doors, only to discover that they were only painted on the wall, one way out, you had to overpower them, but who are the guards?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

as tough as the count said, he would be a bit of a problem, but DeadShot was your main worry, you had seen him, if you burst in to that room, he would shoot the both of you before that caveman had time to look up, there was only one possibility, it was risky but it might work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully waited till the two had stopped, then picking up a piece of fractured wood, placed it on the floor and kicked it, it made a great clunking sound, and it was clear the two must have heard it, then you waited, then you heard the sound of a revolver arming, and saw the door handle turn, this was your chance, you turned and charged straight into the door, it went flying of its hinges and sent its opener flying into the wall, his pistols hurtled across the room, he lay there clearly out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you ran in to face your next opponent, suddenly twenty men ran into the room, Smiling Crono said in a way that was clearly strained \"Me have help\", You turned towards Jason \"get behind me\", Jason smiled and said \"Don't worry I can take clear of myself\", several of the men had rifles, you need a plan, quickly your eyes darted round the room, then an idea hit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrono smiled \"Me think your doomed\", Matt smiled at him and said \"Me think you can't shoot what isn't here\", you then jumped grabbed hold of Jason and started to vanish, the men were fixed in a state of confusion, then began mad firing, the two of you hit the ground, still holding on to Jason, your charged at one of the pillars, remembering your second fight,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pillar buckled and fell, and part of the roof gave way all but six of the twenty went hit by it, smiling the two of you reappeared, and the fight began, you grabbed hold of two of them and smashed them into the floor, Jason kicked the gun out of one of them hands, dodged his blow, clobbered him in the gut and smashed him to the floor, then with a flying kick sent another on to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final two grabbed the rifles, you ripped a plank out of the floor and smashed it round their heads they collapsed, turning you shook hands with Jason, suddenly the floor shock, and you found Cronomagnus standing in front of you, he looked a lot scarier up close, gulping you said \"You\u2019re the smart one?\", he shook his head, \"No me the tough one\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly you swung at him, only to be met with pain, his skin was like a brick wall, only unlike a brick wall, it didn't collapse when you punched it, you tried again, only to be met by the same results, then again this time in the face, his head moved backwards slightly, but apart from that he didn't react, you gulped, looking at him smiling, he grabbed you and with on arm tossed you like a football.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went hurtling across the room, you smashed through the wall, groaning you got to your feet, you saw Crono had grabbed Jason, he had that look in his eye, the kind that a six year old has, before it crushes an ant, \"No\" you screamed, you charged across the room, and smashed into him, this time he reacted, he was sent sprawling, Jason landed \"Get out of here\" you shouted, he ran off, Crono jumped to his feet, \"Bring it on Flintstone\" you shouted, the two of you charged,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crashed into each other, Crono was startled, but you felt like you had been hit by a truck, he swung at you, you dodged, swinging your legs, you managed to knock him over, he however grabbed you and pulled you to the floor, you dug you hand through the floor board, pulling it out, you smashed it over his head, only for the board to turn to splinters,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you wrestled there, you needed a plan, Crono was stronger and tougher than you, then it hit you, you dug your hands into the floor boards, and heaving with all you might, pulled them up from under Crono, he was sent flying into the air, then fell back, he went right through the hole, looking down, you saw him lying on the cement, dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned round smiling, he was defeated, you turned and started to walk away, unaware of a big blob of muscle rising out of the hole, \"Jason\" you called, not noticing the thing silently Climbing out, \"Jason you can come out now, I gave him quite a licking\", the thing silently followed you, its arms up high, ready to make the killing strike at any second,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason\" you called again \"It\u2019s over, come on out and lets go, I'm sick of this place\" you called, the thing got closer and closer, you were still completely unaware it was behind you, its arms up ready, poised in the position for a kill, it lifted its arms a little higher ready for the killing swipe, then suddenly a large pile of bricks fell from the sky, it smashed down on him and knocked him out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned round shocked, you looked up, and saw Jason standing on the rafters, his pen knife in on hand and the sawn rope in the other, He smiled, \"Don't worry mate, that\u2019s why I'm here\" he said, he jumped down, and landing with the grave of an acrobat, bent down towards Crono unconscious body and said \"Don't worry about the pain take to aspirin and your be fine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you turned to go, when suddenly you noticed something, DeadShots body was

It was completely dark in his room apart from the lamp on his desk, which cast a slightly yellow hue over everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting story.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Skander said. He kept writing. <br>\r\n\"You know that 'San Franksico' doesn't have a 'K' in it, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh...\" Skander said, and crossed out the bay city and re-wrote it correctly. \"Thank...wait a minute! Who said that!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his pen down and turned around in his chair. There was no-one there. Then he heard someone whistling. He looked up to see someone sitting top of his bookcase! The figure jumped off and floated down towards the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...woah!\" Skander spluttered, \"Who are you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost floated towards him, \"I'm Master Adrian. Master Adrian Jeremiah Stone. And you, Skander Kenneth Jones, have about as much a command of the English language as a Chinaman.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Skander said. <br>\r\n\"I'm a ghost,\" said the boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander stared at Master Adrian. He looked a little older than Skander, and was about the same height. He wore a sharp, black three-piece suit and a black fedora hat. A glistening gold double-albert watch-chain stretched from one pocket of his waistcoat through the central buttonhole to the other pocket. His shoes were shiny black leather. He looked like a perfectly dressed young man. Except that everything was slightly transparent and dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been watching you ever since you first moved into my house,\" said the ghost, pacing, \"I think I like you.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm talking to a GHOST?\" Skander asked.<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not?\" the ghost replied, \"What's the matter? Ain't all jazzed up about talkin' to a spiiirrriiit?\" he asked. <br>\r\n\"I...I never knew I could talk to ghosts,\" said Skander. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaster Adrian shrugged, \"Yeah, whatever. Well you are now, Skandy-boy.\" the ghost laughed. \"What's the matter? You look like you seen a ghost...oh wait! YOU HAVE!\" and he laughed at his own joke. \"Relax, kid, I'm not here to hurt you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well that's a relief...ah...nice to meet you...uh...Master Adrian.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh scrap the formalities...\" Adrian said, \"Just call me Adrian.\"<br>\r\n\"O-okay,\" said Skander. \"So um...when did you die?\" <br>\r\n\"Fourth of January, 1919. In the middle of an epidemic of Spanish Influenza,\" the boy said. \"Thats...what? 90 years ago now? Wow. Yep, I've been dead a loooong time. And this was my house. And this was my room. But I still think it's my house and I still think this is my room. I'm never gonna leave this place because I don't want to. Now that you can see me and talk to me, let's get that one thing straight. I'm here to stay whether you like it or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey buddy,\" said Skander, \"I...I don't want any trouble...\" <br>\r\n\"Good,\" said Adrian, \"I don't want to give any.\" <br>\r\n\"We...w-want to be friends?\" Skander asked. Truth to be told, having a ghost for a friend was a pretty cool idea. <br>\r\n\"Sure,\" said the ghost. \"Nice to meet you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander watched Adrian pull out a semi-transparent gold pocket watch from his waistcoat. He checked the time on it and then pocketed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That looks like a pretty expensive watch...\" Skander said. <br>\r\n\"It was my father's,\" Adrian replied, \"He gave it to me when I got the Influenza. I had wanted it my entire life. Well, now I can keep it my entire AFTERlife!\" he chuckled. He pulled ghostly silver case from his coat and opened it. He pulled out a cigarette and put it between his lips. He lit the cigarette with a match from a pocket match-safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that supposed to be bad for your health?\" Skander asked.<br>\r\n\"I've been dead ninety years,\" Adrian said, \"What health?\" <br>\r\n\"Right,\" Skander nodded. </span></div></div>",

We'd get our asses caned so bad we'd be standing up for a whole week! Now move it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the wake-up call, Adrian...\" Skander said. He started changing, tugging on a T-shirt, a jacket and jeans, socks and sneakers. He packed his bag and headed into the kitchen. Plenty of time. Perhaps having a ghost in the house was gonna be a good thing. Skander sat down at the breakfast table where his mother put a plate of bacon and eggs in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh that does look good,\" said Adrian, \"I haven't had bacon and eggs in ninety years...Enjoy!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, stop bothering me!\" Skander said, \"I want to eat!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, did you say something honey?\" Mrs. Jones asked, who was preparing her own breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, n-nothing mah!\" Skander said. \"Just um...\"<br>\r\n\"Oh Adrian!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander looked up. <i>What?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian was floating above the stove, watching the eggs and bacon frying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can talk to ghosts too?\" Skander asked.<br>\r\n\"Oh sure,\" said Mrs. Jones, \"I wondered how I was going to introduce Adrian to you, but I think you two already met. I think there's a clairvoyant or psychic streak in our family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...what?\" Skander asked. <br>\r\n\"We can speak to the dead,\" said Mrs. Jones, sitting down.<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Adrian shouted.<br>\r\n\"Sorry dear,\" Mrs. Jones added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, Skander and Adrian walked to school, the ghost floating along beside Skander. He was early enough today that he could walk to school instead of taking the bus. They headed into class and sat down at one of the desks at the back. Jason wasn't there yet. It was double history. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay boys, take out your books,\" said Mr. Anderson, walking in, \"We're continuing our lesson on World War One, known before 1945 as the Great War. This was the first modern war...Mr. Lancet, you're late.\" <br>\r\n\"Sorry sir,\" said Jason. He headed down the back and sat next to Skander and pulled out his books. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...with aircraft, tanks and chemical warfare...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you feel something?\" Jason asked. <br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Skander replied, \"What?\"<br>\r\n\"I feel cold...\" <br>\r\n\"Oh...No, I'm fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tried to write down his notes. Skander watched him. Then he saw the zip on Jason's pencil-case open of its own accord. A biro floated out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adrian!\" Skander whispered, \"What are you doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biro continued to float in mid-air, rotating slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never got these newfangled...ball-point pens...\" Adrian whispered, \"They're so hard to use...I prefer fountain pens...\" He put the pen down on Jason's desk and picked up a calculator. \"In my day we used BRAINS...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it! Someone'll see you...\" Skander whispered. <br>\r\n\"Who's your friend?\" Adrian asked. <br>\r\n\"Jason...\"<br>\r\n\"Cool, I'm gonna meet him.\" <br>\r\n\"Don't!...\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm a ghost and you're a mortal, you can't touch me, skin-tube.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biro lifted off the desk and started writing on a blank page in Jason's notebook. The writing was loopy and old-fashioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Jason.\" it read. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Skand...\" Jason said, \"I didn't know you wrote this neat...\"<br>\r\n\"It's not me...\" Skander whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...My name is Adrian...\" the pen wrote. Then Jason stared at it. \"What the!?\" he spluttered. <br>\r\n\"Don't be afraid...Skander knows me very well. I just want to meet you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked at Skander, whose two hands were on his own desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way...what...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm a ghost...Boo!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander had to grin at this. The pen dropped flat on the desk and didn't move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way...\" Jason whispered. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander nodded. \"Let's just say we bumped into each other at home...\" </span></div></div>",

Clenching his teeth, the ghost blew, hard! The sudden gust of wind blew the fire on the bench out. He looked quickly at Skander, who was looking at Jason, who was also looking at Skander. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the HELL was that!?\" Jason shouted.<br>\r\n\"I told you he wasn't normal,\" said Adrian, \"See?\" <br>\r\n\"I...I don't know...\" Skander spluttered, \"I just got so angry and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your eyes turned red\", Adrian added.<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Jason asked.<br>\r\n\"I saw it...\" said Adrian, suddenly, \"Out of the corner of my eye...A red glint...I think you have heat-rays or something in your eyes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" Skander shouted, \"That's impossible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian swirled over to where Skander was standing.

Suddenly, his eyes turned blood red! A red laser-light shot out of them, striking the hovering piece of paper, setting it on fire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, cool!\" Jason said. Adrian let the ball of charred paper fall to the ground. \"It is something...rather extraordinary,\" he said. He tugged his pocket watch from his waistcoat, \"We still have...\" he looked at the dial, \"Forty minutes...until the end of lunch,\" he put his watch back into his waistcoat pocket, \"Why don't we see what else our friend can do, hmm Jason?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-why not?\" Jason said, stammering from amazement. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Turning back towards the school-buildings, the boys headed off to find an empty classroom. Adrian walked next to Skander and Jason next to Adrian. Adrian was completely solid now, or he appeared completely solid, at least. Anybody looking at him would think he was just another guy. Except that he was wearing a suit that hadn't been seen in shopfront windows in about a hundred years. If anyone actually bothered looking really close, they would've noticed that Adrian was not even walking on the GROUND. He actually hovered up above it about an inch or two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander reached a classroom and peered in through the small window. It was deserted, and in a quiet part of the school. He tried the handle. It was locked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!\" Adrian said, \"Locked doors...Leave this to me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs casually as if he was stepping into a shower to wash himself up, the ghost-teen stepped through the door. There was a moment's silence, and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lock turned and the door opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in, gentlemen,\" he said. <br>\r\n\"Neat!\" said Jason, staring at Adrian with a new respect. Adrian slammed the door shut behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's see what else you can do, Skander,\" said Adrian, hovering in mid-air near the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling stupid, Skander ran, jogged, jumped, waved his arms, blinked, coughed, blew...so far, the only thing he could do was shoot fire-lasers from his eyes and set things on fire. He sat, dejected, on a chair at the back of the room, thinking. He flicked his hands, rapidly clenching and unclenching his fingers in quick, snappish movements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I have to be able to do SOMETHING!\" he said. He threw out his right hand and extended his fingers, as  if he was releasing an imaginary yo-yo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething very bright and a mix between white and sky-blue, shot out of his hands! It hit a desk and blew it to pieces, the force of the blast sending two chairs flying across the room! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think...we found a new power,\" said Adrian, recovering from the shock and hovering back down towards earth. <br>\r\n\"What was that!?\" he asked. <br>\r\n\"I...I think...No! It can't be...that stuff isn't real...\"<br>\r\n\"What's he talking about?\" Adrian asked, looking at Jason.<br>\r\n\"No idea,\" Jason said.<br>\r\n\"Pulse beams!\" Skander said, \"I can shoot balls of energy out of my hands...or electricity or...something!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" Adrian said. He hovered over to the rubbish-bin in the corner and fished through it. He pulled out a torn maths-book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FIRE!\" he shouted. He threw it into the air. Skander extended his arms and fingers in the same, quick, snappish motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo balls of bright light shot through the air, hitting the book squarely in the cover, blasting it apart! Pages fluttered to the ground. Jason went to pick them up, the pages were torn to pieces, but also slightly singed, as if something very hot had hit them and then disappeared again very quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is COOL!\" he said. </span></div></div>",

There were a lot of tall trees, and since it had rained a lot recently, lots of branches had fallen on the ground as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Skander stopped in his tracks and was overcome by a serious stiffness in every muscle in his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man\u2026 I feel so stiff right now\u2026\u201d he said, as every muscle tensed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! What\u2019s happening to him?\u201d Jason wondered, as he noted something weird about Skander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander appeared to be getting\u2026 bigger? His chest started to push out, and his sweater was suddenly fitting very tight. His arms became thicker, as his biceps inflated dramatically. His torso widened at the shoulders, to the point where he began to resemble a teen bodybuilder. Skander looked like he was about to burst out of his clothes, but the growth stopped short of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhhh\u2026\u201d he groaned, as he flexed his arms. \u201cOoooh God\u2026 I-I\u2019m getting stronger or something\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the chicks are gonna notice for sure!\u201d Adrian grinned, as he folded his arms and just stared at Skander while he was having his growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, his legs thickened and widened at the same time, filling out his jeans. His calves inflated, making his jeans fit super-tight around his new, bulging muscles!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026 I need to buy bigger clothes!\u201d Skander groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! Look at him! He just grew all that muscle in a matter of seconds!\u201d Jason exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander then walked over to pick up a huge, 10-inch-thick tree branch, which was laying on the ground. He easily lifted it up, and then he rested it on his thigh before snapping the thick branch in half like it was a toothpick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat Scot! You\u2019re strong!\u201d Adrian shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I guess I discovered super strength\u2026\u201d Skander grinned, as he tossed the huge branch on the floor like it was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys then started walking back to class, since they were almost out of time.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He staggered to his feet. \"Adrian!\" he shouted, \"Adrian what's happening!? I...I can't see!\" Skander struggled two steps, and collapsed backwards onto the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhunk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In here, doctor! In here!\" a man shouted. <br>\r\n\"Honestly Mr. Stone, I don't think this is wise, he is badly infected!\"<br>\r\n\"I don't care, I want him here, at home. Here. Here where I can see him, where we can...we can keep an eye on him\". <br>\r\n\"Oh alright, alright...In here, men!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander opened his eyes. He was lying on the floor in a room. He stood up and looked around. It was his room! Only...it wasn't. He stared around. Everything he knew was gone, his clothes, his bed, his computer, his desk-lamp. He looked around. The desk was older, plainer. It had a rocker-blotter, dip-pens, inkwells and notepaper on it. An old bed and cabinet were in the corner where Skander's bed usually was. A shiny, brass alarm-clock ticked loudly on the bedside table. Two men were standing near the desk. The older one looked like a doctor. He had a doctor's medical bag behind him, sitting on a chair. The other man was taller, younger. He had brown hair and was wearing a brown suit. Four men came in, wheeling a gurney. The doctor stepped forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy now,\" he said, \"Onto the bed...careful, careful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gurney rattled as the men struggled to move the patient. They laid him down on the bed and moved aside. The doctor placed a metal bucket next to the head of the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep him in isolation,\" said the doctor, \"If he wants anything, he can ring the bell. Otherwise, keep OUT of this room. It is not safe! I must leave.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking his bag and hat, the medical man left the room. Skander stepped closer to the bed. He gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying in bed was Adrian. He was wearing a suit. A black suit. He looked a mess. The white dress-shirt was covered in speckles of blood and the waistcoat and sleeves of the shirt were badly stained. Mr. Stone stepped towards the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, son?\" he asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian struggled to get up, he wheezed and his arm collapsed. He fell heavily on his right side, his head hanging over the side of the bed. He gagged and coughed. The sound was sickening. A loud, rasping, retching hack. Skander clapped a hand to his mouth as white phlegm gurgled and spewed out of Adrian's mouth and slopped into the bucket with a dull \"fwop!\" Mr. Stone backed away and left the room, \"Ring the bell if you want anything!\" he said, pointing to the bell on the table, and he closed the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying it?\" Adrian asked. Skander jumped and turned around to see Adrian, the ghost, staring at him. \"My last moments alive. Let's watch, shall we? It's not pretty, huh? I was so dizzy, I didn't even know which end was up! My father and mother are coming soon...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Adrian on the bed reached out a trembling, shaking hand. It was vibrating so much it hit the alarm-clock. The metal contraption fell to the floor and exploded into a hundred pieces, cogs, glass, metal and screws flying everywhere. The hand grasped the bell weakly and rang it. The door opened a couple of minutes later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, son?\" Mr. Stone asked. Mrs. Stone screamed and collapsed into the chair by the desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I want...\" Adrian wheezed. He reached out a trembling hand and tugged on something. Mr. Stone stood up and looked at his watch. It was the most expensive thing he owned. He knew how much his son wanted a nice watch of his own. Carefully, he undid the chain and tugged the watch out of his waistcoat pocket. He put the watch into his son's pocket and did the chain up around the buttonhole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There now, Adrian. You take it. I know you've always wanted it, you may as well have it now...Oh god!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian was shaking in bed, thrashing! Throwing his body around. The bed shook and rattled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ADRIAN!\" he screamed. Adrian struggled over the side of the bed and threw up. Blood and white mucus squelched out his mouth and splattered into the bucket. He struggled up and stared outwards with bloodshot eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father...\" he wheezed. Suddenly, the body went limp. It fell off the bed, hitting the half-full bucket and tipping it over. The body hit the floor and the bucket rolled across the room. Mrs. Stone screamed and screamed while Mr. Stone ran out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Christ!\" Skander whispered... </span></div></div>",

Most of the curtains and blinds were drawn. Electric lights shone from lamps hung from the celing, or from sconces screwed into the wall. They passed the bathroom with its old-fashioned toilet and sink and the clawfoot bathtub. Adrian opened a door and beckoned Skander inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my father's study,\" said Adrian. He cast a hand aorund the chamber and Skander took it in. A nameplate on the desk read: \"Lawrence Stone\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Lawrence Stone was a man of precise habits and an almost sterile neatness and cleanliness. A gigantic desk the size of a bathtub was situated in front of several bookcases. Between the bookcases was a fireplace. A fire crackled in the grate, throwing a hot, yellow glow around everywhere. Between the fireplace and the desk was a high-backed, leather office chair. On a side-table was a gigantic black desktop typewriter the size of a microwave oven. A tall, stately grandfather clock ticked slowly from where it stood next to the door. A couple of couches and a couple of armchairs filled in the empty spaces. A chandelier hung from the ceiling, but it had been turned off. A green banker's lamp on the desk was turned on, and the light reflected on the green, leather writing surface of the desk. The yellow from the fire and the green from the desk sure made the room look weird. Skander walked slowly around the room, looking at everything. The pens, notepads, papers, inkwells, blotters and stamps on the desk, the books in the bookcase...and a boy sleeping on the couch near the fireplace. The boy looked a little younger than Skander. He had light brown hair, and was wearing a white dress shirt, black trousers and a black waistcoat. His shoes were off, and soft, dark red socks covered his feet. He was truly sound asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nathaniel,\" said Adrian. \"My younger brother...Poor kid\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian bent down over the slumbering child and held him in his ghostly arms. He gave the boy a kiss on the cheek, and ruffled his silky, light-brown hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He means the world to me...although I never got a chance to tell him that,\" said Adrian. \"He's a great kid\". </span></div></div>",

The two boys walked across the sand of the beach. Skander was wearing shorts and a T-shirt that were probably too small for him. They showed off his form perhaps a little too well. Everyone stared at the two boys, the one that looked like a hot surfer dude, and the one who looked like he just stepped off the R.M.S. Titanic. They ignored them. As usual, if anyone had really bothered to look, they would've noticed that Adrian was not leaving any shoe-prints on the ground, despite the fact that he was wearing the black leather shoes that he had on when he died. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached the jetty to see Jason sitting there with fishing-equipment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" he shouted, \"You made it!\" <br>\r\n\"We made it,\" said Skander. \"Come on, Adrian.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys jogged along the jetty and reached the end. Adrian shrugged off his ghostly coat and waistcoat and lay them on the jetty. He stood there in his white shirt, black tie and black suspenders. He bent down and picked up a fishing-rod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't changed much since I was alive,\" he said. \"I was rather fond of fishing...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe baited the hook. \"You might want to stand back,\" he said. The boys took a few steps back. Adrian swung the fishing-pole through the air. A long, thin line of fishing-wire shot out and hit the water with a 'splash!', the little red and white sinker bobbing in the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice cast,\" said Skander. He threw out his line, and then Jason threw out his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" said Adrian, \"Skander, you could be a great super-hero, like Batman or Superman...\"<br>\r\n\"Me? Naaah...\" said Skander. \"I dunno...\"<br>\r\n\"You have powers,\" Adrian said. \"You could do lots of stuff.\"<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, but...well so what?\"<br>\r\n\"You could be famous,\" said Adrian. \"A celebrity.\"<br>\r\n\"Well yeeeaaah...but it'd be a pretty lonely life.\"<br>\r\n\"I could help,\" said Jason.<br>\r\n\"You don't have any of my powers,\" said Skander.<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you can give me some.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know how! Adrian's probably the best sidekick to have if I ever DID become a super-hero.\" <br>\r\n\"Perhaps your mother might know,\" said Adrian. \"She...I GOT SOMETHING!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys grabbed Adrian's rod and tried to reel it in. A fat, flapping fish came up with the line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\" Jason said, \"You are good at fishing!\"<br>\r\n\"Told you,\" said Adrian, crossing his arms, smugly. \"Hey...what's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander stared out. He could see two figures in the water, thrashing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they're in trouble!\" Adrian said, \"Come on, Super Skander, let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Skander said. \"I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian pushed Skander off the jetty into the water. Skander coughed and spluttered. Then his head popped up. He started kicking and paddling. Faster, faster, faster...soon, he was a machine! His legs thrummed through the water and his arms swung up and down in a windmill fashion. Adrian gurgled happily underwater. The two friends swam out. Skander didn't even feel tired! What was going on!? Must be super-strength or super-speed...he looked behind him. Definitely super-speed. His legs were slamming through the water like paddlesteamer wheels. He reached the two figures in the water. A boy about twelve, and his brother, about Skander's age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on!\" Skander shouted. He reached them. \"Okay kid, grab on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy climbed on Skander's back. His extra weight made it harder to swim, but Skander managed. Adrian popped up in the water. \"Come on!\" he shouted to the other boy, \"Your life's more valuable than mine, let's get it back before you lose it, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian grabbed the other boy's hand and started back to the shore. The older boy was too panicky to realise that Adrian, though he was completely immersed in sea-water - was not even wet. His hair was still neatly parted, his clothes bone-dry. They swam back to shore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh baby!\" a woman screamed. She ran to the water's edge as Skander and Adrian emerged from the surf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's alright,\" Skander said. Adrian dragged the other boy ashore. \"He's a heavy one!\" he said. The woman grabbed her sons and kissed them and then grabbed Skander and hugged him. \"Oh I had no idea where they went! You boys are VERY lucky!\" she said, turning to her sons.<br>\r\n\"Yes mom,\" they said. <br>\r\n\"Oh thank you, thank you,\" said the lady, \"What's your name?\"<br>\r\n\"Skander,\" said Skander. \"No problem.\"<br>\r\n\"You and your friend saved my boys!...Where is he?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander turned around. Adrian was gone. He turned to the jetty. Adrian was packing up the fishing-gear and putting on his coat again. Skander guessed the ghost-boy wasn't used to the attention... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He held out the fat, silver fish. Mrs. Jones smiled, \"I'll cook it for dinner.

The climate here is similar to our own planet, but it also enhances Skander's physical abilities. He can run faster, hear clearer, see further and is more powerful here on Earth because of the atmosphere. But apart from that, Skander comes from a long line of super-beings. I have various powers, of course...But Skander has inherited all kinds of abilities from his ancestors, passed down through generations. They'll all show themselves with time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of powers does he have?\" Jason asked.<br>\r\n\"No idea,\" said Mrs. Jones, \"They'll come at random.

There is a way for Skander to transfer his powers to another person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian cleared his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another...LIVING...person. It can only be done once, and the affects are permanent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's it done?\" Skander asked. His mother started cleaning the fish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You grab the person by the shoulders. You close your eyes and envision that person posessing your powers. A bond is created. And while it's in existence, your powers...\" she pointed at Skander, \"Could transfer to Jason...\" she started prepping the fish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You can only make this bond once, with only one person. The bond transfers your powers and any potential powers, to him. Once it's broken and the powers have been transferred, you can't do it again.

She was a good seamstress, and she could judge whether or not her clothes would fit Skander just by looking at her son's current clothes. Jason was a bit harder, but when she was done, Melinda Jones had four red and black costumes, two for Skander, two for Jason. The form-hugging lycra would be comfortable to wear for long periods of time and it was tough enough to put up with anything the boys could do with it. She also created four pairs of close-fitting red gloves and had bought heavy-duty red boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey boys! Come in and try these on!\" she shouted to the kids who were out in the back yard, practicing with their powers and playing catch. Adrian was too fast for Skander. The moment Skander threw the ball, the ghost vanished and reappeared at the other end of the yard, ready to catch the ball. Eagerly, they all jogged inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice...nice fit...\" said Skander, after he tugged the uniform on, \"A bit tight.\" <br>\r\n\"It's meant to be tight,\" said Melinda, kissing her son, \"Can't have your clothes coming off in a fight, can we?\"<br>\r\n\"Only with girls,\" said Jason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelinda and Adrian laughed. Skander tugged on the glauntlets and the boots and red socks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is cool!\" he said. He looked like a smaller Mr. Incredible, with a reverse-coloured costume. \"Hey mom, what about capes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a little worried about those,\" said Melinda, \"But I made them anyway. They're red on the outside, and black inside, with quick-release clasps around the throat. Pressing the clasp here...\" she pointed to it after she clipped the cape around Skander's throat, \"will instantly release it. It's a safety precaution,\" she said. She suited up Jason as well, and smiled at the two super-teens. \"Oh you look so cute! Oh, and I made these for you, too...\" she said. And picked up a pair of black silk masks to cover the top half of their faes. \"Just in case you might want them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander stretched his mask over his head and stared in the mirror, then struck a heroic pose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah...\" he said, \"That's all kinds of sexy right there...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelinda burst into giggles and collapsed into a chair, heaving with laughter. \"Oh boys!\" she said, wiping tears of laughter from her eyes with a handkerchief. \"Now Adrian...\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about me,\" said Adrian. \"I've been wearing the same suit for 90 years. It's my favourite one and I like it. Not gonna change nothin'. Besides, I'd lose my scare-factor. Nothin' freaks people out like a fellow wearing clothes from the last century.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelinda giggled, \"I suppose you're right,\" she said. \"Well! Hope you're all ready for action!\" she said. And she hugged, kissed and waved at the boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcited, the three boys rushed to Skander's room and closed the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we gonna call ourselves?\" Jason asked excitedly. <br>\r\n\"Trident Force!\" Skander said, \"There's three of us, and we got powers. And...it sounds cool!\"<br>\r\n\"What about our names?\" Jason asked. <br>\r\n\"Names?\" Skander replied, \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"Well we can't use our REAL names!\"<br>\r\n\"Good point...I'm gonna be Stryker!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STRYKER? What kinda name is that?\" Adrian asked. <br>\r\n\"A friggin' awesome name!\" Skander snapped. \"What about you, huh, Ghostboy?\"<br>\r\n\"The Shadow,\" said Adrian, and he let out an evil laugh. \"He sees all, hears all, but can't be heard or seen...it would be perfect!\"<br>\r\n\"What about you, Jason?\" Skander asked. <br>\r\n\"Ummm...\" Jason thought. \"My surname's Lancet...Jason Lancet...\"<br>\r\n\"THE BLADE!\" said Adrian quickly, \"That would be just amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grinned, \"Hey yeah...that would be cool...Stryker, Blade and Shadow - Together...TRIDENT FORCE!\" he screamed, punching a fist into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander grinned, \"Then it's settled! That's what we are!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter telling Melinda, she agreed to sew emblems on their clothing. A dagger and yellow lightning-bolt for Jason and two yellow lightning bolts shaped like S's for Skander. \"Skander Stryker!\" was what they stood for, Skander insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and Skander tugged ordinary clothes over their uniforms after their little 'superhero confrence' and alterations to their costumes, and headed outside with Adrian to keep their eyes out for crime. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was like swimming, only in air. He jumped and spun and twirled around, his red and black cape flapping behind him in the breeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, fellahs, we have a HOUSE FIRE! HELLO!?\" Adrian shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" Skander said, \"let's go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiving through the air, the boys shot towards the burning building. The smoke was thick and black and impossible to avoid, and yet, despite the fact that they were breathing it in and out, neither Jason or Skander felt wheezy. It was as if the smoke didn't affect them! They smashed through holes in the roof and ran from room to room, shouting. Firemen were shooting water into the rooms as fast as they could and scrambling in from the streets below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found one!\" Jason shouted, and Skander ran into a room where a boy about 10 was caught underneath a collapsed closet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't breathe!\" the boy screamed. <br>\r\n\"Hold on, buddy,\" said Skander, \"We're gonna get you out...just relax...Jason lift!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grabbed the closet and hoisted it up in his muscular arms, the lycra on his sleeves stretching impressively. Skander grabbed the boy and hoisted him upright. \"Come on, kid, let's get outta here! Blade, take his other arm.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grabbed the boy's other arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like flying, kid?\" Jason shouted, \"'cause you're gonna go for one! Hold on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two super-teens shot through the window of the apartment block, their capes fluttering in the updraft from the fire. People in the streets below screamed and pointed upwards. The two figures in black and red hovered slowly to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy does it now...\" said Jason. He let the boy go and he dropped the last two feet and landed lightly on the pavement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice work Blade,\" said Skander. <br>\r\n\"Thanks Stryker.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you boys?\" a policeman shouted. <br>\r\n\"No time for that now, sergeant,\" said Skander, \"there's still people in there...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading inside, the boys stared around, going from room to room. Suddenly, Adrian popped out of the floor, looking as neat and perfect as he always did, although a little spookier with all the flames around him. \"I found a guy downstairs!\" he said, \"Come on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning downstairs, the boys found a man pinned under by a fallen beam. Skander lifted it up while Adrian and Jason helped the man up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be okay,\" said Skander. He helped him outside. The man coughed and gagged. He collapsed onto the pavement, panting for air. Paramedics rushed him onto a stretcher. Just then, a man in an official and hig-ranking police-uniform showed up. Skander recognised him at once from the newspapers and television. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon Commissioner Weston,\" Skander said. <br>\r\n\"Who are you boys?\" the commissioner demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" said Skander, looking at Jason, \"Who are we?\"<br>\r\n\"Trident Force,\" said Jason, grinning, \"here to watch over the city and people.\" <br>\r\n\"Weeell,\" said the commissioner, smiling, \"Super-heroes, huh? Nice work, boys...very nice work. I see two of you, where's the third in your trident group?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander and Jason looked up. Standing on the roof of the burning building, the crowd could see a boy in his late teenage years wearing an old-fashioned suit. He smiled down at them and waved...then disappeared into thin air...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be damned...\" said the commissioner. \"Well, thank you, boys.\"<br>\r\n\"No problem, officer,\" said Jason. \"Stryker, I think we better get going.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping into the air, the boys flew off into the skies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have we learnt today?\" Skander asked Jason on the flight home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can fly...\" said Jason, doing a barrel-roll through the air, \"Smoke and flames don't hurt us...\"<br>\r\n\"And we're soon gonna be famous...\" said Skander, grinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at home that evening, the boys headed upstairs to Skander's room where they found a package waiting for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" Skander asked his mother. <br>\r\n\"A policeman delivered it while you were out,\" said Melinda, \"Compliments of Commissioner Weston.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander ripped the paper off the box and opened it. It was a police radio! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this is too cool...\" said Jason, acting as if he'd just gotten the latest computer-game. \"This is WICKED! Plug it in!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander unravelled the cables and plugged the radio into the wall-sockets. He flipped a few switches and turned a couple of dials...and they were on the airwaves... </span></div></div>",

Vanishing, the three boys reappeared on the street, opposite the bank where officers were taking cover behind a brick wall, firing over the top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on, officer?\" Skander shouted. <br>\r\n\"Yo Stryker!\" the man yelled back, \"Eight guys, in the bank. Robbed the joint. Two took off with the cash. Blue van.

Skander and Jason stood up and ran across the street, bullets bouncing harmlessly off them. The men saw the boys and opened fire. Skander coughed as a mouthful of lead-shot from a shotgun flew into his mouth. He spat it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell!?' one of the men shouted. He threw his gun at Skander. The muscular teen grabbed the gun and twisted it into a spiral shape, the long, shiny shotgun barrel now resembling a piece of metallic macaroni. With ridiculous ease, Skander snapped the gun in half and threw it on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus!\" the man shouted, \"Run!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe six men jumped up and ran, still firing behind them. Policemen jumped over the wall they were hiding behind and ran after them. The men ran into an alleyway and Jason and Skander ran in after them. The desperate bank-robbers fired their guns in vain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't waste my time...\" said Skander, \"Your bullets are useless...\" he walked up to one man who was holding a Colt .45 in his hands. The man grabbed Skander by the neck and forced the gun into the boy's mouth. He fired! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bullet hit Skander in the back of the throat. It rebounded and fell down his gullet. Skander felt it being dissolved, like a peppermint drop. Skander bit down on the gun. He meant to hold it in his mouth, but instead...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrunch! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire front half of the gun disappeared into Skander's mouth. He was so surprised, he accidently swalllowed the barrel in shock, but tried to act as if this happened every day and that he regularly ate .45-calibre Colt automatic pistols for breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now lie down,\" said Skander. \"The cops are here now.\" </span></div></div>",

He swooped down to see the van, weaving and speeding in and out of traffic on the highway. He dived. Sure enough, the van was dark blue. Adrian dived through the roof into the back of the van. Duffel bags and backpacks inside bulged with banknotes. Undoing the latches on the rear doors of the van, Adrian threw the sacks out into the street. He slammed the doors shut and locked them. He slid through the dividing wall between the cargo-area of the van and into the driver's cab. There were two men here, and three seats. Adrian sat himself in the middle of the van and calmy materialised and acted as if he was a hitch-hiker, come along for the ride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taking a bit long, isn't it?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men screamed! One of them tried to grab Adrian, which, of course, was useless. His hand went right through Adrian. The ghost grabbed the man. Another hand reached for the door and opened it. Undoing the seatbelt, Adrian threw the man into the road! The van lurched and the door slammed shut, catching the man's coat and dragging him along. Adrian vanished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell are you!?\" the final bank-robber screamed, \"WHO THE HELL ARE YOU!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your worst nightmare...\" said Adrian. \"Peek-a-boo!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian's face materialised in the mirror and the robber screamed. He lost control of the van. Adrian dived into the man's body and used his hands to grab the wheel. He turned the wheel hard over to the left. The van skidded across the road and hit a police roadblock and spike-strip. The spike-strip tripped the van over and it crashed onto its side and then up onto its roof, finally crashing down onto its left side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye!\" Adrian said. He smiled at the crooks, one pinned to the door by his coat, the other dazed inside the cab, and floated upwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is better than any movie!\" said Skander, flying next to Adrian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was totally cool!\" said Jason, \"The way he crashed the van!\"<br>\r\n\"Aaactually...that was me,\" said Adrian, \"I posessed him and forced him to crash it.

Melinda had insisted on divulging Jason's new abilities to his parents, they were shocked, of course, but they got over it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps he'll be able to do things faster now,\" said his father. <br>\r\n\"Daaad,\" said Jason. <br>\r\n\"No seriously, you're a lucky kid, Jase,\" said his father. \"And you look great!...we're proud of you. So Linda, what happens if Jason has kids?\"<br>\r\n\"If he does,\" said Melinda, \"They inherit his powers.\"<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, interesting...\" said Mrs. Lancet, \"I'm not sure if we can handle super-powered babies, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelinda laughed, \"They won't get their powers until they're teenagers, don't worry...Are you sure you won't stay for dinner?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Linda, but we're expected at a friend's house. Him and his wife are celebrating their 25th anniversary. We'll see you tomorrow, Jase. Look after yourself.\"<br>\r\n\"Bye dad!\" Jason said. His parents left the Jones house and Melinda brought out dinner - Homemade pizza and lasagna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you boys are hungry as heck,\" she said, \"after flying around so much, so I made you an extra-special dinner.\" <br>\r\n\"Mom, you have powers, don't you?\" said Skander.<br>\r\n\"Not as many as you do, darling. I married into your father's family, he was the one with all the powers - God rest his soul...\"<br>\r\n\"What happened to dad?\"<br>\r\n\"He died on the way to Earth, darling. It was a long time ago, you were only a baby. There was an airlock failure and he...well he suffocated...\" Melinda sighed. She didn't want to talk about it. She cut up the pizza and put it on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, where's the chilli?\" Skander asked. He stared around the table. <br>\r\n\"Oh I left it in the kitchen...\" said Melinda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwisting around in his chair, Skander stared at the chilli, sitting on the counter in the kitchen. He reached out a hand for it, even though it was still 15 feet away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh just get up and grab it,\" she said. <br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" Skander mumbled. Suddenly, he felt something bump against his hand. He turned back to the kitchen and yelped to see the jar of chilli hovering just out of reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh very funny, Adrian!\" Skander shouted. <br>\r\n\"What?\" the ghost asked, appearing next to him. Skander nearly dropped the jar. <br>\r\n\"You didn't just...levitate the jar over from the kitchen?\"<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n\"Wh...\" Skander stared in disbelief. The jar was on the COUNTER! In the KITCHEN! He was in the dining-room! How the hell...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can...I can levitate things and make them move around!?\" Skander asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked up, \"Really? Let me try...\" He raised his hands. The pepper-grinder whizzed towards him. \"Hey cool!\"<br>\r\n\"Man I never knew I had...had...\" Skander struggled to find the word. <br>\r\n\"Telekinesis?\" Adrian offered.<br>\r\n\"Uh...yeah,\" said Skander. \"Wow!

Skander stared at the fireplace. At first, nothing, but then, a clanking sound, as the poker rose into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool...\" Skander said. He lowered the poker back down. He stared at the piano and, with a jangle, it too lifted a couple of feet into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome...\" he said. <br>\r\n\"Ahem...\" Adrian cleared his throat, \"You mind, hunky-boy? That piano's been in my house for a hundred years, I'd appreciate your not throwing it around.\" <br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" said Skander, and he set the piano back down with a muffled 'clunk'! He'd forgotten that when his mother bought the house, which hadn't been touched in ages, a lot of the furniture inside it had belonged to the original Stone family. Next, Skander levitated a glass jug, half-full of lemonade and filled up the glasses around the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thanks, honey,\" said Melinda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Adrian,\" Jason shouted, \"You're a ghost right...what kinda powers do you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost swirled around the chandelier in the middle of the dining-room, the glass decorations clinking slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can make myself invisible...\" he said, vanishing. \"I can make myself appear solid,\" he said, reappearing in complete solidity. \"I can be transparent...\" he said, turning into a black and white version of himself, whispy and smoky. \"Or translucent...\" He added, turning into a colour version of himself, but through which light could shine, \"...I can teleport...\" he said, vanishing from the top of the chandelier and appearing next to the kitchen door, \"...I can fly...\" he said. \"I can go through walls...\" and he disappeared in one wall and popped out another, \"and floors and celings...anything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought ghosts can possess people?\" Skander asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian let out his usual, creepy laugh. \"Sure I can,\" he said.

He headed to the bathroom to brush his teeth and do his hair up with gel in the mad, spikey way he liked it. He headed into the kitchen to find leftover lasagna and pizza on the kitchen table, all hot and ready to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I warmed up some of the leftovers for you,\" Adrian said. <br>\r\n\"You know how to work a microwave?\" Skander asked.<br>\r\n\"Of course, why?\"<br>\r\n\"I dunno, I guess I didn't expect ghosts to know stuff like that since they don't eat...\"<br>\r\n\"Hey I can work your PC perfectly fine,\" Adrian said. \"Now eat up.

He was perhaps four feet away now. Davy swung a meaty fist towards Skander. Skander whipped aside so fast, Davy might as well have been punching in the opposite direction. Skander slammed his fist into David's stomach. The bully collapsed like a house of cards in a tornado. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want some of this!?\" Skander asked, turning to Brad, the other guy. He was already moving his feet, preparing to take Skander on. Skander punched and Brad ducked! Skander's fist hit the brick wall behind him, cracking it. Skander kicked, but missed again. Brad turned to run, not wanting to chance fate another time, but found his way blocked by Jason who did a nasty, curved, underarm jab. It nailed Brad right between the legs and he let out an anamalistic howl of pain, clutching his potato-mashed goolies and collapsing to the ground, twitchin in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys better get outta here,\" said Jason to the kids, \"Go on, scat!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the boys left, Skander stood, examining the cracks he'd left in the brick wall.

The superhero was sound asleep.<br>\r\nAdrian was about to wake him up, when he heard Jason\u2019s mother talking to her husband in the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly flew over and materialized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Mrs. Lancet!\u201d he said politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, hello Adrian! I\u2019m baking a chocolate cake for you guys to take to the beach today! I guess Melinda is taking you all to the beach, so why don\u2019t you go ahead and wake up Jason?\u201d she said to the ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d he cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flew back and grabbed a feather from Jason\u2019s desk, and started to run it over the soles of his feet, which were sticking out from the covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201d Jason groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWake up! We\u2019re going to the beach! We\u2019re taking chocolate cake with us!\u201d Adrian said to Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChocolate? Hmmm Yummm!\u201d Jason yawned, as he rubbed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped out of bed and stumbled over to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, honey! Would you like to try a slice of cake?\u201d his mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to see what that tastes like!\u201d Adrian chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sat down on his chair at the dinner table, where he poured a glass of milk and grabbed his fork and knife, just as his mom placed a slice of delicious chocolate cake on a plate before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you can\u2019t have any! You\u2019re a ghost, remember?\u201d he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh wanna bet?\u201d Adrian said with an evil grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Jason was about to take his first bite, Adrian walked over to him, and allowed his body to take possession of him. Adrian became transparent and \u201cmerged\u201d with Jason\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason took a bite and swallowed. He then drank some milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! That was pretty tasty!\u201d Jason spoke, in Adrian\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! What the---?\u201d Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCongratulations! You\u2019re possessed!\u201d Adrian\u2019s voice continued, from Jason\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Quit that!\u201d Jason protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust take another bite, will you?\u201d Adrian grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason just complied and ate the rest of his small piece of cake. It was absolutely delicious. Then he washed it away with a glass of milk, before he grabbed his swimming trunks, his towel and some sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I\u2019ll teleport you to Skander\u2019s room\u2026\u201d Adrian\u2019s voice said, speaking from Jason\u2019s mouth. \u201cHere we go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Jason disappeared, and re-appeared in Skander\u2019s bedroom, just as Skander was getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! You teleported!\u201d Skander gasped, as he saw Jason pop up in his bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 I\u2019m possessed by a ghost!\u201d Jason grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, sleepyhead!\u201d Adrian\u2019s voice then said, while coming out of Jason\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026 That is so weird\u2026 Two people in one body\u2026\u201d Skander chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom gave us some chocolate cake to take to the beach with us\u2026\u201d Jason explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I even got to taste some of it!\u201d Adrian spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well he just jumped into my body without\u2014\u201c Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI took it over\u2026 Muahahahaha!\u201d Adrian laughed. \u201cWe like the same food\u2026 So I\u2019m gonna do it more often! Who\u2019s gonna stop me? Plus I get to experience your cool little powers!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Melinda walked in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, are you guys ready to head on out to the beach?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, where\u2019s Adrian?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Adrian and Jason spoke up at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOver here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelinda looked up at Jason in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy does Jason sound like Adrian?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Adrian came flying out of Jason\u2019s body, and landed right next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally! I thought you were NEVER gonna come out!\u201d Jason complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I could use some ocean water over my body, so I might possess you again when you go swimming at the beach!\u201d Adrian snapped back. \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten wet in decades!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how does it feel to be possessed?\u201d Skander wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeird\u2026 I could feel him inside of me the whole time\u2026 Making me say and do things\u2026\u201d Jason noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys grabbed towels and packed the SUV for the ride to the back, where they would spend the rest of their Saturday afternoon\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The stiff joints snapped into place and the whole chair broke open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaah! Thanks sweetie,\" she said, and gave him a kiss. She set the chair up and tugged out her book. \"You boys go and play. Try not to get too wet...\" <br>\r\n\"No chance of that, mah,\" said Skander, \"Come on, Jason.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys reached the surf, but didn't go in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I wanna stay dry today,\" said Jason.<br>\r\n\"What are you? A wuss? Who always listens to their best friend's mother?\" Skander asked. <br>\r\n\"Well I...\" Jason waved his hands dismissively. Skander shrugged. \"Whatever...I wanna build a sand-castle.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing nothing but their tight, black lycra costumes with T-shirts over the top (to hide their logos), the boys started digging. Adrian sauntered over, having left his coat, hat and waistcoat with Melinda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth are you doing?\" he asked. <br>\r\n\"Building a sand-castle,\" said Skander. <br>\r\n\"Huh...\" Adrian said. \"You can't build a sandcastle without a spade and bucket...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost disappeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where'd he go?\" Jason asked. Then Skander saw Adrian striding out of the waves with something in his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While you were acting all heroic last time we were here, I went exploring,\" said the ghost, \"I found these buried in silt underneath the jetty. Some kid must've left them there a long time ago. We can use these.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the castle-building had begun. People passing by watched the two teenagers in what looked like surfing-gear, and another wearing black trousers and a white dress-shirt, digging, stacking, moulding, patting and sculpting. Skander's powerful hands gouged into the damp sand near the water's edge, scooping up huge clumps of the stuff and dumping it next to Jason, who filled the bucket to make the towers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHARK!\" someone screamed. Skander's head snapped around. He could see people both running away, and towards, the surf. He stared out to sea. He could see people caught out in the riptide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason!\" Skander shouted, \"You deal with the sharks and I'll get the people!\" Skander tugged off his T-shirt and Jason did the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And let him get eaten alive!?\" said Adrian, standing up, \"I don't bloody think so! BOTH of you get the people, I'll handle the sharks. They can eat me all they like - nothing'll happen.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth teens had dived into the water. Adrian teleported, disappearing from the beach, and showing up a few miles out to sea. He grabbed a shark and started punching it, pulling at it, smashing it and wrestling with it. Unfortunately, Adrian couldn't posess animals, but he sure fought like one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GOOD AFTERNOON!\" Skander shouted to the struggling group of teenagers in the riptide. \"My name is Stryker and this is my friend The Blade, we're gonna be your surf-lifesavers for today!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were four teenagers, two girls and two boys, all in their mid teens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get us outta here!\" one of the girls screamed, and gurgled as she swallowed more water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Blade, you take two each, I'll handle the others!\" Skander shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grabbed one of the boys and reached his hands out for one of the girls. \"Come on, sweetheart,\" he said. \"Let's get the hell outta here! Hold on now...Deep breath! Dive!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave hit them and they went under. Jason started kicking. He powered through the water like a speedboat. The boy tugged on Jason's arm and he went up again. They were almost at the shore! They took another breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! How the hell do you swim so fast!?\" the boy gasped. <br>\r\n\"The Blade is as keen as a knife, through water, air and land...\" said Jason, grinning, \"Come on, not much further! Jeeze, you guys know how to get yourselves drowned!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack out at sea, Skander was having a bit more trouble. With the extra weight and with no firm footing below him, he wasn't sure if he could take off and fly, and the waves kept disorientating him about where to swim. He let out a scream of frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on surfboy,\" said Adrian, pretending to swim through the water towards him, \"Move it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Shadow! You're not helping!\" Skander yelled. <br>\r\n\"Duck!\" said Adrian, grinning. Skander turned around. <i>Jesus Christ!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave, a HUGE wave, was surging towards them! Skander swore. If he could just WALK on water this would be no problem! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wave hit them. They were forced under, but their natural boyancy made them shoot up again! Skander felt himself shoot into the air. Then he fell...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhunk! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander lay there, dazed, then he got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait...got up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander stared around him...he was walking on water! He jumped and pounded and slammed his feet down - He didn't go under! It was like he was walking on a gigantic sheet of glass! One that he could reach through. He grabbed the girl and heaved her into his arms. Then the boy. Holding them as easily as pillows, he cuddled them close and started a leisurely stroll back to land. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!...Wow!\" the girl panted. Then she grabbed Skander around the chest and neck. \"You're cute...\" she said. Skander blushed. She kissed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock it off Stacy, you think everyone's cute,\" said the other boy, who was obviously her brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy ignored him and her hands wrapped themselves around Skander's bulging arms. \"So strrrrrroooong...\" she said, and giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy now,\" said Skander, he lowered the two of them onto the sand. People crowded around them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey look!\" someone shouted, \"It's those super-kids!\"<br>\r\n\"Where!?\"<br>\r\n\"There, near the water!\"<br>\r\n\"Hey let me through!\"<br>\r\n\"Daddy, I wanna see! I wanna seeeeee!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander strolled over to Jason. \"Hey,\" he said. <br>\r\n\"I saw you out there,\" said Jason, \"What did you DO?\"<br>\r\n\"I'll explain later...\" said Skander. \"Right now...just wave for kids, smile at the olds, shake with the boys and pose for the girls.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason collapsed into fits of laughter. \"You idiot!\" he said, snickering. </span></div></div>",

Her handbag was hovering in mid-air! She reached up for it and the bag dropped into her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe piano in the corner of the living-room started playing by itself.

It turned out some sort of old-fashioned jazz tune. <br>\r\n\"Hey Blake, I didn't know you had a player-piano,\" said his friend Eric. <br>\r\n\"It's not a player piano!\" said Blake. \"Who are you!?

Skander laughed. \"You...you don't want me to do that.\"<br>\r\n\"Aww come on!\"<br>\r\n\"No I mean really...you...don't want to see me do that.\"<br>\r\n\"Awwww...\"<br>\r\n\"Just one thing, Stryker...\" said Jason, \"Let them have some fun.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay okay...\" said Skander. \"It better be something you don't value, 'cause it won't BE very valuable once I'm done with it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small crowd laughed. They rushed out onto the balcony and Blake stared around his back yard. He pointed to a rusting metal hulk in the yard. \"Dad's been wanting to throw that out for years,\" he said, \"But he keeps complaining it's too big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander looked at the rusting barbeque-set. It was so old and...gone...that it was barely standing. This was easy. Skander could sneeze at it and it'd fall over. But, to oblige, he thrust out his right hand, palm open... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very ground beneath them shook! A blue-white beam and ball of energy pulsed out of Skander's hand, smashing the barbeque-set to pieces! Shards of metal, none of them bigger than a cookie, littered the yard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah cool!\"<br>\r\n\"Duuuuuuuuuuuuude!\"<br>\r\n\"Awww man!\"<br>\r\n\"Siiiiick!\"<br>\r\n\"Blow up something else!\" <br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" said Skander, \"Can't be blowing up everything...What else you want me to do?\" <br>\r\n\"Fight someone!\" one of the boys said. <br>\r\n\"Oh you don't want him to do that,\" said Jason. <br>\r\n\"Aww come on, I can take him!\" said one of the boys, shrugging off his jacket. <br>\r\n\"Uh...no...you can't,\" said Jason, \"Nobody can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the boy was already hopping around on his feet, doing practice jabs. Stryker grabbed the boy's shirtfront and hurled him into the air! He screamed as he shot up like a rocket, his hair whirling around him! Stryker jumped into the air, catching the boy on the way down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy now,\" he said, and he dropped him the last few feet. The boy hit the balcony with a 'whunk!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooooaaaah...\" he said, getting up. \"Oh maaaan...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can you do?\" one of the girls asked, looking at Jason.<br>\r\n\"Anything Stryker does, the Blade does better...\" Jason said, grinning. <br>\r\n\"No you can't,\" said Skander, crossing his arms, confidently. <br>\r\n\"Try me,\" said Jason. <br>\r\n\"Okay superkid, let's do target-practice,\" said Skander, \"Blake, you got any newspapers around here? Old ones?\"<br>\r\n\"Um...yeah,\" said Blake, \"In the study.\"<br>\r\n\"Get them, wrap them up with some rubber-bands or something and bring them out here.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake ran into the house and came back a few minutes later with some rolled up newspapers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Skander, \"Ready?...Aim...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander threw the first newspaper into the air. \"FIRE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's eyes blazed red and a laser shot out of them, hitting the first newspaper. It burst into flames! Suddenly, the whole bundle of papers was scooped out of Skander's hands. Adrian soared upwards and started throwing them everywhere! The club-members watched as red flashes of light went everywhere, and flaming newspapers fell to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's getting dark,\" said Blake, \"We better get inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander blinked. \"Why?\" His eyes flashed a blinding white light all over the yard. \"Not bright enough?\"<br>\r\n\"Woah! How'd you do that!?' one of the kids asked. <br>\r\n\"I can also see in the dark,\" said Skander. He blinked and his eyelights went off. \"Jase, show them night-vision!\"<br>\r\n\"I can't SHOW them...I can DO something with it, though.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Skander. He left and came back a few minutes later with a handful of kitchen-knives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hit me,\" Skander said. He stood at one end of the balcony and handed Jason the knives. \"Blake, turn off the lights.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake did as he was told. \"You guys stand back,\" Skander said. \"Okay, go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason blinked. His eyes turned green. Night-vision. He threw a knife through the air. Skander caught it and threw it back. Jason ducked it. The blade thudded into the balcony-rail behind him. They continued throwing knives for a few minutes, with everyone gasping and applauding... </span></div></div>",

Will you be spooked? Maybe. Terrified? Hopefully...Possessed? Definitely\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd thrilled and clapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This guy is creepy,\" said a boy with black hair to his friend. <br>\r\n\"I'd be a sad excuse for ghost if I wasn't, now wouldn't I be?\" said Adrian, swirling around him like a human-shaped cloud of smoke. Then, he vanished! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, boy,\" the black-haired kid said, in Adrian's, old-fashioned American accent, \"Let's dance!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd laughed as the boy broke into a quick 'Charleston' dance, swinging around and kicking his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what the...\" the boy said in his own voice. Adrian's took over, \"Shut up, kid, I'm not done yet!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the boy found himself climbing over the railing of the balcony. He ran along the ballustrade, from one end to the other, doing cartwheels and handstands and jumps all the way. Finally, his body flipped and tumbled back onto the balcony and Adrian flew out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that was fun!\" Adrian said. The crowd gasped and clapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you make things fly around like a pollygust?\" one of the girls asked.<br>\r\n\"That's a poltergeist,\" Adrian corrected and he made a truly creepy face, \"...an angry and vengeful spirit...RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR!\" he roared. The sound was deafening and the girl's hair flew back, as if blasted by a hurricane! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yeah, I can,\" said Adrian. He vanished again, then reappeared next to one of the boys. \"I can also teleport, make myself invisible, semi-visisble, transparent, translucent, solid...\" he grabbed the boy's hat and disappeared again and reappeared, floating twelve feet up in the air, waving the blue baseball cap, \"And, I can fly, just like those two skin-tubes there,\" he added, pointing to Skander and Jason. He dived thrugh the roof and then emerged in the living-room. He stepped through the window. \"And I can go through walls, floors, celings, rooves...anything!\" he threw the hat back to the boy, \"Even yoooooooou!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shot across the balcony, his ghostly form spearing everyone in the chests and abdomens, popping out of one and into another, until he appeared next to Skander and Jason at the other end of the balcony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was speechless. Adrian bowed...and once more, disappeared into thin air. </span></div></div>",

Another time.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" said Blake. He followed them to the door. When they were outside, Blake whispered in their ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason...Skander...can I see you guys at school?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" said Skander, \"So long as you don't blab.

Come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three friends headed out of Blake's house and started walking home. It wasn't a very long walk, but they took their time. Adrian turned a corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, where you going?\" Jason asked. <br>\r\n\"A different route,\" said Adrian. <br>\r\n\"Well wait up!\" said Skander. The two boys jogged up to Adrian and followed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adrian, where are we going?\" Jason asked. He didn't recognise this part of town at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A special place,\" said the ghost. \"Come on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey kept walking. \"I had a real fun time tonight,\" he said. \"First time since I died I spent time around real people...and actually did something worthwhile. You fellows are great.\" <br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Skander. Adrian turned a corner. \"Here we are.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a cemetary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...what are we doing here?\" Skander asked. <br>\r\n\"It's a shortcut,\" said Adrian. \"Come on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adrian...\" said Jason. \"I...I know my neighborhood, cutting through Elmtree Cemetary adds another twenty minutes to our walk! Why are we here...HEY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian snatched Jason's iPod out of his pocket and ran off with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey come back here!\" Jason shouted. The two boys ran after the ghost. He vanished and reappeared a few feet ahead. They kept chasing him and he kept vanishing. Finally, Adrian stopped. The two boys teleported from their last spot right to where Adrian was, so that they didn't have to waste time running anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's NOT FUNNY!\" Jason shouted, \"My mom'll kill me if she finds out I lost my iPod! Give it back!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian tossed him the iPod. \"There,\" he said. \"I wanted to show you guys something and I thought I'd have some fun doing it...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing...show...what?\" Skander asked, \"What is there around HERE that you'd want to show US?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian pulled his silver match-case from his pocket and opened it. He tugged out a match and closed the case. Kneeling down in front of a gravestone, he struck it across the top. The splinter of wood burst into light. The ghost knelt down, holding it at the base of the gravestone so that the light could illuminate all the text above it. Kneeling down, Jason and Skander read... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Here lie the remains of Master Adrian Jeremiah Stone. <br>\r\nBorn into this world, 15th of June, 1898, <br>\r\nAnd who departed this life, 4th of January, 1919. <br>\r\nAged Twenty Years and Five Months. A victim of <br>\r\nSpanish Influenza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere lies a Stone, inscribed in stone, <br>\r\nOne stone tells of the other. <br>\r\nThe upper stone doth last forever, <br>\r\nHow unlike the Other.</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander and Jason gulped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never shown ANYONE this,\" said Adrian. \"You're the first people. Ever. You're the first people I ever really liked since I died. I think you deserve to see where it is that I am buried.\" <br>\r\n\"Wow...\" said Jason. \"Cool...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Skander grabbed Jason and covered his mouth. He turned quickly to Adrian, \"He doesn't mean it!\" he said quickly, when he saw the ghost's eyes turn blood red. He knew Adrian was very sensitive about his death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something else I want to show you...\" Adrian said. He vanished. A couple of minutes later, he reappeared, half in, half out of his grave. He held something in his hands. \"Skander, this is for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander looked at the thing in Adrian's hand. It was a long golden chain. A large, gold pocket watch hung on the end of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" Skander whispered. <br>\r\n\"It's the watch I always wear,\" said Adrian. \"It was buried with me. Take it.\" <br>\r\n\"No...\" said Skander, \"I...I can't, this was...\"<br>\r\n\"Take it. I want you to have it,\" said Adrian. \"You're the first real friend I've had in years. You should have it. Look after it. It's antique now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander held the watch and chain. They were in absolute MINT condition. \"Father took very good care of his things,\" Adrian said. \"It works just as fine today as it did when it was made. It's probably worth a fortune now. Look after it.\" <br>\r\n\"I will,\" said Skander. He put the watch into his pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason, this is for you,\" said Adrian. He held up another item. A dazzling gold ring with rubies, diamonds and sapphires set into it. \"It is my signet-ring. Another item I was buried with. Wear it on your right hand, on your pinkie-finger. Keep it there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys were speechless. Again, they tried to refuse, but Adrian ignored them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come you can still wear these things, if we have them?\" Skander asked, noting the gold chain still threaded through Adrian's waistcoat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I died wearing them,\" Adrian explained. \"So their remains are always with me. But the material posessions are now yours, forever. They were the most priceless things I owned. As expensive now as they were back then. Look after them\". <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Finding both boys asleep, Adrian hovered around the bed. He saw the watch which he gave Skander, lying on the table next to Skander's bedside lamp. The ghost picked it up and held it in his hands, sadly. Then, he wound it up. The fast, metallic ticking filled the room. He set the time and then hovered over Skander's bed, dangling and swaying the watch on its chain. He held it up to Skander's unhearing ear, and then put it back down on the table. He grabbed the covers and tugged them up over Skander's body until only the top half of his head showed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G'night, buddy,\" he said. He floated over to Skander's computer and turned it on. He may as well surf the internet until they woke up. He clicked and tapped and typed, searching around for stuff that would interest him. Something bumped against him. He looked up. Skander was floating in mid-air. Fast asleep. Adrian blew the boy back to over his bed, but he continued to float. Adrian shrugged. He just hoped the boy would wake up over his bed instead of over the floor, otherwise he was going to be in for a very painful wake-up call... </span></div></div>",

After that, we take a train back home!\"<br>\r\n\"Why not fly?\" Skander asked. <br>\r\n\"We thought a train would be more romantic and fun,\" said Mrs. Lancet, \"Nobody travels by train anymore, and we thought it would be nice to give you boys a treat.\" <br>\r\n\"Woah...thanks,\" said Skander. \"Does Jason know?\"<br>\r\n\"Jason isn't awake yet,\" said Mr. Lancet, \"Sleeping away...No idea what he did last night, but...\" <br>\r\n\"I'll wake him up,\" said Adrian.

I'm too...bulky.\" <br>\r\n\"Nonsense! Put it on! Come on! You'll look great!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander sighed. He tugged off his clothes and went to put on the suit his mother had bought for him. It was a sort of medium grey. He sat down on the bed and put on his white dress-shirt and a pearl-grey necktie. Then, the trousers. He tucked in the shirt and buttoned up the fly. He looked hopelessly at the suspenders. He had no idea how to put them on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me do it,\" said Adrian. He floated over and showed Skander how to clip the suspenders on and adjust the strap-lengths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" he said, \"Now, the waistcoat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander picked up the waistcoat and shrugged it on. He buttoned it up and then put on the coat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh!\" said Melinda, giving her son a hug and a kiss. She ruffled his longish blond hair. \"Doesn't he look ah-doooooorable!?\" <br>\r\n\"Cute as a button!\" said Adrian, who was examining his own, jet-black, ghostly suit in the reflection of his cigarette-case. <br>\r\n\"I always said you were born classically handsome,\" said Melinda, \"You look great in a suit, honey.\"<br>\r\n\"Moooom!\" Skander grumbled as his mother ruffled up his hair again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kissed him. \"All done!\"<br>\r\n\"Not yet,\" said Adrian. He picked something out of his coat pocket. \"You didn't bring this with you. I found it on your desk just before we left home.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was holding the watch he'd given to Skander. The antique gold timepiece twinkled in the sunlight streaming in through the cabin's windows.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I can't wear that!\" said Skander. \"It's...too valuable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian blew a raspberry, \"This watch and its spiritual counterpart,\" he said, looking at the duplicate chain on his ghostly body, \"Is the most expensive and valuable thing I own! And you will wear it!\" <br>\r\n\"But!...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Skander could do anything, Adrian was already fastening the chain to the buttonhole on Skander's waistcoat. He put one half of the Double Albert chain into Skander's left pocket, along with the watch, and into Skander's right waistcoat pocket, he put the other length of chain, and the knife which Skander had clipped onto it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you bought a pocket-knife to go with the other end of my chain,\" said Adrian. \"Nice. Useful in today's society, I suppose. I always...\" he tugged out his own chain, \"Kept my match-safe on it. Well, come on!\" <br>\r\n\"Come on where?\" Skander asked. </span></div></div>",

Not even as a member of...ahme...our little club.\"<br>\r\n\"But what about press-photos?\" Jason asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost blew a raspberry, \"I'm a friggin' GHOST! I don't show up in photos! Not in photos no videos no mirrors no nothin'! That's cause I'm spirit with nothin' with it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian opened his cigarette case and tugged out a smoke.

Skander and Jason leaned on the railing of the bridge deck and stared out over the harbour. Somewhere, a foghorn blasted and a bell rung. Passengers on the boat deck waved to people down below, or to passengers on another ship. The wind blew Skander's hair around <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is terribly exciting,\" said Adrian, looking around at all the crowds of people and the fine weather. \"You know, this is only my second-ever voyage, living or dead? I've never really been on a boat before.\" <br>\r\n\"And I've never been on one with a ghost before,\" said Jason. <br>\r\n\"I guess you don't think much of ghosts on boats, do you?\" Adrian asked. <br>\r\n\"Nah. They're a nuisance. Just havin' 'em around's a nuisance!\" <br>\r\n\"Well I'll try not to be!\" said Adrian, and he headed off to mingle with the passengeres. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Theyr'e gonna be freaked as hell when they find out what he really is,\" Skander said, watching their ghostly friend head off into the crowds. <br>\r\n\"They're not gonna find out,\" said Jason. <br>\r\n\"Yeah I suppose no--hello lips, legs, tits and ass...\" <br>\r\n\"Oh you tease!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy and her brother walked up towards the two of them. \"I didn't know you and Jason were on this voyage, Skander,\" she said. <br>\r\n\"Just a...holiday...sorta,\" said Skander. <br>\r\n\"Oh I bet...\" she said. She slunk a little closer. Her brother made a face. \"I'll see you later, Stace,\" he said. <br>\r\n\"Sure...\" she said. Stacy gazed lustily upwards, leaning against Skander's taut, impressive body. \"Well, you are tall, aren't you?\" she cooed, her hand running through his hair. <br>\r\n\"I didn't mean to be,\" said Skander. He hugged her. Damn, she was hot. She had a beautiful, dark blonde head of hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two teenagers leapt apart as Adrian popped up between them. \"Lunch in...\" he tugged out his watch, \"...fifteen minutes, folks. Better get moving!\"<br>\r\n\"Will you eat with us?\" Skander asked. <br>\r\n\"Oh I'd love to!\" said Stacy, \"We're here with our parents and a friend of mine named Tina. I pointed you out at school,\" she said, looking at Jason. She winked. \"She thinks you're cute!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason punched a fist into his palm. \"Hey, the J-man's always cute,\" he said. \"When was I not?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian laughed and, if nobody had been watching, would've flipped over the railing into the water. \"Shut uuuup Jason!

Skander smiled, \"Sure,\" he said. \"Oh there's Tina!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina was a short girl with black, flowing hair and brown eyes.

He left the girls and walked over to his friends, \"Guys, what's up?\"<br>\r\n\"This freak wants to possess me so that he can eat food or taste it or whatever!\" said Jason, pointing at Adrian. <br>\r\n\"Give the guy a break! We're on holiday,\" said Skander. <br>\r\n\"I won't be doing anything else,\" said Adrian. But when he saw Jason's expression, he sighed. \"Oh fine! I'll just provide the bloody conversation then! Though by the looks of it all, you've got that all covered anyway!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you two stop fighting!? For heaven's sake...\" Skander said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed. \"I'm sorry Adrian, it's just...weird!\" <br>\r\n\"Never mind, never mind,\" the ghost said. \"I'm gonna see what else I can do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone sat down at the table. It was a large one and when they were all seated, there was nearly a dozen people there. It was noisy but nobody cared. Adrian picked up a jug of lemonade and started filling everyone's glasses for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you drinking?\" Stacy's brother Marsden asked. <br>\r\n\"I don't drink,\" said Adrian. <br>\r\n\"This is lemonade, not whiskey.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't...drink.\" <br>\r\n\"Adrian's...\" Stacy began, but Skander shot her a look. <br>\r\n\"...um, Adrian's already had a fair bit to drink, you know, it's been warm lately and...I guess he's just had enough.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander nodded to Stacy, just out of her brother's line of sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all, it was a pleasant meal and by the end of it, everyone was full and feeling lazy. They strolled over to the windows of the dining-room to stare out onto the ocean when someone shouted...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stryker?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander turned around. It was Michael, the newspaper reporter! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikey,\" said Skander. \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n\"Covering the voyage, writing up a series of articles on sea-travel,\" said the reporter. \"What a view, huh? Where's your friends?\" <br>\r\n\"They're here somewhere,\" said Skander. <br>\r\n\"Don't know why you're taking a ship, you can fly and do all kinds of stuff. If everyone ad your abilities Stryke, the transport industry would go bust!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stryke?\" someone shouted, \"Did he say 'Stryker'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh...\" Skander said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a whole crowd of people surrounded him. Jason stepped up and suddenly, he too was mobbed by people asking for photographs and autographs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it! They're on the ship!\"<br>\r\n\"Why? They can fly!\"<br>\r\n\"Probably just wanna do it the old-fashioned way.\"<br>\r\n\"Aww man he's got a cute ass!\"<br>\r\n\"Lucy!\"<br>\r\n\"What? He does! An' that front ain't bad either!\"<br>\r\n\"That's enough young lady!\"<br>\r\n\"Yes mom...Bye there bubble-butt...\"<br>\r\n\"LUCY!\"<br>\r\n\"Alright alright...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander waved the girl away and the crowd laughed. They continued to ask questions, chatting and chatting until Skander and Jason had to make excuses to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" said Jason, straightening out his suit and trying his best to wipe lipstick from his cheeks. \"What a mess!\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, get used to it brother, we're celebrities now...\" said Skander. \"Hey baby!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy sidled up to him, \"Hey...Me and Tina are going out for the dance in the main lobby tonight. You guys wanna come?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" said Skander. \"Who else is coming?\"<br>\r\n\"Mom and dad are dancing together,\" said Stacy. \"Marsden hates dancing, he's going to the disco with some goofballs he met somewhere else on the ship. What about your folks, Jason?\"<br>\r\n\"I think they're trying to salvage some of their 'second honeymoon' idea thingo and have dinner alone,\" said Jason. \"Hey Skander, who's your mom gonna dance with? She doesn't have a partner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure she'll find someone,\" said Skander. \"Come on, I wanna see some other stuff...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Five large mirror-balls hung from the celing and slowly turned, spraying yellow, blue, red, green and white light all over the place. At one end of the hall, a large jazz-orchestra was preparing for the first dance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, everyone, and welcome to the first dance of the first night of our voyage!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turned to the center of the room where a man in a white suit was holding a microphone. \"I am the head steward, and it's my duty and honour to welcome you all aboard the Queen Mary Two and to wish you all a wonderful time tonight. Bathrooms, if you need them, are behind the central staircase, snacks, drinks, finger-food and nibblies are all over along the sides there. Alright. Mr. Everland!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandleader bowed. \"Ladies and gentlemen, if you'll take to the floor.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" said Stacy, tugging on Skander's hand. \"I hope you can dance.\"<br>\r\n\"A bit,\" said Skander. \"I learnt in school.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina pulled Jason onto the floor. \"Come on Jase,\" she said. <br>\r\n\"I dunno, I...\"<br>\r\n\"Relax, I'll lead. My cousin's a dance-instructor. If he can teach me, I sure as hell can teach...you!\" she said, and gave him a kiss. Jason grinned. \"Okay!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. and Mrs. Lancet stepped onto the floor along with Stacy's parents and the music started to play. The band opened with \"Moonlight Serenade\", a slow, waltzy, dreamy jazz-piece. The lights flashed and the couples swung, bobbed and turned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not bad,\" said Stacy, holding Skander a bit tighter. \"You really can dance!\"<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" said Skander, grinning.<br>\r\n\"Oh don't be so modest...Woah!\" she gasped as Skander tugged her closer. \"You're the boss,\" he said, grinning down at her. <br>\r\n\"Oh you teaser...\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong, Mrs. Jones?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelinda was sitting in a chair on the sidelines, watching everyone dance.

I was a very good dancer in my day. The music may have changed a bit, but I reckon I still have all the...moves!\" he said, and he cut a sharp twirl and threw out his hand again and grabbed her, tugging her to her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, Adrian, I can't...I...everyone will see you...\"<br>\r\n\"Everyone CAN see me. I don't care. I haven't gone to a proper ball since 1916! Besides, I loooove to dance.\"<br>\r\n\"Well you're certainly dressed right!\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you, ma'am, a gentleman is always dressed right for every occasion. Now if you'll let me take the lead, the music waits!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh alright,\" she said, and got to her feet. \"Lead on Ghostmeo.\" <br>\r\n\"That sounds like a really bad joke,\" said Adrian as he led her out onto the dance-floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelinda laughed, \"I've made worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started to waltz.

He flicked his cigarette out into the ocean. \"I think I'll go spook that cute redhead on the deck below us\".<br>\r\n\"Well don't cause too much disaster,\" said Skander. <br>\r\n\"I'll be fine!\" said the ghost, slipping through the floor. \"Whooo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show-off,\" said Skander. He headed back to his cabin. This had been a real interesting voyage so far. So far, he'd met a lady friend, found a partner for Jason and had discovered that Adrian could dance like a god. Skander was in awe of the ghostly boy. There was certainly a lot there to admire and Skander was glad that he'd discovered his secret ability to communicate with the dead. </span></div></div>",

Come on!\"<br>\r\n\"Now boys, you make sure nobody sees you now, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian floated over to Skander, \"Can you become invisible yet?\"<br>\r\n\"Huh?...I dunno, I never...I don't even...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian dived into Skander's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!

No come on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander teleported. He landed on the bridge-deck and headed into the wheelhouse. They could see officers and lookouts keeping an eye on the ship's speed and heading. Water splashed around and dribbled down the windscreens and the wind blew around outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so unlike the Titanic,\" said Adrian, \"Can you imagine what would happen if this ship went down?\" <br>\r\n\"Shuttup, you'll jinx it,\" Skander said. <br>\r\n\"I'm a ghost, that's what I do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA door behind them opened and closed. A man in his fifties came into the wheelhouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's our speed?\"<br>\r\n\"Ordinary cruising speed, sir,\" said the helmsman. <br>\r\n\"\"We need to ride out this bloody storm! Full speed ahead!\"<br>\r\n\"Aye sir! It's not that bad, though.\"<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, but I want to get out of here and on to New York before it does!\"<br>\r\n\"Yes sir! Full speed ahead!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis last direction was shouted at another man, who started pressing buttons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All ahead full, sir,\" he shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain nodded, \"Good, good...Looks like the rain's slackening. Anything on the radar?\"<br>\r\n\"No sir. No ships, just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship gave a sudden jerk and threw everyone forward! Some people fell to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?\" the captain shouted. <br>\r\n\"A wave, sir?\" one of the officers asked.<br>\r\n\"That was no bloody wave! Felt like a rock or a reef or something! Where are the charts?\"<br>\r\n\"Over here, sir!\" one of the men said. He opened a cabinet and ran his finger through a series of papers. He pulled out a map and handed it to the captain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's our position?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe position was given and the captain checked it on the chart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it...\" he said, looking at the chart. \"Nothing here! Another chart!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother, larger-scaled chart was brought. Still nothing marked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be an uncharted reef or something,\" said one of the officers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be,\" said the captain, \"Go down below, and see how badly she's damaged, will you?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Skandyboy,\" said Adrian. \"Let's go look.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeleporting, both the boy and the ghost went right down below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what's down this far?\" Skander asked. <br>\r\n\"Just engines, I think,\" Adrian shouted. They had arrived. Searching around the engine-rooms, they heard the sound of water. They ran towards it. By the light of the flourescent lamps overhead, they saw the damage. A hole, perhaps twelve feet wide and eighteen long had been ripped savagely through the hull of the ship. Water was rushing in from below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jesus,\" said Skander. <br>\r\n\"You're super-strong, can't you bend the metal back into place?\" Adrian asked over the sound of the water rushing in. <br>\r\n\"I...I don't think I can,\" said Skander, \"All the metal's been ripped away from the outside as well as the inside, I'll only be able to close up a tiny bit! Come on, we better get up on deck!\" </span></div></div>",

He grabbed the slippery hull of the ocean-liner and pushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, the ship moved almost at once! It was like carrying a pillow! Grabbing the ship as firmly as he could, Skander pushed! The ship rose off the rock. Skander stood on the rock. It was just out of the water at its highest point. Skander continued to push and lift. People in the lifeboats screamed and pointed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian, splashing around in the water, tying together lifelines on the boats, turned around to see a blonde muscle-teen in what looked like a black and red wetsuit, lifting the ocean-liner on his shoulder like an empty laundry-basket! Carefully, Skander took a step forward. The water splashed, but his footing remained firm. Slowly, he started walking. Water rushed and gurgled out of the hole at the bottom of the ship. Adrian watched as it hit the water and solidified into a road of ice! Skander kept walking, slipping, sliding...then he had an idea. Bending forwards a bit, he started skating and sliding across the ice, like what a child might do with slippery woollen socks on a freshly-polished floor! This was cool! This was easy, this was fun! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason appeared beside Skander. \"What do you want me to do!?\" he shouted. <br>\r\n\"Get the lifeboats, you and Adrian.

Adrian and Jason swam alongside him at top speed, pulling the flotilla of lifeboats along behind them. As if nothing had gone wrong, life onboard ship resumed. Occasionally, people came down below to examine the hole in the ship's hull, and to stick their heads out and wave at Skander underneath the ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA forghorn sounded, a bell rang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking, welcome to New York City! Please proceed to your cabins and ensure that your valuables and luggage are secured for exiting the vessel. Thank you\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahoy there young Skander!\" the captain shouted a few minutes later, sticking his head out the hole at the bottom of the ship, \"Good work! Listen, when we reach the harbour, I want you to put the ship in the drydock! It should be somewhere to your right, a big, open place with sluice-gates!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander nodded. He kept on sliding along the ice. Then he saw it ahead of them. Manhattan island! He slid into the harbour. All around the shoreline and on boats and ships, people waved and screamed and fired smoke-rockets. The crowd gasped as the muscle-teen soared into the air, holding the ship easily on his shoulders. Carefully, he lowered himself down into the drydock and let the ship down as carefully as he could on the cradles behind the closed sluice-gates. He climbed out and jumped onto the jetty. Officers started opening doors and policemen, paramedics and dock-workers ran forwards with gangplanks and stretchers to help people off the ship. Out in the harbour, Jason and Adrian pulled their lifeboats up to empty jetties and tied the ropes off. More people showed up with ladders to throw over the sides of the jetties. People started climbing up, glad to be on dry land again. Jason shook the water off his body and went to find Skander. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who ever thought that the dead would come to the aid of the living, huh?\" one lady said to another as they watched Adrian helping people out of the boats onto the jetty. They stared at Adrian, impeccably neat and handsome in his suit and neatly combed, brown hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey boys!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander, Jason and Adrian, who had gathered around the saved ocean-liner, turned around to see Mike the journalist, with a camera. \"Come on! Group-photo! Group photo! Where's the captain!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian stood in the middle, with Skander on one side and Jason on the other. Behind them was the captain, and all around them, were the ship's officers. Behind the group was the massive structure of the ocean-liner Skander had so easily saved from the ocean's depths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameras flashed as they took their photos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is great,\" said Adrian, smiling at his friends. <br>\r\n\"Do ghosts show up in photographs?\" Skander asked.<br>\r\n\"We can when we want to,\" said Adrian, he smiled. </span></div></div>",

He turned to Skander, and grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelinda had just put down the phone in their hotel-rooms in New York's 'Plaza' hotel, the mayor wanted to present all three boys medals for bravery and acts of heroism. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how much more of this I can take,\" said Jason. He pointed to the newspapers on the coffee-table beside them. From every single front page, they could see the photograph that Michael had taken of them down at the docks a week before when they brought the famous Queen Mary Two and her passengers safely into harbour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're famous now, son!\" said Mr. Lancet, \"This evening, you'll be at the awards ceremony!...Dress up good, now\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We better start dressing now, then\" said Melinda, \"Skander, you can put on your suit,\" she turned to Mr. and Mrs. Lancet, \"If you don't mind...?\" she asked, pointing towards the door. <br>\r\n\"Not at all, Melinda,\" said Mrs. Lancet, \"We'll leave you in peace with the boys!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelinda fussed over Jason and Skander while Mr. and Mrs. Lancet went to their own room to change into something more appropriate for an awards-giving. Skander tugged on his coat and Adrian put his watch back onto Skander's waistcoat and the ring back onto Jason's right pinkie-finger. Melinda tugged and tousled their hair, trying to get it to stay just right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And honey, do something about that hair of yours,\" said Melinda, rubbing Skander's face and feeling his stubble. <br>\r\n\"What? I like my stubble,\" said Skander, running a hand around his chin, \"It feels good. Makes me look sexy\". <br>\r\n\"Honey, we're going to an awards ceremony, not a frat-party,\" she said, \"I want you to look PRESENTABLE! Now unfortunately, we don't have a razor...\" <br>\r\n\"I'll sort it out,\" said Adrian. \"You leave it to me, come on, boys, into the bathroom!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelinda laughed as Adrian herded the two teens into the bathroom. He slammed the door and locked it after him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait here, I'll be right back!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where's he gone?\" Jason asked.<br>\r\n\"No idea,\" said Skander. He sat down on a chair inside the bathroom while Jason sat on the edge of the bath. A few seconds later, and Adrian reappeared in the bathroom, holding a towel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, who's first?\" he asked. <br>\r\n\"Um...I'll do it,\" said Jason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" said Adrian. \"Skander, move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander got off the chair and pushed it up against the sink. Jason sat in the chair and leaned his head back against the edge of the sink. Adrian whistled while he opened the towel he had with him. He pulled out a brush and a jar and a small bowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's all that stuff?\" Skander asked.<br>\r\n\"I borrowed it from the hotel barbershop,\" said Adrian. He was lathering up the shaving-soap now. \"Hold still, Jason, and try not to move...\" he said, and started lathering up Jason's face with the shaving-brush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...\" said the ghost, putting the brush, bowl and cream aside. \"Time for a nice...neat...close...shaaaave!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost picked something up wth his left hand. For a moment, Skander thought it was a comb, but the ghost flipped the contraption open to reveal a long, sharp blade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...what the hell is that? A machete?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"This, young man, is called a straight-razor,\" said Adrian, holding it in his hands and melting into the sink behind Jason. \"It's what I used to use to shave with\". <br>\r\n\"What did you...?\" Jason asked. Then he saw the blade. <br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING!?\" he screamed, jerking upwards in shock. \"Get that thing awaaaaay from me!\"<br>\r\n\"Jason, don't make this harder than it has to be,\" said Adrian, \"I know how to use one of these things, don't freak out.\"<br>\r\n\"Freak out!? I'll show you freaked out if you bring that hatchet near me!\" <br>\r\n\"I don't have TIME for this!\" the ghost snapped. He dived into Jason's body. Jason's left hand held the razor. Standing in front of the mirror, Adrian started moving Jason's hands, stretching the skin and scraping delicately and methodically with the razor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn that looks scary...\" said Skander, watching Adrian work. <br>\r\n\"It's not, really,\" said Adrian, \"It's actually kinda fun, shaving like this\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was whimpering, his face trembling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop moving you big wuss!\" said Adrian, \"What are you scared about? I ain't gonna cut yah!...Skander, lather yourself up, I'm nearly done here\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander picked up the bowl and started spreading lather over his face, as he'd seen Adrian do. It felt sorta weird. Soft and cool and smooth. When he was done, the entire bottom half of his face was smothered in cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian popped out of Jason's body. \"All done!\" he said. Jason didn't move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, all done!\" said the ghost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason still refused to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you, deaf? I said MOVE IT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Jason looked up, he looked terrified! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K...k...k-keep that...that thing away from me, you psycho!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian looked at the razor, which he'd just finished cleaning on a towel. \"Oh relax,\" he said, \"Now move!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason got off the chair and Skander replaced him. Jason felt his chin and face. So smooth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Softie,\" said Adrian, \"Now Skander,\" he said, waving the lethally-sharp razor in front of his friend's eyes, \"You gonna squirm around like Jason there, or you gonna be a good little boy?\"<br>\r\n\"I'll be good,\" said Skander. <br>\r\n\"Excellent...chin up, mouth closed, don't move\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander felt Adrian get to work. The blade was cold, metallic and VERY sharp. Skander was nervous. He knew he couldn't be cut or sliced or stabbed, but he still felt nervous. He'd never had anyone try to shave him with what amounted to a miniature hunting-knife before. Despite the fear, it actually felt kinda good. Adrian shaved away, pulling, stretching, scraping and wiping, whistling as he worked. When he was done, he patted Skander on the cheek, \"Get up big man, all finished!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander didn't move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said get up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill no movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong?\" Jason asked, walking over, carefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Adrian examined Skander carefully. \"He's asleep!...I SAID WAKE UP YOU BIG LUMP!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander jerked suddenly awake, the chair slipped and he crashed to the ground in a heap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" said Adrian, cleaning the razor and folding it up. \"I'm gonna take this stuff back to the barbershop, I'll see you guys later\". </span></div></div>",

Skander blew, thinking of fire. the flames shot out his mouth, racing through the air and lighting up the wicks on the top of the candles. Everyone on the table clapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you two really ARE the hottest guys in the world,\" said Tina, giggling and giving Jason a kiss. \"And still cute!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen dragon-breath, how about you stop showing off and do something constructive?\" said Adrian, he threw the two baskets of bread in Skander and Jason's directions, \"Toast the bread for us!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander grinned and speared a roll on the end of a fork, \"Sure thing, buddy\", he said. </span></div></div>",

The waiters and other diners watched this performance with shock and amazement. Two, incredibly handsome teenagers and their equally hot girls and their parents, watching the boys spit fire out of their mouths just as easily as sticking out their tongues. When they'd finished, Skander stood up and took a deep breath. He blew, hard! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fireball shot out of his mouth and people ducked! It filled the entire room and turned everything a dazzling, yellow-golden colour. The fireball was hot and very bright. Eventually, it went out. The crowd clapped and cheered and Skander bowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stryker?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA boy about ten came scuttling over. He was holding a pen and a laminated photograph. It was the one taken of him and Jason and the crew of the ship after they saved it. \"Mommy and I were on the boat when you picked it up,\" the boy said, \"Can you sign it for me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy turned it over, to show a smooth, paper area where Skander could sign. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" said Skander, \"What's your name?\"<br>\r\n\"Julian\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander tapped the biro on the back of the photo... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"To Julian &amp; Family, From...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd under this, he signed \"Stryker\".

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Some people are born celebrities. Some aspire to celebrities. Some are sudden celebrities. Skander and Jason found themselves in this last category. They had no idea that, in the time it took them to get back to California by train, just how far afield their legend had spread. Skander had typed \"Trident Force\" into Google one afternoon and found at least half a dozen fansites or forums that had been created in a matter of hours after their heroic rescue of the ocean-liner. There were photographs and videos pasted, posted, uploaded and shared all over the electronic cyberspace. Skander flipped through discussion-threads, blogs, vlogs and opinion-polls, everything from \"What powers will they have next?\" to \"Who's Hotter?\" Some of the posts really made him smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander decided it was pretty hard for him and Jason to hide who they really were from the world now, but they dressed as normally and casually as they could, to blend in as best as possible with the population, sporting white T-shirts, jeans, sneakers and zip-up jackets so that they looked like most other teenagers their age. Skander did up his hair in the usual way and, with Jason and Adrian, they teleported off to school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though they were early, they were not prepared for what they saw once they got there. The school corridors were crowded with boys and girls ranging from thirteen up to eighteen. They were huddled in groups all over the place, staring at...something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Skander asked, looking at Adrian. The ghost, in his invisible form, floated up towards the ceiling. His face broke into a grin. \"It's your poster!\" he said. <br>\r\n\"Poster?\" Jason asked, \"We didn't do any posters...did we?\" he asked, looking at Skander. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd thinned a bit and Skander stepped forward. He gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poster was about three or four feet long and about two feet wide and it was pasted up above a drinking-fountain between two blocks of book-lockers. It was bright blue near the top, descending to navy blue and then black at the bottom. Standing in the middle of the poster was an illustration of a young man with dark brown hair, wearing an old-fashioned suit and black shoes. One leg was straight, the other was bent at the knee, because his left foot was on tip-toe, with the heel of the shoe resting on the inner ankle of the right foot. Either side of the man was a teenaged boy, wearing a black lycra costume with red gloves and red boots. Two yellow, vaguely \"S\"-shaped lightning-bolts were slashed across the chest of one of the boys, and two crossed daggers were emblazoned across the chest of the other boy. Skander stared up and recognised each of their faces at once. He looked up a bit further to see, in big red letters: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>\"TRIDENT FORCE\"</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd underneath it: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>\"Everyone's Favourite Super-Teens\"</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander grinned. He looked down a bit more. Above each of their heads were their names and short descriptions:  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"STRYKER\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strong, blonde and dashingly handsome, Stryker is the muscles of the group, willing take on the humanly impossible for the protection and salvation of Mankind. His strength knows no bounds and his heart no limit of incredible courage and fearlessness in the face of adversity. Known for his godlike and incredible features and handsome appearance, he's as dangerous as he is fun to look at. Stryker holds the lion's share of Trident Force's powers, which are all at once numerous, fantastic, deadly and awe-inspiring. His constant experimentation and discovery of new powers means that Trident Force will continue to grow more and more powerful, to allow them overall to provide greater service and aid to the people of earth, be it from criminals and crimes, or to major world-disasters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THE BLADE\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Firm but kind, The Blade is as keen and sharp as his name implies, able to detect and combat evil, danger and threats to society with ease. Known for his dark, handsome features and firm, bulky frame, the Blade works to preserve peace and harmony and to save people in distress. More vocal than Stryker, Blade has provided the press and the public with plenty of details regarding their incredible missions and services to mankind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THE SHADOW\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one who sees all but who himself is almost never seen, The Shadow is the mystical and mysterious member of this trio of heroes. Preferring to keep to himself and to work in the background of the group's operations, he is nonetheless a valuable and fascinating addition to the team. Many believe him to be truly supernatural or spiritual in being. While this has been rebuffed by paranormal skeptics, it is hard to deny the facts. Those lucky enough to meet the elusive third member have described him as handsome, tall, well-dressed and with a classic, old-world charm. A gentleman with manners, ethics, morals and above all, a desire to aid those whom he finds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether, they are Trident Force, a group of teenage wonders who have dedicated their lives, young as they are, to the assistance, protection and wellbeing of mankind. Always everywhere and always on alert.</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander grinned. This was awesome. This was COOL! He kept staring at the poster. The artist really drew them up great, he thought. A girl screamed and pointed. Everyone stared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA white-out pen was hovering in mid-air in front of the poster. It pressed its tip against the bottom of the poster, just underneath Adrian's portrait. The group of excited teens watched as the pen flashed across the paper, leaving a trail of white paint behind. 'The Shadow'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always wanted to sign something with my face on it,\" said Adrian, whispering in Skander's ear. Skander grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One of the girls bent down to pick it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What WAS that?\" one of the boys said, loudly. <br>\r\n\"I bet it was a ghost,\" said one of the girls, grinning. <br>\r\n\"Maybe it was THE ghost?\" said a redhead, pointing up at Adrian's portrait, \"Perhaps it was HIM?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all looked at each other and laughed...and yet...why not? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys,\" said Skander, sticking his head through the crowd to the front where he could see the poster clearly for the first time. Everyone smiled and grinned at him. <br>\r\n\"Skander, my man,\" said Lance, one of Skander's friends; his voice faltered. \"What...happened to you?\"<br>\r\n\"What about me?\" Skander asked. <br>\r\n\"Dude...you're buffed!...Like...majorly! Have you been working out or something?\"<br>\r\n\"Sorta...\" said Skander, \"A...a bit of um...weight-lifiting\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls oogled at his arms and chest and drooled from lust. Boys oogled and drooled from jealousy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" said Lance, \"Duuuuude...You are a freakin' TANK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason pushed his way through the crowd, \"Hey guys, what's going on here?\" he asked. <br>\r\n\"Just checkin' out Skander's new build, J-man,\" said Lance, \"And...holy crap what have you been eating!?\"<br>\r\n\"What?\" said Jason, feeling his face for pimples or zits. <br>\r\n\"WHAT!? Look at you guys! You're totally ripped!\"<br>\r\nSkander laughed, \"I dunno, are we? What do you think Jase?\" <br>\r\nJason shrugged a broad, firm shoulder. \"I dunno...I don't feel any different\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" said one of the girls, \"You look a LOT like those guys in the poster\", she indicated the \"TRIDENT FORCE\" poster above their heads. Skander looked up and grinned, \"Yeah I suppose...that's what everyone's been saying,\" he replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you?\" one of the boys asked. Jason and Skander's heads snapped around to face him, \"WHAT?\" they both said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother boy stared up at the poster, then turned to look at Skander and Jason...then back up at the poster...then at the two huge teens in front of him. His mouth opened in slack-jawed amazement. <br>\r\n\"No...No freakin' way...\" the boy mouthed.<br>\r\n\"What?\" everyone shouted, turning to him. <br>\r\n\"IT IS THEM! LOOK!\" he shouted. He pushed Skander and Jason aganst the wall, underneath their respective, artistic selves. \"Look!\" <br>\r\nThe crowd gasped. Jason laughed and Skander grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God...\" said Skander. \"...I...Hah!...I...I guess the...the game's up then, huh Blade?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...mygod!\" said one of the girls, \"It IS them! Woah this is like...woah...\"<br>\r\n\"No way...\" said Lance, staring at his two friends, and then up at the poster, \"No...waaaaaaaay!...\"; but he could see that it was true. He stood there in shocked silence for a minute. And then...<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute!\" he said, \"Where's the other dude? I thought there was three of you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander stared at Lance. Lance wasn't quite as tall as Skander, but he was well-built and tough. He didn't look like the kinda teenager who was easily scared. He had a rich, dark tan from working-out outside in the sun and his once brown hair had been leeched of its colour so much that it was a sort of brown-blonde mix now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a joke!\" said one of the other guys, \"They can't be Stryker and Blade! It's too much of a coincidence! What, they just HAPPEN to go to the SAME SCHOOL as we do? Hah! Yeah right. And if they really ARE here, where's the other dude!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\"Muahahahahahahahaha!!!...\"</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laugh was loud, deafening! CHILLING! Everyone flinched and trembled and stared around, trying to locate the source of the laugh. It sounded totally badass and wicked. The classic evil mastermind cackle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that!?\" the boy stammered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\"...Who knows what evil, lurks in the hearts of men?...Muahahahaha...THE SHADOW KNOWS! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!\"</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus they are real!\" one of the boys said, he was panicking now. Someone shouted and pointed, the crowd, whose collective heads had been swivelling all over the place like lighthouse lamps, snapped back to the poster that they had originally come to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look!\" one of the girls shouted, \"Up there! The poster's moving!\" <br>\r\n\"It can't be moving, it's glued to the freakin' wall!\" said the boy beside her. <br>\r\n\"But look!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd of teenagers stared up. The figure in the middle of the poster looked a bit more solid and lifelike. Suddenly, everyone screamed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian stepped calmly out of the poster just as calmly as if he was entering another room in his own house. He hopped down onto the floor and stood himself squarely between his two incredible friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...My...GOD!\" one of the girls whispered. \"IT IS THEM!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud jangling echoed around the room. It was time for class... </span></div></div>",

Everywhere Skander and Jason went, they were mugged by dozens of students, begging for photographs, auotographs, inscriptions and...in the case of the girls, a chance for a fondle. Skander finished his in-class English-paper and signed his name down the bottom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Skander Kenneth Jones.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe read it over and folded it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You misspelt 'Nevada'\", Adrian whispered in his ear, \"One 'E', two 'A's\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander opened his paper, rewrote the word, folded up his work again and handed it in to the teacher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work, Skander,\" said his English teacher, \"You can leave for lunch early\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Skander. He picked up his books and headed out of the classroom. Jason, who had finished before him, was sitting in the cafeteria, waiting for lunch to start officially. Both boys were hungry and excited, filled with the thrill of being celebrities. And their schoolfriends, in fact, everyone in school, was thrilled at the thought of two teenage gods walking among them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang. At once, the school burst into life and boys and girls ran this way and that, throwing open lockers, shoving in books and then stampeding towards the cafeteria. Skander and Jason were sitting in the middle of the room at a table for eight people. Lance saw them first, and raced over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maaaan!\" he said, sitting down next to Skander, \"This is so cool! I can't believe I know a CELEBRITY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander grinned, \"No I'm not...\"<br>\r\n\"DUDE YOU COULD WHUP MY ASS AND SAVE IT AT THE SAME FRIGGIN' TIME!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander laughed, \"Yeah probably...go get your lunch man, I'll watch your seat\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance raced over to the serving-line and came sprinting back a few minutes later. The table was jammed with twice the usual number of students, who all wanted to meet their local superheroes. The food they had taken from the serving-area lay largely forgotten on their trays while they fired questions at the two boys like verbal machine-guns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much can you lift?\"<br>\r\n\"Can you really set things on fire by looking at them?\"<br>\r\n\"That ghost dude can fly, what about you?\"<br>\r\n\"Can you turn invisible?\"<br>\r\n\"How fast can you run?\" <br>\r\n\"Can you throw me into the AIR?\"<br>\r\n\"How strong are you!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys!\" said Jason, holding up his hands, \"Please! One at a time, one at a time!...Okay...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was, perhaps, five seconds' pause, and then... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Can you really shoot pulse-beams from your hands?\"<br>\r\n\"Can you breathe fire?\"<br>\r\n\"Do you have X-ray vision?\"<br>\r\n\"Can you really make things float!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander leaned back, took a deep breath and blew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive fireball shot up into the air and everyone yelped in fright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE!\" he shouted, \"ONE...AT...A...TIME!...Yes, we can breathe fire, yes we can make things levitate, and yes, we can fly like that 'ghost-dude'. And make sure he never hears you say that, he hates it when people call him that\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show us what you can do!\" one of the girls said. \"Everything!\" </span></div></div>",

Skander grabbed Jason and held him up easily in one hand. He threw him into the air. Jason screamed and whooped as he shot upwards. The crowd watched him fly up into the sky, then come down again. An inch from the ground, he did a barrel-roll and shot up again. Firing plasma beams from his hands, he destroyed a rubbish-bin landed again. The boys uprooted trees and replanted them, they snapped steel bars like toothpicks, stayed underwater in the school swimming-pool, to demonstrate breathing under water, and then walking ON water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, where's that ghost-dude?\" Lance asked as the girls crowded around Skander's body, eager to dry him off with towels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a name,\" said Adrian, strolling down the stairs into the pool-area.

The ghost jumped down again, flying through the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you do that echo-voice thing?\" one of the boys asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Voice projection?\" Adrian asked, \"It's a vocal skill.

They strolled into the commissioner's office and sat down...or, in Adrian's case, hovered in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah you made it, gentlemen,\" said Weston. \"I'll make this as brief as I can, the son of a hotel tycoon has been kidnapped\". <br>\r\n\"Oh?\" said Adrian. He lit a cigarette and started smoking. \"What's his name?\" <br>\r\n\"Jasper Horowitz,\" said Weston, \"He's the son of...\"<br>\r\n\"Mr. Arthur Horowitz, owner of Horowitz Hotels,\" said Adrian. \"I know who he is. Wealthy type. Old money. Been in business since my time. What about young Jasper?\" <br>\r\n\"Weeell...\" said the commissioner, getting up from his desk, \"He's been kidnapped, like I said. We have recieved a ransom-note and frankly, it's...not good\". <br>\r\n\"How old is Jasper?\" Skander asked.<br>\r\n\"Eighteen,\" said Weston. \"Popular, well-liked, attractive. He's an athlete and a good student in university. Hopes to carry on the family business when he grows up. Steady boy. Likes to splash his cash around a bit too freely. So these goons nabbed him, figured if they squeezed him enough, the old man would start splashing some cash to bail the kid out\". <br>\r\n\"And?\" Jason asked.<br>\r\n\"Well there's the problem,\" said Weston, \"We don't know where to send it to. They've asked for...\" the commissioner picked up a piece of paper on his desk, \"...Ten million dollars\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander swore. Weston looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" said Skander. \"HOW MUCH?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeston repeated the number. \"They say if the money isn't paid by the end of the week, they'll kill the boy. Torture him. I don't know if they really mean it, but that note was sent two days ago, and we don't know what condition Jasper is in...OR, where to deliver the money.

He sat back in his chair and started staring around the room. First at the desk, tables, chair, filing-cabinet, then at the water-cooler. He kept staring at the cooler, looking at the water gurgling and sloshing and bubbling inside it. He blinked and rubbed his eyes...He turned back around to look elsewhere in the room. He blinked again. He saw something. What? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned back to the desk and looked at it. There was something wierd about it. It was like Skander was looking through a dirty window. He could see vaguely through the wood! He strained his eyes, rubbed them, wiped them...he opened them again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he could stare right through the desk! Skander looked upwards. He could see through walls! Doors! Even people! What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So that's what you have to do,\" said Weston. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" said Jason. \"Come on, Stryker\". </span></div></div>",

The ghost vanished. The boys waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnseen and seeing all, The Shadow wafted around the building, sliding in and out of rooms and checking every cavity he could find. He was on the top floor when he found them in a back room. Two men and a teenage boy. The boy was tied by his arms and legs to an old bed. Adrian looked at the two men, who were playing cards. The boy was awake, but gagged. Adrian headed back to the yard behind the apartment building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Top floor, back room,\" he said. \"Let's go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeleporting into the building and landing just outside the door, Skander raised his fist. Then he paused. \"Let's creep them out a bit, first\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Hehehahahahahahahaha!!...Who knows what evil...LURKS...in the hearts of men!? Hehehehahahahahaha!

Okay Shadow! How about you show us what you can do!? Big show-off...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian grinned at Skander and vanished. Watching through the wall, both boys clapped hands to their mouths to try and stop themselves from laughing as the two kidnappers were hauled into the air and thrown back down onto the ground! A wind whipped up inside the room, blowing dust and cards and loose clothes everywhere. The table and chairs rose into the air and were flung down, smashing to pieces on the floor! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander and Jason kicked the door down and rushed in. Grabbing both men and knocking them out, easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blade, get these guys outta here,\" said Skander, \"Shadow, show yourself!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding them as easily as tissuepaper, Jason left the room, dragging the two, dazed and beaten men behind him in one hand. Adrian showed himself, sitting on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper Horowitz went insane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe screamed and thrashed in his bed, jerking, twitching and throwing his body around, trying to break the bonds. Skander ripped the bed apart and burned through the ropes with his eyes. He helped the older boy up and threw his clothes on him, which were stuffed into a chest of drawers. The older teen stared at Adrian in terror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, him?\" said Skander, \"Relax, he's not here to hurt you. Now get dressed!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper tugged on his clothes and stood up. He was tall for his age, his appearance reflected his wealth. Perfectly smooth skin, no blemishes, hands manicured to within an inch of their lives, hs hair would once have been a perfectly arranged classic style, each and every brown strand held firmly in-place by hair-gel. His teeth were straighter than ramrods and more even than a spirit-level and just as white as pure cotton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...wow!\" he panted, \"Thanks!\" he gasped. <br>\r\n\"Come on,\" said Skander, he led Jasper out of the room. Jasper kept looking back at Adrian, who waved, and then vanished slowly into midair. <br>\r\n\"Who...?\" the rich-kid asked, but Skander just grinned. \"A friend of mine\". <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He turned to Skander and Jason and Adrian, \"I can't thank you boys enough for what you've done. You saved my son's life\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander grinned and scraped his shoes across the hospital floor. \"Well...\" he said, and shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now don't be so modest,\" said Mr. Horowitz, \"I have something special for you\". He picked up the two briefcases he had with him. \"This was to be the ransom money\".<br>\r\n\"How much again?\" Jason asked.<br>\r\n\"Ten million in cash,\" said Horowitz. \"...I don't need the money and you boys worked hard. It's going back into my account and I'm writing all of you a cheque for three and a half million dollars each\". <br>\r\n\"No you're not,\" said Adrian, \"You're writing those two cheques for five million each. I don't need the money, what would I spend it on?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older man laughed, \"I suppose you're right,\" he said. \"Well...then that'll be it!\"<br>\r\n\"Five...No,\" said Skander, \"We can't!\"<br>\r\n\"Yes you can,\" said Mr. Horowitz, \"I insist! Take it...please! I can make more easily!\" <br>\r\n\"Well...\" said Jason, he looked at Skander. \"It's certainly...very generous...but...\"<br>\r\n\"I think we're being stupid,\" said Skander, \"We'll take it, Mr. Horowitz, and thanks for your reward\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe businessman smiled, \"Excellent,\" he said. He tugged a chequebook out of his pocket and filled out two slips, ripped them off and handed them to the two boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, if there's ANYTHING I can do to help you boys in the future, you let me know,\" he said. \"As a matter of fact, I have another idea\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?\" said Jason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man felt through his pocket and pulled out a key-card. He handed it to Skander. \"Take this and keep it\". <br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Skander asked, examining the card. <br>\r\n\"It's the keycard to one of the luxury suites at my hotel, top floor. It's got a view of the city you'll never have imagined! You guys and go there and use it whenever you like. No charge\". <br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" said Adrian, standing up, \"That's too much!\"<br>\r\n\"Not at all,\" said Mr. Horowitz, \"All the suites at the top are for special guests, and I think it'd be grand to have you boys staying in one of my hotels! And the original hotel, started by my grandfather!\"<br>\r\n\"I know,\" said Adrian, \"I saw it being built\". </span></div></div>",

Adrian floated along behind them, perfectly invisible to everyone but them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was cool!\" said Jason. \"Five million each!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Skander, \"Hey, at least he's alright, Jasper, I mean\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, totally...Hey Skander...who's those guys?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander stared ahead to see two large trucks parked in the street, and a large car in the driveway across the road from his house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They look like new neighbours,\" said Skander, \"But...what are they doing on MY lawn?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys picked up their pace and reached Skander's front yard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon,\" said Skander. \"Like it?\" <br>\r\n\"Afternoon,\" said a man. \"You live here?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Skander replied. He looked across the street, \"New in town, huh?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes,\" the man said, \"My name's Geoffrey, that's my wife Susan and my two sons, Reggie and Michael\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander looked at the two boys, they were probably a year or two younger than he was. \"Nice to meet you,\" Skander said. He shook hands. Jason introduced himself and the handshaking was repeated all over again. Skander looked at Reginald and Michael. They were tallish for their ages and had light brown hair and thin faces. Their father was taller and beefier, with darker brown hair. Susan was slimmer, younger and had blond hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" said Skander, looking at the house, \"What's your interest in this joint? You're moving in across the street from me, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Geoff. \"Just admiring the house. It's so old and beautiful\". <br>\r\n\"It's got most of the original furniture in it,\" said Skander. \"Are you from around here?\"<br>\r\n\"Used to be...a long time ago,\" said Geoff. \"I actually live in New Jersey, but well...we decided to move here instead. Go back to the family roots, you understand\".<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Skander. He stared at the two lorrys parked outside the house. \"Where are the guys who are meant to unload the stuff?\"<br>\r\n\"Not here yet, just the drivers,\" said Geoff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll help,\" said Jason. Skander nodded. And slowly, they lifted, carried and pushed everything inside. Between the two of them, both boys made a great pretence at lifting up a piano and putting it in the front room, when each boy could really carry a hundred pianos as eaily as a loaf of bread. Jason helped them unpack everything. He picked up a large, heavy book. It looked very old. He put it on the coffee-table in the living-room and then picked up another book, of the same size and style, but which looked to be of modern manufacture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah, my family bible,\" said Geoff, walking over. \"That's the original,\" he said, pointing to the older book, \"This is one I had made especially, so that we could continue recording family events\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason opened the cover of the older book. Drawn neatly with pen and ink on the front page was what looked like a tombstone, with black grass growing around the base. 'Carved' into the stone in loopy, neat cursive writing were the words: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b><i>\"Good Lord bless and preserve this book of records, tales of deeds and misdeeds carried out by the Family Stone\"</i></b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason blinked and looked at the page again. He turned more pages and kept reading. He found a family-tree. He scanned through it, until he found a familiar name... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSTONE, Master Adrian Jeremiah. <br>\r\nBorn: 15th June, 1898. <br>\r\nDied: 4th January, 1919. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way...\" he whispered. \"No...freakin'...way!\" </span></div></div>",

Melinda had invited the new neighbours over for dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pity your parents couldn't make it, Jason,\" said Melinda as she poured out water for everyone. <br>\r\n\"Oh they had to work late,\" said Jason. \"So uh...Geoffrey, you said you used to be from around here?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh not me personally,\" said Geoffrey, \"My family was. Waaaay waaaay back. Stone is my name. Geoffrey Adrian Stone\". <br>\r\n\"Adrian?\" Skander asked, looking up. <br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Geoffrey, \"That was what my grandfather insisted I have as my second name, so he told me once. In memory of another family member, his older brother. My grandfather was born in 1905, my father was born in 1940, I was born in 1973. Grandpa was still alive and he told me one day when I was born he insisted I took Adrian as a second name. To remember my great-uncle. In fact, that's one reason why we all decided to move back here. To find out more about him. He died young\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden breeze forced its way into the house, whipping up the curtains and making the chandelier shake and sway. The lights flickered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you shouldn't talk about death,\" said Skander. <br>\r\n\"Interesting thing is,\" said Geoffrey, \"According to what I've managed to dig up, this used to be my old family house\". <br>\r\n\"I'm not about to move,\" said Melinda. \"But one day, when Skander grows up I might move and I can give it to you\". <br>\r\n\"That's not gonna be for at least ten years,\" said Skander. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's talking about my little brother Nathaniel,\" Adrian whispered in Skander's ear during the meal. \"I was seven when he was born. God I miss him. Cute kid!\" <br>\r\n\"Nathaniel Stone?\" Skander asked.<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Geoffrey asked. <br>\r\n\"Oh nothing,\" said Skander. <br>\r\n\"Nathaniel Stone was my grandfather,\" said Geoffrey. He looked at the two teens, \"Now look at you two,\" he said, pointing to Skander and Jason with his knife, \"You boys must work out lots, huh?\" <br>\r\n\"Well...\" Skander said. <br>\r\n\"Just...weights,\" said Jason. \"You know...heavy stuff...\"<br>\r\n\"Like pianos?\" Susan asked, grinning. <br>\r\n\"Oh, pianos, cars, buses...ocean liners....\" said Jason, chuckling. \"Skander's been bench-pressing the QM2 for past couple of months\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander laughed, \"Stop exaggerating!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce dessert was finished, everyone sat around the living-room, chatting, shaking hands, asking questions and joking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you boys are going to the local highschool, right?\" Skander asked Reggie and Michael. <br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Michael. \"We're kinda...well...excited. We heard...stuff\".<br>\r\n\"Stuff?\" Jason asked. <br>\r\n\"You know those 'Trident Force' guys who saved that ship?\" Reggie asked. <br>\r\n\"I...might have heard of them...\" said Skander. <br>\r\n\"They say that they go there for school!

They chatted and joked and asked questions. The two newcomers couldn't help but notice the huge blue and black posters with \"TRIDENT FORCE\" on them, that seemed to be pasted on every available square inch of wall. The three figures stared down at them. Skander and Jason with red and black masks over their faces, and Adrian in his suit and tie, with a black fedora hat and black silk mask drawn on and around his head and face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I wish we could meet them!\" said Michael, staring up at one of the posters, \"They must be so cool!\"<br>\r\n\"Well thank you,\" said Skander. <br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n\"Nothing\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeeze guys, we gotta go!\" said Skander. \"Come on Jase...can you find your classroom alright?\"<br>\r\n\"Number twelve,\" said Reggie. <br>\r\n\"Oh that's...down the corridor. Turn left and go past the front doors, then to the end of the corridor, turn left again and it's on your right,\" said Skander. <br>\r\n\"Thanks dude!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two brothers ran off in one direction, and Skander and Jason teleported from where they were, to their own classroom. Another, shadowy figure followed the two young brothers down the corridor. Adrian was going to make darn sure that nothing happened to his blood on their first day in school. He floated, invisible, along the corridors, hovering just above them. He floated into their classroom with them, and sat down at the back of the classroom, in an empty seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Class!\" said the teacher, wafting in, \"I want you all to meet our new students. Reginald and Michael Stone. Reggie, Mike, why don't you introduce yourselves?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys got up and introduced themselves, telling a bit about who they and their family were and why and when they moved to California. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Mrs. Cotter, \"You can sit down now...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Reggie...\" said one of the boys, \"What kind of name is Reggie, Reggie? Sucky gay name is what!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy's name was Grego and he was mean to everyone. <br>\r\n\"Stop it, Grego!\" another boy hissed, \"Let them be! It's their first day!\"<br>\r\n\"Reggie-Reggie what a dredge, slipped on dog-crap fell in a hedge...Aaaaagh!....Guuuh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrego let out a strangled yelp of pain, his face contorted in excruciation. He was hyperventilating, gritting his teeth and seemingly twitching in his seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething or someone had grabbed his right ear and was twisting, tugging and pulling at it with all his might! The pain was almost dizzying! He tried to bat it away, but he couldn't feel anything there! No hands, no clothes-pegs or anything, just a LOT of twist-and-pinch-indunced pain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try that stunt again wise-guy, and I'll rip your freakin' tongue out!\" a voice from an unseen mouth whispered in his ear. </span></div></div>",

I'll be outside!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance waved and walked off. Skander and Jason reached their lockers. The wheels on their conbination-locks spun this way and that without them even touching the dials. The locks clicked and fell open. The doors opened without anyone touching them and their books floated in and their lunches floated out. The doors slammed and the locks clicked shut again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...did...just...happened?\" Reggie asked. <br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Skander asked. \"Oh the locks thing? Nothing...it's...it's nothing\". <br>\r\n\"How did you DO that?\" Reggie asksed. <br>\r\n\"Hey it's not the only thing I can do,\" said Skander.

He flexed his arms, \"This ain't super enough for yah?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys laughed. They passed another poster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those things are everywhere!\" said Reggie, \"It's like they follow us around or something!\"<br>\r\n\"More true than you might think,\" said Skander. \"That's Stryker,\" he said, pointing to the red and black-clothed, masked figure with blond hair, \"That's Blade,\" he added, pointing to the other figure, with brown hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's the guy in the middle?\" they asked. <br>\r\n\"The Shadow,\" said Jason. \"Third member of the team. Sort of like...the leader. Very mysterious. Almost never seen\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lookin' at yourselves in the mirror huh?\" said Lance, walking back with his lunch in his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a poster,\" said Reggie. \"But it could be. A mirror, I mean. They sure look real similar. Bet they'd look exactly the same if they did the masks thing...wait a minute!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReggie's mind snapped back to Skander and Jason levitating their stuff out of their lockers. The two brothers had been so amazed at the time that they totally disbelieved what they'd seen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys made your books fly!\" he said, pointing at Skander and Jason. He stared up at the poster. \"YOU'RE STRYKER AND BLADE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christ these two are slow on the draw,\" said Jason. \"Yes, we are\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah cool!\" said Reggie. \"And you're our NEIGHBOURS! Oh this is sugary! You guys really DO have powers, don't you!?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" said Skander. \"Haven't you guessed?\"<br>\r\n\"Well...yeah but...hey, what can you do? Can you really fly?\" Mike asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and Skander sprang into the air and hovered in front of the poster, in front of their illustrative selves. <br>\r\n\"Oh awesome!\" said Reggie. \"But..hey who's the guy in the middle?\"<br>\r\n\"That's the third member of our little crimefighting group,\" said Skander, hovering back down to earth. \"His name is Adrian Stone\".<br>\r\n\"Stone? He's got the same name as us!\" said Reggie. \"How come he's dressed all old-fashioned?\" <br>\r\n\"Well, it's just...what he likes to wear. But then he's always been pretty formal,\" said Jason. <br>\r\n\"Can we meet him?\" Mike asked. \"It'd be awesome to tell dad we met a guy in town with the same surname! He'd go crazy!\" <br>\r\n\"I bet he would,\" said Skander, \"Sorry guys, but the Shadow is very reclusive. He only shows himself when he wants to. You can't force him\". <br>\r\n\"You act like you know all about him,\" said Mike. <br>\r\n\"Perhaps I do,\" said Skander, laughing. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, well then what's he look like?\" the two boys asked. <br>\r\n\"He's on the poster, ain't he?\" Jason said. <br>\r\n\"Yeah but that's just a drawing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he's about six feet tall, brown hair, dark eyes, smooth complexion, light skin,\" said a voice behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said that?\" said Reggie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys turned around, but saw nothing. Then, a young man appeared before them, wearing a black, three-piece suit with a Double Albert chain, neat, black leather shoes and a black fedora hat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLY CRAP!\" they screamed and backed away. <br>\r\n\"Reginald and Michael Stone! I would appreciate it if you kept civil tongues in your mouths!\" <br>\r\n\"Who are you!?\" they gasped. <br>\r\n\"Boys,\" said Skander, resting hands on their shoulders, \"Meet the Shadow. AKA, your uncle Adrian\". <br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" they shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian walked forward. \"Good afternoon,\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" said Reggie, \"No way this is real!\" <br>\r\n\"About as real as your face, young man,\" said Adrian. \"Now stand up straight or I'll give you a hundred reasons not to sit down again!\" <br>\r\n\"Yessir!\" the boy said quickly. \"So...you...you really are real?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" said Adrian. <br>\r\n\"But...You're not us...I mean...part of our family...right?\" Mike asked. <br>\r\n\"I beg your pardon? Of course I am,\" said Adrian, \"What do you boys think this is, a joke? You, Michael, hold out your hand\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael did so. Adrian took the ring from his pocket. \"You know what your family monogram is, don't you?\"<br>\r\n\"Mono...what?\"<br>\r\n\"Monogram! It's like a logo\". <br>\r\n\"Um...ah, yeah, dad showed us, um, two 'S's in front of a diamond\". <br>\r\n\"Right,\" said Adrian. \"Then this is for you\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed Michael the ring. MIchael looked at it. \"You really are related to us!\" he said. <br>\r\n\"Yes I am,\" said Adrian, \"And you two, my nephews, will behave yourselves\". <br>\r\n\"Yes sir,\" they said. \"But how are you related to us?\" Michael asked. <br>\r\n\"Your father's name is Geoffrey Adrian Stone. He said that his grandfather Nathaniel gave him the second name of Adrian. Right?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes\".<br>\r\n\"Nathaniel was my younger brother. He was thirteen when I died. That makes me your great-grand-uncle.\"<br>\r\n\"Coooooool...\" the boys said. \"Wait til dad hears about this!\"<br>\r\n\"This is wicked!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian grabbed both boys and gave them a hug each. \"It's nice to see Stones back in town,\" he said. </span></div></div>",

Visit whenever you like\". <br>\r\n\"Cool,\" said Reggie. Skander grabbed Reggie by the arm so tight he nearly snapped it in half. \"I wouldn't say that, if I were you...Not unless you want a really big family argument\". <br>\r\n\"Oh...sorry...\" said Reggie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached the front steps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in,\" said Reggie. Michael unlocked the front door and they all stepped inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey dad!\" Mike shouted. \"Daaad!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA door opened and Geoffrey Adrian Stone stuck his head around the frame. \"Yes, what is it Michael?\"<br>\r\n\"Can we talk?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm kinda busy doing some research, kid, later\".<br>\r\n\"Now\".<br>\r\n\"Later\". <br>\r\n\"Dad, now\". <br>\r\n\"I said, later!\"<br>\r\n\"Dad!\" said Reggie, \"We said 'now' we mean 'now'!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff groaned. \"Alright what is it?\" <br>\r\n\"We uh...we found something at...we um, found something today,\" said Reggie. He held out the ring. \"It's got that logo thing on it that you showed us once\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff took the ring. It was bright gold with two \"S\"s on it and a diamond between them. He whistled. \"This is beautiful!\" he said. He took out a loupe and held it up to his eye, closely examining it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a...signet ring...turn of the century...with the family monogram on it...where did you find this?\" <br>\r\n\"Just...lying around,\" said Reggie. \"We knew you didn't have it in your collection, so...\" <br>\r\n\"It's nice...\" said Geoff. He checked out the ring more closely. He read the engraving on the ring inside the band... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Mast. A. J. Stone</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff turned to his desk and opened the family bible. \"A...J...A. J...\"<br>\r\n\"Adrian Jeremiah,\" said Reginald. \"It stands for Adrian Jeremiah\".<br>\r\n\"How do you know?\" Geoff asked, not turning around, \"You guys never look in this bible\". <br>\r\n\"It was a hunch?\" Mike suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently, Adrian wafted into solidity behind everyone. He stepped forward, holding a finger to his lips, indicating to the twins, Skander and Jason, to remain silent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael don't lie!\" he said clearly, \"I <i>told</i> them what it stands for, that's how they know\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoffrey turned around. His jaw dropped, he was totally speechless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon, Geoffrey. I apologise for my tardiness, I'm only about 90 years late for the family reunion, but I'll be there next time you throw one\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who...\" Geoffrey stammered, \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n\"Christ...for a history professor you're a bit slow on the ball aren't you?\" said Adrian. A gust of wind blasted through the study. The pages on the old bible fluttered and turned rapidly until they stopped. Geoffrey looked at the pages that were opened... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>STONE, Master Adrian Jeremiah. <br>\r\nBorn: 15th of June, 1898. <br>\r\nDied: 4th of January, 1919. <br>\r\nCause of death: Spanish Influenza. <br>\r\nAge at Death: 20 years. <br>\r\nParents: Lawrence and Cynthia Stone.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're real!\" said Geoffrey. <br>\r\n\"Why not? Aren't you real?\" Adrian asked. \"The boys have been telling me that you have been researching my life for the past year and a half. Well I'm here now, ask me whatever you like\". <br>\r\n\"This is incredible!\"<br>\r\n\"Not really. I just wanted to hang around on Earth and watch time go by,\" said Adrian. \"Speaking of watching time ticking away,\" he said. \"I have something else to show you guys\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out the gold watch and chain. \"This was my father's. And it would make a fine addition to your family museum\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian opened up the caseback of the watch and handed the whole thing to Geoffrey. He looked at the engraving on the caseback... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Property of Lawrence Stone</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's beautiful!\" the boys said.<br>\r\n\"It's incredible!\" said Geoffrey. <br>\r\n\"It works,\" said Adrian. \"So don't drop it\". </span></div></div>",

By a family-member!\" said Reggie, grinning. <br>\r\n\"What haunted house?\" Adrian asked, \"This house ain't haunted. I haunt Skander's house. The house I grew up in, the house I died in. The house that will, hopefully, one day, be returned to the family of Stone\". <br>\r\n\"Relax Adrian, I'll take good care of it, and when I move out, your family can take it back,\" said Skander, popping downstairs. \"What's up?\" <br>\r\n\"Just playing,\" said Reggie.

Come on\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys vanished and reappeared in a locked room upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Adrian asked. <br>\r\n\"Commissioner Weston says that a group of nutjobs set themselves up in one of his hotels, one of the modern ones, on the beachfront. The terrorists or whatever they are, have the whole place on lockdown.They say they got a bomb or bombs or something inside the building, ready to blow the entire place up if Horowitz doesn't cough up\". <br>\r\n\"How much?\"<br>\r\n\"Eeh...Two billion dollars\". <br>\r\n\"WHAT!?\" <br>\r\n\"I know!...\"<br>\r\n\"WHERE THE HELL DO THEY THINK HE'S GONNA GET THE MONEY!? I've known the Horowitz family a hundred and ten years!\" Adrian shouted. \"They got big in the 20s. In the 30s they got busted in the Depression just like everyone else. They shot up again the 60s after the War and they'd been living the highlife ever since, but I don't think they have THAT kind of money! Oh Lord!\" <br>\r\n\"Well Weston KNOWS THAT,\" Skander said, \"Our job is to go into the hotel and take out the baddies and if we can, locate whatever bombs there are. Once we have, the bomb-squad can handle the rest\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian made a face of disgust and let out a whistle of amazement. \"Damn!\" he screamed. <br>\r\n\"Now come on, keep a level head,\" said Skander, \"Let's go get Jason...\"<br>\r\n\"Where is he?\"<br>\r\n\"Downstairs with Geoff and his parents\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys headed downstairs and found Jason in the kitchen. They explained everything to him and the third member of the crimefighting trio whistled. \"Well we better get going! Come on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncle Adrian, where are you going!?\" Reginald asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fast as they could, Adrian explained to everyone present, what had happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wanna come!\" said Michael, quickly. \"We wanna see you do what you do!\" <br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" said Adrian. \"You stay here where it's safe!\" <br>\r\n\"But we won't get IN the way!

They are armed, heavily armed. Shotguns, rifles, submachine guns, assault-rifles, hell, the only things they don't have are field guns. They've locked and barricaded all the entrances to the hotel, they got all entrances guarded, and they claim to have at least two bombs. Now the problem is, we can't go in because at the slightest sign of any police-presence, they claim they're gonna blow the place sky-high, money or no money!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the plan?\" Jason asked. <br>\r\n\"You boys fly up to the top floor,\" said Weston. \"You start there, and you go down, floor by floor, checking all the rooms. You neutralise any suspect IMMEDIATELY. I don't care how you do it and I won't ask. I know you fellows can't be hurt, but that won't stop these guys from trying awful hard, believe me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commissioner pulled out three walkie-talkies and handed one to Skander, one to Jason, one to Adrian and kept a fourth one for himself. \"Now go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three boys vanished. Reappearing on the top floor of the hotel, they devised a plan. Adrian would do a quick sweep of the hotel to locate everything, then they'd go through, floor by floor, clearing everything out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you can really do a sweep that fast?\" Jason asked, \"These people may not have much time\". <br>\r\n\"I reckon I can,\" said Adrian. \"Leave it to The Shadow. You boys wait here and be good, now, okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes papa,\" said Skander. Adrian zipped up to his face. <br>\r\n\"No wisecracks or I'll let you do the sweep\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost vanished. Jason and Skander walked to the windows of the hotel-room they were in, and peered down into the street below to see police-cars and barriers everywhere, and huge crowds. What would happen if a bomb really did go off? Skander was nervous. He looked at the crowds below him. Somewhere, down there, looking up at him, were two boys and their father with the surname 'Stone'. </span></div></div>",

They looked one way, then the other. Then they stepped out. They reached the end of the corridor when they saw a figure in black walking towards them. It was not Adrian. For one thing, he didn't have the gold chain across his abdomen that Adrian always wore, and this man, whoever he was, was wearing a black ski-mask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap!\" Skander shouted. <br>\r\n\"Oooh no! Hey! You kids! Get back here you punks!\" the man shouted, and ran towards them. He pulled out a gun, but Skander and Jason were back in their room and had the door closed faster than the terrorist could aim. Desperately, Skander looked around for something to defend himself with. He opened the bathroom door and yanked the towel-rails off the walls. These would do. He tossed one to Jason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When he comes in, beam him!\" Skander said. Jason nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened, the man charged into the room. He stared left and right, searching for the boys. But he didn't think to look up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloating near the ceiling, Skander and Jason watched the man. When he decided he'd picked the wrong room, he turned to the doorway and was about to barge out again when Skander jumped down from the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boo!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man punched Skander, who ducked. Skander tripped the man over with a kick and the revolver in the crook's hand spun out of his reach, under the bed. The man pulled out another gun from his coat and fired, aiming for Skander's chest. The bullet hit the superteen in the chest and bounced off. The man kept firing, at Skander's chest, arms, legs, his face, neck, forehead...the bullets kept bouncing off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough of this!\" said Skander. He bent down and easily twisted the gun out of the man's hand. Breaking it apart as easily as if it was made of paper, Skander rolled up the metal like it was playdough, blowing on it with his firebreath to melt the metal until he had what looked like a long, steel cable in his hand. Jason forced the man onto his back and twisted his arms around. Skander wrapped the melted and reshaped remnants of the man's gun around his wrists from behind, and then hauled him upright. Skander made a face, and then spat something hard in the man's face. It struck the man's cheekbone and fell to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bullet rolled across the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, what did I mi---woah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander and Jason turned around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian had returned. </span></div></div>",

He walked over to the bed and started ripping up the blankets like tissue-paper. He threw the strips cloth to Jason, who hogtied the man and gagged him. When they were done, he looked like a trussed up goose. His hands were tied behind his back, his legs were tied together at the ankles and knees and he was on his stomach, with his legs bent backwards to meet his hands. His four limbs were then tied to each other. For extra measure, Skander tied the hogtied terrorist to the bed with one least strip of cloth. Searching his body and the room, Skander picked up the man's two guns. He tossed one to Adrian and kept the other one for himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That ought to hold him for a while,\" he said. <br>\r\n\"What are the cops gonna say?\" said Adrian. <br>\r\n\"Thank you\", said Jason. \"Now let's go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys headed out of the room and started doing a door-to-door search.

This is Weston, do you copy, over?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason flipped a switch on his walkie-talkie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reading you loud and clear, over\", he said. <br>\r\n\"What is the situation? Over\". <br>\r\n\"One terrorist captured and tied on top floor. Have just finished searching top floor. Nobody here, nothing else to report, over\".  <br>\r\n\"Good work boys, keep going. Over and out\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hotel was a large one, and the boys had to use superspeed and teleportation to get anything done. Most of the top floors were empty. It was when they reached the middle and lower floors that things started heating up. From the middle floors down, there were men with guns walking around everywhere. They were all wearing black clothing with black ski-masks on their faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do?\" Skander whispered to Adrian. \"We need some way to surprise them\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost hovered as he thought, and thought as he hovered. \"I'll handle this,\" he said, finally. <br>\r\n\"Don't do anything stupid, don't give us away or anything,\" Skander said, \"No theatrics\". <br>\r\n\"Yes, mother,\" said Adrian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiding behind a closed door, Adrian raised his hands. With X-ray vision, the boys stared through the door to see a heavy floor-lamp raise itself into the air. They watched it spin around like a baseball bat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHUNK! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man didn't know what hit him. He fell senseless to the floor. Slowly, the boys opened the door and stepped onto the staircase landing where the man was standing. Binding him up with bedsheets again and stripping his body of weapons, they headed further down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt each floor down from then on, there was always at least two men to try and get rid of. They were a few floors from the bottom when Adrian's luck ran out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA heavy wooden statue of a bald eagle mysteriously floated up from the side-table it was sitting on and was slowly floating through the air, ready to stun another man on the head, when they heard a voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah whatever, I know, I know, don't worry! I'll handle it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adrian!\" Skander whispered, \"I think we got company!\"<br>\r\n\"Wh...?\" Adrian said. His attention broken, he dropped the levitating eagle statue too early. It hit the ground and gave away their position hiding behind the closed door. The man in the lobby on the other side of it, twisted around and opened the door. Skander, Jason and Adrian turned to run, when they bumped into the other man, coming down the corridor. For a moment, the sudden meeting took everyone by surprise. Then Jason swore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh what the hell!\" he said. He struck out with his right foot. His heel hit the man who was talking on his cellphone, in the stomach. He flew back and crashed through the wall, into the room behind him. Skander ran for the other man. But he'd already pulled out his shotgun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T MOVE!\" he shouted. \"DON'T MOVE!\" He pulled out a cellphone and pressed a speed-dial number and held the phone to his ear. \"Yo dude, we got some freaky kids up there!\" he shouted. <br>\r\n\"Deal with them!\" an answering voice on the phone shouted back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man fired his shotgun but Skander dived. He did a forward somersault. He popped up on his feet right in front of the man and grabbed the shotgun by the barrel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no, that's not a toy,\" said Skander, softly, \"Now give it to papa\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man struggled to shake Skander's grip off the gun, but it didn't work. Skander grabbed the shotgun slide and ripped it off. Holding the barrel in his hands, he twisted it around until the whole gun looked like nothing more threatening than a bubble-blowing stick. The man's face contorted in fear. He dropped the gun and shrugged a machine gun off his shoulders. He fired desperately but the bullets bounced off Skander's taut, hard body. Then, the man pulled something out of his pocket. It was his cellphone. He pressed a combination of buttons on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn explosion like an erupting volcano shook the building! Skander grabbed the man and forced him onto the ground. He twisted the phone out of his hands and ripped it to pieces in front of his eyes. Skander picked the man up and threw him down the stairs. The man screamed and hit the bottom step with the back of his head. Knocking him out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, policemen and firefighters were going crazy. Weston was screaming into a radio mouthpiece. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shots fired, shots fired! The first bomb appears to have gone off! Requesting SWAT teams to land on the roof!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelicopters whizzed into view over the hotel. They landed on the roof of the hotel and black, heavily-armed policemen charged into the building. They grabbed hostages from their locked hotel rooms and started herding them up to the helicopters while more police charged into the hotel from the bottom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's uncle Adrian and Skander!?\" Reggie shouted. \"I wanna see them!\" <br>\r\n\"REGINALD COME BACK!\" Geoffrey shouted. But the boy had already run off towards the hotel.<br>\r\n\"REGGIE!\" Michael yelled. Then he too, vaulted the barriers that the police had set up and ran after him. They ran into the hotel, screaming. Policemen were firing canisters of tear-gas all over the place while firefighters with extinguishers ran up the shiny, marble staircase, to put out the fires in the rooms above. Skander, Jason and Adrian flew down to the lobby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ADRIAN!\" the boys screamed. The ghost stared down. His eyes blazed a horrible blood red. He swooped down on them, his face contorted in fury! His arms grabbed the boys around their throats and hoisted them into the air before flying out of the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I TOLD YOU TO STAY OUTSIDE!\" the ghost roared at them. <br>\r\n\"But we were scared for you!\" Reggie shouted.<br>\r\n\"I'M A FREAKIN' GHOST! SCARED IS MY DAMNED BUSINESS!\" Adrian yelled back. \"YOU DO THAT AGAIN, I WILL BEAT YOU KIDS SO HARD YOU WON'T SIT DOWN FOR TWO WEEKS! NOW GET OUT OF HERE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw the boys out of the building and swooped back in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kids, honestly!\" he growled as he landed on the floor next to Skander. The police had taken over the fight now, and they could hear gunshots upstairs. In another half an hour, it would be all over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>BEEP BEEP BEEP! A delivery van honked its horn as it backed into the driveway of the Stone's house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian wafted through the house, watching Reggie and Michael sleeping in their rooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDING DONG! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian flew downstairs and, invisibly, opened the front door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...hello?\" a man shouted. He rapped on the open door and then stepped inside. \"HELLO!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA door at the end of the landing opened and Geoff came lumbering down wearing jeans and a blue, button-down shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Geoff said, and yawned. <br>\r\n\"Sorry to wake you up so early,\" said the man, \"But I have a delivery for this address?\"<br>\r\n\"Do you...?\" Geoff asked. He took the clipboard and read it. \"Oh yeah...\" he said, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes. \"Okay...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver of the truck handed Geoff a pen and he signed the paper on the clipboard. Putting on his shoes, he followed the man outside. Parked in the driveway was a large moving-van. Slowly, the two men opened the doors at the back of the van. The noise woke everyone up. Reggie, Michael, Skander, Jason and all their parents crowded out into the street. It was only eight thirty in the morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said the delivery man, \"I'll hold the front, you push\". <br>\r\n\"Right,\" said Geoff. He climbed into the back of the van. \"Ready!?\"<br>\r\n\"Hold on...okay ready! PUSH!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether, the two men pushed and pulled and heaved and tugged. Slowly, something covered in a heavy blue tarpaulin, came sliding down the ramp into the driveway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go!\" said the delivery man, \"All in one piece!\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Geoff, and shook the man's hand. <br>\r\n\"Bye now,\" said the delivery driver; he closed the back of his van and then drove off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What IS that?\" Susan asked her husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little surprise,\" said Geoff, \"Gather around everyone. Mr. Lancet, if you take the other side, we'll pull this tarp off\". <br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Jason's father, \"Down the bottom here?\"<br>\r\n\"That's right...ready? Pull!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men pulled back the tarp and folded it and put it aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, boys!?\" Geoff asked. \"How's this for family history?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the driveway was a glistening antique motorcar. It was bright red and its chrome and brass trim, headlamps, bumper-bars and windshield frames sparkled and twinkled in the morning sunlight. The logo of the car was screwed onto the front grille. The canvass roof of the touring car was folded back, and the beautiful leather seats inside looked soooo comfortable. The sparkling nameplate on the grille read: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Pierce Arrow</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" said Reggie and Michael, walking up to it and looking it over. \"Does it run?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure it does, I had it professionally restored and shipped over!\" said Geoff, proudly. \"What do you all think?\" <br>\r\n\"It's beautiful, honey!\" said Susan, admriing the gleaming paintwork. \"How old is it?\"<br>\r\n\"Um...1918,\" said Geoff. \"Purchased by Mr. Lawrence Stone in December of that year\". <br>\r\n\"Nice family heirloom,\" said Skander and Jason walking over. The car was so shiny that Skander ended up checking his reflection in the headlamps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a Pierce Arrow 1918 family touring car,\" said Geoff, proudly, patting the red paintwork with his left hand. \"Ain't she a beauty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'll be goddamned! Father's automobile!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turned around to see Adrian walking towards them. The ghost had an expression of disbelieving shock on his face. He walked up to the car and examined it minutely. \"Good God...\" he whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Recognise it, Adrian?\" Skander asked.<br>\r\n\"RECOGNISE IT? I was WITH father when he BOUGHT it! Oh wow!...Had no idea it had lasted THIS long in the family!\" <br>\r\n\"Was it expensive?\" Reggie asked.<br>\r\n\"It cost about a thousand bucks back in 1918,\" said Adrian. \"Pierce Arrow was one of the best cars you could buy!\"<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Geoff, \"Who wants to go for a drive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once, everyone started shouting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh cool!\"<br>\r\n\"Daddy I wanna go, I wanna go!\"<br>\r\n\"Geoff it's so beautiful!\"<br>\r\n\"A real antique and it works!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff laughed. \"Well first, we gotta get this car started\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked up a long metal rod which was sitting on the running-board of the car. \"This rod goes through the hole in the front grille,\" he said. \"Let's see how it works, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff slotted the crank-handle into the hole and grabbed the hooked end and started turning. Nothing happened. He kept turning it. Still nothing happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on EARTH are you doing?\" Adrian asked, standing over Geoff, \"Try turning it the OTHER way\". <br>\r\n\"I...I did, it's too stiff,\" said Geoff. <br>\r\n\"You SURE this car works?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\"<br>\r\n\"Then you're not starting it the right way. Move, let a PRO handle this\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff stood up and stepped aside. Everyone turned to watch. Adrian grabbed the handle and turned it three or four times in the opposite direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure that won't break it?\" Geoff asked.<br>\r\n\"It's MEANT to be turned this direction,\" said Adrian, \"You're just not using enough...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nREEEEEEEERRRRRRRR!!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe engine caught and turned on. Everyone gasped and cheered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...FORCE!\" Adrian said, giving the handle one last turn and then getting up. He snapped his fingers and grinned, \"Aaaay! Still got the magic touch!\" he said, and grinned. \"NOW it's working! Who wants a ride? Geoff, I hope you're better driving than you are starting up a motor-car. If you can't do it, I'll drive. Reggie, Michael, hop in. Skander and Jason, if you're brave enough, you can stand on the running-boards and HOLD ON TIGHT!\" <br>\r\n\"Um...you drive, Adrian!\" said Geoff, laughing. Adrian smiled. He floated into the driver's seat. \"I haven't touched this baby in nearly a hundred years, I hope I can still remember how it works!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling on a couple of levers, the ghost pressed on the accelerator. The car crept forward a bit. \"Right!\" he said, \"All aboard!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone climbed in. Adrian tugged on a lever and the car took off down the road... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The automobile rumbled out into the road and Adrian opened it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How fast does this thing go?\" Skander asked. <br>\r\n\"About a hundred miles an hour is its top speed,\" said Adrian. He honked the horn with his left hand and waved an arm out the side of the car. He turned left and kept driving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you wave your hand?\" Jason asked. <br>\r\n\"Signalling!\" Adrian shouted over the noise of the motor, \"This car doesn't have indicator lights. That's how we used to signal in the old days!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe squeezed the bulb-horn and the horn hooted loudly. People shouted and waved and gawked at the car as it drove by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY LOOK!\" Skander shouted. He pointed ahead to see Lance, Stacy, Tina and Stacy's brother Marsden waving from a car that pulled up alongside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dudes!\" Lance shouted, \"What is that THING you're driving!?\" <br>\r\n\"Family heirloom!\" Geoffrey shouted back. <br>\r\n\"Huh!\" said Marsden, who was driving the other car, \"What can it do?\" <br>\r\n\"A hundred or so,\" said Geoff. <br>\r\n\"Woah! Hey Skander, man, we saw you guys on TV last week! That was crazy awesome, man! We're throwin' a party, and like...well...for YOU GUYS! And...yeah\".<br>\r\n\"For US?\" Adrian shouted, jerking his head around and nearly crashing the car. \"WHAT?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Tina screamed. \"You guys totally gotta come! Everyone is going crazy wanting to meet you!\" <br>\r\n\"It's a costume-party,\" Lance shouted, \"Find somethin' cool and come!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian nodded, \"Sounds great!...Now, come on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Skander felt himself being jerked back as Adrian stepped on the gas! The old Pierce Arrow lived up to its name and took off! Everyone cheered as Adrian revved the engine and sent the car flying along the highway at top speed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure it can take this!?\" Geoff shouted. <br>\r\n\"It'll be fine!\" Adrian shouted back. He took an onramp off the highway, did a U-turn and then drove back towards home, again at near top speed. It was a thrilling joyride. They reached the main road near their houses and Adrian slowed down. The Arrow skidded around the corner and drove back to their neighbourhood. Adrian stopped the car while everyone got out. Geoff opened the garage-door, and Adrian gently backed the car into the garage, to park it beside Geoff's Mercedes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was wicked!\" said Reggie and Mike. \"We love this car!\"<br>\r\n\"You're not gonna sell it, are you?\" Adrian asked.<br>\r\n\"Hell no! This is staying in the family forever now!\" said Reggie. He hugged the hood of the car. Then he let out a yelp of pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful kid, the engine's still hot from the drive!\" Adrian said, and laughed. </span></div></div>",

It's glass silk\". <br>\r\n\"What?\" Skander asked, puzzled. Melinda smiled. \"It's a special silk grown by special silkworms,\" she said. \"Your grandmother has a whole farm of the little things,\" she said, smiling, \"and she gave me some of this fabric, and I forgot about it. Glass silk is see-through silk when it's woven into cloth. I took some and did a bit of measuring and cutting...well...here\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave the boys two cloaks. They were black on the outside and red inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They look exactly the same as our old ones,\" said Skander, exmaining his carefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they?\" asked Melinda, smiling, \"This is a very special silk. Put on the cloak and you'll see what I mean\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander clasped the catch around his throat. Nothing happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it,\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelinda grabbed the cloak and threw it over Skander's head. Jason yelped in horror and nearly fell over stepping backwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it!?\" Skander shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glass silk makes its wearers invisible,\" said Melinda, smiling. \"Look!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander walked to the mirror above the fireplace. Sure enough, he was invisible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh cool!\" said Skander. He tugged the cloak off him. The invisibility disappeared and he was back to his old self, and the cloak morphed back to its old black and red colours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does mine do that too?\" Jason asked. <br>\r\n\"Yes it does,\" said Melinda. \"Under your cloaks, you're completely invisible!\"<br>\r\n\"Cool!\" said Jason. \"Hey, what are YOU going as?\" he asked, looking at Melinda. <br>\r\n\"Joan of Arc!\" said Melinda, looking at her old-style clothes. \"I just need to find something to tie on my bonnet with\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their costumes on, the boys ran across the road to where everyone else was getting ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold still!\" said Susan as she tugged on Michael's belt. \"Okay...there!\" she said, and slapped him on the back, \"All done!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael looked at his belt and holster. \"Cool!\" he said. He pulled out his toy cap-gun and loaded it with caps. He fired it in the air, and it let out a very realistic 'BANG!' that made everyone jump. Reggie was dressed up as a gunslinger with his own belt, holster and toy revolvers. Michael clipped the sheriff badge onto his costume and looked at himself in the mirror in the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reach for the sky, boy,\" said Adrian, wafting up behind him. Michael nearly died. He twisted around and fell over, bumping against the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the!...?\" he spluttered. <br>\r\n\"Ghosts don't reflect in mirrors,\" grinned Adrian, \"Gotcha!\" <br>\r\n\"You are SUCH an asshole sometimes, Uncle Adrian\".<br>\r\n\"Hey come on, no language like...what the hell is THAT supposed to be!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReggie and Michael looked up to see Geoff tugging on a black coat. \"What do you think?\" he asked. He pulled out a cigar and put it between his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What ARE you supposed to be?\" Adrian asked. <br>\r\n\"Winston Churchill?\" Geoff said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys burst into laughter while Adrian struggled to keep a straight face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, everyone was dressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we gonna get to Stacy's house for the party?\" Skander asked. \"Jason and I can just fly there...\"<br>\r\n\"I wanna take the car!\" said Michael. \"The old one!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff grinned, \"Me too. Let me think...It's not too far...The kids can all go in the car. Us grown-ups and drive in our own cars. Uncle Adrian, can you handle them all?\"<br>\r\n\"We'll be just fine,\" said Adrian. \"Come on Reginald\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian opened up the garage. The five adults piled into the Mercedes and drove off. Skander and Jason climbed into the back of the Arrow with Reggie while Michael was up the front with Adrian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I start it up?\" Michael asked. <br>\r\n\"You think you have the strength?\" Adrian asked. <br>\r\n\"I dunno...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian vanished. Suddenly, Michael yelped. \"What's going on!?\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you do,\" said a voice coming out of Michael's mouth. \"Go on my little nephew...grab the crank with your right hand, thumb away, and turn!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael grabbed the crank and turned. Once, twice, three times...the engine caught! Adrian swooped out of Michael's body and landed in the driver's seat. \"Come on!\" he shouted. Michael jumped in and Adrian pulled on the gears and pressed on the gas-pedal. He flipped on the electric headlamps and the car drove off... </span></div></div>",

Stacy's family was rich, and they owned a huge, old mansion called Rosewood Hall. It was a towering, ancient structure on the edge of town, four floors high and as old, creepy and cavernous as they come. The perfect place to host a big, freaky costume party. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duuuuudes! You made it!\" said Marsden. He grabbed the doorhandle of one of the Arrow's doors and opened it. Jason and Skander stepped out with Reggie behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a cool car,\" he said, looking over it. \"How old is it?\"<br>\r\n\"About ninety years,\" said Adrian, killing the engine, turning off the lamps and getting out. \"Is it alright if we leave it here in the driveway, off the street?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure man,\" said Marsden. \"Yo, Michael my man, what's up with the gun?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm the sheriff!\" said Michael, pointing his gun to the older boy who was dressed up as a 1920s gangster. <br>\r\n\"Oooh, dah shewwif!\" he grinned, \"Damn kid I'm scared!\" he laughed, \"Come on in guys!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of friends headed inside to see everyone chatting and laughing. The moment the heavy front doors closed, everyone stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh,\" said Skander. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once, all the party-guests had swarmed around them, hugging, kissing, grabbing, touching, feeling...stroking. And then the voices started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! OH MY GOD HE IS SO HOT!\"<br>\r\n\"HOW DO YOU KNOW THESE GUYS?\"<br>\r\n\"That Blade is such a hunk! Oh God!\" <br>\r\n\"Hey dude, can I have your autograph!?\"<br>\r\n\"What about a photo?\"<br>\r\n\"Do you really go to the same school as the Stone twins?\"<br>\r\n\"Hey it's that ghost dude!\"<br>\r\n\"Where!?\"<br>\r\n\"Over...\"<br>\r\n\"BOO!\"<br>\r\n\"HOLY CRAP!\" <br>\r\n\"...there!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Skaaaaander!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander turned around to see Stacy. She gave him a kiss, \"Gimme a hand, flyboy. Take these lights and throw them up around the chandelier, will you?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" said Skander. He grabbed the fairy-lights and soared into the air. He strung them around the chandelier and looped them around staircase railings and then plugged the lights in. He let out a yelp of surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh what's wrong!?' Stacy asked. She ran up the stairs to where Skander was hovering above the power-socket. \"This house is pretty old and we haven't had a chance to sort out all the wiring yet.

Come on, I want you and your friends to meet some of MY friends!\"<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh, okay,\" said Skander. He wondered who Stacy's 'friends' were, and how they were gonna react when they found out she had a superteen for a boyfriend... </span></div></div>",

It eventually landed on the garage roof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are NOT gonna touch that car,\" said Adrian, \"I will rip them a new asshole if they so much as SNEEZE at it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRASH! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople screamed as a heavy pot-plant fell over, shattering on the verandah.

He smelt drunk. Skander watched him as he walked over to Stacy. \"Hey baby, want some action?\"<br>\r\n\"Get AWAY from me, you creep!\"<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm...\"<br>\r\n\"GET OFF ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stinging 'slap!' could be heard and howl of pain. Skander walked over. \"Something wrong?\" he asked. <br>\r\n\"HE TOUCHED ME!\" said Stacy. Skander looked at the guy in front of him. He was a little taller than Skander and had unkempt facial hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen dude, just back out, okay,\" said Skander.<br>\r\n\"But we're having fun, dude! We ain't...HURK!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander's fingers had wrapped around the guy's nutsack and was squeezing it with (to him) very gentle force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you one chance,\" said Skander. He squeezed a bit harder. The gatecrasher let out a weird, whining noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...to get out,\" said Skander, releasing his nuts, \"...Before I make a girl out of you. Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander grabbed the taller guy with his hands, \"You don't have a choice, grogbreath!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting the guy as easily as if he was a toothpick, Skander hurled him out the front door. The guy flew out, over the fence and down the road like a javelin, eventually ploughing through a hedge at the end of the street. The other guys started backing away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get...out,\" said Skander. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The school trip to the local history museum wasn't down to classes, but down to students. Whoever wanted to go, signed up their names and were issued permission-slips to be signed. It meant a day away from school, so most kids put their names down, including Skander and Jason, who both wanted time away from the classroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Jones!\" said Skander's teacher, waving him back into the room at the end of history, \"I hear you're going on the trip on Friday. I'll be going too! I wondered if you could give this to your mother,\" he said, handing Skander a piece of paper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Skander asked. <br>\r\n\"Well, the school wasn't able to book quite enough coaches to get everyone to the museum, so we're hoping that some parents will ehm...will...offer to um...carpool\". <br>\r\n\"Sure,\" said Skander. He took the piece of paper and turned to leave again. <br>\r\n\"Oh and one more thing!\" said his teacher, calling him back in. <br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Skander asked. And now, his history teacher pulled something out of his briefcase, \"Could you sign this? My son Timmy's one of your fans,\" he said, \"And I promised him I'd get your autograph!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher rolled out a poster onto his desk. Skander grinned, \"Sure,\" he said. He took a pen from the whiteboard and uncapped it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To Timothy, from Stryker\", he wrote. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" said the teacher, and lifted his hand away from the poster, which snapped back into its rolled-up position. And Skander ran out to lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Get out of here and I'll handle it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander shrugged. Jason popped up behind him, \"Ready to go?\" he asked. <br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Skander. The two boys vanished. Adrian disappeared again, and reappeared inside the garage of the Stone household. He opened up a plastic jerry-can of gasoline and poured it into the gas-tank of the Arrow, then filled up the radiator with water. He opened the garage door and, turning himself into full-visibility mode, cranked up the engine, hopped in and drove the car out to the curb. He honked the horn loudly, three times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReggie and Mike came running out the front door and jumped into the front seat and the back seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you driving us to the museum Uncle Adrian?\" Reggie asked. <br>\r\n\"Yep,\" said Adrian, \"Hold on, now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling on the gearstick, Adrian pressed on the gas and the car chunnered out into the road. Adrian turned, and then headed off to school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait til our friends see this!\" said Reggie, excitedly. They didn't have long to wait. A couple of minutes later, and the car pulled up outside the school gates. Mounting the curb, Adrian drove through the gates and executed a sharp, 180-degree turn in the courtyard. He honked the horn again, and waited. Students stuck their heads out windows, and ran down staircases, along corridors, until they had reached the courtyard. They stared at the car in amazement, the shining brass headlamps and the red paint, glistening in the sunlight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" one of Reggie's friends shouted, \"Can we come!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReggie nodded. Two of Reginald's friends climbed into the back seat. Then two of Michael's friends scrambled into the back rumble-seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" said Adrian, \"Who wants to try and start us off?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the teachers stepped out, it was Skander's history teacher, \"I'll do it!\" he shouted. Bending down over the front, he grabbed the crank and turned it. Everyone watched. Eventually, the engine caught on and the car started. Adrian honked the horn and they were off! The cool breezes whisked past the car, and the boys couldn't believe they were riding in an antique car, driven by a ghost! Where-ever it was that Adrian learnt to drive before he died, he did it very well. The car slid in and out of lanes of traffic, it turned smoothly around corners and eventually reached the front doors of the museum. Parking the car in a secluded spot of the multistory carpark next door, they all headed into the museum to meet Skander and Jason... </span></div></div>",

He tugged out his pocket watch and checked the time, \"Alright, let's go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of students wandered through all the different exhibits, staring at the photos, at the stuff behind the glass cabinets, at the mock-ups of houses, living-rooms, street-scenes, offices, police-stations, antique motor-cars, steam-trains and aeroplanes hanging from the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at this, Uncle Adrian!\" said Mike, walking over to an old Ford Model T, \"Our car's better than this one!\" he said. He opened the door of the car and climbed in. Reggie climbed into the cab of a steam locomotive and tugged on all the levers, wheels and cords. He grabbed a long cable running along the ceiling of the cab and pulled it. A large, brass bell rang loudly. They kept searching and walking around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Age of Steam\", Skander said, reading a placard, \"Were you alive then?\" he asked, turning to Adrian. <br>\r\n\"Sure was,\" said Adrian, \"Everything used to be run by steam. Boats, trains, elevators, electrical power was steam-generated...even the first cars were run by steam\". <br>\r\n\"How do you run a car with STEAM?\" one of Reggie's friends asked. <br>\r\n\"How do you run anything with steam? You fill up the tank with water, you boil the water, that makes steam...\"<br>\r\n\"But that would take ages!\"<br>\r\n\"Not if you made the amount of water really small,\" said Adrian. \"You heated up small amounts of water each time and that made steam to drive the car...Hey, I haven't seen one of these in ages!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost walked over to a recreation of an old office with a placard which read: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An Early 20th Century Office\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian stared around at the desks, the bookcases, the typewriters and the telephones. He sat down in a chair and read the card next to a typewriter which said: \"Feel free to try me\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" the ghost said. He floated a piece of paper into the machine and cranked it in with the rollers. Pressing his fingers on the round, glass and metal keys, the ghost began typing. The clattering of the keys and the rattling of the carriage was loud and clanky. When the carriage reached the end of the line, a bell rang. Adrian pushed the page up a bit, and then shoved the carriage back to the 'start' position. All the kids crowded around them, wanting to try stuff out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is fun!\" said Jason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey passed all kinds of exhibits - cars, musical instruments, furniture, art, clocks, jewellery. Adrian was comparing his own pocket watch to the ones behind a display case, when an alarm went off! </span></div></div>",

Armed security guards jogged past the boys and Skander and Jason went with them. They skidded into a room with broken glass everywhere. A sign hanging from the ceiling read: \"JEWELLERY EXHIBIT\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason rushed from display case to display case. Every single one was empty. Each one had had its glass fronts smashed and the jewellery snatched out of it. Rings, necklaces, diamonds, rubies, sapphires, emeralds, pearls - all gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" a security guard shouted, \"You boys aren't allowed in here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander, Jason and Adrian vanished. When they reappeared, they were flying over the museum. Skander and Jason wore black and red while Adrian hovered nearby in his usual black suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where did they go?\" Skander shouted. Adrian stared around, he pointed to a white van speeding out of a parking-lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" he shouted. <br>\r\n\"Adrian, you go tell the police, we'll handle this!\" Jason shouted. Adrian vanished. Skander and Jason dived, faster and faster, soon, they were hovering just behind the van. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you wanna do?\" Skander asked. Jason paused and thought, \"Gimme your cape,\" he said. Skander unbuckled his long cape and handed it over. Jason vanished and resolidified inside the van. He staretd picking up briefcases, bags and boxes, all crammed full of stolen loot. He put them inside the cape and bundled it up like a sack of dirty laundry, then, he teleported out of the van with the bulging cape in his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piece of cake!\" he said. <br>\r\n\"If you drop that or if you rip my cape, I am SO gonna kill you!\" Skander shouted. \"Now what?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm off, buddy! Have fun!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Jason soared off. Skander wondered what to do. Up ahead, he could see a police roadblock. The van skidded around the spike-strips, lifted onto two wheels and then slammed back down again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't!\" said Skander, he dived under the van, he was an inch from scraping himself against the bitumen road-surface. Slowly, he began to rise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe van's wheels lifted off the road, the van lifted off the road! Soon, it was hovering in mid-air. Holding onto the front axle, Skander started flying, carrying the van on top of him like a parachute backpack. He wondered what to do. Suddenly, he felt movement. The sliding door in the side of the van opened! A man leaned out holding a gun. He stuck his head underneath the van and started firing at Skander. Skander ignored him. The bullets bounced off him and he kept on flying. The man fired desperately. One bullet hit Skander's shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a pretence of pain, Skander let out a yelp and his right hand let go of the axle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsupported, the van lurched over to the right. The man screamed as he fell out. Skander let go of the van entirely now. He let it drop. Diving after the man, he snatched him easily out of the sky and then went flying back towards the van. He threw him into the open side door and slammed it shut after him, then dived back underneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, please remember to keep all exterior doors closed at all times, thank you\", he said, his voice echoing inside the van's cabin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Skander saw what he wanted. The local police-station. The road was clear ahead, and behind and below, Skander could see helicopters from the police and news companies, police-cars and reporters and cameramen, racing after him, all trying to get the best story, the best pictures... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, please prepare for landing,\" said Skander. Bending his arms back, he threw the van forward. It soared through the air, coming closer and closer to the ground. The men inside screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe van hit the road! The front two tyres exploded on impact and the van skidded and slid and slithered along, on its bare rims and the tyres of the back wheels. Sparks flew and rubber screeched...until it finally came to a halt, the front bumper of the van just nudging the gates leading into the police station's impound yard. </span></div></div>",

The boys all whipped around to see everyone frozen in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is that?\" Adrian asked. <br>\r\n\"It's the fire-alarm!\" Skander said. He heard the deep \"Whoooop! Whoooop!\" of the siren and the high, jangling of the electronic bells. \"Reggie, Mike, you stay here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you guys going!?\" Mike shouted. But Skander, Jason and Adrian had already run off. They bumped into a group of teachers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happened?\" Jason asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's two fires!\" one of the teachers shouted, \"One in the science-block, one in the library-complex!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason turned from Skander to Adrian, wondering what to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two go to the library, I'll handle the science-complex,\" Adrian said. <br>\r\n\"What? No way!\" Skander shouted. <br>\r\n\"There's gonna be gas and acid and chemicals and all kinds of poisonous stuff in the science-block! I'm already dead! I don't care about that stuff! I can't die again!

Thick, black smoke was blasting out the windows and pouring into the skies above. The library across the road was also belching out smoke, thick, white, fluffy plumes of it. Skander and Jason headed inside. Jason sniffed and coughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you smell plastic?\" he shouted over the wailing of the siren, \"I can!\"<br>\r\n\"What do we DO?\" Skander shouted. <br>\r\n\"Downstairs!\" Jason said, \"We can start there and move up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys rushed downstairs. Offices and warehouses were everywhere down here, they stored paper, books, records and computers. As the boys went down lower, the lights flickered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELLO!?\" Skander shouted. The smoke was almost unbearable down here. They coughed and tried to keep low to the ground. Jason pushed open a door into one of the offices. Everything was on fire! Skander sniffed the air. He smelt something...strange...tangy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's GAS!\" he shouted, \"Let's get the hell outta...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOOOOOOOM!!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe building shook! Plaster and light-fixtures came crashing down! Skander just remembered the staff-complex and its kitchen were part of the library building. The fire must've set off the gas-mains in the kitchen! Flames roared and crackled! They were so loud, the boys couldn't even hear the sirens and bells down here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He...eehheh...HELLO!\" Jason coughed. He saw something on the ground, \"Hey! Skander who is that!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys rushed forward to see a man lying in a corridor. He was wearing a blue suit. It was Mr. Webster, one of the legal-studies teachers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You grab him!\" Jason shouted. Skander lifted the man onto his back. He wasn't very heavy, but because Skander had to bend so low to keep out of the smoke, it wasn't easy keeping his balance. He sneezed and coughed as the smell of melted plastic became overpowering! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just fly!\" Jason shouted. Skander grabbed Mr. Webster and levitated, then, flew! The two boys floated and shot along the corridors and up the stairs. They reached the foyer. They smashed out the glass doors into the courtyard and Skander flew Mr. Webster out onto the school oval. Boys and girls shouted and pointed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Stryker and Blade!\"<br>\r\n\"Whoooooo!\"<br>\r\n\"YOU GO BOYS!\"<br>\r\n\"Look out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander and Jason flew back in and kept searching the building, they rushed upstairs to see the library doors closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell!?\" Jason shouted, \"These things won't open!\"<br>\r\n\"I bet the electrics shorted out!\" Skander yelled back, \"These doors are probably jammed!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors into the library were made of stainless steel and glass. The glass was breakable, but the elaborate latticework of steel bars was not. Skander and Jason ripped, kicked, bent and pummelled until they had created a hole big enough for them to get through. They climbed through it into the hot and smoke-filled library. They could see broken windows and people on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" Jason shouted, \"Grab as many as you can and let's get the hell outta here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander grabbed people by their shirts, gathering them up like shopping-bags and then flying through one of the broken windows, over the top of the building and over to the oval. A firetruck pulled up nearby and firemen started unreeling hoses and plugging them into hydrants. Red and white lights flahed as ambulances, sirens wailing, skidded into the schoolyard. Skander and Jason dropped off their loads and then flew back into the library to find more people...this was a real nightmare! </span></div></div>",

The two boys moved from room to room, but everyone seemed to be out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" Skander shouted to Jason, \"We...ahheh!...We better move!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys hovered into the air when suddenly they heard a groaning noise. What was that? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside on the school oval, students screamed as the library and some of the surrounding buildings, collapsed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SKANDER!\" Stacy screamed. <br>\r\n\"JASON!\" Tina yelped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying dazed on the floor with the burning wreckage of the collapsed library all around them, the two superteens tried quickly to assess their situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We gotta get outta here!\" Skander shouted. <br>\r\n\"The rubble's too hot to touch!\" Jason yelled back over the crackling of the flames. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander reached up for a steel beam and touched it. He could see steam rushing up from where he grabbed the beam. But it didn't hurt. He pulled his hand away. It wasn't even burnt! Perhaps if he tried his plasma beams, he could blast their way out? Yeah... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander clenched his hands and threw them open again. Something blasted out from his palms and hit the beams!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly it wasn't energy beams. It was...water! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jason! Look!\" Skander said. He tried it again. Concentrating hard, Skander could turn his hands into firehoses! Jason watched, and then tried himself. Together, the boys managed to put out enough of the fire to lift the rubble off them. They flew out into the air and then soared down onto the oval again. Students and teachers cheered and waved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! That was incredible!\" said Stacy, hugging Skander as he landed next to her. \"And you're still the cutest...\" she said. Skander smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh look,\" she said, grabbing one of his huge arms, \"You cut yourself!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander checked his right arm. There was a nasty cut running along his arm. He shrugged, \"It's nothing\".<br>\r\n\"Makes you look tough...\" she said, grinning. Skander nodded. He started beyond her for a minute, to a figure in black, standing several yards away. Adrian gave them a thumbs up, and vanished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well due to the fire, we won't be able to hold the halloween dance at school this year,\" said the year-level co-ordinator to everyone, \"Electricians and gas-men had to be called in to check all the wiring and pipes and it's just too much hassel to set up the party around them. Now...it would seem that the party would have to be cancelled...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we have to!?\"<br>\r\n\"What about next week?\"<br>\r\n\"Can't we have it outside?\"<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding? Not in this weather!\"<br>\r\n\"What about the gym?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but the gym has to be rewired along with all the other major buildings, those two fires did a lot of damage,\" said their coordinator. \"But, I have had a suggestion\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skander, could you come up here, please?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander got up and walked to the front of the room, \"I spoke to Mr. Cracknell and we've decided that we can hold this year's halloween party,\" Skander said. \"It'll be at my house, for all you guys who've seen it, I think you'll agree it'll be perfect. It'll be this Friday, at six o'clock, you can come in a costume if you wish. But if you can't find one, then formal clothes are expected. If you have any questions, you can leave a note in my locker and I'll catch up with you during school to talk about it\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone started chatting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man this is cool...\"<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks Skander!\"<br>\r\n\"What's your address!?\"<br>\r\n\"Stacy, are you going?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course I'm going!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's got the hots for Skander...rrrawwwr...\"<br>\r\n\"Melissa!...Yeah, isn't he cute?\"<br>\r\n\"Skander, dude, nice work, man\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander smiled. He'd cleared it with his mother and with Jason's parents and Mr. and Mrs. Stone. They all agreed to help prepare for the party on Friday. All he had to do was spread the word! </span></div></div>",

Four teachers and nearly a hundred students poured off the buses onto the pavements. They checked around until they found the right house-number. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStone Manor, the house which Melinda Jones had bought cheap because of rumors it was haunted, towered four storeys high. Lights were off. And apart from the streetlamps, old-fashioned and dim, the whole place was in darkness. They walked up to the front gates, which swung open on their approach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" said one of the boys. They started up the driveway towards the house. Everyone stared around at the enormous building. Skander and his mother lived here alone? Woah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached the front doors and one of the boys rang the doorbell. Slowly, the two double doors creaked open. It was pitch black inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we go in?\" one of the girls asked.<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" said one of the boys. Slowly, the group of about a hundred students and about half a dozen teachers, crowded into the room. The foyer was huge and echoy. The perfect place for a dance. The house was old and creepy. The perfect place for halloween! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELLO!?\" one of the teachers shouted out, \"ANYONE HOME?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answer. Some of the kids tried the lights. They weren't working. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFitzz!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone struck a match. Everyone watched the single glowing matchstick. Then, it lit an oil-lamp, which was turned up bright. Adrian stood at the top of the stairs, holding the lamp in his right hand. The ghostly figure dressed in black. He floated slowly down the stairs towards them, the lamp the only source of light in the entire room. He stopped at the bottom of the stairs. Everyone watched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi!\" one of the boys said, \"We are at the right place, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian vanished. Some of the boys yelped and the girls screamed. Adrian reappeared in the very middle of the room, still holding the lamp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, mortals. And welcome to Stone Manor. My name is Master Adrian. Master Adrian Jeremiah Stone, and I will be your resident ghost this evening. Skander, Jason, the Stone Twins and their parents will be down shortly. In the meantime, make yourselves at home\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian vanished again and appeared next to a fuse-box. He plugged in a few leads, and suddenly, all the lights came on! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooooaaaah...\" everyone gasped as they stared around the grand foyer. \"This is amazing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys!\" said Skander. He was walking down the stairs, dressed in a black, three-piece suit. The Stone twins and Jason followed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's begin, huh?\" said Skander. </span></div></div>",

He groaned. Excellent, the school cheerleading troupe. Nothing but four of the brattiest, sluttiest girls ever. He couldn't stand then. Jason walked up to Skander and shuddered. \"Who invited Bitchzilla and the three Witches?\" he groaned. <br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" said Skander. \"Let's move over to the stairs before they...\"<br>\r\n\"SKAAAANDER!\" <br>\r\n\"Oh god, kill me now!...\" <br>\r\n\"Skaaander! Oh aren't you adoooorable! Muah!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander struggled not to throw up as a face, loaded with lipstick, powder and WAAAAY too much perfume, was shoved offensively close to him. Lips kissed him and then withdrew. Skander gagged from the overpowering scent of lavender. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what was that about?\" Stacy asked, smiling. <br>\r\n\"Never mind!\" Skander coughed, \"I...I think I'm gonna be sick! Who the hell invited her here!?\"<br>\r\n\"I dunno, but gossip about a party at YOUR place spreads like fire on gas, she could've found out any old way!\" Stacy said. <br>\r\n\"Well thank god nobody likes her much. Perhaps she'll leave,\" Jason said. \"At least she has the decency to stick to her own group of friends\". <br>\r\n\"Don't look now, but she's starting to spread out,\" said Stacy. <br>\r\n\"Who invited HER?\" Tina asked, walking up to Skander with a tall, solid-looking footballer with thick, blonde hair. <br>\r\n\"Who's this?\" Skander asked.<br>\r\n\"Oh this is Darcy! He's Melissa's boyfriend...isn't he CUTE?\" <br>\r\n\"Hey,\" said Darcy, shaking Skander's hand. The guy had a palm so huge it must've taken a fortune teller two weeks to read it. <br>\r\n\"Hey,\" said Skander. <br>\r\n\"So you're the flyboy, huh?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah\".<br>\r\n\"Wanna show me some of your 'moves'?\"<br>\r\n\"I...Not right now...\" said Skander. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, Darcy,\" said Adrian, walking into the group, \"Is there something wrong, Skander?\"<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Skander asked, he whipped his head back. \"Oh...just some...girls. Oh god why did they have to come! And...OH NO!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour of the biggest, strongest, most arrogant jocks that the school could possibly produce, just entered the foyer. <br>\r\n\"Oh no...this is gonna ruin everything!\" Skander groaned. <br>\r\n\"Yo dude!\" said Skander's friend Richard, \"Why are THEY here?\"<br>\r\n\"I DUNNO! WHO THE HELL TOLD THEM!?\" Skander shouted over the sound of the music and chatter. <br>\r\n\"Not me!\" said Richard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey pipsqueak! Get over here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys looked up to see Lance, one of the taller jocks, beckon Reginald over. The boy was half his size, and he was holding a cup of...something. <br>\r\n\"What took you so long!?\" the giant snapped. He yanked the cup out of the boy's hand and then peered into it, \"I asked for COKE! Not fanta! I hate Fanta!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah but the Coke's not...\" <br>\r\n\"I said I wanted COKE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bully tipped the orange, fizzy drink over the boy's head, \"Now go and do it!\" <br>\r\n\"Laance!\" said Francie, \"Don't be so mean!...What're you looking at you little piece of tripe? Go off and get his drink! GO!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl shoved Reggie and he fell over onto the floor. Adrian vanished. He reappeared behind his nephew and lifted him up. \"Get to your room next door and change before your parents see you,\" said Adrian, and shoved his nephew out the front door and across the street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who ARE those guys?\" Adrian asked Skander, a few minutes later. <br>\r\n\"You don't wanna know, Adrian...\"<br>\r\n\"Oh YES I DO,\" Adrian said fiercely, \"That big fellow over there just shoved my nephew onto the floor and tipped Fanta all over his clothes! I wanna teach him a lesson...\" <br>\r\n\"Adrian!!!\" Skander said. <br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\" Jason asked, popping up next to Skander. The two boys told him. <br>\r\n\"Ooooooh...\"<br>\r\n\"Let me scare them. Let me do it. I'll scare them good!\" Adrian said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Skander and his mom live here and it's supposed to be some sort of 'haunted house'...Yeah right! Perhaps they got it because it was a total dump! But haunted? Gimme a break!\" Lydia said. <br>\r\n\"A DUMP?\" Adrian snarled, \"In the Belle Epoque, this was one of the finest houses in town! Oh let me scare them, just this once!\" <br>\r\n\"Adrian!\" Skander said, then he lowered his voice, \"You're a ghost...You better do a damn good job. Make them run out of the house screaming if you can\". <br>\r\n\"Oh come to me, dark powers...\" said Adrian, holding up his arms dramatically. <br>\r\n\"You're not serious, are you?\" Jason asked, nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian turned around and grinned, evilly. His eyes flashed red. Then, he vanished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I mean, a ghost-house?\" Lydia continued, \"Yeah right...I bet this place is real spooky!\" <br>\r\n\"You have no idea, sweetheart...\" Adrian whispered in her ear. He wafted invisibly around them, grinning. What should he do? Should he start off small? Build to something big? Hmmm... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swarmed over to the beverage-table and scooped up some cold water in his hands. He floated back and dribbled it over the eight, unwanted guests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lance! Watch it with your drink!\" Roz hissed. <br>\r\n\"I didn't do anything!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah you did! You keep getting water on me!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm drinking COKE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian decided to do some classic ghosty stuff. He floated into a portrait hanging on the wall. The painting started rattling and swaying back and forth on its hook. The jocks and cheerleaders stared at it nervously. The lights flickered. The music died and came back on again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like this house is kinda creepy,\" said Bradley, one of the jocks. <br>\r\n\"Oh pleeease!\" said Lydia, \"I wouldn't believe this house was haunted unless a ghost popped up right in front of me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh?\" Adrian said to himself, \"Be careful what you wish for...\" he whispered in Lydia's ear. \"Because it might...come...TRUE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eight of them screamed as Adrian shot out of the floor, right through the middle of the circle they'd created for themselves! His eys glowed a horrific, vampirish red, his teeth were sugar-white and to the screaming teenagers, he looked just like a vampire! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dare to defame the house of my family! For this you will PAY!\" he roared. He shot into the air and swooped down on the girls. With surprising strength, he hoisted Lydia up into the air by her hair and flew her out the door. Her friends screamed and raced out of the house!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude!\" Darcy said, \"That was AWESOME!\" <br>\r\n\"Oh thank you,\" said Adrian, \"I haven't done a good scare in decades...\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he approached the hall, he saw Adrian standing in the middle of the foyer, underneath the chandelier, playing a violin. Sweet, relaxing music wafted through the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you could play the violin,\" said Skander, grinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian finished playing. He turned around to face Skander. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister Skander, there is a LOT about me that you don't know,\" he said. \"And this is just one of those things.

He reached his bedroom, stripped to his boxers and stretched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone wolf-whistled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ADRIAN!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost popped out of the mirror, grinning. \"Get to bed,\" he said. <br>\r\n\"Not if you're gonna perv on me! I never knew ghosts could be gay...\"<br>\r\n\"Oh where's your sense of humor? Go on, bed! I'll turn out the lights\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander sighed. He got into bed and Adrian floated around the room and turned out the lights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anyone outside had bothered to look onto the roof of the Stone Manor, they might've seen a young man sitting on the chimney.

Not a typewriter!\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but I've got a typewriter's fingers!\" said Adrian, laughing, \"I'm used to applying more pressure than I usually do...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Krrrrch!* <br>\r\n\"Calling Stryker, calling Stryker, this is Commissioner Weston calling Stryker, over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander jumped off his bed and grabbed up the mouthpiece for the radio on his desk. He jiggled one of the knobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stryker here, reading you loud and clear, over!\" <br>\r\n\"Weston here. Assemble team at police HQ, in my office. Important meeting, over\". <br>\r\n\"What time, over?\"<br>\r\n\"ASAP. On verge of important drugs bust, require assistance, over\". <br>\r\n\"We're on our way. Over and out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander stripped down and tugged on his red and black uniform while Adrian vanished to find Jason. The two super-teens and their spiritual guide flew off until they reached the police headquarters. They teleported into the commissioner's office and sat down...Or in Adrian's case, hovered over a chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You boys are prompt!\" said the commissioner, \"But that's just as well. We have a very VERY delicate situation\". <br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\" Skander asked.<br>\r\n\"We've finally located a gang of drug-dealers,\" said Weston, \"They do everything. Cocaine, marajuianna, heroin, meths, opium, ice, you name it!...\"<br>\r\n\"So it's a drugs bust, why do you need us?\" Skander asked. <br>\r\n\"BeCAUSE they're in a place where we can't touch them,\" the commissioner said. \"If we could get them out, we could pounce them at once...But if we can't\". <br>\r\n\"Well where are they located?\" Skander asked. <br>\r\n\"Whitmarsh Manor...\"<br>\r\n\"Whitwhatwhere?\" <br>\r\n\"Whitmarsh Manor. It's an old Victorian mansion about ten miles from here, out on the coastline, near the town of Whitmarsh. Problem is, the building's isolated and it's very easy for them to escape. Whitmarsh backs onto the sea. If we drove up in our cars, they'd simply slip down to the water on the other side and get away in boats\".<br>\r\n\"Why don't you go by land AND sea?\" Jason asked.<br>\r\n\"We'd like to, but its pretty dangerous. Also, there's a helipad there...\"<br>\r\n\"A what?\" Adrian asked.<br>\r\n\"A helicopter landing-pad...Well, not really. It's an old tennis-court or something, or so our survelliance photos tell us...but they could also get away by air. And if they do that...Well, I don't think we'd ever catch them\". <br>\r\n\"So what do you want US to do?\" Skander asked.<br>\r\n\"Find them, capture them, turn them over to us,\" said Weston, \"PREFERABLY alive, but from what I hear, these guys won't be taken in that state\". <br>\r\n\"Well, we're on our way,\" said Skander. \"Where do we go?\"<br>\r\n\"Whitmarsh is about ten miles south of here,\" the commissioner said, \"You should see it, it's a fairly big town, but not huge. The manor's right on the edge of town\". <br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Skander, \"Well, come on guys!...We'll see you later, Commissioner. How do we contact you if we want to?\"<br>\r\n\"A phone-call will do. But some of my men will follow a few miles behind you, just in case\".<br>\r\n\"Right,\" said Jason, \"let's go!\" </span></div></div>",

Adrian took a deep breath and sighed. <br>\r\n\"Something wrong?\" Skander asked.<br>\r\n\"Those no good, conniving little bastards...\" Adrian said. <br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"USING OUR HOUSE!\" Adrian roared. <br>\r\n\"What!? Adrian what are you talking about!?\" Skander shouted. <br>\r\n\"Whitmarsh Manor is OUR manor!\" Adrian said, \"It's belonged to the Stone Family since it was built! Or it did...By rights this should belong to Geoffrey and his family! And damn it, I'm going to claim it back!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the two other teens could stop the ghost, Adrian had soared through the roof of the house. Skander looked at Jason, who shrugged. The two teens vanished into the house with Adrian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlying through the house so as to make as little noise as possible, the three figures scoped the place out. They finally discovered the various drugs labs in the basements. There were twelve men there, with chemistry sets and fires and bunsen-burners and all kinds of things. They had obviously got the lights working, because one man was watching television. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me do this...\" Adrian whispered. <br>\r\n\"What are you going to do?\" Skander asked.<br>\r\n\"Shhhhh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian floated into the room, invisibly. Just his outline could be seen. And in the dim room, it wasn't easy to see it unless you knew what you were looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors slammed shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo what the hell, man!?\" one of the gangsters shouted, \"What's goin' on!?\" <br>\r\n\"It's just the wind,\" one of the other men said.<br>\r\n\"Luther, all the doors just slammed shut!\"<br>\r\n\"Well then OPEN them!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man who spoke first went to try and open the door to the ground floor, but it was locked! <br>\r\n\"Hey Luther! The door's locked!\"<br>\r\n\"What? Let me try...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man named Luther rattled the handle, but sure enough, the door was locked. <br>\r\n\"Oh real smart, Timmy, you didn't put the chocks under the doors to stop them MOVING, and now we're trapped in here!\"<br>\r\n\"I DID put the chocks under the doors!\" <br>\r\n\"Hey guys!\" said another man, \"Is someone checkin' all these chemical sets?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two arguing black men turned around to see a fat white man with a red beard who looked like a biker, who was pointing to the chemistry sets. The drugs and chemicals inside the beakers were bubbling furiously! Whatever might have happened next was suddenly interrupted by several loud blasts! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beakers exploded and glass flew everywhere! The bunsen burners flared up and soon all the workbenches were on fire! Skander and Jason were peering through the keyhole in the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooooah...Adrian's got it goin' on!\" Jason said. <br>\r\n\"Where? Let me see!\" Skander said, and he bent down to the keyhole. His jaw dropped. Men were throwing water onto the workbenches, but it wasn't helping! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get the hell outta here!\" one of the men shouted.<br>\r\n\"HOW!? That idiot Tim locked us in!\"<br>\r\n\"I DID NOT!\"<br>\r\n\"No he didn't...\" said a voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone froze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian appeared, hovering over the fires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shiiit!...\"<br>\r\n\"HOW DARE YOU DEFILE THE HOUSE OF MY FAMILY! YOU WILL BE VERY SORRY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a blast like a nuclear bomb going off, and the twelve men were thrown back. Skander and Jason flinched at the sounds of bodies hitting the floor and walls. They waited for a few minutes, then teleported into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done,\" said Adrian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't KILL THEM did you?\" Skander asked.<br>\r\n\"Nooo!...Just knocked them out. Help me bind and gag them. Then we can get them outta here!...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing electrical cords and tape, they bound the crooks up like turkeys, and flew them out to the waiting police-vans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Niiice...Niiiiiice!\" said Weston, as other officers clapped and cheered. \"Good work, boys!\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks commissioner!\" said Skander. <br>\r\n\"You boys'll be getting a BIG cheque in the mail, I can promise you that,\" said the commissioner, \"Good work!...By the way, we heard an explosion inside. I hope nothing was damaged?\"<br>\r\n\"Eehm...I hope you weren't counting on taking photos and evidence,\" said Skander, \"Their drugs lab is a bit of a mess...\"<br>\r\n\"We'll send in a clean-up team anyway,\" said Weston, \"Take some snapshots, some bits and pieces, then...Well I don't know what'll happen next, this house has been abandoned for years...\" <br>\r\n\"We'll figure something out,\" said Adrian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the evidence-gathering team entered the house and the other cops left with their arrested suspects, the three friends sat on the cliff overlooking the sea below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Adrian...\" Jason said.<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\"<br>\r\n\"You said this house belonged to your family...\"<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\"<br>\r\n\"I had an idea...\"<br>\r\n\"Hmmm?\" <br>\r\n\"You think...ehm...we could have it?\"<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" <br>\r\n\"N-n-not...like...I mean...\" Jason spluttered, \"As a hideout?\" <br>\r\n\"A hideout?'<br>\r\n\"A headquarters! We could repair it, clean it up, renovate it, bring back all the old charm! And then downstairs, we could make like a whole 'Bat-cave' dealie, with all our high-tech stuff...What do you say?\"<br>\r\n\"I dunno...\"<br>\r\n\"PLEEEEAAASE?\" <br>\r\n\"Well...nobody really owns the house...I WAS going to give it to Geoffrey,\" Adrian said, \"BUT...I think you might have a good idea there. We certainly have the money to renovate it...\" </span></div></div>",

There's five bathrooms upstairs, two downstairs...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian walked slowly down the stairs leading into the foyer of Whitmarsh Manor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really seem to know this house,\" said Tina, \"I can't believe you got the whole place renovated and restored and...re...-everything! In just three months!\"<br>\r\n\"Skander and Jason are very fast and efficient workers,\" Adrian said, \"And we had a lot of help. Here is the drawing-room, the ballroom, the music-room, the main dining-room, the kitchens, store-rooms, billiard-room and at the back here, the swimming-pool, home gymnasium and general conservatory\". <br>\r\n\"Woooow...\" said Tina. <br>\r\n\"All the weights are specially cast from lead,\" Adrian said, \"So as they would be heavy enough to pose a challenge...however small...to Skander and Jason\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy grinned, \"I think they should've used cars\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost smiled, \"Perhaps. The garage is accessed through that passage there. There's also the tennis-court out the back. Now, through these doors...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian opened a pair of doors underneath the grand staircase which led into the foyer, \"...lead into our...secret lair...of sorts. Come\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the top few floors of Whitmarsh Manor had been lovingly and carefully renovated, refurbished and restored to original, Belle Epoque style of the turn of the century, as was Adrian's desire, the basements of the mansion were like a timewarp into the twenty-first century. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Through this door is the computer-room, with twenty-four hour highspeed internet access, printers, scanners, four PCs...\"<br>\r\n\"Four?\" Stacy asked.<br>\r\n\"One for me, one for Skander, one for Jason, and one spare,\" Adrian said. \"Next door is the radio and communications room. It has telephones and a radio transmitter and reciever. On the other side of the corridor, is the home theater, bathroom and storage-rooms for equipment and...other necessities\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander and Jason strolled down the stairs into the basements, \"Hey girls,\" Skander said, \"How're you liking Adrian's tour?\"<br>\r\n\"It's great!\" said Stacy, \"What a beautiful house!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrring!...rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrring!!...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh damn!\" Adrian grumbled. And he quickly teleported upstairs. He appeared next to the desk in the study and he picked up the handset of an old-style telephone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" <br>\r\n\"Hey Uncle Adrian, just wanted to know how things were going?\" <br>\r\n\"Wonderful Geoffrey, wonderful. Why?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh we were all...well...wondering...When you guys might be throwing a housewarming party?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't think that's been discussed, but I'll see what I can do\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian hung up and headed back downstairs... </span></div></div>",

Geoffrey squeezed the hooter three times. The gates rattled, and swung slowly open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool!\" said Reggie. \"So this house really belonged to our family?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Geoffrey, \"It's beautiful, isn't it? I really gotta say, the fixed it up great\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car drove in, and parked under the verandah. They got out and headed to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see a bell anywhere,\" said Susan. <br>\r\n\"There it is!\" said Reggie, pointing to a heavy chain and knob. Susan grabbed it and pulled. Inside, they could hear a loud clanging sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow,\" she said, \"An actual bell! This kinda neat...\"<br>\r\n\"See? I told you you'd love it,\" said Geoffrey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sudden gust of wind and a young man dressed in black appeared behind the family, holding an old oil lamp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan screamed and the boys jumped. Geoffrey whirled around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christ! Don't DO that!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian headed towards the door and opened it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in,\" he said. \"You are expected. Welcome...to Whitmarsh Manor\". <br>\r\n\"Are we the first here, Adrian?\" Geoffrey asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes sir. We're also expecting the girls, Jason's parents, their friends, Skander's mother and colleagues, and the residents of Whitmarsh, the town down the road\". <br>\r\n\"Oh swell,\" said Geoffrey. \"Hey, why haven't you turned the lights on?\" <br>\r\n\"With so many people, and with the wiring not yet fully tested, we did not want to overload the circuitry,\" Adrian explained. \"We will be using lamps and candles for this evening, except in the kitchen. I hope you don't mind?\" <br>\r\n\"Not at all,\" said Susan, \"It looks kinda cool\".<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. This may be cool, but the weather outside is not,\" said Adrian, \"There is a fire in the drawing room, if you wish to wait in there\". <br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Susan, \"I love the furniture!\" <br>\r\n\"I insisted on it,\" said Adrian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Uncle Adrian, can we stick with you?\" Reggie and Mike asked. Adrian smiled, \"Certainly, if you like\".<br>\r\n\"Can I carry the lamp?\" Mike asked.<br>\r\n\"No,\" said Adrian. He put the lamp on the coffee-table in front of the drawing-room fireplace. \"You may carry the candles, howeer\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike and Reggie took up the candlesticks and followed their ghostly relative into the hall. The doorbell rang again and Adrian went to answer it. It was Tina, Stacy, their parents and their brothers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Adrian!\" said Tina, \"Where's my Jason?\"<br>\r\n\"He's in the kitchen,\" said Adrian.<br>\r\n\"What's with the candles?\" Stacy's father asked. <br>\r\n\"We did not want to overload the power-grid just yet,\" said Adrian, \"We're not too sure of the wiring at the moment\". <br>\r\n\"Oh okay...the candles are a nice touch\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen, Stacy and Tina watched Skander and Jason working at the speed of light. Sandwiches, sausages, pizzas and sausage-rolls were being cooked, made, sliced, baked and boiled at the speed of light. Trays, platters and bowls filled with food were being turned out at amazing speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adrian, stop being a doorman and start being a waiter!\" Skander said, \"We need to get this food into the drawing room!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian grabbed an entire tray of sandwiches and disappeared. He popped back a minute later, grabbed more food, and vanished again. Stacy's parents smiled at his efficiency. </span></div></div>",

Let's dance!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, everyone found themselves dancing to the ghostly organ music, being provided courtesy of the late Master Adrian Jeremiah Stone.

It looked like it was in serious trouble. Red distress flares went up and exploded into the night sky. Near to the manor, a towering white lighthouse had a light that flashed and shone through the night, two white beams shining out onto the choppy water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could say anything, Skander had run out of the ballroom and through the hall. He threw open the front doors and ran through the grounds, with Jason following behind him. The two boys scrambled down the sides of the cliff and started walking across the water towards the ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking on water was one of Skander's favourite powers. It wasn't easy in rough seas, but it was manageable. He lost his balance many times, but he finally reached the ship, to see passengers gathered on deck. Skander and Jason were both wearing their black and red lycra costumes, which they wore under all their other clothes at all times. People shouted and pointed and the two boys scrambled up the side of the ship, pulling themselves up hand over hand, up the anchor-chains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifeboats were loaded with passengers, but the storm was too rough to allow the boats to be launched safely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we'll have to fly them off!\" Skander shouted at Jason. Jason nodded. Over the sound of the storm, he waved his hands and Skander understood that Jason wanted to take two lifeboats at the same time. Skander nodded back and mouthed the word \"OK\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLashing two lifeboats together, the crew loaded women and children in. Jason swooped down and grabbed a handful of ropes and flew off, the pair of boats swinging away underneath him like some sort of white, wooden basket with rope handles. Skander did the same. They looked like a pair of storks delivering babies from the ship to the safety of the manor grounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nParty guests ran outside to help bring everyone into the house while Adrian vanished downstairs to the communications room. he was soon on the radio to the nearest emergency centers, which sent ambulances and the coastguard to come and help. </span></div></div>",

Coastguard boats had showed up by this time, and were busy hauling people from the water into their boats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, we need to get more people off!\" Jason shouted over the sound of the storm. <br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Skander said, \"You go that way, I'll...\"<br>\r\n\"Skander! Jason! Hey!! OVER HERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys turned around to see a boy with dirty blond hair struggling through the wind towards them. It took Skander a minute, but then he remembered! Blake, the boy they'd met on the beach, who had invited them to his house for the fanclub meeting. Blake screamed and waved. The ship rocked again and he fell over against he railing of the ship. Skander grabbed him with a powerful right hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Blakie! What're you doing here!?\" Skander shouted. <br>\r\n\"This was supposed to be a holiday!\" Blake screamed back, \"SOME HOLIDAY! GET ME THE HELL OUTTA HERE!\" <br>\r\n\"Hold on, buddy!\" Jason shouted. He grabbed Blake's other hand. \"Ready!?\" Jason shouted again. The two boys nodded, and they flew off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they landed back at Whitmarsh Manor, they hurried Blake inside. Blake changed into some of Skander's clothes upstairs and then went downstairs to find his parents. The housewarming party was still going, and survivors were being welcomed into Whitmarsh Manor with open arms and being served food and drinks. Blake stared around everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is amazing!\" he said. </span></div></div>",

They sent emails, listened in on radio, watched the news and kept track of everything that was going on. They helped out the cops in high-speed persuits, in apprehending criminals and in dealing out their own vigilante justice. A powerful searchlight on the roof of Whitmarsh kept the coastline safe, and all around for dozens of miles, people could see the light swinging around, shining out a beacon of hope and safety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man dressed in a suit strolled up the driveway of Whitmarsh Manor. He carried a briefcase in one hand. He reached the gates and pulled a bell-cord. The bell swung and jangled and the man waited for someone to respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May help you?\" <br>\r\n\"Yaaaah!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian walked up to the man from behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah,\" said the man, \"I'm here to speak to Stryker and Blade about a uh...proposition\". <br>\r\n\"Business?\" the ghost asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Who are you?\"<br>\r\n\"Just the caretaker,\" said Adrian. He unlocked the gate. \"Come in\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man bent down and picked up his briefcase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thanks for unlocking the...\" he said, but Adrian had vanished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously, the man headed up the driveway. Behind him, the gates slammed shut again and locked. He reached the front porch and knocked on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" said Adrian, opening the door. <br>\r\n\"Jesus!\" the man yelped, \"How'd you get here so fast!?\"<br>\r\n\"I am the caretaker, sir. I know my way around this entire house. Stryker and Blade are in the library, upstairs, to the left, sir\". <br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" said the man. Adrian closed the door and turned around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I take your hat, sir?\" Adrian asked.<br>\r\n\"Oh thanks,\" said the man, handing Adrian a grey fedora hat. <br>\r\n\"And your coat?\"<br>\r\n\"No, I'd rather keep this on me, thanks\".<br>\r\n\"Yes sir. Right upstairs, sir\". <br>\r\n\"Thanks\", and the man started up the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So caretaker, how old is this...\" the man began, but Adrian had vanished again. <br>\r\n\"What the hell!?...Okay...No more double martinis before lunch...\" he mumbled to himself. He reached the top of the stairs and walked around the landing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!?\" he called out. A door opened and a handsome, blond-haired teenager stuck his head out. <br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n\"Aaaah, you must be Stryker,\" said the man.<br>\r\n\"Yeah\". <br>\r\n\"My name's James Matherson...\"<br>\r\n\"Come in,\" said Stryker. James entered the library and Skander closed the door. <br>\r\n\"Tell me,\" said Stryker, \"What I can do for you...Blade! Wake up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grunted and sat up in his chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?...oh! Hi!\" he said. Jason shook the man's hand and pointed to a chair, \"Sit down\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys, I come as a representative of Miss Degeneres...\"<br>\r\n\"Degeneres...Ellen Degeneres?\" Skander asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah! She's been watching you fellows on TV and she'd love it if you could make a spot on her daytime talkshow\". <br>\r\n\"Oooooh,\" sad Skander, \"So that's it, huh?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes\". <br>\r\n\"Sounds intriuging\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man smiled, \"She's willing to pay you $2000 each for your appearances\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason whistled, \"How much!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two thousand each\". <br>\r\n\"Saaay, that's not bad,\" Jason said. \"How can we contact her?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames smiled, \"Here's a card,\" he said, handing Skander a card with some names and numbers on it. \"If you give her a phone-call, you guys can talk over everything with her and arrange a date and time. She would like you on her NEXT show, if you can manage it\".<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" said Skander.<br>\r\n\"And here's my card,\" said James, \"Just in case you need to contact me about anything. Now, if I can find my hat, I'll be off...\"<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" said Skander. <br>\r\n\"Where's your caretaker?\" James asked.<br>\r\n\"Caretaker?\" Jason asked, \"What caretaker?\"<br>\r\n\"What...I...this...guy. Young guy, twenties, wore black. He let me in here!\" James said, \"Where is he?\" <br>\r\n\"I dunno who you're talking about,\" said Skander, \"We don't have a caretaker at Whitmarsh, or a butler or anything!\" <br>\r\n\"But...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man turned around dizzily, then, he noticed his hat on the table. His jaw dropped. He snatched up the hat, which certainly wasn't there a second ago, and jammed it on his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes well...thanks for your time, boys! If you need any help, you ring the numbers on those cards!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man turned around headed out of the library and down the stairs. He reached the bottom when the figure in black appeared in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your briefcase, sir,\" Adrian said, holding it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames's jaw dropped. Snatching it out of Adrian's hand, he ran out of the house and down the road, through the mysteriously opened gates, and into his car. A minute later, the screeching of tires could be heard as the expensive Mercedes sped off! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adrian!\" Jason said. <br>\r\n\"I haven't had a good scare in yeeeaaars,\" Adrian said, \"That was SO much fun\". <br>\r\n\"Hopefully as fun as this,\" said Skander, picking up the phone... </span></div></div>",

Skander couldn't believe he was holding Robin Williams' autograph! They all chatted and joked until one by one, they were called out. Skander and Jason were the 'Grand Finale' of that week's show, so they waited the longest. Not that they complained.

Adrian hovered absent-mindedly near the bookcase, checking out Skander's collection of literature. Skander was busy tuning the dials and trying to find something juicy on the airwaves...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...Domestic disturbance at...\" Krrrrch \"Hit and run at the corner of Elm and....\" Krrrch \"Code Three, Code Three, shooting and robbery at 43 Banker Street.

That's pretty far, isn't it?\" Adrian asked. \"We better teleport.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanging into their costumes at super-speed, the two boys disappeared into thin air, with Adrian following behind. They reached the apartment-block and looked around. It was all in semi-darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell are we supposed to see anything!?\" Skander said to Jason. Adrian materialised in front of them. He was glowing a ghostly white glow which lit up the immediate area around him. \"Come on,\" he said, \"I saw someone moving nearby...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander and Jason jogged around, searching here and there. They heard a deafening blast and Jason jumped as a shotgun slug hit him in the stomach. It flattened against his abs and fell to the ground. Jason reached out and grabbed blindly. Skandler raced over and suddenly found the shotgun-barrel shoved into his mouth! The gun fired and Skander felt hot lead fill his mouth. More angrily than anything else, Skander bit the muzzle of the shotgun off. Then, he slowly started munching on the barrel, his diamond-hard teeth smashing through the metal, right down to the trigger-guard. The robber goggled at the sight before him of a teenager eating up his shotgun. Skander spat and the twisted, mashed-up remains of the gun clattered to the ground, followed by the 'clunk!' of the slug fired into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough joking,\" said Skander, \"Come on Blade, get him up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason heaved the man up. Skander picked up a steel fencepost lying nearby and wrapped it around the man's wrists like one of those flexible wire bag-ties. He bent the steel bar as easily as if it was wire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should keep him from waving his arms around,\" said Skander, \"Now only if we could see!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robber let out a howl and jerked his head back! Two very bright, white beams of light struck him square in the face! \"WHO ARE YOU GUYS!?\" he screamed. He struggled with the bar wrapped around his hands, trying to cover his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stryker, your eyes!\" Jason said. \"Look!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander stared around. Two, super-bright 'eyelights' blazed out of his eyes, bright as lighthouse lamps. Jason quickly said, \"I wanna be able to see!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes blazed white, and two bright beams shot out. Using their new-found power, the two boys dragged the man back to the apartment-complex. The ambulance was there and paramedics were carting a man away on a stretcher. A man in official-looking uniform strode towards the boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evening boys!\" he shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Commissioner Weston. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evening, Commissioner,\" said Skander, \"Here's the suspect, all gift-wrapped for you.\"<br>\r\n\"I see you're making good use of that eh...little present I sent you.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's great,\" said Jason. \"Real useful.\"<br>\r\n\"Excellent, excellent...Listen, you and your msyterious third friend might be able to help me...\"</span></div></div>",

A passenger-jet, a 747 jumbo, came soaring down through the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Jason shouted, \"Don't you hear something!?\"<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Skander shouted. <br>\r\n\"I hear it!\" Adrian shouted, \"Or...Don't hear it!\"<br>\r\n\"WHAT IS IT!?\" Skander yelled. <br>\r\n\"Look at the plane! The engines aren't turning!\" Jason shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the blades of the plane's jet engines were completely stationary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adrian! Hop inside and see what's going on! But for the love of God, don't show yourself!\"  Skander shouted. The ghost dived through the roof of the cockpit... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mayday, mayday, mayday!\" the captain of the plane shouted, \"We are in an emergency, mayday! Tower, do you copy?\"<br>\r\n\"Reading you loud and clear...\"<br>\r\n\"We have run out of fuel, over. We are gliding. I repeat, gliding! Our descent is rapid...Jack, can we make it to the airport?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe co-pilot checked the charts in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's the nearest airport?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"At least a hundred miles...\"<br>\r\n\"Damn it! Then no!\"<br>\r\n\"We may have to make an emergency landing!\" the captain shouted into his microphone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Copy that. U/A Flight 87 preparing for crash-landing...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian had heard enough. He soared up out of the plane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're out of gas!\" he shouted at Skander, \"They're trying to make it to the airport!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is it!?\" Skander asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A hundred miles that-a-way!\" Adrian shouted, pointing ahead. \"The plane's dropping too fast!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You go ahead!\" Skander shouted, \"Jase! Come on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlying either side of the plane, the two boys dived and then flew up under the wings, holding them up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, this isn't as heavy as I thought it was!\" Jason shouted, \"It's like a kite! A heavy kite, but I could carry this thing all day!\"<br>\r\n\"Well try carrying it a hundred miles without dropping it!\" Skander shouted. They kept flying. Then they changed positions, flying over the wings, with their hands holding onto the edges, keeping the plane up, their black and red capes flapping behind them in the slipstream. Passengers stared out the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, please remain calm!\" Skander shouted. He had no idea how loud he was actually shouting. Inside the cabin, the passengers could hear his every word! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit back, enjoy Trident Force Airlines and try to get some sleep! We'll be on the ground soon!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander turned his Hollywood-handsome face to one of the windows and smiled. Everyone waved back. Jason did the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe further they flew, the easier it became to hold the plane. Finally, they saw the runway. The pilots pulled on levers and pressed buttons. The landing-gear came down and the plane hit the runway! The force was considerable and for a second, Skander let go of the plane. Jason struggled to hang on. Flaps in the wings opened up as the plane struggled to slow down. Skander jumped down to the runway and grabbed the axles of the landing-gear. Planting his boots firmly into the ground, he pressed them down, hard! He skidded and scraped along the tarmac, until finally... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmbulances, fire-trucks and airport security rushed over. Skander gasped. He'd sooner try stop a nuclear missile than try and wrestle a loaded jumbo-jet to the ground...Jason was sweating. Suddenly, they saw people rushing towards them... </span></div></div>",

They could see motion-picture cameras, stills cameras, notepads, pens and audiotape recorders in their collective hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are they?\" Jason asked.<br>\r\n\"The Press, I'll bet,\" said Skander, he grinned. \"Come on, buddy-boy, let's get famous...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Hey you kids!\" one of the reporters shouted. <br>\r\n\"Jerry don't call them that!\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, Michael Hayes, <i>Daily Star</i>, Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah, woooooaaaah!\" Jason said, holding up his hands as the two teenagers were surrounded by reporters on all sides. \"Easy, ladies, guys...one at a time, please! Mr. Hayes, I am the Blade and this is my friend the Stryker. Together, we are two parts of a three-person team, and we call ourselves Trident Force. A three-pronged attack force to protect people from crime and danger.\"<br>\r\n\"Impressive!\" said Hayes, writing quickly, \"And how old are you?\"<br>\r\n\"We're sixteen,\" said Stryker. <br>\r\n\"And very handsome, too!\" said one of the lady reporters. The two boys grinned. <br>\r\n\"Hey, here are the pilots!\" one of the reporters said, \"Captain Mitchell, is there anything you'd like to say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain was a man in his fifties. He tugged off his cap and wiped his forehead with a handkerchief. \"When I grew up, I did it with Superman, Batman and all the rest of them. Now that I'm growin' a little older, it's nice to know the city I love...is being well-protected! By these fine fellows,\" he said, he patted Jason and Skander on the shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a photo!?\" someone shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once, a dozen cameras came out of nowhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander looked at Jason, \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh alright...Me in the front.\"<br>\r\n\"Why you?\"<br>\r\n\"Because I look cuter.\"<br>\r\n\"Shove off!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding either side of the captain with the plane behind them, the two boys posed while cameras flashed and plinked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Hayes stepped forward, \"Hey Stryker, how about an autograph?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander shrugged, \"Sure, got a pen?\" <br>\r\n\"Now how would I look? A reporter without a pen!? Here!\" he said, handing Skander a biro. <br>\r\n\"Anything in particular?\"<br>\r\n\"Whatever you like...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>To Mike Hayes, and a long and friendly association with the local media - Stryker</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" the reporter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother reporter stepped forward, \"Excuse me, did I hear you right? You said you have THREE members?\"<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" said Jason. <br>\r\n\"Well there's you, and there's Stryker...where's the third guy?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh he's around...\" said Skander, staring over his shoudler. \"He's always...around...but he prefers to keep out of the limelight. If you look hard...you might find him somewhere...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reporters did, but couldn't find anything. They thanked the boys and dispersed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look hard!\" Adrian said, \"Blind as bats!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the crowd left, he appeared in front of his friends, right at the back of the mob of reporters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkander grinned, \"Sneaky bastard.\"<br>\r\n\"That's me,\" said Adrian, floating over, \"Well...that was satisfying.

The furniture was antique and the carpets were rich red and gold mixed together in fancy patterns. The walls were of carved wood, and with old-style electric lights and lamps everywhere. The staff wore old-fashioned clothes from the 19th century. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flying is great,\" said Skander, looking at Jason, \"But I wish we could just teleport to places, like you do,\" he said, turning to Adrian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not hard,\" said Adrian. \"You just think of where you wanna go and visualise yourself there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said it, the ghost, flying through the sky alongside Jason and Skander, disappeared! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" said Jason. He floated over to Skander and grabbed his arm. \"The Sundowner...\" he whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a rushing sound and a flash of light! Both boys vanished and reappeared on the roof of a building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" said Adrian, watching them appear, \"I told you it wasn't hard...Come on, let's go in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and Skander climbed down an emergency staircase while Adrian slipped through the ceiling. The boys stared around the hotel. Using super-speed, they checked the rooms, going down, floor by floor. They found the hostages and the crooks, desperate drug-dealers, in the middle of a lounge on the fourth floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let the Shadow handle this...\" said Adrian, grinning evilly at his two friends. Skander and Jason held back, watching their ghostly ally do his stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud echoing laugh vibrated around the lounge, as if through surround-sound speakers... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...Muauahahahahahahaa!!...Who knows what evil...Lurks in the hearts of men? Hehehahahahahaah!! The Shadow knows! Hauahahahahahahaha!!...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta admit...\" Jason whispered in Skander's ear, \"Adrian has style!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this!?\" one of the druggies shouted, \"Some stupid radio-broadcast!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother, echoing, evil laugh filled the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" said Adrian. Invisibly, he floated through the air. He surrounded the man who'd spoken. Adrian grabbed a revolver and bullets hidden inside the man's coat. Materialising on the other end of the room, Adrian cocked the pistol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Missing something?\" he asked. He pointed the gun. The people screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you see me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian vanished into thin air, the gun going with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...now you don't!\" he said, his voice echoing creepily around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put down your guns,\" the disembodied voice said. \"And head out where all those nice friendly coppers have their own hotel for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw you!\" one of the men said, \"Who are you!? I swear I'm gonna shoot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't hit whatcha can't see, now can you?\" the ghost asked, and chuckled.<br>\r\n\"Smart-ass...well perhaps not! But I sure as hell can hit what I CAN see!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the man and the others screamed as Adrian appeared barely two feet in front of him, the gun pointed right between the eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, shoot,\" said Adrian. The man was trembling, his hands were shaking so much he could barely hold the gun. He fired! The bullet went right through Adrian and hit the trunk of a potted palm tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Path-et-ic...\" said Adrian, smirking. \"Naughty boy...\" he reached out and grabbed the other gun, stuffing it into his whispy coat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get in there...\" Jason whispered. Skander nodded. They threw open the doors to the lounge and charged in. The men opened fire! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite hopeless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bullets hit Skander and Jason in the chest...but that was it. Rebounding like peas or flattening themselves like miniature globs of mashed-potato, the bullets bounced harmelssly off them. The two boys floated through the air and grabbed the crooks, disarming them quickly and forcing them to the ground. A hostage stood up, \"Who are you guys!?\" he shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trident Force,\" said Jason. He hovered down to the ground. \"Now if you don't mind, I need your tie.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man undid his necktie. Jason used it to tie up the crooks arms behind their backs and to tie them all together until they looked like some ridiculous entry into a crazy race, the four crooks had their hands tied behind their backs, and their hands tied to each other behind their backs, until neither could move at all. The cops raced upstairs and stopped, grinning and laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice work, boys,\" they said. \"Come on, you four...It's gonna be 25 years in the slammer for you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian tugged out the guns from his coat and gave them to Stryker. He whispered something in Skander's ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might want these, officer,\" said Skander, \"Their weapons and ammo.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks kid,\" said the policeman. He opened a bag and dropped them in. \"Okay boys...easy on the stairs...\" </span></div></div>",

I hope that I am dreaming, but some part of me, wants this to be real. Well, I have seen stranger things.<br>\r\nThere was a huge gap of awkward silence as he smokes his cigarette. I decided to break the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So...Why are you here?' I asked nervously.<br>\r\n'I told you, this is my house and this is my room!' he said, tired of repeating himself.<br>\r\n'Yeah, but since I live here now, can we call it MY room?'<br>\r\n'Uhhh... NO!' he said bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think this ghost is trying to get me out of this house. I have to get rid of it somehow, but what can I do? I pinched myself to make sure that I was dreaming. I wasn't. Now that I have established that, I have to find the ghost's weakness. I decide to stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What WERE you're hobbies?' I asked trying to act like I care.<br>\r\n'I used to play Chinese checkers with the butcher's son,' Adrian said, 'he was my best friend.'<br>\r\n'Interesting...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere has to be some way to get rid of him. Using brute force won't work, he's a ghost...that smokes. What are ghosts most afraid of?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh Tim Robbinson,' Adrian was babbling to himself, 'if only I can see you again.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe I can vacuum him into an anti-ghost bag... Wait. Ghosts are afraid of the light. I thought that the light in the room was a bit dark. Where is a strong source of light? I have quite a strong flashlight in my desk drawer. I quietly opened the drawer. That Adrian ghost is still rambling on. I took my flashlight and pointed it at him, switched on, as fast as I can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Die ghost, DIEEEE!' I shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked to see if he is still there, and he was, not impressed at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, so that's how it was going to be!' Adrian sneered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked angry as he approuched me. I am about to be killed by a ghost. What am I going to do? If I was going to do something, I'd better do it fast. I stood up and ran for the door, but the ghost slammed it shut. He took out something that looked like a butcher's knife. It can't end like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, out of the blue, my teeth started to glow. It became brighter and brighter and then...I smiled. The ghost grunted at the sight of the bright light my teeth were giving off. The light became brighter and brighter. The ghost screamed like a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Aaaahhhhh!' he screamed, 'Turn it off, turn it off!'<br>\r\n'Why should I?' I asked angrily.<br>\r\n'I can help you!' he said out of desperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI closed my mouth and therefore dimmed the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can help you,' he repeated, 'only if you help me first.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't know if I can trust him, but help from a ghost can be usefull.<br>\r\nSo what was I to do?</span></div></div>",

He was cornered by this evil character before him, ready to kill him for ownership of the room. Skander kept flashing his pearly-whites at the ghost; constantly smiling, then closing, smiling, then closing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter kid,\" came that voice, \"got a twitch?\" He laughed bitterly, and stabbed at him. Skander raised his arm to defend himself, and, after a few seconds of silence, and hidden eyes, found that there was no pain, as was expected. Instead, as Skander found as he raised his head to view the circumstance, the ghost had turned to stone; pure, physical, touchable stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way,\" Skander whispered in awe, \"no way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood, and looked upon the stone statue that was taking up room in, what is now officially, his room.</span></div></div>",

As Skander fell asleep, he started to feel a strange feeling in his eyes.  He figured that it was just his tired eyes.  \"SKANDER JONES!\"  His English teacher yelled.  \"No falling asleep in my classroom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Mrs. Pinckett,\" Skander yawned.  \"I really don't feel well.  Can I go to the Nurse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll write you a pass,\" Mrs. Pinckett answered reluctantly.  As she was writing his pass, Skander began to notice the weird feeling in his eyes again.  This time though, his eyes were open.  As he looked at Mrs. Pinckett's desk, he noticed he was able to see right through it like it wasn't there.  He screamed bloody murder.  \"Skander, are you okay?\"  The teacher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I need to get home!  I'm in pain!\" Skander lied.  He needed to ask his mother about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just go to the Nurse already!  I have a class to teach,\" Mrs. Pinckett insisted.  Skander ran through the halls to the Nurse, somehow faked a fever, and got a one way ride home from his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I have a question for you,\" Skander informed his mother about his X-ray vision.  \"Why can I do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the answer is quite simple, yet simultaneously unbelievable.  Skander, you and I are actually aliens.  The last of our kind in fact,\" Mrs. Jones explained.  \"Our race has a very rare trait where some can develop super powers.  It is extremely rare.  The last of our race to develop powers died 500 years ago.  However, before I left the planet with you on a regular trade mission, our planet blew up.  When I returned to the site of our planet, it was gone.  I fled to the first planet I could find, which was Earth.  You and I are the only ones left!\"  She started to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I did not know that.\" Skander said with a look of absolute shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not all though,\" Mrs. Jones added.  \"I read up on this rare trait, because the doctors knew that you had it since you were born.  Apparently, on different planets with different atmospheres, different things can happen with the trait.  It depends on the elements in the atmosphere.  Our home planet had a atmosphere made mostly of oxygen and water vapor.  However, I read that nitrogen makes the super power trait much stronger and more developed.  Since this atmosphere is made of almost 80% nitrogen, expect a lot of powers and changes soon.  The powers usually develop when the person turns 17.  You turned 17 one week ago.  This seems right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm going to be developing powers.  I might as well become a superhero!\"  Skander cheered up.  \"I think just having X-ray vision is pretty lame though.  You can't do much with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In due time,\" Mrs. Jones assured Skander.  \"Soon, you will have more.  Until then, you should get some rest.  You didn't sleep well, did you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Jones and Skander arrived at the Jones household, and Skander immediately ran to his bed.  He fell asleep almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he woke up, he felt different.  He walked over to the bathroom, and noticed that his once skinny, tall body became a muscular one.  He looked like a junior bodybuilder, built with big, ripped muscles.  He also felt stronger.  He decided to test his strength by going to his basement gym.  He has been trying to bulk up, but nothing worked.  Now, he needed to see if he got stronger.  He entered the gym, which only had a couple of weights, a barbell, and a bar to do pull ups.  Skander's pull up record before was only 3, but now he felt unstoppable.  He walked up to the bar, jumped onto it, and started pulling up.  It was incredibly easy.  He started doing it with one hand, while holding the heaviest dumbbell he could find in the other.  It was still incredibly easy.  \"I've definitely acquired super strength.  What about speed?\"  He asked himself.  He cleared the middle of the room, and started to run around in a circle.  He got faster and faster and faster, all without tiring.  \"Speed, check.  Flight?\"  He jumped into the air, and started hovering in the air.  He moved around, and landed softly.  \"Check.  Durability?  If not, this is going to hurt.\"  He took the 20 pound dumbbell, held it over his 8 pack abs, and dropped it.  It bounced off harmlessly, leaving no mark, and with Skander feeling no pain.  \"Check, thankfully.  What else can I do?\"  He went back upstairs to his computer, and looked up a list of super powers.  \"What about laser vision?\"  He took a piece of scrap paper, and focused on trying to vaporize it.  Eventually, a beam of light came out of his eyes, setting the paper ablaze.  \"Huh, I wonder if I can make it different colors.  It would be cool to have blue laser eyes.\"  He took another piece of paper, and focused on it, this time thinking about blue.  Somehow, it worked, and the paper burned blue.  \"Cool, what else is here?  Telekinesis.\"  He concentrated on lifting his trash can.  Soon, the can lifted into the air.  Then, he made his bed with his mind, making sure he could do specific things.  Then, for the hell of it, he lifted his bed, both with his arms and mind.  They were both very easy for him.  \"Next is, walking on water.\"  Skander, still only in his shorts, went outside to his pool, and stepped onto the water, only to notice that he was not going under.  He thought about going underwater, and he fell in, only to notice that he could breathe and see clearly underwater.  <i>What can't I do?</i>  He thought.  He swam back up to the surface, where he tried to make an energy ball in his hand, similar to the Dragon Ball series.  It also worked.  As he fired it straight up, he noticed his mother coming home.  She must have gone out food shopping.  Before he was to go into the house to help her and tell her about his powers, he watched as the energy ball exploded high in the sky.  He hoped that he did not hit a plane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Skander, you look different,\" his mother commented on Skander's new physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just found my powers.  There are a lot, and I'm still finding more,\" Skander retorted.  He listed off all the powers he's found.  \"I think if I become a superhero though, I'm going to need a costume.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can make you one,\" Mrs. Jones said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom!\"  Skander said happily.  \"Well, I'm going to see if I have more powers.  See you when I'm done.\"  Skander went back up to his room.  \"Okay, strength, speed, durability, flight, telekinesis, laser eyes, walking on water, breathing underwater, energy balls, x-ray vision, what else?  Teleportation?\"  He focused on himself being on his bed rather than in his chair.  Nothing happened.  \"Oh well, guess I'm flying everywhere.  How terrible,\" he said sarcastically.  \"I don't think shape shifting is something that I'd have.\"  He continued skimming through the lengthy page.  He then came across psychokinesis.  \"Includes pyrokinesis, metalkinesis and hydrokinesis.  Some telekinetics also have these powers.  Let's see if I'm that someone!\"  He took a glass of water, and tried to make the water float.  It worked.  Next, he tried to create a ball of fire in his hand.  It worked.  He made sure that the smoke did not set of the smoke alarm.  Then, he tried to bend his metal trash can without his super strength.  It became a mess of metal.  Finally, at the bottom of the page, he noticed force fields.  Skander tried to conjure up a force field.  He saw a small translucent sphere hovering in the air.  He bent the shape around, making it flat, then a square, then a cube.  The then through a pencil at it.  The pencil bounced off.  He then tried to make a one way force field.  He telekinetically retrieved the pencil, then threw it again.  It bounced off one side of the field.  He retrieved the pencil again, turned the force field around, and threw the pencil, which passed right through.  \"Awesome.  All these powers.  Once mom's done with my suit, I can be a superhero!  I think I'll be The Blaze.\"  Skander made that decision, and went downstairs.  \"Mom, when you make my costume, can you make it with this in mind?  I decided my name was The Blaze.  Thanks mom!\" He requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"  His mother responded.  <i>I hope he uses his powers for good.</i>  She thought.  Unbeknownst to her, Skander heard that, because he can read minds.  He went to the kitchen to make himself some lunch.  He decided to make a sandwich.  As he was cutting it in half, he cut his finger.  The cut closed immediately though.  \"Regenerative healing.  I can get used to this,\" he laughed as he ate his sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules for continuing this story:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't kill Skander, and keep his powers consistent.  If you add some, make sure he goes through the \"discovering a new power\" process.  Keep Skander a hero, but if you want to make an evil super villain, be my guest.  With that, feel free to add on!  Don't be shy!  </span></div></div>",

Need anything?\"  Mrs. Jones asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll call you if I think of anything,\" Skander started.  \"Actually, when you're getting the Lycra, could you get red, yellow, black and blue.  Those are the colors I want.  The blue is for my mask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.  See you when I get back!\"  Mrs. Jones yelled as she left.  Skander was home alone, so he decided to try to master his powers.  He noticed that the more physical powers were much easier to get used to than his more mental ones.  Some were even automatic!  He first tried to master his telekinesis by making another sandwich using only his mind.  Using his mind, Skander took two slices of bread out of the bag and put them in the toaster.  After pushing the tab on the toaster down, he levitated the peanut butter out of the cupboard and grabbed a knife.  Once the bread popped out, he levitated the bread, used the knife to spread the peanut butter and put the slices together, making a flawless peanut butter sandwich.  Right as he grabbed the sandwich, he heard a thump come from the bathroom.  He put the sandwich down, and walked to the bathroom.  Skander smiled as he realized that his powers finally had a practical use.  However, he realized that this guy will know his identity.  Skander thought about how to make sure this guy does not notice his powers.  He'd just wing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Skander walked towards the bathroom, he used his X-Ray vision to look into the room.  He saw a burglar, dressed in all black, getting his bearings.  It must have been a hard thump.  One minute later, the burglar opened the door to see Skander standing there.  \"Hello, I see that you broke into my house at noon.  That's not smart!  People could have seen you!\"  Skander taunted the burglar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a gun,\" the burglar retorted.  \"Not so smug now!  Now get outta the way!\"  He pointed the gun at Skander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not a good idea,\" Skander stated, knowing that the bullets would bounce off him harmlessly.  \"Instead, I'm just going to take you to the police, and turn you in.  Capisce?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so!\"  The burglar yelled as he shot Skander.  Just as the powerful teen predicted, the bullet bounced off his left pec.  The burglar's expression became more frightened.  \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather not say,\" Skander responded as he punched the burglar, knocking him out cold.  \"He needs to forget this happened.\"  All of the sudden, an orange beam came out of Skander's eyes, landing on the burglar.  Skander had no idea what happened.  As he wondered what happened, the burglar woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?  Who's house is this?  Who are you?  What am I doing here?\"  The burglar kept asking questions.  He just gave up and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I wiped his memory of today.  Interesting...\"  Skander grinned as he strolled back into the kitchen to eat his sandwich.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jasper Hillard Davian was your typical, idealised teenage boy. Tallness ran in his family. His cousin Mike was almost seven feet. At six and a half, Jasper felt as small as five two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you coming OUT yet!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a minute!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasper! Come on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper groaned. <i>Mothers!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall, muscular teenager dumped about two gallons of gel into his hair to fix it up right. He hated it when it stuck up unevenly. He wanted it to look good. Not \"caveman\" good, but \"rough-and-tough\" good. He spent more time tweaking, modelling and sculping his head of brown hair than a sculptor spent modelling a block of clay. Finally satisfied with his hair after the sixth time, he came out of the bathroom. He tugged on his jacket and grabbed his backpack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, if you're going to spend that much time in the bathroom, at least try and hurry up in the mornings, hmm?\" said Alison. <br>\r\n\"Sorry, maah,\" said Jasper. They headed out the door and into the driveway. Jasper threw his bag into the back seat and got in the front. His mother started the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh damn!\" she groaned. <br>\r\n\"Now what?\" he asked. <br>\r\n\"Flat battery\". <br>\r\n\"Well how the hell did that happen?\"<br>\r\n\"Your FATHER, I'll bet! Jump-starting his car or something...Oh trust him to forget to...Ooooh! David I am going to fry you ALIVE when you get home! Honey, you better take your bike!\" <br>\r\n\"But mom!\"<br>\r\n\"No buts! I can't drive you today, sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper groaned. He got out of the car and went to get his bike. He strapped his backpack onto the back of the bike and climbed on. He wasn't going to bother with a helmet. It would mess up his hairdo. He checked his reflection in the dial of his watch, which he kept more for making sure he was godlike gorgeous more than for checking the time. He pressed down on the pedals and the racing bike shot off. His long legs pumped up and down tirelessly as he whizzed along. This was easy! He remembered how much loved riding a bike when he was a kid. Perhaps he should do this from now on? Yeah...When it wasn't raining, at least. He took a corner, the tires squealed. He hit the pavement, jumped up and then pedalled through the school gates. He squeezed lightly on the brakes and the bike slid into the bike-rack. He forgot his lock! Crap! Forget it, he'd chance it this one time. He'd have to get a lock sooner or later, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper unbuckled his backpack and headed inside. He checked his watch, this time to actually see if he was late. Nope. Fifteen minutes early. Sweet! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so you made it todae, didja Jaspy?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper looked up from his watch to see Brandt and Ivan striding towards him. Brandt was tall, like Jasper. His hair was a lighter brown, and shorter, neater. He had a strong Irish accent, which made him an absolute chick-magnet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ve vondered vhen you vuld get here!\" said Ivan. Ivan Pytor Loskov was a Russian. He looked like some Cold-War-era spy. Five feet, nine inches tall, with very, very, VERY short, buzz-cut blond hair. His body was so pale he might have been bathed in bleach as a baby. He was very thin and sharp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you guys had each other for company, didn't you?\" said Jasper, \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zis crazy booze-sviller, he still hasn't returned my iPod yet!\" Ivan said, \"And I vant it back, Brandt, or the next song you vill listen to is zhe funeral march by Chopin, yes?\" <br>\r\n\"Alright alright...bloody Red!\" said Brandt, \"here, take your iPod!...We wondered where you were, Jasper..\"<br>\r\n\"Car broke down, I had to cycle to school instead,\" said Jasper. \"Come on, we got history coming up in...\"<br>\r\n\"Vive minutes,\" said Ivan, checking his watch, \"ve better move, come!\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Five minutes,\u201d Jasper repeats out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could use more than five minutes Jasper thought to himself. He closed his eyes and cursed himself for forgetting the lock to his bike. He knew that his bike was probably safe, and that most of the kids in his school could be trusted \u2026 most, but not all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts ran to Michael Gibson the weirdest kid in school! Everyone knew Gib-stick, as they all called him because he was so skinny and weak from the time they were eight years old until today. He had always been different and most of the kids picked on him all the time, but in the past few months Gib-stick had become weirder still. He had started to put on weight, some muscle, and he had started fighting back against all those who had picked on him, and he always won. His fights were so strange. He seemed to never throw a punch or make a move, but he would win and hurt the other kid badly. Everyone now knew that you did not cross Gib-stick. Even to call him Gib-stick was enough to get yourself very, very hurt. Jasper did not even want to think the name Gib-stick because it seemed like Gib-stick, Michael, knew when people were talking about him. It was like he could read your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper had never referred to Michael as Gib-stick or joined in when other kids picked on him. Jasper always said hello to Michael, but they were never friends. However, a few days earlier Jasper was running down the hall because he was late for class. He turned a corner quickly and collided with Michael. Michael fell to the ground hard and all of his books and papers flew in every direction. Jasper had not seen him until it was too late, and did not feel the impact of their collision as Michael had. As Jasper stood still above Michael, who was struggling to get up, they made eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Michael, I am late for Anatomy. I didn\u2019t mean to knock you over,\u201d Jasper explained quickly as he offered a hand out to Michael to help him up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael did not say a word. He only stared coolly into Jasper\u2019s eyes. Jasper felt a strange sensation deep in his body. Like a warming sensation that was growing hotter and hotter. Jasper looked down to his midsection where the heat was coming from and then quickly back to Michael. Michael broke his stare and the sensation left Jasper\u2019s body. Jasper did not know if in that moment he was feeling a new strange power beginning or if it was something else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael did accept Jasper\u2019s assistance. He slowly got to his feet and began retrieving his books and papers from the hallway floor. Jasper picked up a book and was reaching for another set of papers when Michael said, \u201cJust leave them. Get on to class. I don\u2019t want your help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper knew it was best to leave Michael so to not anger him further. \u201cI am really sorry, Michael,\u201d Jasper said over his shoulder as he turned to leave. Just then Jasper realized that three of the prettiest girls in their grade were watching the whole thing. These girls had always picked on Michael. They are the three who had come up with the name Gib-stick. It was no secret that Michael had a crush on all three of the girls, and especially their leader Haley Stedt. Haley was a devious girl who liked to tease Michael. She would flirt with him all the time, but always called him Gib-stick while the other girls giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper knew this situation was about to get worse for Michael, and it did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Gib-stick, are you gonna let Jasper run all over you like that?\u201d Haley was the first to call out. The other two were quick to join in with their jeering and continuous giggling. Jasper turned back to Michael and their eyes met again. Jasper knew that Michael would not be angry at the girls. He knew that Michael would blame their teasing on him this time, and he was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think this is funny?\u201d Michael said in a low angry voice to Jasper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t mean to run into you, Michael,\u201d Jasper replied emphasizing the name Michael in his reply. It was then that Jasper realized that all of the books and papers that had just been scattered throughout the hallway were neatly stacked in Michael\u2019s arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael interrupted Jasper\u2019s thoughts, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Soon enough they will be laughing at you!\u201d With that Michael walked past Jasper with a terse grin on his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper had forgotten about this encounter until now. For some reason Jasper knew that he should have locked his bike, but he also thought that it would not matter. If Michael Gibson wanted Jasper\u2019s bike, no lock was going to protect it. It was then that Jasper realized that he had been standing in the hallway with his eyes closed reliving this encounter for several moments. Jasper opened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything and everyone in school was frozen in place. Jasper turned around. A younger student had been carrying her books loosely and one had come loose and was falling to the ground. Jasper looked astonishingly at the book suspended in mid-fall. The book was opening. A neatly folded note had started to escape the book\u2019s pages and was frozen on the edge of freedom. Jasper recognized this as the kind of notes his female classmates pass to one anther during boring lectures. The whole world seemed frozen in place. Jasper walked around the hallways and peeked inside of classrooms. Nothing moved. No fans were turning. No one breathed. Jasper thought nearly half an hour had passed, and still nothing had changed. He looked at his watch. No time had passed! It was still five minutes until the hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper realized that he had done this. I just wanted more that five minutes to talk with Brandt and Ivan before going to history class. I wonder if the whole world is stopped, or just what is close to me. I wonder how I get it to start again. I wonder if they can all see me walking around them. These thoughts and more all ran through Jasper\u2019s head. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>History class went by fairly fast. They were studying the Second World War. Hearing about blood and guts and battles made it interesting and the double-period seemed to fly by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man you dudes got CREAMED in Stalingrad,\" said Jasper. <br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" said Ivan. \"Come on, it's time for our recess break\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing their books, the three friends left the classroom and went to their lockers. Jasper dumped his books on top of his locker while he tried to open his locker. He shoved the key into the padlock and turned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" he thought. He pulled the key out and checked it. Yeah, this was the right one. He shoved it back in and turned it. Still nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMN IT!\" he screamed. He rammed the key in a third time and twisted it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSNAP! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandt and Ivan jumped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell...?\" Jasper goggled. He held out his hand to find half his key there. The other half was stuck inside the now busted padlock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duuude, what did you DO?\" said Brandt. He was examining the broken key, snapped clean in half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...It's this stupid locker!\" Jasper groaned. He grabbed the lock and squeezed, trying to rip it off. Perhaps it was so screwed that the shackle would just break. He wrenched it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAAAAH!\" Jasper screamed. He slammed his fist against the lock. He felt something give! Then a sharp pain as something hit his foot. He bent down and picked up half his padlock from the floor. The shackle of his lock was still attached to his door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...\" he said. He slid the shackle away from the door and held the two halves of the lock in his hands, \"Damn!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't...\" said Brandt.<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"You snapped that thing in half!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper looked at the lock. No he didn't!...Wait...yes he did! This lock was only a week old. It was brand new! It shouldn't break like this, should it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper squeezed the shackle of the lock in his hand. He felt it bend beneath his fingers. He raised an eyebrow. He put the other bit of the lock in his pocket and started twiddling around with the broken shackle. He twisted it, bent it, straightened it, twirled it up into a spiral around one of his fingers...This was SOLID STEEL! How could he bend it like this? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi Ivan, you seeing this?\" Brandt asked in disbelief. Ivan nodded. Jasper had now opened his locker, put his books into it, closed it and put the shackle through the loops in the door to hold the thing closed. He tied the bar of steel up into a neat bow, and left it there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never knew I could do this!\" said Jasper. \"Perhaps the metal was faulty\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper and Ivan walked off. Brandt stared at the bow of steel. He tried to squeeze it like Jasper had done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\" he winced as he nearly broke his fingers. \"How did he DO that?\" </span></div></div>",

It was a cool day and they sat down <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you been working out?\" Brandt asked. <br>\r\n\"No,\" said Jasper, \"I...I dunno, I...\" <br>\r\n\"You tied a rod of steel into a bow!\" <br>\r\n\"I...Yeah but...I...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandt grabbed one of Jasper's hands and examined it. It was large and firm and muscular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't FEEL any different,\" said Jasper. He unconciously closed his hand around Brandt's, who screamed. Brandt let out a yelp of surprise and let go at once. Brandt rubbed his right hand tenderly with his left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That HURT!\" Brandt hissed. <br>\r\n\"Woah sorry, man!\" said Jasper, \"I didn't mean it...\" <br>\r\n\"You really are strong! Try and lift Ivan up\". <br>\r\n\"That's not a challenge,\" said Ivan, \"Anyone can lift me up\". The Russian teen stared around the yard, and then pointed to a teacher's car parked nearby. \"Try that\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper walked over it, when he heard four voices behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jessie! What's up, Jessie? Gonna trash Mr. Wilson's car, Jessie?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper turned around to see Derek, Zach, Arnold and Billy. They were your typical, stuck-up, rebellious teens. Jasper had had enough of their bullying and teasing. They usually picked on Brandt and Ivan because they weren't born in America. As expected, they largely ignored Jasper, and turned to the other boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Paddy...\" said Derek. <br>\r\n\"His name is Brandt,\" said Jasper, turning around. <br>\r\n\"Shut up Jess...So Paddy, found any clovers lately? What about you, Red?\" <br>\r\n\"How about you leave us alone, hmm?\" Ivan asked. \"All we want is to enjoy our food\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the boys grabbed Ivan's lunch and threw it to the ground and smashed his shoe into the neatly clingwrapped sandwiches. Jasper grabbed the boy and hoisted him off the ground as easily as an empty shopping-bag. <br>\r\n\"How about you leave my buddies alone, huh?\" he asked. <br>\r\n\"Hey...shut up, Jess!\" the boy said, even though his fear at being picked up by a boy six inches taller than him was clearly showing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sweep of his hands, he grabbed the other three boys by their shirt-collars and hoisted them up until they were level with his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus!\" Zach said, \"When'd you get this buff, man?\" <br>\r\n\"I said...leave them alone,\" Jasper repeated. \"Capisci?\" <br>\r\n\"Uuuh...ah, yeah!\" said Billy, \"Whatever you say, dude!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper put them down. The boys started walking away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a jerk!\" one of them said. Before they could even scream in shock, Jasper was right behind them. He grabbed them, two in each hand and hoisted them into the air until they were kicking and screaming like babies! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BEAT IT!\" he shouted. And, as if he was pitching for a baseball team, Jasper did one, then two overarm throws. The boys sailed through the air like baseballs, hitting the sandpit of the elementary school next door. They staggered to their feet, spitting sand out of their mouths and brushing it out of their hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Assholes!\" Jasper groaned as he went back to Ivan and Brandt, \"You guys alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvan and Brandt didn't even speak. They stared at Jasper in shock. </span></div></div>",

He closed the book, capped his pen and swivelled around in his chair to surf the 'net. He brought up the site for the local newspaper and checked the forecast. Every single day for the next week was going to be boiling hot. He checked through the weather warnings. No fires, no barbeques, keep out of the sun... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"All schools closed by local Board of Education\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper read the message again. Due to the extreme heat, all schools in the metropolitan area were to be closed for a week. Jasper grinned. A weeklong free holiday! Awesome. He packed his bag and then left his room. His parents were in the living-room, watching television. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and that concludes the news for this evening...\" said the announcer on the nightly news. David Davian changed the channel to watch sports while Jasper's mother started doing the ironing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky kid,\" said Jasper's father, \"No school for you this week!\"<br>\r\n\"I know,\" said Jasper. He sat down. \"I think it's already getting to me, I'm feeling kinda woozy\". <br>\r\n\"Have dinner, then you can go sleep,\" said his mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper headed into the kitchen. His mother was a phenomenal cook. A huge pizza and an entire pan of lasagna was cooling on the island counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you guys eating?\" Jasper asked. <br>\r\n\"We've already had two pizzas between us,\" said Jasper's dad, \"You can have the rest\". <br>\r\n\"Okay\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Jasper sat down to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our little boy's growing up so fast,\" said Jasper's mother, smiling at her husband. David grinned, \"He's fine, sweetheart. He's healthy, he's gotta good appetite and he's doing well in school. What else could we ask for?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper's mother looked up when she heard the dishwasher door close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done!\" Jasper shouted, \"I'm off to bed!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper's mother headed into the kitchen and gasped. The entire pizza and the whole pan of lasagna were gone. That kid sure knew how to eat!...Aaah but he was a growing boy. Nothing wrong with that... </span></div></div>",

On Monday morning it was already 115 degrees Fahrenheit, with the mercury only expecting to rise, and not drop. Jasper groaned and rolled over fitfully in bed. He hated hot weather. He always found it impossible to sleep in hot weather. He rolled over and got out of bed. Maaan he felt dizzy. He got up and stumbled over to the bathroom to brush his teeth. He parked himself in front of the sink and reached down for his toothbrush and toothpaste. He lathered up his mouth and started scrubbing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas the top of the mirror always this close to his forehead? He didn't remember it being that close. Perhaps the heat was warping his mind or something. Yeah, that was it. Just the heat. He finished brushing his teeth and went back into his room to change. His clothes felt a little tight. Perhaps he was working out a bit too much. Hehehe. He tugged them on anyway, and then went into the kitchen, where his mother was making cereal for breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sweetie!\" she said, and she hopped up on her tip-toes to give him a kiss, \"Hungry?\"<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...\" Jasper mumbled, and sat down. <br>\r\n\"Hey champ!\" said Jasper's dad, \"Honey\". <br>\r\n\"Sweetie,\" said Mrs. Davian. <br>\r\n\"I'll see you folks this evening,\" said David. He gave his son a ruffle of his brown hair and his wife a kiss, \"You be good now, Jasp\". <br>\r\n\"Yeah pa,\" said Jasper. He started eating his cereal. He was really hungry. He ate one. Two. Three. Four. Five bowls. By the time he was done, the box of Frosty Flakes was completely empty. He got up and wondered what to do today. Nothing too exertive. It was waaay to hot for that. He'd watch a movie or something. He went back to his room, turned on his computer and put a DVD into the disc-drive. He'd sit back and watch a few movies, yeah, that sounded like a good idea. He turned off the lights and turned on the air-conditioning, and went to find something to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back again?\" his mother asked, \"You ARE hungry!\"<br>\r\n\"So?\" Jasper asked.<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" she said, \"Just nice to see you eating\". <br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Jasper. He took an entire tub of ice-cream and a spoon back to his room. He had serious munchies. He had no idea why he was so hungry, but he was. So he took a bottle of lemonade and a glass back to his room, too. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jasper laughed and laughed and laughed. He was watching a comedy film which he hadn't seen in ages and he was really enjoying it. He slurped and licked away at the ice-cream and gulped down the lemonade. The cold, tingliness felt good inside his sweltering body. When the movie was over, he took the DVD out of the disc-drive of his computer and put in another one. And watched that. After perhaps eight hours of solid film-watching, Jasper got up to stretch. He had a serious crick in his back. He stood up and stretched. He threw his arms up and yawned and groaned and...touched the ceiling with his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper knew he was tall, but he wasn't that tall!...was he? He reached up again. He could press his fingers firmly into the ceiling above his head. He was sure he wasn't able to do this yesterday! He looked around. He didn't feel any taller. And yet he could touch the ceiling. But then how often DID he touch the ceiling with his hands? Not that often. Perhaps he could always do it, and he just never noticed it. Yeah, that was it. He sat down in his chair again and kicked it around, spinning around lazily, his body stretched out and relaxed. He pushed his chair over to the mirror hanging next to his wardrobe and looked at it. He let out a yelp like a wounded dog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring back at him was a Jasper Davian with brown hair, muscular physique, tall stature and...glowing red eyes. Jasper's jaw dropped. He got up and stumbled through his room in the dark. He grabbed the light-switch and flipped it. He ran back to the mirror and stared. His eyes were bloodshot red. They even seemed to be glowing. He narrowed his eyes and the glowing seemed to become even stronger. Suddenly, a red beam shot out of his eyes, striking a scrunched up tissue-paper on the table underneath the mirror. The piece of tissue burst into flames, and just as quickly, smouldered into ashes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell!?\" he yelped. He reached down and picked up the tissue. It crumbled into black and grey fluffy ashes between his fingers. He just set something on fire with his eyes! This was not human. He stood up and wondered what was going on. He stared at the mirror again and blinked. His eyes returned to their normal colour. He blinked again. Still normal. He narrowed them. They flooded with redness, when he opened his eyes properly again, they were blood red, again. Jasper picked up a spool of thread on his dressing-table. Jasper was always vain and this included his clothing. He hated having loose buttons or rips or tears, and he was too impatient to wait for his mother to repair his clothes, so he usually did all his own sewing. He concentrated his eyes on the roll of thread and another red beam shot out of his eyes, hitting it solidly in the middle. It took a bit longer, but soon, the thread started to smoulder. Then it blackened. But nothing else. Wait...fire always burned upwards. Jasper tilted the spool of thread in his fingers and concentrated on the lowest part of the spool, which was now at a roughly 45-degree angle. The threads caught fire and suddenly, the flames raced up and around the cardboard spool and the thread and suddenly, Jasper found himself holding a fireball in his hands!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly...It didn't hurt. He rolled it from hand to hand. He closed his hands around it, he clenched the flaming lump of cotton in one hand, and then the other. It didn't hurt him at all! He could feel the flames on his fingers and hands, but they felt like nothing more than a slight tingling. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This was...scary, but also kinda cool. Jasper wondered what else he could do now. He could set things on fire and he could...Oh yeah, the super-strength dealie. He stood up and wondered what he could test his strength on. There was an empty plastic bottle on his desk. He grabbed it and squeezed it. The cap flew off under the immense pressure. it hit the curtains and clattered to the floor. A few, easy squeezes and he'd turned the bottle from a 600ml lemonade container into a pellet of plastic no bigger than a quarter. It was like folding tissue-paper. That was EASY. He wondered what else he could do. He headed onto the back patio where he found a whole heap of firewood which his dad had been chopping up for the winter. Jasper set up a couple of logs and picked up the biggest axe he could find. It was a beasty chunk of steel on a shaft of wood - the log-splitter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept his legs wide apart and tried to remember what his dad had taught him about splitting logs. High, fast, aim for the edge of the log. Right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper tapped the log gently with the blade, to mark his target. He heaved the axe above his head and let it drop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe log, a piece of oak, nine inches across, was blasted apart by the axe. The two halves of the log flew off into the distance. Jasper collected them again, aimed and let the axe drop. Wham! Wham! He'd split the log into quarters. He tossed it aside. As he did more logs, he found it became easier and easier to do, until it was as easy as chopping up vegetables. Soon, he was holding one axe in each arm, swinging back and forth, shattering logs and then tossing them aside. He finished the last few logs and then decided that it was getting far too hot to continue. He put the axes aside and headed indoors. He was sweating like a pig. Stripping naked, he stepped into the shower in the bathroom and turned on the tap. The water was cool and wonderfully refreshing...and it was splashing over his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper stepped out of the stream of water to discover that the shower-head only reached his shoulders! He would have to sit down if he wanted to have a proper shower. He squatted down in the shower-cubicle and started cleaning himself. Once he was done, he stepped out...and hit his head on the top of the shower's door-frame. He swore and rubbed his forehead tenderly. He dried himself and then headed off to find more clothes. He tugged them uncomfortably on and stared at himself in the mirror. The T-shirt and shorts were uncomfortably tight. He decided that just shorts would do. He grabbed the T-shirt and tried to take it off. But it wouldn't budge. It was clinging to his body like paint! He tugged and stretched and crinkled and grabbed...but it would not move! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" he screamed. He threw his arms up and the shirt ripped open! At the same time, the door to his bedroom swung open and an elderly woman in her seventies peeped around the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I hear a young man in here using improper language?\" she asked. <br>\r\n\"Sorry nana,\" Jasper said, \"It's my...\"<br>\r\n\"...Weeeeeell,\" said nana, walking in, \"Aren't YOU getting strong!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper blushed. His grandmother had a very flirty and dirty sense of humor for an old lady, and she certainly never held back. She came in and grabbed him around the chest and abs. \"Mmm!\" she said. \"Growing up fast, aren't you Jaspy?\" <br>\r\n\"Gran!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman laughed, \"Here, I'll help you with the shirt, sweetums,\" she said. And carefully, she tugged it off him, to reveal her grandson in all his topless glory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, aren't you adorable,\" she said. Jasper bent down and the old woman gave him a kiss. \"What are you going to wear?\" she asked. <br>\r\n\"I dunno, none of my shirts fit me,\" Jasper said. \"I guess I can just wear the shorts\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNana looked at the shorts, which left nothing to the imagination. \"Those shorts?\" she asked. \"Aren't they a bit...tight?\" <br>\r\n\"They're all I have!\" Jasper said, exasperatedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, poor sweetums. Well anyway, it's time for dinner!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper followed his grandmother into the dining-room where the family sat down for sushi. Something cold and filling was what they needed on such a hot day. Jasper ate roll after roll after slice after slice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you eating a bit much, son?\" David asked. <br>\r\n\"Nonsense!\" said nana, \"He's a growing boy! Aren't you, sweetums?\"<br>\r\n\"Graaaan!\" Jasper groaned. Jasper's mother laughed, \"Mom, stop teasing!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper finished his meal, had a few drinks, cleaned up and then went to bed. The heat was making him drowsy. He turned his air-conditioning on full-blast, turned off all the lights and climbed into bed... </span></div></div>",

He untied the steel rod around his locker, shoved his books back in, grabbed his tracksuit, shoes and bathing-trunks and towel and all the other things he'd need, and followed his two friends to the gymnasium. It looked weird to see a seven-foot tall teenage chunker walking down the corridor with his two friends either side of him, like bodyguards. Not that it looked like Jasper would ever NEED bodyguards. In the week off from school, his physique had buffed out until he looked like The Incredible Hulk. Girls stopped and stared at his ass, guys stopped and stared at his abs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached the gymnasium. They changed in the locker-room and then headed upstairs to the weights-room. Mr. Carlson the sports-teacher was there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay boys, today we're doing some basic weights-training. I want each of you to select a machine and a comfortable weight-range and just do a few practice-sets, okay? Mr. Davian, I hope you understand that the use of steroids is greatly disapproved of in the athletic world\".<br>\r\n\"Yes sir,\" said Jasper. <br>\r\n\"So in future, I want you to stop all growth-hormones, muscular enhancers, protien-shakes, powders, pills, potions and poultices, okay?\" <br>\r\n\"Um...whatever you say, Mr. C.\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys broke off into groups of two, and went to find a machine to work out on. Jasper and Brandt headed to the bench-press. Brandt lay down and started. He increased the weights until he was benching 25 pounds. After two sets, he was feeling rather tired. He got up and wiped himself down with a flannel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your turn!\" he said to Jasper. Jasper lay down on the bench. He was to tall, his legs hung off the end. He tried his usual weight. His arms shot up as if there wasn't anything holding them back! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too light,\" he said. He lowered them down, \"Gimme more!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandt moved the pin down a bit. Again, they flew up and down without any sign of Jasper exerting himself. <br>\r\n\"I SAID I WANTED IT HEAVIER!\" Jasper shouted. He lowered it again. Brandt grabbed the pin and moved it a second time, now, Jasper was benching seventy-five pounds. He hoisted it easily upwards. <br>\r\n\"For pete's sake, Brandt!\" he groaned. <br>\r\n\"Fine!\" Brandt said. He grabbed the pin and moved it AGAIN. Now, Jasper was up to 250 pounds. Jasper grabbed the bar and pushed! The whole thing shot upwards! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated, Jasper rolled over. He stared in amazement. <br>\r\n\"You moved this thing, right?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"What?\" Brandt asked, \"Only to 250! You said so!\"<br>\r\n\"I can't bench 250!\"<br>\r\n\"You just DID!\"<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper looked at the weights. He scratched his chin and moved the pin again. 400 pounds. Again, he tried to lift it. Again, it was ridiculously easy. He tried the max. 500 pounds. A quarter of a ton. It STILL wasn't heavy enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper got up. By now, a few of the other guys were staring at him. Jasper lay down on empty bench. He stretched his arms backwards and grabbed the entire benchpress-machine and hoisted it into the air! It rattled and shook violently. Everyone gasped. Jasper's arms, his shoulders, chest, biceps swelled up like balloons as he hoisted the machine, which probably weighed a cool, 1000 pounds of solid steel, into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo dude! Careful!\" one of the other boys shouted, \"I wanna use that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jasper had already benched the machine ten times without even panting! He let the whole thing come down again. It hit the floor with a muffled 'whump!'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stood there, slackjawed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...very impressive, Mr. Davian,\" said their sport-teacher. \"Uuummm...You all better get changed for swimming, boys\". </span></div></div>",

In the distance, he could hear his schoolmates talking about him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DID YOU SEE THAT?\"<br>\r\n\"No way...\"<br>\r\n\"That thing has to weigh like a ton! He could throw it like a ball!\"<br>\r\n\"A ball of paper!\"<br>\r\n\"What a BEAST!\"<br>\r\n\"Since when the HELL did he get muscles like that, anyway? He didn't look that buff last week!\"<br>\r\n\"Maaan...What a freakin' TANK. He could beat the crap out of all of us!\"<br>\r\n\"He wasn't even sweating!\"<br>\r\n\"You think Brandt gave him some sorta steroids or something? That crazy Irish prick always has weird stuff on him\". <br>\r\n\"He's crazy, but he's drunk-crazy, not pill-popping crazy. And what about his HEIGHT? Jasper wasn't ever THAT tall!\" <br>\r\n\"Whatever we do, don't mess with him\".<br>\r\n\"Oh hell no!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper felt embarrassed, but he couldn't help but listen to what they were saying. He brought out his shorts and towel and goggles, and started tugging off his shirt. It was too tight. Again. Everytime he raised is arms to get it off his head, his shoulders swelled up like bowling-balls, stopping the shirt from getting over his head. He tugged and pulled fruitlessly. He tried to grab it from the bottom and just tug it up inside out, but that didn't work either. It was too TIGHT on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrrruuuuugh!!\" he grunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSKRRRRRRRRRRRRIP!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seams on his shirt ripped open with a sickening tearing sound. Even though he'd busted right out of it, his shirt was still proving troublesome to get off. He thought he heard breathing. Or voices, or...giggles? Behind one of the lockers. Then he thought he saw an eyeball. No. Two. Three. Four...A bunch of perhaps half-a-dozen girls were checking him out from the gaps between the lockers! Jasper pretended NOT to notice, but he may as well have some fun. He took his time, now. He ripped off his shirt slowly. Taking time to flex each of his arms. He tugged off his jeans. He turned his back to the lockers and then tugged off his underwear. He swore he heard gasps of delight as his world-perfect ass made its debut on the highschool peepshow stage. He tugged on his shorts. They clung TIGHT to his body, leaving nothing to the imagination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a HUNK!\" he heard a girl say. <br>\r\n\"He is SO sexy!\"<br>\r\n\"So BIG!\"<br>\r\n\"Can you imagine the size of his...\"<br>\r\n\"Lucy!\"<br>\r\n\"...It must be SOOOOO HUGE!\"<br>\r\n\"I bet he's whale-size hung! Like, a total and major...\"<br>\r\n\"LUCY!...Yeah I bet it is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore giggles. Jasper closed his locker, slung his towel over his shoulder and stepped into the corridor between the rows of lockers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamera-phones flashed as girls took his photo. They swarmed around him like flies around honey. The sexiest honeycomb in the world. Sweet and hot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeey Jasper!\" said one of the girls. \"Aren't YOU looking CUTE?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he's so MODEST!...And such a MAAAAN!...Mmmmmm!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl reached up and felt his arm. He flexed. She squealed fit to break glass! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooooow!\" she said. \"Hey Marcia, you GOTTA check out his arms! They are total beast-cannons!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper laughed. Eventually, he managed to wave the girls away and go for a swim. He wondered if they would be there when he got back. </span></div></div>",

Even standing at the 'deep' end of the pool, the water barely reached his waist. The diving-pool was the deepest pool in the school's swimming-complex, and it too, wasn't deep enough for Jasper. At least, not to dive into. He mostly splashed around in the diving-pool, which he couldn't even really dive in. His feet touched the bottom, and his head was just inches from breaking the surface when his feet DID touch the bottom. The marking on the side of the pool read: \"9ft\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper lay on his back, enjoying the water while his friends swam around, and Mr. Carlson instructed them on the different styles of swimming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" one of the boys shouted. Jasper started in the water as something hit his chest, slid off it and into the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My glasses! Oh great going, Aston!\" <br>\r\n\"Hey shut up, Dingus!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenver ran over to the edge of the pool and stared into it. Something at the bottom of the pool winked up at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU IDIOT!\" he shouted. Suddenly, Denver found himself in the water, spluttering and kicking as the other boy jumped in after him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" Mr. Carlson shouted, \"You two stop it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooooaaah!\" Aston screamed. He found himself hanging in midair, suspended by his speedos. He was hyperventilating from the pain of having his nuts squeezed and his ass being ripped open at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we say?\" Jasper asked, holding Aston up as easily as an empty grocery-bag. <br>\r\n\"I...I...I....\" Aston gasped. <br>\r\n\"WHAT DO WE SAY?\"<br>\r\n\"I...S...s...so...sorry!\" he gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper let go. Aston yelped as he hit the water and plummeted downwards. Jasper swept the bottom of the diving-pool with his feet and found the thing which Aston had thrown in. He scooped it up between his toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here Den,\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenver reached out for his glasses, \"Thanks Jasp!\" he said. </span></div></div>",

Jasper, Ivan and Brandt were sitting at the back of the classroom, they finished off their last bit of work and closed their books. The bell rang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's all! Whatever you haven't managed to finish during class will be homework,\" said their teacher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper, who had completed everything, smiled. No homework tonight. Jasper opened his bag, which he'd brought with him, and started stuffing his books and papers into it. More boys chatted near the windows, laughing and joking amongst themselves. Ivan watched them, then looked up at Jasper, \"You know, it's kind of cool, havink a giant in the classroom,\" he said. \"Mount Davian\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandt laughed and nudged Jasper in the abs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" he winced, rubbing his elbow. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, you like that, huh?\" said Jasper, laughing. He grabbed Brandt's right hand and pressed it against his abdomen. Brandt ran his fingers up and down. It was a solid slab of muscle. Impressive in anyone's language, but this was like rubbing against corrogated steel. This was a real washboard ab-set. This was cheesegrater country. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woaaah!...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSMASH! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople screamed, Jasper's head whipped around towards the window. One of the boys had accidently stepped on a dropped glue-stick. It had rolled, he had lost his balance, and he'd smashed through the window! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't hold it!\" he yelped. He was hanging onto the windowsill of a window on the third floor of the main building, with only solid asphalt below and was facing a drop of nearly 30 feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get me up!\" he shouted. His friends opened the window and tried to reach out to grab him, but they couldn't bend far enough to catch hold of the wrist of the one hand holding onto the window-sill. <br>\r\n\"He's slipping!\" one of his friends shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFwwwwwwwwwooomp! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper flashed over to the window, blasting everyone aside. He reached out and grabbed the dude easily by his right wrist, just after he let go of the ledge. Jasper hauled the guy back up and through the window, just as extra teachers rushed into the room with a rope. Jasper held the guy easily in one arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright, Sean?\" he asked. <br>\r\n\"Yeah put me down, you big lug!\" he said. Jasper laughed and lowered Sean to the floor. \"That was close! What happened?\"<br>\r\n\"I stepped on...something, and I slipped, I fell through the window\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir geography teacher walked over and examined Sean carefully, \"No cuts...you're very lucky,\" he said, \"And you, Jasper, were very quick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper smiled, \"Thanks Mr. James\". <br>\r\n\"Alright!\" said Mr. James, \"Class dismissed!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper strolled back to his table where Ivan and Brandt were talking, he caught the tail-end of their conversation as he came nearer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I still can't believe how fast he could move!\"<br>\r\n\"Like lightning!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Jasper asked.<br>\r\n\"Nothing!\" they both said. But as they walked down the corridor to their lockers to get their other books, Brandt said, \"Jasper were you aware of how fast you were moving?\" <br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Jasper asked again. <br>\r\n\"Sean let go of the window and you were across the room in like half a second!\"<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Jasper said, \"I...\"<br>\r\n\"It was at least twenty five or thirty feet from our desks to the window, and with all the other desks and people in the way....How did you MOVE that fast?\"<br>\r\n\"Was I...I mean...I didn't...I....\" Jasper's mouth went slack, \"I did,\" he siad, closing his locker door. <br>\r\n\"Ve both saw you,\" said Ivan, slinging his bag over his shoulder, \"You vere fast! Like lightning! Boom! Here! Bang! There! How you move that fast, man?\" <br>\r\n\"I guess I'm just...strong?\" <br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" said Brandt, \"But that was awesome anyway!\" </span></div></div>",

Carry me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper turned around to see his brother, Hunter. Hunter was ten, he was holding Scrapples, his tiger plush-toy in his arms. He was dressed in blue pyjamas and he stared up at his older brother with admiration in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not tonight, Hunter,\" said Jasper, \"I'm tired\". <br>\r\n\"I wanna be carried!\" Hunter said. \"It's fun!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper chuckled, \"Okay, okay\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper bent down and scooped up his little brother. Hunter held onto Scrapples with one hand, and started squeezing Jasper's muscles with the other. <br>\r\n\"Don't do that,\" Jasper said, \"It tickles!\" <br>\r\n\"They're so big!\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah I know...Uuungh!\" Jasper flexed one of his biceps and Hunter laughed and squeezed it. It was like trying to squeeze a ball of granite.

He forgot he'd taken Scrapples out of his brother's arms when he was putting him in bed. He opened the door and tossed the toy tiger onto his brother's bed. <br>\r\n\"You took him!\" Hunter said. <br>\r\n\"Naw, I just forgot!\" said Jasper. \"Goodnight, Hunter\".<br>\r\n\"Scrapples...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter rolled over and went to bed. Jasper went to his own room and climbed into his hammock. He had to sleep in a custom-made hammock now, since his bed was too small. He climbed into it, tugged the blanket over him and tried to get to sleep. But Jasper wasn't exactly used to sleeping in things that swayed around, so this was going to take some getting used to... </span></div></div>",

He'd been tossing and turning for two hours. He rolled over in his hammock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where was the hammock? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper felt underneath him. Nothing. No hammock. No pillow. No blanket. Just...air. What? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat up and felt around him. Where was the lamp? Suddenly, his hand hit something metal. He followed it down, and then found the switch for his lamp. He flipped it on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it wasn't midnight with his brother sleeping in the next room, Jasper would've screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the yellow light from the lamp, he could see that he was FLOATING. He was hovering about two feet, perhaps three, off the top of his hammock, and about five feet from the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is too...what the hell...\" Jasper whispered. He sat up. He tried to get down again. He tried to move around...It was like he was swimming in air! He could roll over, somersault, twist, backflip, barrel-roll...this was cool! But it was also majorly freaky. How the hell did he get down? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHUNK! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment he thought about getting his feet onto the ground, Jasper hit the floor. Ouch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat there, on the floor for perhaps two minutes, trying to figure out what was going on. This was a dream. Yeah, it had to be! But the pain in his ass-cheeks told him different. He stood up again. What had happened? He had thought about getting down to earth...and he did. Perhaps if he thought about flying or floating or...hovering or...whatever it was!...he would do that too? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fly!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jasper felt himself rise up, like a balloon. His feet rose, inch by inch. Jasper bent forward, as if he was skiing or something, but this was really to stop himself from cracking his head against the ceiling. Soon, he found himself hovering about six feet off the floor, staring downwards at the boards beneath him. This was kinda cool! He wondered how he moved? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forward\"? he whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHUNK! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooooooooowwww!\" Jasper groaned, as he rubbed his forehead. He'd just crashed into his closet! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back!\" he hissed. He went in reverse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forward!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Jasper was ready. He twisted his body right, and he flew right. He twisted it right again, then left...left, right, right, left. By moving his torso, he could steer. By bobbing his head up or down, he could fly higher or lower. If he brought his head right up, he could just hover in mid-air. Moving his arms made him go even faster. Finally, he stopped, his feet hitting the floorboards. This was weird. He needed a drink to clear his head. He opened the bedroom door and went to get a glass of water. On the way back to his room, he stopped outside a door and opened it. Hunter and Scrapples were fast asleep. Jasper closed the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miaow!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiaow? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rrrroooaaaww!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper stared down. Furkins was weaving in and out of his legs. Furkins and Taffy were their pet cats. One belonged to Hunter, really, and the other belonged to grandma. Jasper bent down and scooped up the little, grey and white kitten. It miaowed and licked his face. He stroked it. Taffy, golden and white, yowled upwards at him. Jasper bent down and picked him up, too. Taffy yowled again. Jasper smiled. He opened the bedroom door and let Taffy in. The kitten scampered across the bed and curled up next to its young master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Taffy...\" said Hunter, stroking his kitten, \"How did you get in?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper closed the door. Now it was Furkins' time to yowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright,\" he said. He put the cat down. It ran to a door and beat at it impatiently with its tail. Jasper wasn't sure if he wanted to open this door. Gran didn't mind being woken up at night, but not this late. Jasper approached the door. Then he saw a glimmer of light underneath it. Was nanna still awake? Jasper paused outside the door. He scooped up Furkins and stroked the cat absent-mindedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...He's growing up so fast!\"<br>\r\n\"I know...When do you think he'll stop?\"<br>\r\n\"Not anytime soon, I hope!\"<br>\r\n\"He's got a lot more bulk, now, you see how much he ate at dinner?\" <br>\r\n\"Oh yes...my little angel!\"<br>\r\n\"He's got his super-strength, then?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah mah\".<br>\r\n\"Super-speed?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I saw him setting the table. Wow!\" <br>\r\n\"Muscle-development?\"<br>\r\n\"Definately!\"<br>\r\n\"I wonder if he can fly yet?\"<br>\r\n\"I haven't seen it\". <br>\r\n\"You really think he can, mom?\"<br>\r\n\"Why not? He'll be capable of all kinds of other things soon enough. Your grandfather had superpowers\". <br>\r\n\"How come we don't have any?\"<br>\r\n\"They skip generations, darling. Like genes or hereditary illnesses, stuff like that\". <br>\r\n\"Well, our little boy's growing up, eh?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" <br>\r\n\"What about supersonic hearing?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't think so\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper opened the door, \"Is something going on here that I should know about?\" he asked, bending over and sticking his head in. Furkins was going CRAZY in his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay!\" he said. He let go of the cat. It flew threw the air, hit the floor and scampered over to the bed. The cat jumped onto nanna's lap and curled up tighter than a piece of clingwrap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, listening at the door, were we?\" asked grandma, \"Come in, sweetums\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper came in and sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son, it's time we had a talk,\" said David, patting his son's broad shoulder, \"Now I'm sure you've noticed a...a lot of changes...\" <br>\r\n\"Dad, I learn sex-ed in school,\" Jasper said. His mother laughed, \"We're not talking about THAT kind of talk or THOSE kinds of changes, honey,\" she said. \"But you've noticed stuff, haven't you?\"<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Jasper said, he didn't want to admit it, but he couldn't hide it, either. <br>\r\n\"You're taller than everyone else, stronger than everyone else, faster than anyone else. Your muscles have become VERY well-developed,\" David reeled off the changes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...something that we LOOOOOOVE!\" said granny, giving Jasper a hug. \"Don't we, darling?\" she asked, looking at mom. Jasper's mom nodded. \"Oh I bet you're a hit in school, aren't you sweetums?\" <br>\r\n\"Mom, stop calling me that!\" Jasper groaned. <br>\r\n\"Nonsense!\" said grandma, \"Honey...You're an alien!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Jasper really did scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!?\" he roared. Furkins hissed and ran underneath the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh now look what you did!\" grandma said, \"Here Furkins! Good kitty...Honey, we weren't sure how to tell you...but you are an alien. We all are. We lived on a very similar planet to Earth. And we decided to move here permanently. Our entire family are aliens. And some of us develop super-powers. Not all generations have these powers, but some of us do. You do\". <br>\r\n\"So that's why I can...do stuff,\" Jasper said.<br>\r\n\"Sure is,\" said David. <br>\r\n\"I'm a freak!\" Jasper said. <br>\r\n\"Oh no you're not, honey!\" said his mother, hugging one of his gigantic arms, \"You're NOT a freak! You're our little baby!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yes he is a freak,\" said nanna, \"But you're OUR freak and we LOVE YOU!..Especially that cute little tushie of yours\"<br>\r\n\"Nanna!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, you've been born with special powers and you should learn how to use them carefully and responsibly,\" said his mother, \"People will be looking up to you...\"<br>\r\n\"Literally,\" said granny. <br>\r\n\"...and you should know that you have advantages over other people. You're special. You should use your powers to help others\".<br>\r\n\"I already...well...\" Jasper said, \"I never really USED them yet...\"<br>\r\n\"I heard on the telephone you saved a kid from falling three floors out a broken window!\" said granny, \"Sean Travers' granny rang me up after dinner!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh HONEY!\" said Mrs. Davian, \"Oh my little BABY!\" she squealed, and hugged him, \"You SAVED someone? Oh such a sweet little treasure...oooooh...muah!\" <br>\r\n\"MOM!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid laughed as he patted his son on the back, \"You're a Davian, kid, do us proud\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...I am an alien...I...we...are aliens. And I was born with special powers?\" Jasper asked, just trying to get everything straight. <br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said his mother. \"And you will develop other powers, like flying and...\"<br>\r\n\"I can already fly,\" said Jasper. <br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" granny screamed, \"AND YOU DIDN'T TELL US!?\"<br>\r\n\"I only found out half an hour ago!\" <br>\r\n\"Show us! Quick!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly, everyone was looking at him, as if they expected him to pull a rabbit out of his ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...okay,\" said Jasper. He took a deep breath. Suddenly, he started levitating. Just a couple of inches at first...but then he really began to rise. He floated up, up, up...leaning forward so that he wouldn't hit the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no!\" said grandma, \"You can't do it INSIDE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to her bedroom window and opened it, \"Out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper floated over to the open window and squeezed through it. Standing on the window-sill, he pushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper shot into the sky like a rocket! He was flying! Soaring! He was going up higher and higher, faster, faster, faster, faster!!! Wnd was blasting him in the face, his hair was almost being ripped off his head! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!\" he screamed. He did a mid-air somersault, a barrel-roll, he twisted and spun and twirled around! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you look at that!\" said Mrs. Davian, putting an arm around her mother. <br>\r\n\"Our little sweetums is growing up!\" said granny. Mr. Davian chuckled, \"That's our little flyer!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper eventually came back down, landing outside his grandmother's bedroom window. \"That was incredible!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll learn all kinds of things in a very short period of time, my son,\" said David, \"Soon, your other powers will begin to show themselves. You can't force them,\" he said, \"You must wait. You must let them grow within you, and when the time is right, they will come. It may take a few days, or even weeks, but they will come soon. So, keep an eye out, for any unusual feelings or activities\".<br>\r\n\"Sure dad,\" said Jasper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranny pulled out a piece of paper and a pen. She made a stroke on the paper, crossing out the words \"Ability to fly\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, goodnight, sweetums,\" said his mother. She hopped up and gave him a kiss. David headed back to bed with his wife, and Jasper left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight, superstar,\" said his grandmother, she smiled at him, and turned out the light. Jasper closed the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Furkins, no picking at the sheets,\" he heard his grandmother say. He chuckled, and got back into his hammock. He tied some string around his ankles and wrists and tied them to the posts of his hammock so that he wouldn't float off again in his sleep. Then, he rolled over and dozed off... </span></div></div>",

Hunter emptied the box into his bowl and slopped milk on top of it. He munched it down quickly, swilled down the milk and wiped his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasper, take Hunter to school, will you?\" David asked, \"Your mom and I have to leave for work early!\" <br>\r\n\"Why can't gran do it?\"<br>\r\n\"Ladies club luncheon, my dear,\" said nanna, \"I have to make sandwiches, can't leave the house, sorry\". <br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n\"Go on! It'll give you some time together!\"<br>\r\n\"But...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid and Darlene rushed out the door, and Jasper found himself sitting at the table with his grandmother. The old woman smiled. \"Oh Jaspy,\" she said, smiling. \"I got something for you\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" he asked. He didn't sound that interested. She pulled something shiny and metallic out of her purse. Something on a chain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is...that?\" he asked. It looked like a gold pocket watch and a chain. Only, it didn't look like a watch at all. She put it into his hand. \"There,\" she said, \"Something you might find useful, now that you can fly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper looked at the thing in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a pocket compass!\" she said. \"Belonged to your grandfather. Put it in your shirt-pocket there, and put the chain through a buttonhole. You can just tug the compass out whenever you need to know if you're going in the right direction\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, nanna,\" said Jasper. He looked at the compass, it was pretty cool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, one other thing,\" she said, \"I've been putting this together for a while now...\" the old woman got up and left the room, she came back holding something black in her hands, \"...and I hope it still fits!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was holding a long, black cape. She shook it out and threw it over her grandson's head, standing on a chair so that she could do up the clasp around his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" she said, smiling. <br>\r\n\"Gran, I don't need this!\" said Jasper, tugging uneasily at the cloak. <br>\r\n\"Sure you do! You know how cold it gets up there, flying around? You'll freeze if you don't have this! It's a pure wool and cotton blend. Nice and tough and warm. Should last you for ages!\" <br>\r\n\"I feel like Dracula!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranny hopped down from the chair, and laughed. She slapped him on the ass, \"Oh you're a LOT cuter than any vampire!\" she said. \"You got your books and everything?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I got it all...HUNTER COME ON!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter came skidding into the kitchen, holding his schoolbag and Scrapples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye nanna!\" he said. He hugged her and gave her a kiss. Granny took Scrapples away, \"You can't take that to school, sonny,\" she said. <br>\r\n\"I'm not. Can you put him back?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure sweetums,\" she said. \"You'll find Scrapples on your bed when you get home. Now go on, both of you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut in the yard, Jasper put on his backpack and Hunter put on his backpack. Jasper bent down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gimmie your hand,\" he said to Hunter. Hunter reached out and grabbed Jasper by the wrist. Jasper threw Hunter up and settled him onto his back, sitting on his shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, Hunter!\" he shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter leaned forward and wrapped his arms around his brother's thick neck. Slowly, Jasper began to rise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" he shouted. Hunter nodded 'yes' into his brother's neck. Jasper started rising faster and faster. Then, he headed off towards school. The elementary school where Hunter went, was across the road from Jasper's. Jasper smiled. He flew low over the school and Hunter climbed off his brother's back and ran off to see his friends. Jasper had picked a lonely spot in his brother's school to land because he didn't want to draw attention to himself. He took off again, and then flew over the road to his own school. He wondered what everyone would say when they saw him flying? </span></div></div>",

Whatever it was, it was huge! Jet black and coming closer and closer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bird!\" someone shouted. <br>\r\n\"Waaay too big for a bird, man!\"<br>\r\n\"It's a plane!\" a girl screamed. <br>\r\n\"It's...It's...Is that JASPER!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant was flying closer and closer, faster, faster...he skimmed over their heads and shot up again. He did a sharp turn, and then hovered down to the ground, landing in front of the crowd that had gathered to watch him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duuuuude!\" one of the boys shouted, \"How did you DO THAT?\" <br>\r\n\"It's windy?\" Jasper asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls flocked to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a MAN!\"<br>\r\n\"I didn't know he could fly!\" <br>\r\n\"Look at those ARMS!\"<br>\r\n\"Check out that ass...\"<br>\r\n\"He is SOOOO CUTE!\" <br>\r\n\"I wonder how tall he is?\" <br>\r\n\"That cape makes him look hot!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper smiled. He flexed his arms as the girls crowded around him. The cotton fabric on his shirt strained against his muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh...Would you look at these things?\" one of the girls asked, \"Total cannons!\" <br>\r\n\"You're so hot!\" <br>\r\n\"What a beast!\" <br>\r\n\"Mmmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper felt slim, feminine hands run themselves up and down his body, feeling his chest, his abs, grabbing at his arms and some even trying to touch his broad, firm shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God...\" one of the boys said, \"That is the most SICKENING sight ever! All those girls crowding around him, checking out his body like that..that is...that is just...ew!\"<br>\r\n\"Wish you were him?\" another boy asked. <br>\r\n\"Yeaaaah!\" said the other boy, enviously, \"He gets all those chicks and all he has to do is STAND there looking hot!...Lucky bastard\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies, girls...please,\" said Jasper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the girls grabbed Jasper by one of his huge arms. He flexed and lifted her easily off the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh!\"<br>\r\n\"Look at THAT!\"<br>\r\n\"Check out those guns!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper let the girl down and then went to sit down on a bench. Girls swarmed around him, feeling his shoulders, arms, chest, running their hands through his thick, brown hair and that firm, sharp, square, masculine jaw. He had a rugged cuteness about him that the girls found irresistable. He wasn't no playboy, but he was hot enough to have any chick he wanted, no questions asked. One of the girls tugged at his cape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who made this, Jasper?\"<br>\r\n\"My grandmother,\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a grandmother?\"<br>\r\n\"Ooooh I bet she loves you for a grandson!\"<br>\r\n\"I bet you help her a lot around the house with all those muscles, huh?\"<br>\r\n\"I hope I get a grandson like you!\" <br>\r\n\"She is SOOOO lucky!\"<br>\r\n\"Does she live with you?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Jasper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls gasped, \"She gets to see you EVERY DAY? Oh man she is soooo lucky!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does she still give her little baby sponge-baths?\" one of the girls asked. <br>\r\n\"Hahahah, what?\" Jasper asked.<br>\r\n\"We will!\" said one of the girls. \"It would be fun! And I bet you get real dirty, don't you? Boy as big as you must find it hard to stay clean when there's so MUCH of you to check out...huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tension was broken. The bell rang.

He sat on the floor in English, thankful that his school was an old-fashioned one, which had rooms with enough ceiling-clearance to let through the Titanic. There was no point to Jasper sitting on a chair. Even though it would probably take his weight, his legs were simply too long for him to sit comfortably. He sat on the floor in a sort of fetal position, using his legs as his desk. He wrote out his work with the biggest fountain pen his father could buy him. Mostly because it was impossible for him, with his massive fingers, to grip a standard ballpoint pen easily. He may as well have written with a toothpick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvan and Brandt sat either side of Jasper at the back of the classroom, on chairs and at desks. They were doing a session of creative writing. Brandt finished his piece and handed it to Jasper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" he asked. <br>\r\n\"You finished it that fast?\" Jasper asked. <br>\r\n\"Well, the first chapter, anyway\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper took the notebook in his hands and read it. He smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wrote about me?\" he asked. <br>\r\n\"What?\" Brandt asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper got onto his knees so that he could get next to Brandt's desk, \"Your main character's a seven-foot teenage 'incredible hulk' dude\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandt grinned, \"Well it was hard to think up something original...and you were sitting right next to me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper grinned, \"It's okay, buddy...I like it\".<br>\r\n\"Thanks\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang and everyone started packing up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure you work on those stories for homework, boys, girls,\" their English teacher said, \"I want them in by the end of the week!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper got up and headed to the door. He had to bend down to get through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't get even taller, did you?\" Ivan asked. <br>\r\n\"Huh?\" said Jasper, \"What...?\" <br>\r\n\"You look taller,\" the Russian said. \"Like you grew even more overnight!\"<br>\r\n\"No way!\" said Jasper. <br>\r\n\"Yes way. Stand there!\" said Ivan. He pointed to the doorframe. Jasper stood next to the door and Ivan stared him up and down. <br>\r\n\"You have grown taller!\" he said. <br>\r\n\"No I haven't!\"<br>\r\n\"You have. These doors are seven feet tall, your head goes way above that. Brandt!\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Brandt asked. <br>\r\n\"Jasper looks taller, yes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandt looked up. \"You know Ivan...I think he does!\"<br>\r\n\"I am not!\" Jasper said. <br>\r\n\"Yes you are!\" his two friends said. Ivan ran back into the classroom and came back with a 24-inch ruler and a chair. He started measuring. Then he climbed onto the chair and continued measuring. Then Brandt took over to do the last few inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much?\" Ivan asked. <br>\r\n\"Uuuuh...\" Brandt said, \"It's...seven foot three!\"<br>\r\n\"IT'S WHAT?\" Jasper shouted. <br>\r\n\"seven three!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh christ, I am growing taller!\" <br>\r\n\"Come on Goliath, we're going to be late for art class,\" said Ivan. </span></div></div>",

Thirty pairs of eyes followed him. Miss Asher cleared her desk and told Jasper to lie on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see...\" she said, \"Right leg...straight...good...left one up like that. Hmmm...Left arm up on top...no, down...right arm bent...face to the front...can you hold that?\"<br>\r\n\"I think so,\" said Jasper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TAKE YOUR CLOTHES OFF!\" one of the girls shouted. <br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!\"<br>\r\n\"Come on Jasper!\"<br>\r\n\"STRIP!

Everyone laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright I'll do it,\" said Jasper. He got off the desk and started taking off his shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, those arms are even bigger than I thought!\" <br>\r\n\"Dude, check out those beefsteak pecs!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh my god his six-pack is awesome!\" <br>\r\n\"Take off your jeans!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper looked uneasily at Miss Asher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh just take it all off!\" she said, \"Get it over with so we can start sculpting!\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All?\" Jasper asked.

The crowd GASPED. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude\", one of the boys whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...\" one of the girls said. <br>\r\n\"It's even bigger than we thought!\" <br>\r\n\"How LONG is that thing?\"<br>\r\n\"How THICK is it?\" <br>\r\n\"No wonder he's so beasty if he has to carry THAT around all that!\"<br>\r\n\"His nuts are HUGE MAN!\" <br>\r\n\"That is HUGE!\"<br>\r\n\"So how many feet is it?\" <br>\r\n\"Eeew, he's getting hard!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Jasper...um, get up on the dick...I mean desk!\" said Miss Asher. \"Just arrange yourself like I said...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper did so, He let his right arm drop down, to howls of protest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't cover it up!\"<br>\r\n\"We wanna sculpt it!\"<br>\r\n\"Whale-schlong!\" <br>\r\n\"Jasper move your arm!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper sighed. He lifted his right arm and put it under his chin, leaving his meat-rod to hang down under its own weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople started sculpting. But not without a lot of whispering, too... </span></div></div>",

Jasper, thanks for your assistance\". <br>\r\n\"No problem,\" said Jasper. He was tugging on his shirt and jeans. <br>\r\n\"Awww, don't cover it up!\" said one of the girls. <br>\r\n\"Sorry ladies,\" he said. Then he bent down and grabbed a few of them by their arms, \"You can see it all next week\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls giggled and left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on King Schlong, it's time for lunch,\" said Brandt. Jasper nodded. Ivan followed along behind and the three friends left the art-room. They took a detour to their lockers, stuffed their books inside and then headed to the cafeteria. Jasper picked up a tray and went to select his food. Two large helpings of fries, four monster burgers, two hotdogs, two pizza-rolls, two bottles of lemonade, a salad, two loaves of garlic-bread and a bowl of mashed potatoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got enough?\" Brandt asked in amazement when Jasper sat down at the table in the corner, away from everyone else. <br>\r\n\"Probably not,\" said Jasper. He started eating. And he was eating fast. In five minutes, he'd already consumed half the stuff on his tray. He ate, guzzled, drank, stuffed and munched. Ivan watched his gigantic friend eating and then stared at Brandt. <br>\r\n\"I wonder if the school has enough to feed him?\" he asked. <br>\r\n\"Hopefully,\" said Brandt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper was finding himself incredibly hungry. He kept going back and forth, back and forth, getting more and more food. He'd made six trips before he was full. Jasper yawned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on guys, I think I need some air,\" he said. Slowly, Jasper got to his feet and left the cafeteria. He went round the side of the school to relax. Ivan and Brandt followed. <br>\r\n\"Are you alright, Jasper?\" Brandt asked. <br>\r\n\"I'm just...\" Jasper yawned, \"Feeling very tired...\" he said. \"Oh god...\" he groaned. He stood up and yawned. He started stretching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, nothing happened. Then Ivan tapped Brandt on the shoulder, \"Are you seeink vhat I am seeink?\" the Russian asked.<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I want to believe it!\" Brandt answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper was growing before their eyes! As he stretched, his two friends could hear the crackling of his bones, his spine, as he grew even taller! His already intense muscles started swelling up even more! Jasper gasped as he fell back, bumping against the brick wall behind him, he was leaning against it as he grew even more hunkified! His arms, shoulders and chest started getting bigger and bigger! HIs abs grew and hardened, his buns of steel got even larger, his lats, quads, pecs, calves...they were all inflating like balloons! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrrrrrip! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper's shirt ripped open, the buttons popped off as his chest broadened, his shirtsleeves exploded as his arms inflated, ripping open at the shoulders and cuffs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy Jesus!\" Brandt gasped. Jasper's jeans ripped open. Ivan grabbed Jasper's belt and struggled to unbuckle it for him as he grew even bigger! Jasper's fly burst open, his zipper being ripped apart as even his nether-regions started to grow! The only thing that seemed to be holding up were his underwear! His shoes burst open as his feet enlarged. His socks, too, seemed to hold up. But apart from his underwear, Jasper was now only wearing rags! A bulge the size of a mutated salami was growing in his crotch, and two nuts the size of oranges. Jasper was growing taller and taller. By the time stopped, he was waaay taller than the basketball hoop he was standing next to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn!\" Brandt gasped. <br>\r\n\"You better get home and get some new clothes, Jasper!\" Ivan said. <br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" said Jasper, flexing his new muscles experimentally. \"Come on, you guys can come with me\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bent down and picked them up easily. He jumped into the air and flew off back home. School could wait.... </span></div></div>",

I hadn't expected that...but, well, we'll see!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman left the three friends standing in the hall, and headed off to her room. She came back a few minutes later with a simple cotton shirt and some shorts. The shirt was a T-shirt with white with black stripes on it, and the shorts were dark blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, put those on!\" she said. <br>\r\n\"Where'd you get so much fabric?\" Brandt asked. <br>\r\n\"I used to be a seamstress,\" said nanna, \"I have my sources\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Jasper tugged on the clothes. They actually fit pretty good. He smiled and looked at himself in the mirror. \"These are alright!\" he said, turning around as if he'd just put on an expensive, pure-wool, three-piece suit with a shirt made of Eygptian cotton and a tie made of French silk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it'll do...for now,\" said granny. \"But I'll probably have to make more clothes for you sometime in the future, I expect...Well...I have to prepare dinner.

The two boys looked at each other, and then looked at Jasper, who was looking at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Brandt said. \"Our parents won't mind\". <br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" said granny. \"Jasper, darling, I want you to do something for me while I prepare dinner...\" <br>\r\n\"Sure nanna, what is it?\" Jasper asked. </span></div></div>",

He bent over the saucepan and picked up a spoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!!\" <br>\r\n\"No tasting! Naughty!\" <br>\r\n\"GRANDMA!!\" <br>\r\n\"OUT!\" <br>\r\n\"But!...\"<br>\r\n\"OUT! Go set the table!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill rubbing the tender spot on his ass where his grandmother had smacked him none too lightly with a wooden spoon, Jasper opened the cupboard and carried out plates, spoons, glasses, forks and knives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get the drinks,\" said Ivan. He opened the fridge and brought out a large jug of milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your grandmother is quite a cook, Jasper, I should introduce her to mine, they'd get on like a flaming house!\" <br>\r\n\"Sure, Ivan, sure,\" said Jasper. <br>\r\n\"She makes these beautiful little dumplings, stuffed with meat and potatoes and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWW!!!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvan screamed and could've jumped two feet in the air! Taffy shot out from underneath Ivan's foot and scarpered off down the corridor. Balancing the plates, glasses and cutlery in one hand, Jasper lunged backwards to try and grab the jug of milk. It flew out of Ivan's hand and plummetted downwards! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper's hand was about a foot from the jug. And the jug was about three inches from the floor. It was hovering in midair! <br>\r\n\"What the hell!?\" Ivan gasped. <br>\r\n\"Here juggy...\" Jasper said, as if he was coaxing a frightened kitten out from under a bed, \"Come here...good juggy...come on...come to Jasper...come on...COME ON!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jug, jumped into the air and the milk inside it sloshed around. Then, to Ivan's amazement, it hovered over to Jasper, who grabbed it by the handle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you DO THAT?\" he gasped. <br>\r\n\"I...I dunno...\" said Jasper. \"I just thought...I...I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything had happened so fast, Jasper hadn't realised WHAT had happened! He just stopped a jug from falling five feet and smashing into a million pieces. The jug had hovered in mid-air and had come to him when called! What? Jasper had told Ivan and Brandt about his alien-beingness in class...written on a sheet of paper...but he didn't think his powers included the ability to levitate stuff! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper headed to the table and put everything down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try it again!\" Ivan said. Jasper looked at everything, \"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n\"Go on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper shrugged. \"Um...okay...uhh...Hmmmm....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper paused. How the hell would he do this? How DID he do it? He stood there, thinking. Then, he raised a hand. The plates rose into the air. The knives and forks spilt off the plates, clattering onto the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops,\" Jasper said. <br>\r\n\"How're you DOING THAT?\" Ivan asked.<br>\r\n\"I'm just...thinking about it. It's...mind-power, I think,\" Jasper said. Jaspr then waved his arms around the room, the plates flew, this way and that, skidding, clunking and clattering into place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey this is pretty fun!\" he said. He continued to practice, with the glasses and cutlery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try the jug again,\" said Ivan. \"Fill the glasses!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper grinned. Holding out his hands and concentrating hard, and looking at the jug, Jasper watched it hovering mid-air. It floated from the middle of the table, over one of the glasses. Ivan picked up the glass. Jasper was thinking in his mind: <i>Tip...tip...tip...come on...tip...tip over...tip...pour...tip...tip...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jug slowly began to rise. The bottom rose up, and the top came down. Shakily, it started splooshing milk into the glass. It wasn't perfect, and Jasper felt he got more milk onto the table than he did get into the glass...but it was a start, anyway! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I need practice,\" he said, when he watched Ivan wiping the milk off his right hand. </span></div></div>",

Ivan and Brandt had chatted, joked, shouted and argued, and eventually went home about nine thirty. Jasper had helped his grandmother clean up, while mom and dad helped Hunter with his homework. After convincing him that \"Happiness\" didn't have a 'y' in it, they sat down to watch some late-night television together while nanna went to do some writing. Jasper had already finished his homework. He whizzed through it at super-speed, turning the pages of his books so fast he nearly set them on fire. Right now, he lay in his temporary bed, wondering what to do. Why not practice that telekinesis thing? Yeah... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper walked over to his rubbish-bin. It was empty. He put it in the middle of his bedroom. He opened a drawer in his desk and pulled out two baseballs and two tennis-balls. He put them on his desk. Sitting on the side of his hammock, Jasper practiced levitating the balls from his desk, to the bin. He did this over and over again, back and forth. Then, he tried levitating heavier things like books, chairs and lamps around the room. They floated and hovered and wavered, but never once did they ever drop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is easy!\" he said to himself. He wanted something harder. He put a blank pad of paper on his desk and focused on the fountain pen his dad bought him for school. The cap unscrewed. The pen rose into the air and the nib swung downwards to point to the page. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, then faster and faster, the nib scribbled over the page, leaving shining, glistening lines of black ink. Jasper recapped the pen and then went to see what he'd done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit messy, but otherwise, Jasper was now convinced he could control his telekinesis enough to make a pen write for him. This was kinda cool. He wondered what else to do. Using on his telekinetic powers, he opened the box of matches on his bedside table that he kept there just for blackouts. A match hovered in mid-air, then, it struck itself against the side of the box. It flared to life and then floated upwards towards the candle next to Jasper's bedside lamp. The match lit the candle, and then fell to the tabletop, extinguishing itself on the way down. Jasper levitated the candle towards him and then blew it out. This was EASY! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper tiptoed out of his room and tiptoed into his brother's room. Hunter was asleep. Scrapples the tiger was snuggled up under his owner's arm, and Taffy the kitten was snoozling away in the folds of the blanket. The cat snuffled, but didn't wake up. Slowly, Jasper made Scrapples rise into the air. Higher, higher, higher...soon, the plush-toy was just a couple of inches from the celing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scrapples?\" Hunter mumbled. \"Scrapp...YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK!!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter screamed loud enough to wake the dead! The terrified, ten-year-old boy found himself floating, about six feet up in the air, completely unsupported! There wasn't a single thing that he could see, that was holding him up, and yet he couldn't get down, either! The bedroom door opened and Darlene came in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey what...Jasper!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper stepped out of the shadows behind the closet and grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put your brother back into bed right now!\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah mom\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper levitated Hunter back to bed, and dumped Scrapples on top of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to hear you bullying your brother again, okay?\" Darlene asked. <br>\r\n\"Yeah mom,\" said Jasper. <br>\r\n\"Good! And you let him sleep!\" <br>\r\n\"Okay, okay!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarlene left the room, closing the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey little tiger,\" said Jasper. He walked over to Hunter's bed and sat down. Hunter scrabbled up onto his pillows, hugging Scrapples as if he was a lifeline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't touch me!\" he said. <br>\r\n\"Heeeey, I was just messin' with yah,\" said Jasper, \"Come on...C'mere!\"<br>\r\n\"No!\" <br>\r\n\"Huuuunter!\"<br>\r\n\"You SCARED ME!!!\" <br>\r\n\"Hey I had to practice! And you weren't doing anything\". <br>\r\n\"You took Scrapples!\" <br>\r\n\"Heeeey,\" said Jasper. He came closer, but Hunter didn't move. Jasper reached out and grabbed his brother, \"It's okay little dude,\" he said. He hugged him, \"I was just messin' with yah...Hey, no hard feelings, okay?\" <br>\r\n\"Awwww...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper gave his brother a hug and ruffled his hair. \"Come on, tiger, time for bed...hmmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...no hard feelings...but next time wake me UP if you're going to leveltate me!\" <br>\r\n\"Whenever you like, tiger,\" said Jasper. \"Goodnight\".<br>\r\n\"Night Jaspy\". <br>\r\n\"Goodnight, Scrapples!\" <br>\r\n\"Scrapples is still angry with you!\" </span></div></div>",

He'd tossed, turned, fidgeted, stretched, compacted, had cramps, growing-pains and stiffness all over his body. If not for the fact that the hammock wrapped tightly around his body, he would've rolled right out onto the floor. Jasper got up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK! RIP!! Schirrrrrip!!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GODDAMN IT!\" he screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like your brother's awaaake!\" said Nanna, as she gave Hunter a kiss, \"Come on, Hunter, hurry, or he'll be eating all your breakfast again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanna left Hunter to change, and went to see what her other grandson was up to. She knocked on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasper, darling, can I come in?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper groaned. He'd completely ripped out of his clothes! Not even his underwear managed to stay in one piece! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" he began, \"Gran my clothes ripped again!\" <br>\r\n\"That's alright, I have some bigger ones,\" she said, \"Can I come in?\"<br>\r\n\"No you don't get it, like, they TOTALLY ripped! I don't have a damn thing to WEAR!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanna laughed. She headed to her bedroom and came back a few minutes later with some stuff in her arms. She opened the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeeeeell!\"<br>\r\n\"NANNA!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe petite woman closed the door behind her while her giant grandson sat, dejected on his hammock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ARE growing!\" she said, and she chuckled. Jasper sure was. \"Just look at yoooouuu!\" said nanna, staring him up and down, \"How tall are you now?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't KNOW!\" Jasper groaned, \"I can't even stand up straight anymore!\" <br>\r\n\"Well stand up anyway, and we'll see! These ceilings are eight feet high\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper groaned. He stood up. His long legs straightened out, his back and torso sought verticality...his monster schlong fell down heavily and hung there under its own weight...his shoulders and chest came upright...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Clunk!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" he said, \"I'm gonna get a crick in my neck if I get any taller!\" <br>\r\n\"Yes I can see...\" said Nanna. <br>\r\n\"WILL YOU STOP!...\" Jasper sat down again to try in vain to conceal his flesh-cannon, which was now a hefty two feet long. And his nuts really were the size of nuts now. Coconuts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman dropped the clothes and laughed. \"Oh Jasper!...You're my little dumpling and I LOVE you!\" she said. \"But still...one has to stare at your...development...\" she said, and her eyes lingered downwards again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gran, just LEAVE! Thanks for the clothes, I'll get changed now!\" he said, desperate to get his grandmother out of the room. Christ! Was it really natural for all grandmothers to be this interested in their grandson's sexual equipment!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper finally tugged on his clothes, brushed his teeth and headed to the kitchen. He ate four boxes of cereal and drank six bottles of milk, two loaves of bread and a pound of butter for breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, lost your appetite this morning?\" David asked. He laughed and waved goodbye to his kids and wife and then headed out the front door to work. </span></div></div>",

He was so tall now, that even the corridors at school could barely take him. Well, they could take him rather comfortably, but still, he was having trouble ducking around hanging light-fixtures and doorframes and dangly art-displays. He soared overhead, between the ceiling, and the tops of students, finally landing outside his locker. He untied the steel rod around his door and took out his books and papers and headed off to class. As he flew around the corridors, he could hear voices following him everywhere...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Did he get even taller?\"<br>\r\n\"Did he get even hotter?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh hell yeah!\"<br>\r\n\"Check out those ARMS!\"<br>\r\n\"What a CUTE butt!\" <br>\r\n\"Is that his dick or a spare petrol tank for the resident jumbo jet?

Girls came in and felt him up, boys came in and drooled. One by one, the class was assembled. Mostly around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, class!\" said their geography teacher, \"Today we're studying the Earth's magnetism and continental drift! So, if we could all fight Jasper's magnetism and drift away from our resident continent, back to our seats, we can...Marcia, Susan, what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n\"Just checking out the twin peaks of Mount Jaspmore,\" said Marcia and Susan giggled. The two chicks sat back down again, keeping their eyes squarely focused on Jasper's ass. <br>\r\n\"Oh very funny Marcia\", said Jasper. Their teacher smiled, \"Okay, now in the beginning there was just one, big landmass...who can tell me the name of that landmass...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper groaned. he was good in geography, but he found it mindnumbingly boring. Perhaps he should fall asleep? </span></div></div>",

No!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah you did!\" said one of the girls, \"We all turned around and you weren't there!\" <br>\r\n\"What?

Hmmm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf his MIND was blank...Maybe HE would also become 'blank'? Like, invisible? But then why did he reappear when he spoke? His mind wasn't blank!...but that was no good. How could this be a power, then? Jasper did some more thinking. Yeah...prehaps once his mind was blank and he went invisible, if he kept thinking about invisibility, he would REMAIN invisible, no matter what? Yeah...that seemed to make sense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" he said. He stood up. \"I'm gonna try this out\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood at the front of the classroom...then paused, \"Who's got a mirror?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandt handed Jasper his iPod. The shiny stainless-steel case would do as a mirror. Jasper emptied his mind, trying to think about as little as possible. Right on cue, his face, reflected in the shiny steel case of the iPod, vanished!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" he said. He stared at his arms, his legs, his body, hands, feet, clothing...He was totally invisible! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is cool!\" he said, \"Can you see me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" said Brandt. <br>\r\n\"Me neither!\" said Ivan. <br>\r\n\"Oh this is awesome! I can go invisible now!\" Jasper said, \"Oh wow! This is...cool!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, just by willing himself, Jasper became visible again. Then invisible, then visible. He switched back and forth faster than a bored man channel-surfed on a TV. Ivan and Brandt were getting dizzy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can go invisible!\" he said, \"Yeah!!!\" </span></div></div>",

He visualised the ktichen in his mind, and then whispered the word under his breath. \"Kitchen!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinked his eyes. He remembered it only happpened because he closed his eyes. He blinked. His room. An instant of darkness. Light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared around him again...he was standing at the kitchen doorway!

He could feel a cool breeze on his face. Breeze? Where was he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper took a step forward and felt hard concrete beneath his feet. He let out a yelp of shock! He ran! Then stopped. And looked down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, he was standing on the roof of the school's main building! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn...maybe I should've been more specific...\" he said. He thought of...the gym! Yeah, that would work. The gym was huge...He blinked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he opened his eyes again, the breeze was gone. Jasper was aware of the musty smell of sweat, salty water and moisture. Where was he? He took a step. He could feel linoleum under his feet. Or something that felt like lino, anyway. He blinked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper let out a roar like a lion! He staggered back and hit the floor, hard! Everything in front of him was brightly lit! As bright as if it was daytime! What the hell was going on!? He got to his feet and looked around. He blinked. Suddenly, he was in darkness again. He blinked again, and suddenly he could see everything! He could see that he was in the basketball court of the school's gym. He rushed to the door, squeezed through it and headed downstairs to the change-rooms. He stepped into the bathroom and stared at himself in the mirror. His eyes were shining a powerful, bright light! And not just flashlight powerful, this was like...lighthouse powerful! Jasper was sure if he stood out on a rock in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, people a hundred miles away could point him out! Jasper blinked. His 'eyelights' went off and he found himself in darkness again. He blinked once more, and found that they turned on again. He kept blinking. Off, on, off, on, off, on, off...on. Soon, he discovered that by thinking, he could control the power and range of his eyelights. This was awesome! But he had to get back to practicing his teleportation. He thought of a place he wanted to be. In front of the serving-counter in the cafeteria. He blinked. Then, he blinked again, to turn on his eyelights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made it! He blinked and thought of a stairwell near the science-department...he was there! He thought of the foyer of the administration complex...there he was! This was easy! Soon, Jasper didn't even have to THINK anymore. He just had to WANT to go there and he was there! This was incredible!! He stood in the foyer of the administration building. The library was behind him, in front of him, offices and the staffroom and the kitchens and storage-rooms. The foyer was a huge, airy place in the daytime, but at night, it was quiet, dark, cold, empty...and kinda spooky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jasper was brought back from his wanderings, his musings, by a sharp pain in his back! His legs, his calves, his arms, his shoulders! His NECK! He collapsed to the ground and groaned! His entire body was cramping up and it hurt like hell! He couldn't even MOVE! He just lay helpless on the ground as his muscles cramped up! His teeth were gritted and his body was shaking, he was sweating! Slowly...VERY slowly...the pain went away...What WAS that? Jasper got to his feet and stretched a bit, trying to get the kinks and tingles out of his body. Wait...something wasn't right. He felt different...Something was tight....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. Not now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRIP! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper's shirt ripped open as he started growing taller! NOW when would it stop? Last time this happened, he reached 8'3\"! How much would he grow this time? And what was that he could hear in the distance? Footsteps? Jasper was glad the room was so dark. He could hear the footsteps getting closer! Closer! CLOSER!!!! </span></div></div>",

He could feel his back and whole body expanding upwards and outwards as he grew taller, wider, heavier, more muscular. His clothes once again ripped to shreds. He stared at himself in the reflective glass windows of the offices on the second floor of the building...Damn he looked hot. But nanna was going to KILL HIM...or die from shock...when she realised he'd ripped through yet another set of clothes! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper didn't have anything around with which to measure himself with. He would go home and try and sleep it off...Wait...how could he go HOME? He'd barely fit in the HOUSE! Damn it! It wasn't a bad night. It was warm, with a slight breeze, but the breeze was warm, too. Oh to hell with it. He'd sleep on the roof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper squeezed out of the foyer of the school admin building and took off. He hoped nobody saw him, the only thing that had managed to stay on his body were his boxer-shorts, and even they felt uncomfortably tight. Navigating by streetlamps, Jasper finally reached home. Instead of landing on the front lawn like he usually did, he landed on the roof. He found a flat-patch above the garage, and fell asleep on the cool, rough roof. He hoped nobody would wake up to find him sleeping, almost totally naked, on the roof of the house, and ask him what the hell he thought he was up to... </span></div></div>",

What was that noise...? Oh right...the church in the next block was striking the hour. Jasper groaned and got to his feet. He listened to the striking bells. Three...four...five...six...seven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeven o'clock in the morning. Jasper groaned. He sat down on the roof of the garage...then he lay down...then he rolled over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHUMP!!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper struggled to his feet! He just dropped eight feet off the roof of the garage, landing in his grandmother's flowerbeds! Oh Nanna was gonna really kill him now. He got up and shook the dirt and soil and leaves and flowers out of his hair and stretched. Oh God...what a way to start the day. He leaned against the garage, running his hands through his hair, one elbow resting on the roof...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait what? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince when was he tall enough that he could stand next to a building eight feet tall and rest his elbow...albeit at right-angles to his torso...on the roof? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper stared at the garage, and then stared at himself. He did a quick calculation in his head. Oh no...this could NOT be happening...But it had. Somehow, he'd grown even TALLER during the night! He wasn't quite sure HOW tall, but he guessed it was less than the huge spurt he had when he was fooling around in school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front door opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...look up, the skies are sunny...YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nanna!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanna, who had come out to get the newspaper stared up at the giant teenager, dressed only in red boxer-shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JASPER?\" she gasped, \"WHAT HAPPENED?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, in some, superhuman feat of contortionistic skill, Jasper managed to get himself into the house. His grandmother closed the door and Jasper sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What HAPPENED to you!?\" she asked, \"And where are the clothes I made you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBit by bit, Jasper explained what happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can see in the dark?\" she said.<br>\r\n\"Well...Sorta. Lights came out of my eyes and it was like I had headlights or...eyelights, really\". <br>\r\n\"And you grew more?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Only this spurt was huge! All my muscles cramped up! I was having...I dunno...growing pains, I guess...I don't even know how tall I am now. Nanna, I'm sorry about the clothes...\"<br>\r\n\"Ooooh it's alright,\" she said, \"I can make more!...I wonder how tall you really are, then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOAH!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter appeared at the top of the stairs wearing blue pyjamas and holding Scrapples in his hands. \"Nanna what did you FEED him?\"<br>\r\n\"Hey Tiger,\" said Jasper, \"Yeah I know...I dunno what Nanna's been feeding me, either\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanna scratched her forehead. \"How are we going to do this...I know!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman ran to her bedroom and came back a few minutes later with some knitting-needles, a ball of yarn, and a foot-long ruler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Outside!\" she said. Jasper squeezed through the door again and went into the back yard, with Hunter following. Nanna instructed her grandson to lay on the grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunter, take one end of the ball of wool and this knitting-needle,\" said Nanna, tying the end of the wool-strand to the needle, \"and push the needle into the ground at Jasper's feet, understand?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah nanna,\" said Hunter. Jasper reached out for Scrapples. <br>\r\n\"I'll look after him for yah,\" said Jasper. Hunter gave his plush-toy to his brother and then went to peg out the string. Nanna tugged the ball of wool along the full length of Jasper's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chin up, darling, I want to get a proper measurement!\" she said. Jasper jerked his chin upwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good...\" Nanna broke the yarn, tied the broken end to another knitting needle, and sank that into the ground, just after the end of Jasper's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" she said, \"Get up and measure it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper got up and reached for the foot-long ruler and started measuring the string. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One...two...three...four...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he goes on like that, we'll be here until dinner!\" said Hunter. <br>\r\n\"Patience, honey,\" said Nanna, putting her arms around Hunter's chest, \"Let's just wait\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...seven...eight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper paused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, honey?\" Nanna piped up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nine foot, even\", Jasper said. Hunter's jaw dropped and nanna screamed, clapping her hands to her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You grrew...\" she said.<br>\r\n\"NINE INCHES!...\" Hunter blurted out. <br>\r\n\"IN ONE NIGHT!?\" the old lady screamed. <br>\r\n\"I...I guess...\" said Jasper. <br>\r\n\"Oooooh...\" Nanna groaned. Hunter yelped and reached out to catch the old lady as she lost her footing and nearly fainted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nanna!?\" David shouted, running out the back door, \"What's...Woah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBit by bit, Jasper explained everything to his parents. Darlene shook her head. \"You better stay home today, Jasper,\" she said. \"You'll need your rest after a growth-spurt like that! Not even nanna thought you'd grow that much!\"<br>\r\n\"Got that straight!\" said Nanna, sitting in her armchair, still holding the nine feet of woollen yarn which had nearly made her drop in a dead faint. \"Nine feet!\" she said again. \"Oh my my my...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper smiled, he gave his grandmother a kiss, \"Love you, nanna,\" he said. Heading downstairs into the basement, now the only room which was really large enough to hold Jasper, he lay down on a bunch of mattresses that his father had set up for him as a temporary bed. He needed a break. Hunter, David and Darlene went off to school and work. Nanna started doing the housework... </span></div></div>",

One loaf, buttered, with a pound of butter. She started cooking. Nanna was a machine. She danced a ballet around the kitchen, switching, swirling, hopping and twirling between the bench, sink, stove, fridge, cupboards, toaster, garbage-bins and a huge, 18-inch wide platter on the table. Once everything was done, the kitchen was spotless, nanna was exhausted, and Jasper would be starving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaaaaasper honey!\" she called downstairs, \"Breakfast!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper came up carefully, not wanting to bump his head on anything, and sat down at the table...on the floor. He ate, and ate, and ate, and ate. It was almost an hour of solid eating. He finished the sausages, bacon and eggs, then the tomatoes and toast, then the pancakes, ice-cream and syrup, and finally, the huge bowl of cereal and milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...that was great, nanna,\" he said. \"Thanks\". <br>\r\n\"My pleasure,\" she said. \"You go have a nap, I'm going to make you some new clothes\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper nodded and went to lie down.

He stumbled over to a rubbish-bin and tossed the handfuls of powder into the bin and then turned around. Hanging on a chair were some new clothes. He tugged them on, they were comfortable and soft. Perfect. He wondered what to do. He could go flying, but his grandmother insisted he stay home. He was bored. He had powers, he wanted to use them! He sighed and lounged around the house. He read, he ate, he watched TV, he went online and surfed the 'net. He would sleep more, but he was already energised enough from his last nap to have enough power and rigor to dig a tunnel to China. He played cards with his grandmother and when nightfall finally came and dinner was over and mum and dad were watching TV, nanna finally let Jasper get some fresh air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brazil's in South AMERICA, not South AFRICA,\" Jasper said, looking over Hunter's shoulder as his younger brother completed his geography homework. Hunter crossed out \"AFRICA\" and wrote \"AMERICA\" above it. \"Thanks,\" he said. Jasper smiled, \"Yeah,\" he said. He hugged his little brother. \"Well, I'm off...\"<br>\r\n\"Where you going?\" <br>\r\n\"I've been stuck in this house all day! Nanna wouldn't let me out! I need some fresh air, man!\"<br>\r\n\"Awww...I wanna fly with you! Take me with you!\" <br>\r\n\"Hunter I need some time alone to just cool off...A lot of stuff has happened lately and I need time to THINK,\" said Jasper. <br>\r\n\"Okaaaaay...\" said Hunter.

It's cool!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper laughed and gave his brother another hug, \"Yeah they are pretty cool, huh? Listen, once all these stupid changes stop, we can hang out whenever you like, okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n\"Heeeeey, just remember what nanna said; one day, you'll get your powers!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah but that won't be for ages!\"<br>\r\n\"Patience is a virtue, little brother...\" <br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jasper was gone. Hunter stared out the dining-room window to see Jasper do a mid-air somersault. He waved to Hunter, and then flew off into the night sky. Hunter groaned. He was bored. He finished his homework, packed his stuff away and went to his room to relax and eventually, sleep. </span></div></div>",

Then, she burst out laughing. \"Honey, Jasper isn't HOME! He went out flying last night! He came home just before I was going to bed and said he wouldn't be back until late morning, and not to wait up for him\". <br>\r\n\"You mean...he's NOT doing this?\"<br>\r\n\"Not as far as I know\".<br>\r\n\"Then...I...I....woah...\"<br>\r\n\"You can FLY honey!\"<br>\r\n\"I...I...I can!...I...I...wow!

Hunter's gained his flying-power!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stared at his mother-in-law, \"THIS EARLY?\" he shouted.<br>\r\n\"I know, it's rather amazing...\" she said. \"Here Hunter, try and control your flight, just think\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Hunter hovered forward, then back. Then up...and then back down to his feet again. Oh this was cool! He really COULD FLY! Oh man! He started doing somersaults and backflips and barrel-rolls and loopy-loops and all kinds of things! This was AWESOME! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening his bedroom door fully, Hunter flew out into the corridor and around the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi nanna, bye nanna!\" he said as he whizzed past her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU BE CAREFUL YOU DON'T BREAK ANYTHING!\" she shouted after him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah nanna!\" he said and he whizzed through the entrance-hall and through the family-room. Taffy and Furkins hissed at hm as he flew past over the dining-table into the kitchen and landed at the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww...we're very proud of you, sweetums,\" said Darlene, ruffling her son's hair. David gave his son a hug, \"You be good now,\" he said, \"Finish your breakfast\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Darlene and Devid were off to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can FLY!\" Hunter said to himself. Oh COOL!!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanna came into the kitchen and made herself some coffee. She smiled at her grandson...then she hugged him, sat him in her lap and snuggled him and smothered him like a baby. She rocked him gently in her arms and held him close, kissing him on the face all over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my little babies are growing up so fast!\" she said. \"Nanna's very proud of you, sweetums\". <br>\r\n\"Love you too, nanna,\" he said. <br>\r\n\"Mmmm!\" she said, and ruffled his hair and held him tight. \"Love you!...Now you go finish off your cereal\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter sat down and started eating. He was hungry, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nanna, will my other powers come soon, like with Jasper?\" he asked. <br>\r\n\"They might,\" she said. \"But there's no real way of knowing.

WAIT FOR ME!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before Nanna could get another word in, Jasper had taken off into the skies!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHERE ARE YOU, YOU CONNIVING LITTLE!...\"<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\" said Hunter, springing up behind his brother and kicking him in the back. <br>\r\n\"YOU LITTLE!...\"<br>\r\n\"Tag! You're it!\" <br>\r\n\"Oh you are dead, pee-wee!\" <br>\r\n\"Gotta catch me first, Jumbo!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter zipped off into the sky with Jasper close on his tail. Jasper threw out his arms and grabbed his brother by the legs. \"When the hell did YOU learn to fly, huh?\" he asked, and started tickling Hunter all over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!! STOP! STOP! STOP I CAN'T!...HAHAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! JASPER STOP!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter fell from the sky and Jasper grabbed him and held him easily in his gigantic arms, \"You can FLY!\" <br>\r\n\"I know!\" said Hunter, \"Isn't this GREAT!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper grabbed his brother by the ankles and hurled him into the air like a boomerang! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo-hoooooooooooooooooooooo!!!\" ; Hunter screamed as he cartwheeled off into the sky. \"This is FUN!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper soared after him, \"You wait til I catch you, pipsqueak!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't!\"<br>\r\n\"Yes I do!\"<br>\r\n\"Ooooh no!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter whizzed off and Jasper laughed. \"Come here you little bastard!\" he flew down towards his brother, grabbed him and gave him a noogie, rapping his knuckles his brother's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooow!\" Hunter yelped. Jasper laughed, \"Gotcha!\" he said. <br>\r\n\"You asshole!\" Hunter shouted. Jasper smiled. \"Awww...You got your wings, kid...Nice work\". <br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Hunter. \"Wanna go flying?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper shrugged a huge, broad shoulder, \"Sure, why not?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Students screamed as something small, brown, blue and tan, shot over their heads; it whipped up dust, sand and leaves as it sped past! It whizzed over the front gates, under one arch, across the courtyard and out again, under another arch! They had barely recovered when another rushing sound was heard, and an even larger, brown and black juggernaut, zoomed overhead, sounding like a jumbo-jet! This last interruption had left everyone coughing and spluttering as leaves, loose papers, dust and rubbish were blasted into the air by the slipstream of whatever had just hurtled past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that!?\" one of the students, a boy with blonde hair, asked. <br>\r\n\"It's coming again!\" someone shouted. And this time, one of the mysterious intruders shot through the courtyard and threw something into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT'S A BOMB!\" someone screamed. The second...thing, whatever it was, wearing blue, shot up, grabbed the thing the other UFO had thrown into the air and then shot down towards earth, landing in the middle of the courtyard, surrounded by dozens of shocked students. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi!\" Hunter said. Hunter had caught his backpack, which Jasper had thrown into the air just a few moments earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor about thirty seconds, nobody said anything. Then, the boy with blonde hair screamed out \"HOW DID YOU DO THAT!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once, everyone started talking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duuude!\"<br>\r\n\"That was so cool!\"<br>\r\n\"I wonder who the other guy was?\"<br>\r\n\"Since when could Hunter FLY?\"<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy with blond hair, a kid named Paul, ran towards Hunter, \"THAT WAS AMAZING!\" he screamed over the noise of hundreds of students and teachers shouting and chattering to each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It runs in the family?\" Hunter suggested. <br>\r\n\"Dude!\" Paul said, \"That was amazing!...Can you take people flying?\"<br>\r\n\"Not yet,\" said Hunter, \"I'm not strong enough to fly and carry guys at the same time. One day, I will be\". <br>\r\n\"Cool!\" said Paul, \"Can't wait!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smiled, Paul was his best friend in school, and they did all kinds of things together. Paul loved acting and he was whizz at all kinds of subjects. He was a small, usually silent boy, which was unfortunate...for the girls, at least...who thought he was also incredibly cute. He wasn't very tall, but he had a slender build and dark blond hair and a thin face. He was a good listener and an expert confidant. He didn't tell anyone anyone else's secrets. This was why Hunter liked him so much...Not that the fact that Hunter could now fly, was going to be much of a schoolyard secret anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JASPER!\" the girls screamed as he touched down in the yard outside the highschool across the road from his brother's own elementary school, \"Wow!...Did you get even TALLER?\"<br>\r\n\"Even HOTTER?\"<br>\r\n\"More buff?\"<br>\r\n\"More HUNG?\"<br>\r\n\"More cute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of the above, ladies,\" said Jasper, smiling. The girls flocked around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was that kid flying with you?\" one of the girls asked, craning her neck up to look at him, \"He was so cute!\"<br>\r\n\"That's his brother, Fisher or Trapper or...\"<br>\r\n\"Hunter,\" Jasper corrected. \"Yeah, he just learnt how to fly,\" and he said it as if he just said: \"He just learnt how to walk\". <br>\r\n\"Oooh wow!\" said another girl, \"That's cool! And he's so cute! Like a mini-version of you. Are your parents having anymore kids? Or are you guys like...limited editions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper laughed at the thought of being compared to a toy...or a toy-boy. Or a plaything...or a player...but he took it in stride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry girls, but Hunter's the only brother I have\".<br>\r\n\"What about sisters?\" one of the guys asked, \"You gotta sister, right Jasper? I bet she's hot!\"<br>\r\n\"Jason!\" one of the girls chided, \"Stop!\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry guys, I only got one sibling, and that's Hunter,\" Jasper said. Then, he vanished and teleported to his locker. </span></div></div>",

He put his stuff into his locker and pulled out his books for maths and English. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Davian!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter turned around to see Mr. Ivans, the school headmaster. \"Can you come with me, please?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was nervous. Mr. Ivans was a scary guy. Or at least, he looked scary. He was actually quite nice once you got to know him, and he knew all his students by name. Hunter followed him uneasily along the corridor and up some stairs, into the administration-wing of the school and into an office. Ivans beckoned Hunter in, and then closed the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your grandmother gave me a phone-call this morning, just before school started,\" said Mr. Ivans, he pointed to a seat and gestured for Hunter to sit down. \"And I want you to know that...\"<br>\r\n\"I can't fly in school?\" Hunter asked. <br>\r\n\"I didn't say that...\" said Mr. Ivans, he sat down as well. <br>\r\n\"We all know about your brother. And your grandmother telephoned to advise me that you too, will soon be developing...certain powers. Is that right?\"<br>\r\n\"Um...I guess so,\" said Hunter. <br>\r\n\"Very well then,\" said Ivans. \"I want us to have an understanding, then, that you won't use your powers to hurt anyone...\"<br>\r\n\"So I can't!?\"<br>\r\n\"You CAN use your powers! It wouldn't be fair if you couldn't. But I want you to understand that...as they say...with great powers come great responsibility. I want you to use them carefully and responsibly, understand?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes sir\". <br>\r\n\"Good\".<br>\r\n\"What if someone's being picked on? What if it's an emergency?\" Hunter asked.<br>\r\n\"You should get a teacher,\" said Mr. Ivans.<br>\r\n\"What if there isn't time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Ivans laughed, \"Your grandmother warned me you might try this. She said the same thing about your brother. If you really think you have to, you can go ahead and do whatever you like, provided it's for a good cause and there aren't any lasting consequences, understand?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes sir\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" said Mr. Ivans, \"Well I think that's everything. I hope that you have a nice day. And Hunter...\"<br>\r\n\"Yes sir?\" <br>\r\n\"Perhaps when you're free, you can fly over the school and get down all the balls and frisbees stuck on the roof. I've been getting calls from all the teachers who are asking me when I'm gonna get maintenance up there to get their students' balls down again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter grinned, \"Sure Mr. Ivans\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Hunter left the room.

Reading, writing, spelling, writing, reading, spelling, more reading, more writing. After English was maths. Usually, Hunter struggled with maths, but today he found it easy. Real easy! He began to notice stuff like how he could burn through entire pages of questions in just minutes. And he didn't even need his calculator! His biro scribbled over the page, writing out lists of answers. Was he suddenly getting really smart? Naaaaah...but what if? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the lunch-bell rang... </span></div></div>",

I've never tried flying with another guy before...\" <br>\r\n\"Please? Just for me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeell...okay...but not here. Let's go around the other side of the square, first\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends got up and headed out of the schoolyard and around the side of the building. An empty basketball court looked like the best place to try this thing out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you need to grab hold of my shoulders,\" said Hunter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul found an old crate.

He leapt a couple of feet off the ground, then fell forward! Paul yelped, but Hunter didn't seem to notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax,\" said Hunter. \"I can't fly up vertical, you'd drop off!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking his time, Hunter started flying up in ever-widening circles, until he was about fifty feet up in the air, the wind whipping his brown hair away from his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woooow!\" said Paul, \"This is incredible!\" <br>\r\n\"Hold on, buddy!\" said Hunter as he zoomed around the schoolground.

Jasper absent mindedly stroked his chin in thought while he flew \"Hey what if I try a different form!\" Jasper thought aloud before focusing his thoughts, his body concaved, feathers grew out of his arms \"Actually, I should turn into a bat. Not a lot of birds out at this hour.\" Jasper course corrected his changes to become a bat as Jasper continued to fly he passed through a modest patch of trees \"This is pretty easy.\" Jasper thought aloud <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jasper flew he noticed a lake \"Hm... not exactly the prettiest form I could take.\" Jasper mused seeing his rodent self in the water. Jasper stopped, now flying in place looking at his reflection, with some focusing Jasper turned into himself again, but he continued to change, his hips grew wider, flat pecs bloomed into modest breasts, a frilly pink dress and earrings adorned Jasper's body, Jasper felt at the earrings until they were flower shaped. Jasper flew across the countryside, the first thing she heard was the way the wind flew through her long hair, her earrings jingled pleasantly, getting a good view of the mountains before heading to his friend Ivan's house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jasper landed bellow the deck, Ivan was reading. Jasper decided to slither up like a snake, as he got closer he noticed Ivan wasn't reading, the book was actually over his eyes as he was asleep. Jasper flew above Ivan before a small sneeze escaped Jasper. Ivan jerked up in surprise \"Gah! Don't do that!\" Ivan exclaimed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Ivan. Didn't think you'd scare so easily.\" Jasper joked at him <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see people flying over my bed!\" Ivan argued angrily <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay but come on these powers are so cool! Look I can change into whatever I want!\" Jasper declared before he turned into a copy of Ivan \"See, you don't even need a mirror when I'm around!\" Jasper remarked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When am I ever gonna need that?\" Ivan asked flatly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026 When you don't have a mirror.\" Jasper squeaked, seeing Ivan's annoyed face Jasper could tell he was losing the crowd here \"Come on, I'll make it up to you. These are awesome powers, dude.\" Jasper said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good, I have a mirror already.\" Ivan remarked <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper was spurred by this, he waited till Ivan wasn't looking before transforming again \"Don't be that way.\" Jasper spoke in a sweet, breathy woman's voice. Ivan looked uncomfortably finding Jasper had transformed, now Jasper's mother, wearing a wrap-around Bikini top and a very small towel. Ivan could tell that Jasper looked much younger than Ivan's mother, but still had her core features surrounded with a youthful and beautiful appearance, her breasts jiggled as she hopped impatiently \"What's a matter? Aren't you gonna come here and give mama a hug?\" She asked sweetly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-don't do that.\" Ivan said, his expression betraying him as his face went red, Jasper played with her bracelets and wiggled to Ivan getting him to his nightstand  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not gonna work on me. I know you like it. Come on, just a little snuggle?\" Jasper asked sweetly <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvan backed up to his bed, Jasper climbed on top of him \"Aw I understand, here let Mommy help you.\" Jasper grabbed Ivan's hand on her overflowing bust \"See, it doesn't bite.\" Jasper spoke sweetly <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvan however continued to back away, refusing to say anything but uncomfortable murmurs \"It's no use trying to resist. A mother knows when a boy's got needs. I've got a couple of my own. And I know exactly how to take care of you.\" Jasper whispered seductively <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-come on, this isn't funny.\" Ivan said back up against his dresser <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love is serious business, so why are you fighting your feelings? This could be your only chance, I'm not gonna make fun of you for your tastes. You made a pretty good pick if you ask me.\" Jasper winked knowingly at Ivan <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you that stuff in private, Jasper.\" Ivan said keeping his eyes to the window, Jasper grabbed his chin and turned his eyes down towards her <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am it keeping private. You want to see? It's right here, take a looking.\" Jasper said gently forcing Ivan's head to her breasts <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvan's legs shook, he was staring right into Jasper's cleavage, it smelled like flowers and Jasper cooed softly \"There, isn't it so much better to make the move and put it out there. I can feel somebody down there that enjoys it.\" Jasper said rubbing her wide thigh against Ivans' groin <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvan groaned, without warn he rammed Jasper into his bed. \"Whoo! There's my big boy! Come get it.\" Jasper beckoned Ivan sweetly. He timidly made his way for Jasper's bikini top, He put his hands under it, Jasper pulled Ivan tighter, the two wrapping together under the sheets, Ivan meekly rubbed himself against Jasper while she giggled sweetly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go. You got it.\" Jasper said tenderly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better not tell anybody about this.\" Ivan whimpered <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I tell anyone what I'm gonna do next?\" Jasper asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasper, this is one thing but you can't seriously be thinking about that.\" Ivan said, his trembling voice betraying his objection to what they both knew was coming next <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying I'm not pretty enough for you, Ivan?\" Jasper asked pursing her lips in a frown <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get it! Come here!\" Ivan said as he started grinding against Jasper's body, Jasper cooed and hollered in tune with him <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh keep doing that, such a sweet boy.\" Jasper spoke lovingly to Ivan, he tried to fondle Jasper's hips as well as her breasts, but there was simply too much of her to get enough of, losing himself in the excitement, Ivan began rocking the bed with his frantic fondling <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't stop!\" Jasper pleaded <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvan took it to heart feeling her up and down till he couldn't get enough, now he wanted to get her out of that bikini and see it all </span></div></div>",

The following day, you realize that you can see through walls. A few hours later, you discover you can fly! A few days later, you realize you have super strength. The following week, you discover you have heat vision and super speed! One-by-one, your powers begin to develop. It almost becomes hard NOT to use them! You're just too \"super\"! How do you adjust to normal life at home and at school, as a super-kid?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, you cautiously tell your parents you've been experiencing strange feelings. Then, you find out you were an alien! How do you take that? Then, you must cope with \"being normal\" at school. How do you adjust to being a \"super-kid\" among \"normal\" students? Do you tell anyone? Do you show off to your best friend? What happens when you get bullied in school? what do you do, when you start seeing and hearing everything that happens around you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, do you decide to become a super hero? How do you pick a costume? Or, do you remain undercover? This is your chance to create a new super hero character!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease: NO sex, no vore, no killing off anyone, no curse words, no one-line chapters, or the like. I will delete and/or edit chapters as I see needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may add as many powers to your hero as you like. Make it fun and interesting. What I'm looking for, is that the hero doesn't know what powers he has until they surface, and he has to learn how to use them once he discovers what his powers are. Give him as many powers as you wish; you can practically make him omnipotent as long as he becomes a super hero and not a villain. The whole idea is that you create an \"origin\" story for a superhero here. I would love to see the \"hero\" as a character who is shy, timid, humble, and maybe even a little scared of all the powers he suddenly comes to possess. You can give him the ability to become invisible, to grow into a giant, to fire lasers from his fists, to teleport, to have telekinesis, or even to control other people's minds. How would he deal with all those powers, at home, at school, or when he's with his friends or his relatives?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***I will award 500 Gift Points to complete, acceptable, and well-written chapters of 300 words or longer.***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
