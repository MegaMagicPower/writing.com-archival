            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bob went shopping for that perfect present to give a friend when he hit the 50 year old mark in life. Everywhere he went the bigger stores had nothing to offer of what Bob thought would make a good white elephant sort of gift. As then, walking through an alley to where he had parked his car, Bob saw a side alley, and in it was the door to a shop named \"Chides of the Times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tinkle from a brass bell above the entrance told of a customer entering the small shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn elderly China-man stepped out from behind a curtain, he with a broad smile on his face. \"You want something to have good night Mister?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Bob said, \"and such as might I ask what you wish to sell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sorry to think you were here before, my mistake. You different man, want queer gift to give to a man reaching 50 years his age. Fifty dollars I show you an ointment of big pleasure, intense feelings of rare delight,\" offered the old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like how could you know what I came here looking for,\" Bob asked, he feeling foolish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" the man held his two fingers to his left temple and then smiled. I have an ointment offering renewed great strength, much heightened virility and an enhancing of the sensuality no female could resist! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, I have too a fine wine to bring out the desire to snuggle and enjoy the open air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, two possible ways of finding what is righteous for your friend, and if you use either as well, maybe the bettering of your lifestyle for someone you love,\" the old man said as then cocked his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" said Bob, he adding, \"I live alone, my life is mostly my job and few things what interest me, actually, my life is quite dull. If I could choose to change my life around it should be a life of good health, wishing for strong personal relationships, and my free constant choice of female companionship. My life would be made better if there were less responsibility, a lifestyle similar to my friend. Now, that is a wish that even your ointments, wines, and salves can't offer a solution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA scowl came over the man's face then he grinned, and waved for Bob to follow to a shelf on the back wall of the shop. As then the old man did open a pair of locked glass doors, reaching inside on his tiptoes, he took hold of a jar filled with a clear substance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here is your desire in this special once in a lifetime body ointment. At the price of five thousand dollars will bring you the easy life, and gain much freedoms with your lady friends. This enhances your masculinity, turning others with lusting eyes so they beg for your sexual attentions! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed Mister you could have a life of ease, no worry about money, and most important excellent health for a richer life!\" said the man with a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob was a good bit as unsure his greatest endeavored wish came in a jar what he would need pain on his body. As my un-trusting friend then asked, \"If I take it and I'm not satisfied, what then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When the ointment is used the sale is final; I know from past sales of these ointments that never is a jar brought back for a return. I sure you will find pleasure untold if you purchase the jar,\" said the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob was a cheapskate at heart and walked away, as he went searching for a cheaper way to get a thrill. In a darker corner was a host of very small jars, all with varied colored ointments, salves, and each had on the top lid a number. \"What are these?\" Bob asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The darker the color the more evil the use. The lighter the color the more kind and considerate. The numbers tell of the total days it lasts! <br>\r\nCustomers use them for a extra thrill on a vacation. Some last a day and a night, while others last onward for days, week, month, a season, and longer.\" said the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine but what does it do for the person?\" Bob asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matters where they travel to and what the surroundings offer and suggest. A trip to jungle could be a swinging good time, or a dude ranch could let you horse around, and go for a swim with Dolphins,\" do you understand Sir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All these, as say I went to a country style bed and breakfast what then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then apply it and choose who is your mate for your vacation stay, it is that simple,\" said the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob was by then as discombobulated about all he had seen, his weekend vacation time was almost used up, he had two or three days left. The price of what he might pick needed to be way less than five thousand dollars, but how much should he spend,\" he bluntly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked at Bob before he then looked back at the expensive ointment, shrugged his shoulders and said, \"Fifty dollars per day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob recanted his cheap thought and looked for a number three, as grabbed a black colored ointment from the shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-huh, fine choice Sir, I suggest a nice time in the country might be very thrilling,\" said the man as he took the cash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy friend Bob then left that shop and proceeded to drive as suggested to a quaint bed and breakfast place in the north woods. I'd been there before a few years ago and had mentioned to Bob of beautiful women staying there, looking for a man with virility. However the If the ointment worked as Bob thought, it shouldn't be any problem finding someone to spend the weekend with. Bob checked in and paid for a three night stay. He told me later about the very friendly old woman who ran the place, as Bob wanted to try his virility ointment, he asking not to be disturbed at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe entered his private first floor bedroom and immediately took the jar from his luggage. The old man had told him that all he need to do was to message the ointment on and choose of who then he felt a want to spend fun time enjoying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob removed his clothes and opened the jar, it having a nasty, musky odor, as the smell filled the room. Bob went to the sliding glass door leading out to a patio, for some cool fall air to counteract the smell. As then, and Bob dipped his fingers into the ointment, and started rubbing it all over his self, while anxious to get out and find a hot date...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd is the best word to describe the warm feeling that invaded his body as the ointment seeped into his skin. The lusting desire for female companionship became as overwhelming. A sniff of the fresh air brought a thick odor of female musk. The desire to follow his nose lead Bob away from the old dwelling, and toward the smell so intoxicated to his mind, as he walked nakedly closer to the origin of that scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Bob stopped and looked straight ahead as there parked between to large semi trucks was a large pickup truck and trailer. Bob stood for a moment and then wondering what he smelled, then walked closer to the trailers back gate. A look into the dark with some areas lit from parking lot lights, Bob stood there feeling dumb, eyes went wide, gawking at the sight of two healthy Angus breed heifers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping back down, Bob laughed and started to walk away. As the breeze whipped up the odor it hit Bob, making him feel weak, and he fell to his knees. Shaking his head it felt as if filled with cotton. Thoughts seemed vague and a lusty desire engulfed Bob, suggesting he needed to inspect the heifers; as enter the trailer, he getting much closer seemed to be the right thing to do. As then he did climb  over the gate, Bob jumped into the trailer for a closer look at those pretty creatures. A touch of the first one's soft black fur gave a shiver down his spine, and goose pimples sprouted over his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly, Bob began salivating, a froth of foam on his lips as he recalled having lowered his face to look directly at the first young cow, eyeing her black vulva. A moment of joy mixed with a sudden unknown desire as he did lick of her most private young part. Unknown to this day, but Bob stood the in absolute unbelief hit, as he jerked back and stood there as suddenly feeling as if drunk. His mind was spinning as again a soiled tongue licked at dry lips, Bob having an intent for another slurp of that heady juice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob reached a hand to hold himself up as lean on her flanks. The wiggle of the nervous heifer had Bob try to hold her, he seeing in the dim light what moments before was a ointment tainted human hand and arm, were then as all bovine, a foreleg and cloven hoofs. He stood and stared, as indeed he had a cloven hoof and blackened skin. His foreleg growing black fur there and looking, the fur was everywhere. Leaning more forward and giving the black cow vulva a sniff, her scent and the ointment were blending, forcing his body to change, as black skin and black fur swept over his entire self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bob turned from one side to the other, seeing as his new bovine form bloomed around him. A snort and sniff brought that wonderful smell which purged his brain of human moral thoughts. He looked down to see a wavering bright pink tapering cock arching from a black hairy sheath, as the sight of the heifer rump looked so fine. He just leaned forward and was reluctantly surprised as his stance seemed to change, allowing him to thrust, and entered to where the heifer held him fast and tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob began rocking about the feeling so right, he I knew the cock would soon shoot out a load. As he almost fell over when what he forgot was not solid ground made keeping contact wit the cow as quite difficult. Right then the thought of the fact that the truck and trailer were moving, heading on their way to a farm. Two Angus heifers and Bob becoming more akin to being a Angus bull were a holiday he was about to enjoy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bob was deep in rut feelings as he stood humping his first totally bestial born cow. No doubt as to his pangs of lust, but unlike a born bull, Bob felt passion for his mating with the second heifer. He became urgent to finish his mating, knowing that the trailer and truck turned off the highway and began a rough drive along a dust gravel road. One thing and one thing only was filled his mind, Bob gained a blind lusting desire to feel and pleasure coming from mating with tender vulva' heifers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs lucky for them and especially for Bob, as their halters were rope tied to the trailers side-slats. As their limited movement offered him two almost willing mates who could not move too far either right or left. Bob recalled that he did the first one rather quick-like, but the second was more of a lounging mating, as he remembered having three orgasmic thrills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon their arrival and when unloading, one of the wranglers said, \"Hey we picked up two cows for the Sunrise Research Farm, but we got a bull now too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I loaded the two cows in and tied them up the way you showed me, Boss! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen before I closed the tailgate I went and signed the consignment forms. I came back gave a quick look inside but by then it was dark. I closed the trail-gate, locked two latches, checked the hitch, safety chains and lights. Then you jumped into the cab and we drove to our first stop and rested at your favorite bed and breakfast bordello Motel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he is part of the load now, maybe the Farm Vet will use him for one of their weird experiments?\" said the driver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words turned Bob to wondering what he got himself into, he hearing the words said about him and his two companions. As the word \"Farm\" aroused Bob, he got another erection as they unloaded him, all the while pondering the word \"Experiments\" tended to give a chill. The farm scents were cruder than those of two lusty heifers as in a heightened state of being bred. As well Bob being by then as changed, was a Black Angus bull, he was still taking his accounting of just how much of him had so changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was mid-morning when the truck driver returned with a man wearing a white laboratory dress jacket, as on the jacket pocket Bob eyed it closely, and with some difficulty her read it as \"Sunrise Research Farm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon then the truck with trailer drove away and Bob stood still alone, wearing then a head halter and having a leather rein clipped, as tied to a ring-post, leaving his black furry body to soak up the heat rays from the Sun. A slow turn of the head to see men coming toward him, both laughing and making rude notes about what the heifer thought, feeling the brutal technique of a bull stretching their new bovine vagina. They quickly stopped laughing and talking when a man dressed in black shirt and slacks walked out the two story tall building, and met with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob felt he was still somewhat aroused, feeling a fly taking a walk along the length of his bullish erect cock. The hairy fringes of his furred sheath touched then itched him bad. Bob wanted to brush away the fly, but his legs could not reach far enough. Bob then gave his head and body a harsh shake, and shook all over with the wilder than wild passion, he bellowing a load Moo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men allowed Bob time to calm himself, before they haltered a thick white rope noose about his thick, muscular neck, and led him along behind the well dressed man. Bob was led to a large barn, and placed inside a box stall. He listened as the men talked, all wondering where he came from, but the well dressed man felt sure of Bob being a sexual changeling. He stood there acting calm and being as if a dumb animal, but kept looking, and waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs from out of nowhere, a man dressed in work coveralls approached Bob, and with remarkable agility and speed, he did insert, compress, and permanently loge a large brass into the bridge of Bob's bullish nose. The ring made Bob to bellow, he screaming from the sharp pain in his nose, as bade him to turn toward the well dressed man and moo again. As then the fun feelings of being an animal came home to roost in a harsh and painful manner. Bob felt then as he had become an Aberdeen Angus bull from nose ring to end of his black furred tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe the bull just accepted his situation as being permanently his new lifestyle. If you are as what I suspect you were, by crawling inside the stock trailer and for why you mated,  bred the two heifer subjects, the sexual fornicating has doomed you. Understand me well, you are as property, I own you, and being but an animal in the eyes of human laws, I can use you as a bull, or sell you to slaughter.\" The well dressed man said to then Bob the bull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob then mooed loudly, as the man smiled at Bob, he saying, \"Don't bother to trying to speak, as a waste of time, just bellow deep as groaning bellows, roared out of your mouth, they make the sounds of a healthy bull.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then Bob knew the old man at his shop was likely laughing a good laugh. Bob knew what he had become, and after the insult from the nose ring, to his treatment like a common farm animal, he realized his body determined his future. Lust governed Bob, as he walked to that barn he felt his yam size big and weighty balls sway, bonking at his furry hind hocks. His bony snaky tail swung, caressing his protruded anus and a flat, muscular furry big butt. He was a brute of bone and muscle, a bovine then, and the truer essence of a living sex oriented brute animal!</span></div></div>",

Sure in his mind, Bob knew from his having mated, bred the two heifers, that this being like an animal did have some thrills, but had real pains with more to come his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Bob stood calmly standing on all fours, his hooves a dull feeling on concrete floor, while he swung his bony tail, watching Professor Haun as he stood by watching his new bull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Dame, please come here, see here this bull, make sure he gets feed a ration of grain four times each day, and a double ration of fresh, green hay, I want him to really grow big.\" Professor Haun so ordered, as Bob understood the words well enough, and the Professor knew that the Bull was not born a bull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob felt a nagging desire to eat and he ate up the grain offered, as then learned some of the new manners a bull knows, as how to forage without the use of a fork, spoon, or knife. Tail swinging, the new to being a Bull, Bull began to worry that his own inkling thought were to accept becoming more, to as all a Bull, and learn to enjoy it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Haun, a Chinese immigrant to the U.S.A. arrived with his Reformation Process and the regulating serums he used to mix both mild topical remedies placed for sale, and the full strength, body changing serums he sold to various people with money and odd to erotic likes for hard to buy animals. The Chinese home remedy shop where Bob bought the ointment as a direct customer of the Professor. As checking with the shop proprietor, and reminding him of the sale, he told of finding a changing man becoming an Angus breed bull, and of two twin sisters having become as Angus heifers, were customers from the same shop, but on another day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDahlia and her twin sister Chun, as the shop proprietor told the Professor, they came looking for a beautification potion or salve, as he sold them two items, one of each kind. He told of tainting the potion with bovine serum, and adding a touch of explicate narcotic to induce sleep and erotic dreaming. Both the Professor and his client were happy with the respected monetary results. As two Angus heifers were worth five hundred dollars of each, an amount shared 50/50 by each partner.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next day to come, Professor Haun would introduce Chun and her sister Dahlia to their bullish lover, leaving them in a stock pen with Bob keeping the thrill seeking as happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the more Bob ate and foraged as would a Bull, he found his ideals changing. He ate until feeling full,  as then sniffed the air in the barn for any erotic scents, smells his changing brain sniffed of, and recorded while in the trailer with two scared, sisterly heifers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long night of needed slumber and with waking to his new day being a Bull, the Professor was there to greet Bob properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Robert, or shall we shorten your name to Bob the Bull. I know of your purchase, the ointment was one I produce here and sell to a few specialized proprietors. It was by pure luck that you being chemically tainted as aroused you happened to meet two sisters, twins who purchased remedies to change as make different, they thought to beautify. As they changed to look like Hu-cows, both transitioned, becoming Angus heifer breed changelings. My wranglers retrieved the sisters and while hauling them here, you met them, bred them, solidifying their physical transformation, and yours as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shall let you breed with them, as the sensuality they as heifers, soon to grow to cows will relish your masculine attentions. Sex and sensuality work together to cause the serums to work, changing bodies, species, and even genders, if need be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you understand me, what I said?\" asked the Professor, to which Bob nodded his big head as specify a Yes, answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will do as I want done with the two heifers?\" The Professor asked Bob, and again the bull nodded his big head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like me,\" asked the Professor, and to that Bob swung his big head to signify a No, answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After a few days of controlled breeding, I will have you brought to Barn Seven, and there, in private, we shall discuss your future, okay?\" The Professor asked, and to this the Bull nodded his agreement to the plan.</span></div></div>",
