Your sister was not home and your mom was with dad, testing his latest machine. You could hear what sounded like a heavy wind beyond the reinforced steel door and swallowed hard, you could only imagine what he was working on. With your heart in your throat, you hit the buzzer but no one answered. You buzzed again and knocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, phone!\" you called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, no answer came and you became very worried. \"Something is wrong!\" you whispered, nervously rubbing one arm. \"Mom or dad always answer when we buzz.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking, you hit the access code to unlock the door and moved to push it open. Only to your surprise, the door violently flew open and ripped off, nearly taking it with you. Fortunately, you managed to catch yourself on the railing at the top of the stairs, going down into the basement, which was as big as your spacious house. Near the far wall you saw a two massive metal rings, standing up inside a pair of supports, spinning in opposite directions with a bright energy field in the center. You looked around for your mom and dad and found them standing at a complex control panel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The energy portal has reversed itself!\" yelled mom, over the noise of the machine. \"Shut it down before we're pulled in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something on the other side is feeding the machine, keeping the field up!\" dad yelled back. \"I can not shut it down, we have to manually hit the brake before it gets too strong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is the manual brake!?!\" yelled mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad paused. \"On the secondary control panel, in front of the machine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom slapped him in the back of the head. \"You idiot!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw the two rings speeding up, gaining strength and you tried to yell a warning to mom and dad but your small voice would not reach them over the sound of the machine. Then, the pull from the machine suddenly increased and you were ripped off of the railing. you let out a blood chilling scream as you passed over them and dad caught your hand, just in time, only his hand was slipping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAD!!\" you screamed, panicked and crying. \"Dad, don't let go!! Please don't let go!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got you, son!\" dad yelled back, desperately trying to hold onto you. \"I got you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, your hand slipped from his grasp and you screamed at the top of your lungs as you were pulled towards the portal. You managed to grab a long handle near another control panel, but it pulled forward and snapped off. Your scream was cut short as you were violently thrown into the portal, just before the manual brake engaged, shutting down the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you, on the other side, an identical machine was running but with a large glass cage attached to it to contain whatever it brought in from the other side. A man and woman at the controls both smiled as various debris piled into the chamber, creating a thick cloud of dust. then, the man frowned as an alarm went off on his control panel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, the computer is detecting a life sign!\" he said, sounding worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman stood up, her face turning pale. \"We picked up a creature from the other side?\" she asked, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the glass age, you landed hard onto the wood and metal that was once pieces of furniture, computers, printers, and so on from your dad's laboratory. You were hurt, cut, bruised, and disoriented. Being thrown through the portal made you feel like you had been sucked up by a tornado and spit out into a field of barbed wire. You moaned miserably and tried to find your way back to mom and dad only you were not home any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! Dad!\" you called weakly. \"Are you okay!?! Where are you!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, your hand pressed against the glass wall of the cage. \"What!?!\" you thought. \"This wasn't here before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the woman saw your hand, then your face and turned completely white with shock as her husband rose with her, carrying the same expression. \"Oh my God!\" she whispered. \"Its...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Da...(cough!)... We... (cough! cough!)... Where ar... (COUGH!)...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou found it hard to talk as breathing in the dust was quickly and severely making your throat raw and sore. Still, you tried as you were worried about mom and dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma... Ma..!\" you cried hoarsely, tearing up from the pain in your lungs. \"Ma... Ma...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a low hiss reached your ears and you saw the dust lift slightly as if someone had opened a door. You turned to the sound to hear someone approaching you through the thick haze. What worried you was that each step seemed to shake the ground below you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is there!?!\" you wanted to say. Only, due to your extremely sore throat, what came out sounded like baby babel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, there.\" said a low but kind voice. \"I no hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up to the voice, as you pretty much looked up to everyone, but panicked as you found a towering figure walking towards you. \"Oh, shit!\" you thought. \"He's got to be at least fifteen feet tall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man moved slowly and talked in a soothing voice but you still screamed in utter terror and blindly ran from him, tripping over the various debris, hoping to escape. To Max, you let out a baby scream and was surprised to see the infant, (you), run passed him. He tried to catch you by the collar of your shirt but it ripped off you like so many rags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, honey.\" radioed Max to Natasha. \"I spooked him, he's coming your way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot yet knowing, or caring, that your clothing had been torn to shreds during your trip and landing, you ran out into the laboratory with no shirt and your shorts falling off you in pieces. Natasha gasped at the number of cuts and bruises on your body and did her best to catch you with out any harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, little one!\" she said, catching you by the drawers. \"Calm down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused, only for a second, as you thought you had heard mom's voice and looked up. Unfortunately, in this world, Natasha, everything, was three times larger and you screamed again, running off. Natasha kept her grip but your shorts and drawers easily tore off of you as they were nothing but strips of rags on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please stop!\" called Natasha. \"I won't hurt you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo panicked to think you clumsily scrambled up the large stairs to find a means of escape only to find that the door to the lab was intact and closed tight. Crying and screaming, you pounded on the massive door, hoping to get it to open. \"Ope...!\" you sobbed, desperately, despite your burning throat. \"Ope...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your fortune, the door opened. Unfortunately, you were greeted by a towering version of Tonya, standing in the doorway with a very tall version of yourself standing behind her! He was just as small, compared to his sister, but a giant to you. \"That... that's me!\" you thought. \"Where the hell am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before they could stop you, you made a run for the front door.  Unfortunately, Tonya grabbed you before you made it very far.  Picking you up, she noticed that you were covered with deep cuts and bruises all over your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at you, Tonya softly says, \"Where did you come from, little guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrying you back into the living room, you see Natasha walking up the stairs.  Seeing her, you scream and bury yourself in Tonya's arms.  Seeing your reaction to her mom, Tonya looks at her and says, \"Mom, what's going on?  Who is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" replied Natasha after a pause. \"He... He came through the portal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth your alter self and Tonya looked at their mom in shock. \"What were you two working on!?!\" asked Eric, alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A parallel portal.\" said Max, now out of the suit and looking guilty. \"Your mom and I were trying to gather objects from a world, parallel to our own, from random locations to study its people.\" he swallowed. \"We finally succeeded, a few minutes ago, only, along with a number of objects, we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You pulled in a baby from another world!?!\" asked Tonya, freaked out and disturbed. \"What have you done!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A baby?\" you thought. \"They see me as a baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over Tonya's shoulder, you gaze into the mirror behind her.  To your horror, you realize why everyone looked like giants here.  The reflection you saw in the mirror wasn't your normal reflection; it was that of a 14-month-old baby.  \"What's going on here!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could stop yourself, you burst into years.  Seeing this, Tonya says, \"Don't worry little guy, we'll get you back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer maternal instincts kicking in, Natasha turns to alternate Eric and says, \"Eric, go grab something to wrap this little guy in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs alternate Eric runs off to get something to wrap you in, Natasha takes you from Tonya.  After handing you over to her mom, Tonya ran off in search of something.  As Natasha held you in her arms you, starting to feel better, stopped crying.  Looking down at you, she says, \"You must be terrified little guy; taken away from your mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Eric came back with a towel.  \"Hope this is alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine dear.\" heading to the couch, Natasha says, \"Bring it over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha placed you on the couch and proceeded to wrap you in the towel.  You tried to resist, but you found yourself unable to fight them.  Once you were wrapped in the towel, alternate Eric says, \"What are we going to do with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking you up, Natasha says, \"We'll look after him until we can send him back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Tonya came back into the room.  Looking at her, you see she's holding a pacifier.  \"Maybe this'll calm him down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks sweetie.\" Taking the pacifier, Natasha looks at you says, \"Look what I got, little guy!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to say, \"No!!  I'm not a baby!!\"  but all that came out was baby talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that, Natasha gently places the pacifier in your mouth.  You tried to spit it out; but you suddenly became very relaxed and sleepy.  You tried to stay awake, but you couldn't.  You closed your eyes a few seconds later and fell asleep.  Seeing that, Natasha says, \"Poor guy must be exhausted.\" looking at Max, she says, \"We still have baby items in the attic, let's set up the crib so this little guy can take a nap.\"</span></div></div>",

It had broke below the floor panel, which was not good, still, he was trying his best to get the machine running again as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to fix it, Max!\" screamed mom, hysterical. \"Who knows where Eric ended up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am fully aware of that, Natasha!\" yelled dad, sobbing. \"I'm working as fast as I can!\" he then thought, \"He could already be dead but I dare not say that to her or Tonya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Tonya returned home from a short shopping trip and immediately panicked as she saw the house in shambles, due to the portal pulling everything towards the basement door. She scrambled over the pile of furniture and entered the laboratory to find mom by the main control panel, crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, what happened!?\" she asked, running to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It... It's Eric!\" sobbed mom, hysterical. \"He... He walked in on one of our experiments!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya turned pale. \"Where is he!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom began to cry louder. \"I don't know!\" she wailed. \"We were working on a parallel portal, trying to reach a world parallel to our own!\" she coughed, choking on her tears. \"Eric.... He... He... got pulled in! He could be anywhere!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom then completely broke down, screaming in tears on Tonya's shoulder while Tonya stood in shock. \"I only left him alone for a few minutes!\" she thought, then broke down herself, hugging her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecuring the new brake into place, dad released the mechanism and quickly gathered his tools before running up to the main control panel. \"I'm ready to try to bring Eric back home.\" he said, placing his tool box down. \"Everyone, cross your fingers and pray!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Tonya broke the hug but they were still crying as Dad then quickly worked the main controls, causing the machine to come back to life with the two rings spinning in opposite directions.  He then increased the power, not wanting it to reverse on him again and watched as an energy portal appeared in the center of the two rings. \"Come on, Eric!\" he whispered. \"The portal is open, come home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the parallel world, Max, inside his laboratory, let out a loud gasp. \"Natasha, the portal is activating on its own!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha quickly ran into basement and gasped herself as she saw the objects they had pulled in were being drawn back through the portal. \"It must be someone from the baby's world!\" she said. \"They are trying to get him back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax, having seen the deep cuts and bruises on your body, knotted his jaws in decision. He quickly took a pen and pad then wrote down the coordinates of the world on the other side before making a run for the manual brake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The baby is too badly hurt, Natasha!\" he screamed, grabbing the handle, near the glass chamber. \"A return trip now would kill him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the glass chamber shattered with a monstrous sound and the pieces were drawn in, through the portal as Max struggled to keep his balance against the vortex. Thinking of your mom, Natasha quickly wrote a note onto a piece of paper then folded it into a paper plane and threw it into the wind. The paper plane was instantly caught and pulled in just before Max engaged the brake, shutting down the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry, honey.\" Max said to Natasha. \"I know the boy belongs with his real parents in his own world but I have to think of his safety above all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha nodded. \"I understand.\" she said. \"Can we send him back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax nodded. \"I wrote down the coordinates on a piece of paper near the control panel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning pale, Natasha turned to the controls and was relieved to find that she had not used it for her note to your mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better check up on him.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then left the basement to a spare bedroom where Tonya had set up a crib from the attic.

Although in a parallel universe; you recognized that you were in the guest room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to speak, to get someone's attention, but noticed that something was in your mouth.  Spotting a mirror at the other end of the crib, you crawled your way over to it.  Looking in the mirror, you see a pacifier in your mouth.  Not only that, but you noticed you were wearing feety pajamas.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down, you think to yourself, \"What happened to me!?  Why'd I turn into a baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat down, you felt something squishy moving against your behind.

Not knowing about your dad's attempt to bring you back or Natasha's note, you came to the conclusion that this alternate family had every intention to keep you for a while, if not forever and began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAw, you poor little thing!\" said Tonya, dabbing at your tears with a tissue. \"You must be starving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see what you bought, dear.\" said Natasha. \"We'll feed him now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya grabbed the bag and followed mom into the dinning room where mom sat down with you in her arms while Tonya  started emptying the contents onto the table. there was a variety of different baby food combinations, all of which you were sure were nutritious for a growing baby but you were not too keen on eating them. Then came out the diapers, which you winced at. They were in a small package of twenty and had a blue flower design on them. Seeing the look you made, mom giggled, thinking that you did not like the smell of the potatoes and rice baby food she had just opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we have a picky eater here.\" she said, smiling. \"I had almost forgot what an adventure feeding a baby could be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling a cloth bib out of the bag, Tony giggled as well. \"I did the best i could.\" she said. \"I tried to find combinations that I thought would taste good and give the little guy the nutrients he needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did fine, Tonya.\" said Natasha. \"Let's see if he won't eat anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya gently tied the cloth bib around your neck then quickly ran off, returning with a clean, damp wash cloth and a plastic spoon from the kitchen. Natasha placed the wash cloth onto the table then used the spoon to scoop up a small amount of baby food. \"Here comes the choo choo!\" she said, before gently making train sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The 'choo choo'?\" you thought, looking at your alternate mom. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing your face, Natasha giggled again and rephrased. \"Open wide.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, you opened your mouth and Natasha spooned the baby food into your mouth. Realizing that you no longer had your teeth, you gummed on the baby food and was surprised by how well it tasted and swallowed it down.

Aaron.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya and her mom gasped again. \"His first word!\" breathed Natasha, tearing up. \"He said his name in another world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then began to cry, hugging you. \"I'm so sorry.... I stole this moment from your mother... I'm so sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I think... Aaron's mom would forgive you as long as her baby is returned to her safely.\" said Tonya, trying to be supportive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, honey.\" replied her mom, crying. \"It's just that these moments are very precious to any mother, they carry them with them for the rest of their lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow regretting trying to talk as it made your alternate mom cry, you reached up and took a tear away from her eye, tearing up yourself. \"Please don't cry.\" you thought. \"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha looked down at you and smiled tearfully. \"I'm fine... Aaron.\" she said. \"Do... Do you want more to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that nodding at her might freak her out more you just gave a low coo and reached for the baby food, causing her to giggle once more. \"Okay, okay.\" she said. \"Here it comes....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha was fed you until you turned your head away, not wanting more and she wiped your mouth clean before placing you onto the table to check your diaper. turning to Tonya, she said, \"Want to learn how to change little Aaron?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya wrinkled her nose at the idea. \"Do I have a choice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha shook her head. \"Not really.\" she replied, undoing the snaps of your baby pajamas.

Looking at your surroundings, you found that you could climb out of the crib with relative ease. Only, it became a more difficult task than you had first imagined, having uncoordinated arms and legs to work with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think of it as a challenge.\" you thought to yourself. \"Think of it as a challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few minutes, you managed to get out of the crib and waddled into the kitchen, the bulky diaper hindering your leg movements as you walked. Once inside the kitchen, you looked about, knowing that you would have to get imaginative to make yourself a snack without waking up the entire house. There was a towel on the floor, fallen from the counter and you took it up before going to the refrigerator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I can loop this around the refrigerator handle, I may be able to open it and get myself some OJ.\" you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swung the towel, getting it to loop around the handle of the fridge on the third try and, with some effort, managed to pull the door open. The OJ you craved was, thankfully, on the first shelf and you were able to reach it. Unfortunately, your tiny body was not strong enough to hold the large bottle and it fell from your hands, onto the kitchen floor, spilling some of it as you pulled it back up right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops!\" you thought. \"I had better clean that up before I'm done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pushed the refrigerator door closed then took the towel and covered the spill before waddling into the other room to return with a sip sup from Natasha's baby bag. Trying to open it, you accidentally spilled its contents onto the floor but shrugged as the OJ mess still needed to be cleaned up anyway. Placing the open sip cup onto the floor, you lifted the OJ bottle and managed to fill the cup, spilling more onto the floor in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a lot harder to do with a baby's body.\" you thought. \"My alternate mom is not going to be happy with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, your stomach growled and you felt the urge to cry for food but, still, you had your pride and you continued with your mission by pushing a step stool into place and climbed up onto the counter top where you found a clean plate in the drain and a loaf of bread in a small basket. You opened the bread, pulling out two slices, then placed them onto the plate before reaching up onto your tip toes and finding a jar of peanut butter and a jar of jelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing these jars are light.\" you thought. \"Now to make myself a real snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, a simple task for a 13 year old, was much harder for you as a baby and you ended up getting more onto your hands and arms than on the bread. Finally, the sandwich was made and you were enjoying it until you accidentally nudged the peanut butter jar with your arm and it hit the floor with an echoing thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced, hearing someone coming and looked up, covered in peanut butter, jelly, and OJ as the lights came on to see who had walked into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What greeted you inside, however, left you numb as you saw alternate mom and dad talking to your real mom and dad on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there nothing you can do to fix it?\" asked Max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad shook his head, sadly. \"The earthquake here damaged everything.\" he said. \"My wife and I will have to rebuild it from scratch and will take at least a year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This link won't last much longer.\" said mom. \"Please, I want to see my baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Max or Natasha could say anything, you waddled into view. \"Ma ma!\" you said, holding your hands out. \"Daddy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside your world, Tonya, hearing you, rushed into view. \"Eric!?\" she asked, surprised. \"Is that really you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toya!\" you yelled. \"Wanna go home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is bad.\" whispered dad. \"His mind is starting to regress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we bring him home?\" asked Tonya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad looked at his damaged equipment then turned to Max. \"What ever you decide, sir, we will comply.\" said Max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if Eric will survive the trip if we send him back through with as damaged as our equipment is.\" she said, sadly. \"The odds are not good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to try something!\" cried Tonya. \"I want my brother back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want him back alive or dead!?\" snapped dad, angrily. \"We miss Eric too but I am not going to risk his life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom, finding herself to be the deciding vote, swallowed hard and fought furiously with her emotions before turning to Max and Natasha. \"Please...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tearing up, you reach out in an attempt to reach your family.  \"Wanna go home!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your world, Tonya started crying, \"I love you, Eric.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the basement, Tonya sees you by the portal.  \"Aaron!!

From the other universe, you watched as your family ran for cover from falling debris.  Before you knew what happened, the portal shut down.  There was silence in the basement as everyone realized the gravity of the situation.  Still in Tonya's arms, you look at the deactivated portal and think, \"<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i>No!!  T-they're alive! I know they are!</i></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to fight your emotions, you did the only thing a 13-month baby could do...you started crying.  Trying to calm you down, Tonya carried you upstairs. \"It's okay Aaron.  I'm sure they're safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you cried in her arms, Tonya thought to herself, \"<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i>Poor guy!

Aaron's family is dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll figure something out, honey.\" Hugging his wife, Max says, \"In the mean time, let's give the little guy some space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile back in your home universe, your family survived the earthquake and was in the process of digging themselves out of the basement.  Having made it to the stairwell, with only a few scrapes, Tonya was in tears.  \"I'm never going to see my brother again!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite a twisted ankle, Mom made her way to Tonya.  Holding Tonya in her arms, she says, \"It'll be alright sweetie, we'll get him back.\"</span></div></div>",

She placed you onto the changing table and took a gentle hold of your tiny hand, looking into your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The year will go by fast, Aaron.\" she told you. \"Don't worry, I'll make sure dad doesn't experiment on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at Tonya, still hurt and grieving, as the tears began to flow and your lips quivered. It was more than you could take and you let loose with a strong cry, shaking your arms and clenching your fists. Tonya did what she could to calm you, her maternal instincts growing stronger. You finally fell asleep, suckling on a bottle of warm milk, two hours later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor little guy.\" said Tonya, watching you sleep. \"You've been through hell, being trapped in a baby's body in another world, then seeing your real family die before your eyes.\" she sighed, tearing up. \"Don't worry, <i>this</i> is your home now and I will make sure you feel safe and secure here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't have said it better, honey.\" said mum, walking into the room. \"Do you think you could have Aaron sleep with you again tonight?

Under the wrapping was an activity walker that was made to look like a black sports car. Seeing it, you let out an excited shriek and started clapping your hands, though you were not sure why.

Giggling, you opened the present to find that it was an indoor baby swing, only it had a cool look. You again gave a baby like shriek and clapped your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://modernurbanbaby.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/bass-swing.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://modernurbanbaby.com/wp-content/up...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I actually might have some fun with that.\"</i> you thought, giggling. <i>\"Okay, two more presents...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around again and found a present from alternate Eric and paused. Seeing this, although he knew mum bought them all at the last minute, Eric said, \"Go on, sport, we have a good idea what you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncertain you tear off the wrapping and just about fainted as you saw that it was a piano, built for a baby!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/genius-babies_2138_180527622.gif\" target=\"_blank\">http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/genius-babies_21...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That's so cool!\"</i> you thought. <i>\"I love the piano!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou again, shrieked and giggled, only you hopped up and down instead of clapping.

Picking you up, she places you on her lap.  Opening Microsoft Word; she says, \"Here you go, little guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to your still regressing mind, you had a hard time typing an intelligent sentence.  At first you only typed things like, \"SLHGFSHGKHK!&amp;^#^@$%^%gjwsag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of that, you were getting frustrated.  \"<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i>What happening to me?</i></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may not have fully understood what was going on, but Tonya did.

Seeing you on Tonya's lap, he says, \"What's up, little guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly closing the document so Eric wouldn't see, Tonya says, \"He was just pretending to type.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cute.\" looking at you, he says, \"How would you like to go to the park, Aaron?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of getting out of the house and going to the park excited you.  You start giggling and clapping, which Tonya and Eric took to mean that you liked the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was in the 30s outside, Tonya and Eric bundled you up and placed you in your new stroller.  After saying goodbye, the three of you left for the park.  You had a great time at the park; smiling and giggling when they pushed you on the swings.  Tonya and Eric watched as you took a few steps in the snow; before falling face first.  You didn't like that very much, so you started crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer maternal instincts kicking in, Tonya ran over to pick you up out of the snow.  \"Eric, get me the towel from the stroller!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric quickly grabbed the towel and ran it over to Tonya.

You're all better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you went home a short time later; as your face was getting red.  Walking into the family room, Tonya saw that dad had set up the swing.

Aaron Summers.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer able to understand anything that was said to you, besides your new name, you merely cooed and smiled...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should celebrate the newest member of our family.\" suggested Eric. \"How about going out for lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone agreed to the idea, you giving a coo and giggle made in unanimous. \"It's settled, then.\" said your new dad, grinning. \"I know the perfect place, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere to?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They might be my real family, but,\" smiling, Eric said, \"You've been my sister for 12 years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before everyone found themselves down in the basement, as Dad turned on the portal.  As the portal engaged, Dad looked at Alt-Tonya and said, \"Remember our deal, he comes back in 3 days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise to bring him back...dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving dad the coordinates for her universe, Alt-Tonya joined Eric in front of the portal.

She was a tomboy in this universe, so imagine Eric's surprise when he learned she was captain of the cheer squad.  \"No, she's not.  Bethany's a tomboy here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm sure you'll have lots to talk about; she knows about our search for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the portal was at full strength, Eric turned around to look at you and the others.  \"I'll see you guys in a few days, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few days, Eric.\" tearing up, Mom said, \"I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Eric and Alt-Tonya disappeared through the portal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And reappeared in the same room; only with a few differences.  Where as in his 'home' universe Eric's basement was full of sports equipment, this one was empty except for the portal.  As the portal disengaged, Alt-Tonya said, \"Welcome home, brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was about to say something when he heard footsteps coming down the stairs.  Alt-Mom appeared at the bottom of the stairs and said, You took a big risk going after your brother, young lady!\" angry, she said, \"That portal nearly blew after you passed through; you could've been stranded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mom, I got him back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, seeing sparks flying, Eric said, \"Can I still go back in 3 days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately you can't, Eric.\" pausing, \"The portal's fried, it will take us months to fix it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? You mean I'm stranded here!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the time being.\" looking at Alt-Tonya, Alt-Mom said, \"What if you took the wrong Eric!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's the right Eric, mom.  His 'father' scanned me; showing that Eric and I are from the same universe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, but you're still grounded young lady.\" looking at Eric, Alt-Mom said, \"Welcome home, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back in your <i>new</i> home, the room was filled sparks and smoke.

Mom and dad worked hard to rebuild all the damaged circuitry and components of the parallel portal. In an amazing two weeks of hard but love filled labor, all that was left was to secure the rings into place and activate the portal. Trevor and his team had set up a rope and pulley system to hoist the massive rings, one at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heave!\" yelled Trevor, holding onto the front of the rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho!\" yelled his team, pulling the rope with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but certainly, the second of two rings was lifted and carefully put in place as dad worked a miniature crane to push the side unit, holding the two rings, into place.

I made it!\" he said, a tearful laugh escaping his lips. \"I'm finally free!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the small boy, dad said, \"Welcome, noble traveler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy froze, turning an ashen white, then slowly turned to see your family and immediately panicked. \"No!... No!\" he screamed, backing away. \"No more experiments! No more, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy... Eric.\" Tonya called out. \"No one here is going to do anything to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy paused, looking at your family, puzzled. \"I haven't been called Eric in a long time.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do.. they call you in your world, Eric?\" asked mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric winced. \"Lab rat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom winced as well then cautiously stepped forward. \"Here, you are called Eric.\" she said. \"We lost our son to a tragic accident, we're trying to get him back.\" she knelled down from a safe distance. \"You are still welcome to stay, if you want, will you let me help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric seemed hesitant at first but mom's warm smile and Tonya's genuine look of concern won him over and he began to cry again. \"Pl... Please.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom pulled Eric into a warm hug, causing him to explode into tears. \"You are safe here.\" said mom, rocking Eric's sickly light body. \"We'll take care of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in what seemed to have become your new home, Tonya set you down onto her bed and looked into your eyes, concerned. \"Can you still understand what I am saying, Aaron?\" she asked. \"Please nod, if you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Tonya, you could understand her but only vaguely. It was almost as if she was speaking another language and you had no one to translate. You were slowly regaining your mind but your memories were clouded and confused. <i>\"I hear her but I can't quite make out what she's trying to say.\"</i> you thought. <i>\"I know her name is Tonya but Aaron doesn't seem to fit me.\"</i> you sighed, frustrated. <i>\"It's so hard to think, let alone talk. Maybe... body language?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Tonya's surprise, you pointed to your mouth and shook your head, before sighing again. \"You can't talk?\" she asked. \"It that what your trying to tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had to tak.\" you managed to say, trying to speak. \"Herts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It hurts to talk?\" asked Tonya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and Tonya hugged you. \"It's okay, Aaron.\" she said. \"We'll work something out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Tonya left the room and returned a few minutes later with a bottle. \"This will help you relax, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, barely understanding and accepted the bottle. Minutes later, you were asleep in Tonya's arms.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We raised him as our own for 12 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, as much as I hate to do this, I'm writing to tell you that we're going to raise Aaron as our son.

You found yourself, at your normal size, strapped to an examination table with dad standing over you, wearing surgical clothing and gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, son.\" he told you. \"Once your vocal chords are out, you will not no longer be able to disturb your family's rest  as I continue on with my experiments.\" he chuckled. \"Of course, you will not be able to talk at all but that is the price for advancing science.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... What are you going to do to me!?!\" you demanded. \"I'm your son, doesn't that count for anything!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have found a way to clone myself, Eric.\" said dad, smiling. \"He is now my son and, when he is old enough, I will be swapping bodies with him. Unfortunately, the process is still a bit messy so I need you to help me perfect it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" you screamed, coming out as a whisper in your own throat. \"You're insane, let me go!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go, Eric.\" said dad, ignoring your protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were dreaming, you struggled inside the blanket you had been tightly wrapped around you, as it was cold. Tonya came to check up on you, holding a rattle in her hand for you to play with later and was concerned by the tearful grunts and mumbles you were making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He must be having quite a nightmare.\" she thought, remembering your incomplete message. \"Poor little guy, I wish I could jump in and rescue you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the rattle slipped from her hand and the handle landed onto your throat, just as the scalpel touched your throat in your nightmare. You instantly woke up screaming and crying, wildly struggling against the blanket, wrapped around you. Tonya, not knowing what to do, tried to pick you up to calm you but you only struggled harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, Aaron.\" said Tonya, near panic. \"It's okay, come on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her mom came into the room, hearing you wailing and immediately took control. She reached into the crib, took the rattle, and gently shook it near your ear. The sound of the rattle did not fit inside your nightmare, causing you to pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Aaron.\" said Natasha, quietly, carefully taking you into her arms. \"I'll make that bad dream go away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the warmth of your alternate mother's body, you quickly fell into a relaxed state as you slowly opened your eyes to see Natasha's smiling face. \"There you are.\" she said, smiling. \"No more bad dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was just a nightmare.\" you thought, relieved but shaken. \"I haven't dreams that bad since I was a toddler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you do that?\" asked Tonya, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric used to have nightmares as well.\" replied mom. \"I used this very same method to calm him down.\" she then smiled. \"Aaron is from an alternate universe, most things are all the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is why you want him to repeat his message.\" said Tonya, catching on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom nodded. \"Exactly.\" then she caught a scent from your diaper. \"Oh, boy, someone made boom boom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya caught the scent as well and smiled. \"Wow, Aaron.\" she said, giggling. \"When you let it rip, you don't play!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed brightly, smelling the stench as well. \"It wasn't as if I could get to the toilet.\" you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom then took you over to the changing table and proceeded to take you out of your pajamas. \"It's time you learn how to change Aaron, Tonya.\" said her mom. \"Watch carefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya nodded then watched as mom untaped the diaper to reveal a brown mess all over your bottom and in the diaper, making her feel ill. \"EW!\" she said, plugging her nose. \"That really wreaks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha giggled. \"I had to deal with it, changing you and Eric.\" she said. \"Now, its your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya blushed as brightly as you were, following her mom's instructions as she properly disposed of the soiled diaper and proceeded to clean you up with baby wipes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget to get in his crack as well.\" said Natasha. \"We don't want poor Aaron to get a diaper rash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it.\" replied Tonya, cringing as she cleaned out your crack before reaching for the baby oil. \"I spread this everywhere, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just where I instructed you to.\" replied mom, watching her spread the oil. \"Now for the powder and then we can tape the new diaper on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya took hold of your legs and lifted them in the air to slide the fresh diaper under you then powdered your bottom and genitals before taping the new diaper onto you. \"Does that feel better, Aaron?\" she cooed, reaching for a clan pair of baby pajamas. \"I bet you're all happy again, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, feeling better to feel clan again but you were still not fully comfortable wearing a diaper. Tonya giggled. \"He's just too cute.\" she said. \"I think I'll take him out for a walk tomorrow morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a fine idea.\" replied Natasha. \"A little fresh air will do him some good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slept peacefully the rest of the night and woke up to find Tonya smiling down at you as she gently lifted you up out of the crib. \"Hey there, little guy!\" she said. \"What do you say we take a little stroll after breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cooed at her, smiling as you were beginning to get restless, stuck inside their house. \"Okay!\" said Tonya, giggling. \"Let's get you some breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on, Tonya took you outside...</span></div></div>",

As she opened the door, she said, \"We'll be back in a bit; I'm gonna take Aaron to the park.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing outside, you were surprised by how cold it was.  \"<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i>Wow it's cold out! No wonder Tonya bundled me up so much.</i></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya started pushing your stroller down the street; while you look at your surroundings.  Aside from a few minor differences; some houses being different colors, this alternate neighborhood was the same as yours.  As she walked down the street, Tonya looked down at you and smiled.  \"It must feel nice to be outside, doesn't it Aaron?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i>No kidding! I was getting restless in the house!</i></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk to the park took 5 minutes or so.  As she entered the park, Tonya made her way to the swings.  \"What do you say, Aaron?  Want to play on the swings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised to notice that the idea of playing on the swings sounded fun.  Looking up to Tonya, you smiled and cooed in response.  Smiling, Tonya walks in front and unbuckles you from the stroller.  Carrying you over to the swings, she places you in one of them.  \"Here we go Aaron!\" walking around to the back, Tonya gets ready to give you a push \"3...2...1...blast off!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent  the next 20 minutes laughing and smiling as Tonya pushed you on the swings.  \"<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i>This is fun!!</i></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya was getting ready to push you again, when she heard some calling her name.  \"Hey Tonya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Tonya and you look in the direction of the voice; to see a girl walking towards you.  As she got closer, you saw it was this universe's version of Bethany.  Smiling, Tonya says, \"Hey Beth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to you, Bethany says, \"Whose this little guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i>I'm an alternate version of your best friend!</i></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlways the quick thinker, Tonya says, \"This is Aaron; he's a cousin on my dad's side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending down in front of you, Bethany says, \"He's a cutie.\" changing to baby talk, Bethany says, \"You're a cutie.  Yes you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Bethany talking like a baby, you start giggling.  Bethany took this to mean that you liked her.  \"Well I like you too, Aaron.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking you up out of the swing, Tonya says, \"You want to hold him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya carefully hands you to Bethany, who holds you close to protect you from the cold.  Looking at you, Bethany says, \"He looks like Eric.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they are cousins.\" smiling, Tonya says, \"But I can see a resemblance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany walks over to a bench, as you doze off in her arms.  \"Poor little guy; playing on the swings must've tuckered him out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany and Tonya talk for a little while, until Tonya notices your cheeks are getting red.  \"I should get Aaron home; his cheeks are getting red.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" handing you back to Tonya, Bethany says, \"I'll come with you; I want to see Eric.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter placing you back in the stroller, Tonya and Bethany walk back to the house; talking the entire time.  You were asleep, otherwise you would've learned that, in this universe, Eric and Bethany were dating.  You woke up just as Tonya carried you into the house.  Seeing you were awake, Tonya says, \"Hey there, sleepyhead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Tonya, you smile and coo.  You're fixation on Tonya was broken when you heard Eric say, \"Hey babe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to face Eric, you see him kissing Bethany.  Seeing that, you say to yourself, \"<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i>What's going on here!?  How's this Eric have a girlfriend, and I don't?</i></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to speak intelligently, you did the only thing a 13-month-old baby could do....you started crying.  Concerned, Tonya says, \"What's wrong Aaron?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking her kiss with Eric, Bethany walks over and says, \"He must've grown attached to me; and didn't like when I kissed Eric.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at you, with a grin, Eric says, \"Do you like my girlfriend, Aaron?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Tonya a few minutes to get you to stop crying.  Once she did, she brought you upstairs for a nap.</span></div></div>",

She looked down at you, surprised and concerned as you wrapped your arms around her left leg, shaking and crying. She saw a large number of deep cuts and bruises all over your body and her heart went out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you come from, little guy?\" she asked, softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing Natasha come up the stairs, you let out a scream and gripped her leg more tightly, too frightened by your new environment to notice the fact that you were completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, what's going on?\" asked Tonya, seeing your reaction to her mom. \"Who is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" replied Natasha after a pause. \"He... He came through the portal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth your alter self and Tonya looked at their mom in shock. \"What were you two working on!?!\" asked Eric, alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A parallel portal.\" said Max, now out of the suit and looking guilty. \"Your mom and I were trying to gather objects from a world, parallel to our own, from random locations to study its people.\" he swallowed. \"We finally succeeded, a few minutes ago, only, along with a number of objects, we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You pulled in a baby from another world!?!\" asked Tonya, freaked out and disturbed. <i>\"What have you done!?!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A baby?\" you thought. \"They see me as a baby?\" then you looked around and realized how they would see you as one since they had not yet studied the other objects they had pulled in with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Tonya slowly came down onto one knee and smiled at you gently. You looked up at her, uncertain, tears still in your eyes. \"Here, now.\" she cooed softly. \"Don't be scared, it's okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carefully pulled a clean tissue from a box on a stand near the basement door and lightly dabbed at your tears, you could smell her perfume, it was the same brand your own sister used. \"She's just like my big sis at home.\" you thought, only a lot bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took her hand, taking a sniff of her perfumed hand to confirm then hugged it as if to try to wake up from the crazy nightmare you were having. Confused by your actions, Tonya turned to her mom and dad. \"It seems he likes me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your perfume, Tonya.\" said Natasha. \"His mom must wear something similar, that's why he ran for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya turned back to you, smiling. \"Aw!, you poor little guy.\" she said. \"Come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached down to pick you up but a sudden urge to pee hit you and you quickly ran off, thankful that the bathroom was in the same place in this house as it was in your own. You had forgotten that you were the size of an infant in this world and would not be able to get onto the toilet, let a lone use it. You had just reached the bathroom door when Tonya caught up with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going, you little rascal?\" she said, gently picking you up. \"You need to stay with 'auntie' Tonya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to tickle your bare tummy, causing you to giggle, which did not help you hold it in. Tonya continued to tickle you until a stream of hot pee hit her blouse. She screamed, quickly turning you around as her mom and dad laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have known better, Tonya.\" said Natasha, between laughs. \"The kid was running for the bathroom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya barely heard her mom as she rushed you into the bathroom and held you over the toilet, allowing you to finish relieving yourself. Once you were done, you turned to Tonya, blushing brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S... Sorry, Tonya.\" you said. only due to your sore throat and hurt lungs, it came out as 'S... Sowy Toya'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya looked at you, surprised. \"You can talk!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded but your throat and lungs were now screaming and you decided to hold off on talking unless you had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Tonya react to you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking up at mom, you saw that she appeared to have gained weight while you were unconscious.  Always one to keep in shape; it looked as if Mom was about 20 pounds heavier than when you'd last saw her.  On top of that; her breasts were much larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing you, she said, \"Eric, thank god you're finally awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if seeing that Mom had gained weight wasn't strange enough; you were confused when she knelt down and seemed to pick you up in her arms without a problem.  It was at that moment you noticed that things seemed different; you were in your bedroom, only it looked different than you remembered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere your desk had been was now what looked to be a changing table; in fact none of your things seemed to be in the room at all.  The room seemed rather barren; you saw some toys and stuffed animals lying around on the floor.  Looking around some more, you saw that the formerly white walls were now a light shade of pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever all of that paled in the comparison to what you saw next...a crib where your bed had been.  Looking up at mom, you tried to speak but were surprised when all the came out was what sounded like baby talk.  Hearing that, you started to worry that something was wrong.  \"<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i>What's going on here!?</i></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't try to talk, Eric; something's happened after you went through the portal.\" Looking down at you, Mom said, \"You've been turned into a newborn baby girl.\"</span></div></div>",

Even if that were true; what would that have to do with mom being heavier than before you had gone through the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick glance over your shoulder confirmed that mom was right; she was standing in front of a mirror holding an infant in her arms.  It didn't take long to realize that the infant was you.  Starting to freak out, you tried to speak again but found that you were still only able to make baby noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no other recourse, you started to cry.  Looking down at you, gently rocking you back and forth, Mom said, \"There's been some other changes as well...Eric.\" pausing, Mom said, \"You've probably noticed that I've gained a little weight since you saw me last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill crying; although not as much; you managed to give what passed as a nod for an infant.  Continuing, Mom said, \"As near as we can tell; reality was altered when you went through the portal.\" Sighing, she said, \"The old...you was never born in this reality.  Instead I gave birth to the...new you 4 months ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was enough to start you crying again; that portal had ruined your life.  If only dad had listened when everybody told him not to make it; then this wouldn't have happened.  Before mom could say anything else, Tonya came into the room.  \"What's going on, I heard crying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just telling your...sister what happened.\" Sighing, Mom said, \"It didn't go very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking you from Mom's arms, Tonya looked down at you and said, \"It's quite a shock for all of us, Eric.\" Pausing, she said, \"Everything in this reality is different; but as far as we can tell only the 4 of us know that's the case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrying you in her arms, Tonya walked out of the bedroom and down the hall.  As you went passed the pictures on the wall, you saw that every picture of the old you had either vanished or been replaced with pictures of the new you.  \"<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i>Why did this happen to me!?</i></span>\"</span></div></div>",

Mom walked over and opened the door; revealing two girls standing there.  You realized that one of them was Bethany; only she looked different than before.  She looked to be a few years older and more filled out then you remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl looked familiar as well; but you couldn't figure out why.  Looking at her, you saw that she looked a little bit like Tonya's best friend Trevor; but since Trevor didn't have a sister you weren't sure about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven that reality had been altered so you were now an infant girl; it wasn't crazy to assume that others hadn't been changed.  Your suspicions were confirmed when the girl turned to mom and said, \"Morning, Mrs. Summers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning...\" pausing, Mom said, \"I'm sorry, I don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, Mrs. S?\" concerned, the girl said, \"It's me, Tracey Powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was enough to confirm your suspicion; this girl was Trevor in this reality.  Somehow your family wasn't the only ones affected.  Looking at Tracey, Mom said, \"Of course, Tracey! I'm so sorry; I haven't been getting much sleep the last few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's understandable.\" Glancing at you, she said, \"Little Erica must be full of energy lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erica!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently this was the first time Tonya had seen Tracey and Bethany; as she was surprised by the changes as well.  Looking at Bethany, Tonya said, \"What happened to you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Bethany said, \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGesturing to Bethany's chest, careful not to drop you, Tonya said, \"When did you get so...big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you remember?\" chuckling, Bethany said, \"I filled out over the summer before Sophomore year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" confused, Tonya said, \"But you're only 13 years old; how can you be a sophomore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, Tonya?\" with a confused look, Bethany said, \"You know I'm 15 years old; we've been best friends since daycare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all this was going on, you were silently watching from the sidelines.  Something must've really gone wrong for all this to happen; you were turned into an infant girl, Trevor was now a girl and Bethany was now 15 years old.  \"<i><span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\">What's going on here!?</span></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if all of that wasn't disturbing enough, you started to having a weird feeling in your stomach.  Unable to speak, you couldn't help but start <br>\r\ncrying.  Mom had been talking to Tracey in the corner when she heard your cries; suddenly saying, \"Sounds like someone is hungry.\" Pausing, she said, \"I'll take care of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone knew what was happening, Mom took you from Tonya's arms and carried you into the kitchen.  Thinking Mom was going to give you a bottle; as if that wasn't bad enough; you were surprised when mom unbuttoned her shirt and exposed an enlarged breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but think how disturbing it was to have your mom breastfeed you; looking at her, you could tell she was as confused as you were.  As much as you wanted to resist, you found yourself latching onto Mom's breast as you started sucking.</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s a boy! Quick! Turn the machine off! Now!\u201d Natasha shouted at Max. Natasha was the main scientist in the couple and Max was more like the assistant. Natasha had been working on the machine for years and this had been the first time that she had ever been able to get something or someone to travel through the machine from another world. \u201cLook at him! A boy! Why\u2026 He seems a little small, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of the glass chamber, you groggily shake your head and blink your eyes. You\u2019re still a bit dizzy from spinning through the portal. It was as if you had been sucked into a whirlpool or something, and you had completely lost your sense of direction. You finally place both hands up against the thick glass wall, as you slowly get back on your feet. You\u2019re only wearing sandals, a pair of shorts and a tank top, since you had been at home that afternoon when you were pulled into the machine and sucked through the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at him, Max! What a cute boy!\u201d Natasha grinned. \u201cI wonder how old he is?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finally get on both feet, you look at her and at the man, who both resemble your parents. You recognize them, but they don\u2019t seem to recognize you. As you look around, the rest of the basement seems just about the same: There are many other devices, control panels, scientific instruments and other lab objects located in the large room, which was lit with huge halogen lamps which were hanging from the ceiling overhead. There were also dozens of large scientific charts and graphs pinned to the walls. Yes, everything did look familiar. You almost felt like you were at home. Still, something was off. Something felt weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main door opened and someone walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom? Dad?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young girl, who had the same facial features as you walked in and curiously stood next to your mother as she stared at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErica! Look! We had tested the portal-transmission machine, and it had pulled this young man through the portal!\u201d Natasha explained. \u201cLook at him! He has your eyes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! He\u2019s a little taller than me! But, he looks just like me!\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little taller?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI noticed that my sandals were beginning to get a bit tight on my feet, and my tank was starting to feel a little tighter as well. What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s strange. Honey! Come over here!\u201d Natasha said to Max, who had walked off to check some readings on the computer screen. \u201cCome and take a look at the boy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNatasha! The computer just alerted me that the properties of the object, which had traveled through the portal, had changed!\u201d Max shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat had changed?\u201d Natasha said, as she walked over to the computer console.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, I felt like my clothes were getting increasingly tight on my body. My sandals were killing me, so I quickly kicked them off my feet. Luckily, I was wearing underwear that mom had just bought for me, so they were a little big on me. But, my tank top was starting to feel much too small on me, as the bottom of my tank top felt like it was crawling up my torso from my waist to the point where my belly button started to show! I felt like I was growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAccording to the computer, the object has changed in size!\u201d Max said. \u201cLook!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? You mean\u2026 The boy\u2019s growing?\u201d Natasha wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax and Natasha quickly turned around and ran back to the glass containment chamber, where they saw me standing there with my hands pressing against the glass. Indeed, the chamber began to shrink for me. I think it was only about six feet high, and I was about four feet tall when I got sucked into it, but I had probably grown a foot by now. My legs were longer, my arms were thicker, my feet were bigger and so were my hands. My head had also grown and I felt that my body was still growing! Was this due to the journey through the portal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow big is he going to get?\u201d Natasha wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could tell that I was now almost the same height as Natasha and that it wouldn\u2019t take long or I would also pass Max, if I would continue growing at this pace. I had already passed Erica, and it seemed like there was just no stopping! My main concern now was that I really didn\u2019t know what would happen to me if I were to become too big for the glass chamber that I was being held in! As I looked up, I could see that my head was quickly reaching the ceiling of the chamber! Oh no!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney! He\u2019s almost as tall as they chamber!\u201d Natasha shouted. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll we can do is hope that he stops growing\u2026 Very soon!\u201d Max replied. \u201cQuick! Let me check his properties on the computer!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha and Max ran back to the computer console, which was on the other side of the room, while Erica remained standing in front of the chamber, looking at me in my predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy head touched the ceiling! To make matters worse, I was still growing! I started to bend down with my knees, which became very uncomfortable after a while because my knees ended up pushing against the glass while my back was now pressing against the other side of the glass wall. I tried squatting down even further, but the chamber just didn\u2019t allow any room! As my body continued to grow, I realized that I wasn\u2019t just growing taller, but I was also getting wider! Everything was getting bigger: My shoulders, my hands, my feet, my arms, my head\u2026 absolutely everything! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crack started to form at the section of glass where my knees were pushing against it. Just at that moment, I realized my growth seemed to slow down, but it didn\u2019t happen soon enough, and in a way, I was happy because it was getting very uncomfortable sitting in that position in that glass chamber which was quickly becoming too small for me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crack in the glass became bigger and bigger, until the entire front side of the chamber broke and glass shattered all over the lab floor in front of me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEEEEKK\u201d Erica shrieked, as she saw the glass break right before her eyes. Of course, I couldn\u2019t wait to get out of the chamber so I could stretch to my full height. Not only that, but my shirt and my shorts were just killing me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked out, I gently stepped away from the broken glass as Max and Natasha came running over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 My\u2026 God\u2026 The boy\u2026 He\u2019s a\u2026 A giant!\u201d Natasha gasped, as she looked up to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just stood there, looking down at the three of them, which was easy since I was now standing about 7 feet tall. As I took a deep breath, there was a loud RIP\u2026 My tank top had torn in half. I desperately needed bigger clothes now. I was the size of a professional basketball player!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tony came walking down the stairs, wearing a similar outfit to what I had on entering this world and gaped at my giant form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" he yelled. \"Who's this guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha threw Tony a guilty look. \"We finally managed to get the portal-transmission machine to work, pulling in objects from a parallel world.\" she explained. \"In the process, we unintentionally pulled Eric into our world.\" she frowned. \"Only the portal's energy seemed to have had an adverse effect on him and he grew to massive proportions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was only four feet tall, originally.\" you said, shyly. \"My mom did tell me I would experience some growth spurts...\" you chuckled. \"...but this is ridiculous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony laughed. \"It's definitely a change of perspective.\" he said. \"Erica and I permanently switched genders, walking in on one of mom's experiments a few days ago.\" he blushed. \"We're still trying to adapt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica blushed herself. \"Tony was once Tonya.\" she explained. \"She kept me safe from mom's 'unique' line of work but I went down to her lab to tell her she had a phone call and got hit by a ray, just as 'Tonya' was trying to pull me away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"That was how I got pulled into my dad's machine.\" you said. \"He is the scientist in my family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering that he was called down, Tony turned to his mom. \"What did you want to see me for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I need you to bring down a set of clean clothing so I can use the molecular realignment module.\" replied Natasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony smiled then ran off, up the stairs as you turned to Natasha, confused. \"the what?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a shrink and growth ray.\" explained Natasha, simply. \"It will make Tony's clothing large enough for you to wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you just return me to my normal size?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be a bad idea, Eric.\" replied Natasha, seriously. \"We do not know what caused you to get as big as you are, trying the machine on you could prove fatal.\" seeing your horrified look, she sighed. \"I promise you I will look deeply into what had caused your transformation, just promise me you will not toy with the MRM.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reluctantly nodded as Tony returned with a clean set of clothing, including a pair of sneakers. \"It's very warm outside so I brought down a pair of shorts, a tank top, briefs, socks and my spare running shoes.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, dear.\" said Natasha. \"Please stand aside while I work the machine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laid the clothing out onto a large platform in one corner of the lab with what looked like a laser cannon hanging over it on a small crane. Walking over to the controls, Natasha keyed in a twelve digit code then set the size she wanted to increase the clothing to and hit the start switch. The laser hummed for a moment then fired a beam down onto the platform and continuously fired as the clothing grew to your size then shut down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The MRM realigns the space between the molecules at make up the object, causing it to grow of shrink.\" said Natasha, handing you the enlarged clothing. \"Don't worry, the effects are permanent, unless it goes through the machine again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded then blushed brightly, remembering that you were only wearing your briefs. \"Um... can you all please give me some privacy?\" you asked, still surprised by your new booming voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha smiled. \"Of course, Eric.\" she said. \"Just come on up when you are dressed and we'll find you something to eat, I'm sure you are hungry after your, err, growth spurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I am.\" you admitted. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Natasha ushered everyone out of the lab. Minutes later, you emerged from the laboratory, struggling with getting through the door to find your alternate family waiting for you in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Eric.\" said Max, smiling. \"This house was built to take a lot of punishment, your new weight will not even phase the floor boards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made you feel better but then Tony suggested that...<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWell, Eric, now that we got you some clothes that fit you, why don\u2019t we get you something to eat?\u201d Natasha suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! I bet he must be starving!\u201d Erica grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so funny looking at Erica. I mean, she looked just like me! She had my brown hair and the same eyes as me. She had the same facial expressions and even her ears and nose closely resembled mine. She could have been my twin sister except for the fact that she was two feet shorter than me. Even her voice sounded a little bit like mine. I swear when I would look at her, it seemed as if I was staring at my own reflection in the mirror. It was amazing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax got a big wooden chair out of the garage for me to sit on. I guess he must have used one of the other inventions previously, or he had used the shrinking and growth device to enlarge some of his furniture just to test. The chair was perfect for my size, but obviously too big for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dining table was a little bit too low for me, but that was okay. We had spaghetti to eat with green beans and salad, along with soup as an appetizer. I had seconds of course, since the first helping didn\u2019t fill me up. The food was absolutely delicious, and it was during dinner that I found out that Max was the cook in the house, since Natasha always spent all her time in the lab working on her inventions and experiments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we were done eating, Erica walked over to me and suggested she take me to the large shopping mall down the street so that she could buy me some more clothes for a guy of my size. They didn\u2019t have any   more clothes to grow in the size machine, but since I had been pulled in by the portal machine in their basement, they all considered me as part of the family for the time being, and they insisted that I stay with them. So, it was no problem at all for them to take me to the mall and buy me some new clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put on the shorts and t-shirt that they had enlarged in the machine, after having taken a nice hot shower in the bathroom. I was amazed that the rest of the house and the lab looked just like my own house and lab in my own parallel world, so everything else seemed pretty much familiar to me and I was able to find my way around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as I got into Erica\u2019s car (I little SUV, really nice!), we drove off to the shopping mall which was only ten minutes away from the house. I recognized the area of town where we lived and all the streets, the roads, the businesses and the landmarks all seemed familiar to me. It was almost as if I was still in my own world and I had never left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we arrived at the mall, I couldn\u2019t help but laugh when I realized truly how much I had grown during the journey through the portal. When we entered through the glass doors and I walked in on a large crowd of shoppers, everyone stopped and stared at me. I was a true giant in the mall, sticking out among the crown as the biggest and tallest kid in the whole shopping mall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica just grinned as she noticed that I started to become a little embarrassed over the fact that I was the biggest guy in the mall, and she started making fun of me over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Goliath, this way!\u201d she teased, as she led the way to the clothing store. Obviously we went to the Big and Tall place, where everything was fit for guys who were too big and too tall to find their clothing anywhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, if I couldn\u2019t find anything to wear in this place, then I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to find it anywhere else! I had to find the clothes to fit my body in this place; otherwise I would be in serious trouble. Luckily for us, all the shirts and pants were placed on racks, shelves and hangers that were clearly marked and labeled, so finding my size wasn\u2019t as hard as we had initially feared. Now, it was just a matter of finding the right shirt and pants that didn\u2019t make me stand out even more than I already needed to, just due to the fact that I was so big alone. I didn\u2019t want to wear something in bright yellow and in lime green, just to draw even more attention to myself. So, I picked clothes in fine, pastel colors that would go with just about anything, knowing that I would look decent in school the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, big bro! You\u2019re gonna look so sharp when you go to school tomorrow!\u201d she said to me, as she carried the clothes I had picked out to the cash register. \u201cYou can\u2019t stay home all day long and now that you\u2019re with us, you\u2019re gonna have to go back to school! But, don\u2019t worry! You\u2019ll have a great time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was just so thrilled with the friendliness and hospitality and I was extremely grateful that my family in this parallel world was willing to put up with me and treat me like a son of their own, even with this weird growth spurt I had come with after I arrived. I figured, in the end, that everything would be alright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I went to school for the first time in the parallel world with Erica and Natasha driving behind the wheel. It was always a challenge fitting in the front seat of the car, with my long legs, but I managed to squeeze into the car seat, although barely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we arrived at the school, Natasha walked with me to the main office, where she talked to the Vice-Principal and the nurse about enrolling me into classes. When the question of my size and my health came up, she explained that I was her nephew and that my father was a large man as well. Not only that, but I had been diagnosed with Pituitary Gigantis, which meant that I had a pituitary gland which was much larger than that of a normal human being, and this lead to my amazing growth spurts. In fact, when I weighed this morning, Max noted that I had gained another eight pounds! Even though I hadn\u2019t gained anything in height, I was probably gaining in muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was confirmed when I took my shower this morning, and I noted my reflection in the large bathroom mirror. I was still growing, since my arms seemed bulkier, my chest appeared larger and my legs were thicker, not with fat but with muscle! I was still hulking out, and nobody knew when it would stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Natasha had finally finished getting all my enrollment and registration paperwork done, Mr. Marnix, the Vice-Principal, walked me over to my first class. Obviously, I was over twenty minutes late, so the class was interrupted when I walked into the classroom for my first period class, which was Math.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher stopped the lecture and I was faced with a classroom filled with about twenty curious students who were all gasping at the sight of me when I slowly walked into the room. I could hear a flood of comments coming from the students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at the SIZE of him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 My\u2026 God\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s no kid\u2026 He\u2019s a grownup!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a giant!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know human beings could grow that big!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet he plays basketball!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a hunk!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s cute!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at his legs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at his arms!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at his chest!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at his ---\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSSSSSHHH!!\u201d another girl hissed. \u201cYou\u2019re embarrassing him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClass!\u201d Ms. Rogers spoke up. \u201cI want to introduce all of you to a new student. This is Eric Summers. Eric, please sit down. There\u2019s an empty desk in the back of the classroom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quietly walked to the back of the class, knowing that every student in the room was staring at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t break the desk\u2026 or the chair, big guy!\u201d one boy shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole room erupted in laughter as I sat down, as carefully as I possibly could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now, class! Be nice! And, Brandon, please\u2026 Watch those sharp remarks and keep them to yourself!\u201d Mr. Rogers said to the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt excited and nervous at the same time. I knew I had to get used to being back in school again, even though the school looked oddly familiar. It was almost the same as my school back in my own world, even though some of the kids were different. Of course, the major difference was the fact that I was about three feet taller than in my own world. Now I had to put up with all the jokes of why I stood out among the crowd, which was the exact opposite of all the crap I had to deal with before I got pulled into the machine which brought me to this parallel world. At first, I was always the little guy, and now I\u2019m the giant. I guess I\u2019m destined to always be the outcast, no matter which world I\u2019m living in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main thing that was concerning me at that moment was the fact that I was still gaining weight. I guess that gaining more muscle couldn\u2019t be all that bad. I used to be picked on when I was in my old world, and here I was, the giant in school, and still growing bigger and more muscular. So, hopefully things would be the other way around this time: I\u2019m the big muscle guy now. I was hoping that I would not be bullied this time around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPsssst Hey! My name is Jesse!\u201d one boy, sitting next to me, whispered to me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi\u2026 I\u2019m Eric\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the boy. He reminded me of one of my friends in my old world. One of my best friends was also named Jesse. He looked just like him. I remembered him as a small, skinny, geeky kid who loved computers and video games. In fact, I remembered this kid being my next-door neighbor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wanna hang out after school?\u201d Jesse asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u2026 We can play video games or something\u2026\u201d I said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it, dude!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a relief! It felt good seeing someone familiar. I began to remember who Jesse was. He always wanted to hang out with me and we were always good friends in school. It felt refreshing seeing that he was also here in the parallel world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least now I had someone else to hang out with and to talk to when I was in school. Even though this time around I was the giant, rather than the shrimp in class. What would happen next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One example was the word, 'comb', it was spelled 'com'. Another word, 'phone' was spelled 'fone', the silent letters had been dropped, spelling the words as they had sounded. <i>\"Interesting.\"</i> you thought. <i>\"This is going to take some time to get used to.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you are still using the old way of spelling, Eric.\" said Ms Rodgers. \"I am aware that the federal changes in spelling has not yet reached everyone, please have your aunt check your homework before handing it in tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am.\" you said, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling rose from the class but Ms Rodgers called for silence. \"Do not pick on Eric for his lack of knowledge.\" she scolded firmly. \"We all learn at our own pace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling you needed to defend yourself, you spoke up. \"Actually, I come from an... err... isolated part of the country.\" you explained. \"I was home schooled before coming here to visit relatives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Rodgers smiled. \"Well, that explains a lot.\" she said. \"May I ask which town you lived in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and replied, \"Suburbia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be a very small community.\" said Ms Rodgers. \"I have never heard of such a place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged then continued on with her teaching. When the bell rang, ending the first class, you walked out of the room  and headed for your assigned locker. Fortunately, it was the same locker you had in your old world and the combination was the same. <i>\"At lest my old locker is the same.\"</i> you thought. <i>\"Right down to the loose panel in the back.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got your books for the next class and closed your locker. Only, as you turned around, you saw Jessie being roughly pushed into a locker by a much more muscular kid who seemed to have been the school bully. \"I need an answer now, you little twerp!\" he yelled. \"Is it a yes or no!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were angry that a boy would pick on your first friend in this world, you stepped up behind him as he then pushed Jessie against the lockers again. \"Answer me, you little toad!\" he screamed, turning red. \"Do I have to get rough!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving heard enough, you took the boy by the back of his shirt and easily lifted him off the ground. The boy struggled as Jessie rose a hand to his mouth, looking fearful. The bully seemed even more frightened as you turned him to to look in his eyes. \"Do you have a problem with my friend?\" you asked, angrily. \"I certainly hope not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your focus on the bully, you did not hear the whispered comments rising all around you as your move seemed to have gathered a crowd. Only Erica came along and saw what was happening. She gasped, sizing up the situation, she ran up to you and firmly called your name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erica, this guys was...\" you tried to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put him down!\" interrupted Erica in a strict tone. \"Do it now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, you gentle placed the boy back onto his feet. As you expected, he began to quickly back away only Erica caught his arm. \"My cousin mistook your actions as hostile, Hank.\" she said to the boy. \"Where he comes from, they do not have the lover's quarrel ceremony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stunned to hear that. \"Lover's quarrel ceremony?\" you asked, confusion obvious in your expression. \"What!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hall exploded into laughter as you saw every girl blushing brightly and began to blush yourself. \"Will some one please explain this to me?\" you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Around here, all love is accepted.\" explained Erica with a giggle. \"Boy and girl, boy and boy and girl and girl. What Jessie and Hank were doing is called the lover's quarrel ceremony where a boy manly confesses his love to another boy and demands his response.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love this guy.\" said Hank, smiling. \"I will scream it on the roof tops, if he will accept my affections...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Jessie charged Hank and shoved him into the lockers, as he had to him. \"I love you too, you big ape!\" he yelled. \"Do you have a problem with going out with me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two embraced and kissed in the hall, causing the students to cheer as you continued to blush. <i>\"Okay..\"</i> you thought, nervous. <i>\"Some things are definitely different in this world...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to wonder what other surprises were in store for you as you then headed for your next class...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The dust making it very hard to see and every breath of dust you took in made you feel more and more strange.

I tried grabbing a handle as I went past, only for it to break off and enter the portal with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip through the portal seemed to be instantaneous; the next thing I knew, I was lying atop the pile of debris that had come through with me. As I began to regain my senses, I couldn\u2019t help but notice my body felt strange.  I wanted to get a closer look by a cloud of dust was obscuring my view.  Climbing down off the debris pile, I started crawling towards where I hoped my parents were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter crawling for what seemed like an eternity, to my surprise, I bumped into a glass wall in front of me.  \u201cThat wasn\u2019t here before, what\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started pounding on the glass; which must\u2019ve gotten the attention of whoever was on the other side.  Everything was muffled, but <br>\r\nI could hear a woman\u2019s voice say, \u201cHoney, there\u2019s someone inside the containment area.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPounding on the glass some more, I said, \u201cLet me out of here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but notice my voice sounded different; like I was briefing helium or something.  I didn\u2019t have time to dwell on that, because I heard the hiss of a door opening nearby.  Hoping it was the way out, I made my ways towards it; only to find what appeared to be my mom, wearing a HAZMAT suit.  \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be alright, sweetie.\u201d The voice was distorted because of the mask but I knew it was her.  \u201cI know you\u2019re scared but I'm not going to hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the woman\u2019s hand, I inched closer only to stop and gasp when I saw her face through the helmet.  The face staring back at me looked like my mom, but there were some notable differences \u2013 the most notable being that her hair was brown instead of dark blonde.  \u201cYou... you\u2019re not my mom!\u201d backing away, I said, \u201cWho are you?  Where am I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy sweetie.\u201d Looking at me, the woman said, \u201cMy name\u2019s Natasha, my husband and I were working on a device to explore other worlds; including your own.  We certainly didn\u2019t mean to pull you through as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell was Dad working on?  Shocked, I looked at Natasha and said, \u201cI'm in another world!?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore precisely, you\u2019re in another universe.\u201d Looking at me, Natasha said, \u201cIt seems your trip left you a little banged up; I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea to send you back in that condition.  May I ask why you\u2019re wearing oversized boys' clothing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m a boy.\u201d Perplexed, I looked at her and said, \u201cA lot of people mistake me for a little girl; because of my height, body shape and feminine face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha looked at me for a moment before, sadly, saying, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not mistaken, young lady.\u201d Sighing, she said, \u201cTaking a look at your reflection.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorried about what I was going to see, I looked at the glass wall and found the reflection of a young girl staring back at me; with budding breasts and torn ill-fitting boy\u2019s clothing.  <i>No, this can\u2019t be happening.</i>  Not caring that Natasha was watching, I pulled down the front of my jeans to look inside.  When I saw a girl\u2019s vagina instead of my penis, I quickly turned back to my reflection in the mirror.  \u201cI'm a girl!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then screamed at the top of my lungs before collapsing to the floor.

One of them, in particular, caught my attention \u2013 it was my voice.  \u201cLet me get this straight Dad, you\u2019re saying this girl is me from another universe?\u201d pausing, he said, \u201cHow\u2019s that possible when she looks probably 2-3 years younger than me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened my eyes to find myself lying on the couch; everyone looking at me.  \u201cWha-What\u2019s going on?  Where am I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re safe, sweetie.\u201d Looking at me, Natasha said, \u201cYou have nothing to worry about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up, I looked down and realized my torn clothes had been replaced a somewhat tightly fitting dress.  My memory started to return at that moment; as I suddenly remembered being pulled through Dad\u2019s portal into another universe.  Jumping off the couch, I said, \u201cI have to get home!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy doppelganger was closest so he managed to grab me.  \u201cWhoa, calm down!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up at my doppelganger to find that other than our voices and face, there wasn\u2019t anything identical between us.  He seemed to be around 5\u20198\u201d and rather muscular.  I tried to wrest myself from his grip but found I didn\u2019t have the strength to do so.  Looking at the group, tears starting to come down my face, I said, \u201cPlease, you have to let me go home!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry...Eric, but I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s not possible right now.\u201d  Looking at me, Alt-Dad said, \u201cThe portal was damaged as a result of your arrival, it\u2019s going to take a few days before I can determine whether it\u2019s repairable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d crying, I said, \u201cNo, I have to go home now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that I was hysterical, Natasha looked at Alt-Tonya and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you bring her upstairs to your room; I think she needs to get some rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Looking at me, Alt-Tonya said, \u201cCome on, sweetie, let\u2019s go upstairs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop talking to me like I\u2019m a little kid!\u201d pointing at Alt-Eric, I said, \u201cI\u2019m 13 years old, just like him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny attempts to fight were fruitless; I was starting to feel lightheaded.  Before I could do anything about it, I collapsed to the floor.  This was followed by shocked gasps from everyone in the room.  \u201cWhat just happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy a stroke of luck, this alternate family had a new mirror leaning against a nearby wall.

Pushing myself up to a seated position, I brought a hand up to my face to determine if what I was seeing was real \u2013 I quickly realized it was when my hand bumped against a strand of long brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glance downward revealed two things; that I had a decent pair of breasts on my chest now, and the clothes I\u2019d been wearing earlier were in tatters on the floor.  Standing up, as I\u2019d seen women do in situations like this, I crossed my arms over my breasts and turned to my alt-family.  The looks on their faces showed they were just as confused as I was \u2013 although, if I\u2019m being honest, I could have done without my alternate self kept staring at my chest the way he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaining my composure, I looked at them and said, \u201cCould someone please tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d nervously, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough that portal turned me into a girl; now I\u2019m suddenly a grown woman?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on here, Eric; but I\u2019ll get to the bottom of it.\u201d Trying not to stare, Max said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you follow my wife upstairs for some clothes; I\u2019ll see what I can find out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha walked over, having grabbed a blanket from off the couch.  As she wrapped it around me, she said, \u201cCome on sweetie, I think I have some clothes that will fit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite my misgivings about what was to come, I followed Natasha upstairs to her bedroom.  While she went to work rummaging through her closet, I stood in front of a mirror and got a closer look at myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first difference that I noticed was that I was now taller than I had been before coming through the portal; if I had to guess, I was probably around 5\u20196.\u201d  I seemed to be an attractive looking woman \u2013 nice figure and decent breasts; I never really thought of older women like that, so I didn\u2019t really have much to go on.  My face resembled a mixture of both my parents, but seemed to lean more towards my Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning away from the mirror, I sat down on the bed and looked at Natasha while she rummaged through her dresser \u2013 it didn\u2019t take a genius to figure out what she was looking for.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry if my being here has inconvenienced your family, ma\u2019am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Eric; you\u2019re not inconveniencing us. If anything we should be apologizing for pulling you through.\u201d Turning around with a bra in hand, she said, \u201cWith all the discussions I\u2019ve had with my husband about that portal, I never once imagined something like this would happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew what she was referring to, but figured I\u2019d ask anyway.  \u201cYou mean that it would pull through an alternate version of your son; who then turned into a grown woman before your eyes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly.\u201d Picking up the clothes she\u2019d chosen, she gestured for me to follow her into the bathroom.  \u201cI never imagined having to dress a woman who was another version of my son.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took about 20 minutes to me get dressed; I, of course, needed some help with the bra.  The two of us talked the whole time; about my universe and family mostly, during which time she insisted that I call her Natasha instead of ma\u2019am.  Once we were finished, Natasha and I stood in front of the mirror; looking at our reflections.  It was only at that moment that I realized just how similar we looked in appearance \u2013 to the point where we could have been mistaken for sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning away from the mirror, I said, \u201cI suppose we should go downstairs; your husband probably has some information for us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a brush from a drawer, Natasha said, \u201cIn a minute, Eric; I want to work on your hair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat started out as a simple brushing of my hair quickly turned into more; as Natasha decided to apply a light amount of makeup.  Once she was finished, she turned me back towards the mirror and said, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was stunned, to say the least; the person staring back at me looked like a rather attractive looking woman.  I had to pinch myself to make sure I wasn\u2019t dreaming.  Turning to Natasha, I said, \u201cI...wow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry if I went overboard; I couldn\u2019t resist seeing what you\u2019d look like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Natasha and I walked back downstairs; where I got shocked looks from everyone \u2013 especially Alt-Eric.  It was hard enough for him to deal with having another version of himself in the house; but to see that version looking like a grown woman, that was too much for him.  Without saying a word, he walked out of the room while Alt-Tonya looked at me and said, \u201cYou look great, Eric; I think that outfit looks perfect on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, I guess.\u201d Seeing Alt-Dad walk into the room, I looked at him and said, \u201cDid you find out anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA surprised look appeared on his face when he saw me standing there; he hadn\u2019t expected that.  Looking at me, he said, \u201cI ran some simulations; it seems that your journey through the portal caused your genetic makeup to fluctuate.\u201d Pausing, he said, \u201cYour appearance is going to alter every few days until it stabilizes; you could become younger or even older than you are now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn\u2019t the information I\u2019d been hoping for.  \u201cAm I always going to be a girl in some form or another?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what it seems like.\u201d Looking at me, Alt-Dad said, \u201cI\u2019m going to try and find a way to make you male again, but I\u2019m not hopeful.  For now, I want to focus on returning you home.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Tonya was upstairs in her room and Eric was avoiding me; which I thought was weird.  Here we were; two Eric\u2019s from different universes, and he didn\u2019t want to be near me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate for anything to get my mind of the fact that I was a woman, I went off to find Natasha.  The layout of the house was nearly identical to the one I\u2019d come from; with some minor differences like carpeted stairs instead of hardwood.  I soon found her in the kitchen, checking over some of the mail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mind if I join you?\u201d walking over to the table, I said, \u201cEveryone else is either too busy or is avoiding me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course Eric, have a seat.\u201d As I took a seat next to her, Natasha said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about my Eric, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s just having a hard time with this.  It\u2019s not every day you see a version of yourself from another universe turn into an adult woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why he\u2019s having a hard time with this.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI\u2019m the one who turned into a woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha looked around for a moment before looking at me.  \u201cI don\u2019t know how things are in your universe, but here <i>my</i> Eric occasionally questions his sexuality.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA few months ago, for Halloween, he decided to go dressed as Black Widow from the Avengers movies; red wig, fake breasts, the works.\u201d Pausing, Natasha said, \u201cHe\u2019d never admit to it, but I couldn\u2019t help but notice he looked, well...happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI processed what Natasha told me as she retrieved her phone and started searching for something.  After a few seconds, she found what she was looking for and handed the phone to me.  What I saw was a very passable Black Widow costume.  I had to really look close to convince myself it was Eric and not a real girl - and Natasha was right, he did seem happy.  Handing the phone back to Natasha, I said, \u201cIf what you\u2019re telling me is true; then seeing me like this must be unnerving for him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you\u2019re right.\u201d Taking my hand, Natasha said, \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll come around eventually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope Max can find a way to undo all of this before it comes to that.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cI\u2019m probably more uncomfortable being a woman than Eric is with seeing me as one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, in the meantime, I\u2019ll enjoy having another woman my age to spend time with.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I did notice one thing as we talked; the longer we talked, the more it sounded like two women catching up than a woman talking with an older female version of her son.  My mom didn\u2019t have a lot of lady friends in my universe; I got the sense that it was the same with Natasha. Mind you I wasn\u2019t complaining; since she was the only one making an effort to talk with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, however, she had to get back to sorting the mail; so I left the kitchen.  As I walked by the basement door, I heard noises coming from downstairs.  My curiosity got the better of me and I decided to go downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI entered the basement to find Max removing some of the clutter that came through with me.  Walking up behind him, I said, \u201cWould you like some help, Max?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay Eric.\u201d Turning to face me, Max said, \u201cThat\u2019s one of Natasha\u2019s favorite tops, I\u2019d hate for it to get dirty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou make a good point.\u201d Sitting down on a chair, I said, \u201cSo when do you think you\u2019ll be able to return me home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t even venture a guess.\u201d Picking up what appeared to be part of a shelf, he said, \u201cRight now I suppose I should find a way to make you a boy again; unless you want to return home as a grown woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would definitely be appreciated.\u201d Taking a deep breath, I said, \u201cNatasha explained why she thinks Eric has been avoiding me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d Looking at me, Max said, \u201cMy wife is usually right about these sorts of things; but if Eric is unsure about his sexuality, he hasn\u2019t mentioned it to us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could ask him about it; since we\u2019re two versions of the same person.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cAlthough I suspect my current appearance might make things worse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope we can get you home before you have to worry about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to say something when I heard the doorbell ring upstairs; followed by the sound of footsteps coming down the stairs.  When I heard voices, I turned to Max and said, \u201cShould I stay down here until they\u2019re gone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, why?\u201d looking at me, confused, Max said, \u201cNo one knows you\u2019re from another universe; as far as they\u2019re concerned, you\u2019re just another woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed Max upstairs and walked out into the hallway; spotting Tonya talking with two people in the doorway.  I recognized one of the voices as belonging to my best friend Bethany, so I started walking towards them.  Sure enough, it was her; standing next to a boy who looked like her brother or something.  <i>That\u2019s weird.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could stop myself, I walked over and embraced her, \u201cBethany, it\u2019s so good to see you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t surprised when she pulled away; after all, a strange woman just came up and hugged her.  What did surprise me, however, was when she said, \u201cBethany?  My name\u2019s Rachel.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cWho are you?\u201d</span></div></div>",

To their credit both Rachel and Brandon, her twin brother, quickly made it clear that they believed what we were telling them.  While Natasha and Max went into the kitchen to get some refreshments, I stayed in the family room with Rachel and Brandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us sat in silence for a few minutes until Brandon spoke up.  \u201cSo do I not exist in your universe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Brandon.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cMy best guess is that you <i>are</i> Bethany; albeit a male version of her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense; since you said Rachel looks exactly like Bethany.\u201d Confused, Brandon said, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t she be <br>\r\nBethany?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Brandon.\u201d Getting a little agitated, I said, \u201cYou\u2019re talking to someone who was a teenage boy this morning but is now a grown woman.  I truly have no idea what to think right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI imagine this must be really weird for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have no idea, Rachel.\u201d Taking a breath, I said, \u201cI hope Max can find a way to undo this soon because I\u2019m not sure I want to be a woman for the rest of my life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Max and Natasha returned with the drinks, I watched Rachel get up and go upstairs.  My curiosity got the better of me, and I excused myself to follow her upstairs.  If anyone had a problem with it, they didn\u2019t say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quietly walked upstairs and went down the hall; hearing voices coming from Eric\u2019s room.  As I got closer, I heard Rachel say, \u201cHow are you dealing with everything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout as well as you might expect.\u201d Sighing, Eric said, \u201cOf all the things my dad\u2019s portal could pull through, why did it have to be a female version of me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know it must be weird for you, seeing...her here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know, Rachel; how could you possibly know?\u201d his voice cracking, Eric said, \u201cAll this time I\u2019ve been wishing I was a girl, and there\u2019s a version of me out there that actually is one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was shocked \u2013 Natasha was right; Eric did want to be a girl.  My presence must\u2019ve made him very uncomfortable; which would explain his behavior around him.  I was the embodiment of everything he wanted to be.  I turned to walk back down the hall, only to suddenly double over in pain.  Rachel and Eric came running out of Eric\u2019s room to find lying on the floor in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gasps I heard from them told me something was wrong.  I struggled to get to my feet but found that I was unable to do so.  Rachel ran over and looked at me, \u201cDon\u2019t try to move, Eric.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eric went to get Max and Natasha, Rachel looked at me and said: \u201cYou\u2019ve changed again.\u201d Taking a deep breath, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re now a _____.\u201d</span></div></div>",

After Natasha got out of the bio-hazard suit, she led you up the stairs to the main floor of her house where she led you to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being a girl is not so bad.\" she told you. \"I'm sure my daughter, Tonya would love to help you adjust.\" she then looked at you serious. \"I'm afraid we can't be calling you Eric here as we already have a boy here with that name and, well, you don't look like an Eric anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A new name?\" you asked, trying to hide your frustration. \"What do you suggest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha thought for a moment. \"How do you like... Sarah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah Teddie Summers.\" you mused, using your real middle name. \"Okay, that sounds fine, for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha smiled. \"Welcome to our home, Sarah.\" she said. \"What do you say we get you some more appropriate clothing before I help you freshen up a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small grin touched the corners of your mouth. \"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only our Eric thinks 'Sarah' is a visiting relative...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrever and Bethany were stunned but they soon smiled as they then nodded turned to you. \"Welcome to our neck of the woods... Sarah.\" giggled Bethany. \"How long will you be staying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure.\" you replied, honestly. \"At least until my injuries heal.\" you sighed. \"I had a rough trip here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that.\" said Trever, looking at the numerous bandages on your feminine body. \"If its of any help, you do look very cute in that outfit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a humorless laugh to which Bethany gave you a quick hug. \"We'll help you adjust.\" she said, releasing you. \"Being a girl is not so bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wasn't she always a girl?\" asked Eric, confused, hearing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany winced then turned to Tonya, who was impatiently tapping her foot. \"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya sighed, turning to Eric. \"You know that mom and dad build all kinds of strange things in the basement.\" she said. \"Well, they made what they called a parallel portal...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon finished her explanation, Eric was white with mixture of horror and fascination. \"I always wondered what I would look like a s a girl.\" he said. \"Now I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya smiled, happy that Eric was taking the news better than she had feared. \"Well, we need to help her adapt to being a girl and fast.\" she said. \"Sarah will be attending our school until we can send her back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now, it's time for lunch.\" said momma, turning around with a plate of sandwiches, who's hungry?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The blouse was comfortable, at least, but you were not used to the buttons being on the other side. As you walked with Eric into the school, he led you to the office where the secretary, Mrs Carol Stark, a short and plump young woman smiled at him and you. \"Good morning, Eric.\" she said in a cheerful tone. \"Who is your friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Sarah Summers.\" said Eric, introducing you. \"She will be visiting us for the school year.

There, as you entered the room, all eyes turned towards you as Eric led you two seats off to the side in the front. The desks with yours and Eric's names on them were borrowed from the Kindergarten class and, as embarrassing as it seemed, they fit your small size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat down at the desk with your name on a piece of paper, you heard a low moan from behind you. \"It looks like they sent us <i>another</i> baby to look after.\" said a mean voice to a number of giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced then turned around to see a teen girl with long blond hair and blue eyes in a cheerleader uniform. She had a fine body, a little over developed for a thirteen year old. You guessed that she was a teacher's assistant. \"I guess we could break out another package of diapers.\" the girl added to more giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a baby, Misty.\" said Eric, defiantly. \"You've already been warned by the principal twice about taunting me.\" he then eyed you. \"Don't even think about taunting my cousin, either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, is the poor widdle babies gonna cry?\" asked Misty, brining the class to a laughter. \"Do you need you wuggy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, rolling your eyes. <i>\"What a bitch.\"</i> you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty looked at you with an evil grin. \"You are a bit taller than Eric but I think the diapers will fit you just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you didn't stretch them out, wearing them yourself?\" you asked. to the students' silence. \"Or did they just not have a uniform in your size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty turned red with anger and rose her hand to slap you but you spoke, stopping her cold. \"You know nothing about me, miss thing.\" you warned. \"For all you know, I have black belts in martial arts and you swinging your hand will result in a 'baby' kicking your ass.\" you turned to her smiling. \"Do you feel... lucky, Misty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Misty, you did know some martial arts and wrestling , taught to you by Trevor, so you could hold your own if you had to. Only you were not an official black belt, at least not yet. There was an awkward silence in the room as, even in your world, no one had ever stood up to the rich girl Misty before. Only, in your world, Trevor kept Misty clear of you.<br>\r\nCursing under her breath, Misty walked back to her desk as the teacher entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, class.\" she said. \"For those who do not know, I am Mrs Connor.

I will leave you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast... my lady.\" you said with a giggle. \"The guard has already seen you as my handmaiden so until I can think of a way to get you out of this, that is who you shall be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy gulped. \"Then to what name shall I go by until then, my princess?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your name?\" you asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geo.\" replied the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, I shall call you...

Tonya stood behind an screen of energy that blocked anything from getting out, while her parents wore hazmat suits as they searched through the rubble. <br>\r\n\"The air looks safe, dad,\" said Tonya \"Why can't I just come and help?\" <br>\r\n\"The air might look safe,\" said Max \"But I don't want to expose you to anything in case it isn't.\" As Max and Natasha continued to search, Tonya noticed a hand between bits of rubble. Throwing all thoughts of self-preservation out the window, Tonya ran through the screen and towards the hand. She tried pushing the rubble aside, while holding her breath so she didn't breath in anything, before she was forced to take a breath. As soon as she did, the rubble suddenly became easier to handle, and it flew into the wall. Any other time, Tonya would have been shocked at this, but she was too preoccupied by saving whoever was under there, so she continued, pushing rubble away, until a 13 year old girl was revealed, unconscious in the rubble. She put her arms under the body of the girl and picked her up. Like the rocks, the girl felt a lot lighter than she should have, but as Tonya passed through the energy field, the girl suddenly became heavier. She staggered out of the lab and into the house, and placed the sleeping girl on the couch. Tonya was surprised to note that the girl didn't appear to be injured, despite being trapped under a pile of rubble.   </span></div></div>",

She looked down at the readout on the screen at her control panel. \"But\u2026 wait, Arthur\u2026 Look at this!\" she exclaimed, pointing down to the monitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man walked to her and looked over her shoulder. \"What is it, Claire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The biostats say that he's eight years old. But he's only four feet tall!\" She looked at Arthur with a skeptical but excited look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Really?\" Arthur said, checking the numbers again. \"Why, no eight year old on Earth has been anywhere near that short for the past twenty years!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this it? Do you think we've done it?\" Claire asked, walking to another control panel on the far wall. \"Do you think we've found the one we're looking for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe the scanners are off\u2026\" Arthur typed something into the keyboard. \"I'll have the systems do a calibration check and rescan. We need to be sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you overheard this conversation from inside your smoky glass box, you coughed, trying not to inhale the fumes and debris cloud that filled your cage, while in your head you were trying to make sense of what the two adults were saying. Eight years old? You knew you were small for your age, but a computer scan should hopefully show you were older than that. And ONLY four feet tall? Sure, there were eight-year-olds taller than you, but it wasn't uncommon to see ones around your height or even shorter. Something about this seemed way too weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't help that from what you could see of the laboratory, it was substantially different from your parents'. The same type of machinery and lights filled the room, but the ceilings seemed to stretch much, much higher, and the windows on the opposite sides of the wall had been boarded up. For their own part, Claire and Arthur at least had a very similar look to your mom and dad, with the same eyes, skin tone, hair color, height and build, but the clothes they were wearing looked like something out of a bad sci-fi comic book. They both had on some sort of robes with really wide shoulders that tapered to a point on the ends, and long flowing tails. Looking closely at the robe, you saw that it had some sort of inscription on it, but the strange squiggles looked like no alphabet you had ever seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Arthur confirmed as he looked up from the control panel, his voice getting more and more excited, \"the scanners are fully in calibration, and the biostats haven't changed. We've really found a four-foot-tall eight-year-old boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank heavens,\" Claire said, \"then maybe it's not too late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down at your body, and saw that, even though you were the same height as before, you did have a more youthful appearance, with slightly smoother skin and smaller hands and feet. You weren't quite as slender as before, and your clothes had changed from the white tank top and cargo shorts you had been wearing to a red t-shirt and pair of jean shorts. Trying to make sense of it all, and afraid of what kind of world you're in, you began to hyperventilate, taking in more of the smoky air surrounding you. This caused you to cough even harder, and you fell to your knees, gasping for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gracious!\" Claire exclaimed when she saw you. \"He's choking in there! Arthur, quick! Turn on the ventilation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur rushed to the side of the cage where a control panel was affixed and flipped a large switch, and the smoke and dust in your chamber suddenly rushed to the top with a loud WOOOOSH, disappearing out of sight. After a few seconds, the air had cleared up and it became easier to breath. You sat down, making sure you breathed as deeply as you needed without overdoing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur put his hand on the glass wall near you and looked down at your face, smiling. \"Hello, child,\" he said, \"I know you're probably frightened, but don't worry. We don't mean you any harm. We're here in peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arthur,\" Claire muttered, \"quit with the alien visitor crap and get him out of there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Arthur pressed two buttons on the cage's control panel, and one of the walls slid down. Thankful for your freedom, you quickly sprung to your feet and stepped out. You felt a lot more light-headed than you expected, however, and nearly fell flat on your face. Arthur, though, caught you and helped you regain your balance before you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, easy there, guy,\" he said. \"You need to be careful. Transporting between different dimensions can be a little disorientating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that you would know,\" Claire said as she walked over to join the two of you, \"or anyone else, for that matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, transporting between dimensions?\" you asked, rubbing the bruises on your arm gingerly. \"And why did you say I'm eight years old when I'm thirteen? And either way, since when is four feet tall not normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire and Arthur exchanged troubled looks with each other. \"Um, listen,\" Claire said as she placed a hand on your back, gently guiding you towards the stairs at the other end of the laboratory. \"Maybe we should have a bit of a talk\u2026\"</span></div></div>",

However, it was stocked with all sorts of different appliances, some that looked completely unfamiliar to you, and was without the window that you remembered being over the sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down at the kitchen table across from Claire, while Arthur went over to a panel on the wall and pressed his hand to it. The panel then lit up, revealing some icons for various food items. \"Would you like anything to drink?\" he asked, looking to you. \"Some water or milk perhaps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say anything, Claire shot him a harsh look. \"Arthur, you can't give him anything to eat or drink until we've run metabolic and digestive tests! For all we know, it could kill him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur looked at his wife questioningly, shrugged and closed the refrigerator again. \"Fine,\" he said, \"just trying to be polite. Though I don't see how a glass of water would do any harm.\" He rolled his eyes as he sat down in between you and his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Claire said, sighing, \"we just need to be careful. I'm sorry, child,\" she turned her attention to you. \"I don't mean to frighten you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not frightened,\" you protested, \"and I'm not really a child! My name's Eric, and I keep telling you, I'm thirteen years old!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire tilted her head to the side a little and looked at you with a slight hesitation in her eyes. \"Okay, Eric, I believe you. Maybe you were thirteen, in the dimension you came from. Are other thirteen-year-old boys there around the same height as you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you put your arm up on the table and leaned against it. \"No,\" you said, \"almost everyone my age is bigger than me, even the girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur leaned closer to you. \"And are other thirteen year olds as, um, underdeveloped as you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head again. \"Not usually. But then again, I'm not usually quite like this either! Something happened to me during the transport process that changed my body, I swear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire thought about this for a second, then jotted something down on a notepad in front of her. \"That might make sense,\" she finally said. \"The dimensional transport process involves disassembling and reassembling matter at the sub-atomic level. It's possible that you were reassembled in a slightly different manner than you're typically accustomed to, maybe having to play by the elemental laws of our dimension, or maybe just having some sort of data loss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur spun around to face her. \"Why would the machine do that? It doesn't make any sense!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire shrugged. \"Who knows? Maybe we should have run a few more calibration checks first before we turned it on, like I wanted.\" She shot a dirty look at Arthur. \"After all, it is a completely unproven technology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slouched down in your seat, frustrated. You could sorta grasp what she was saying, but it all sounded way beyond the capabilities of any technology you knew about. Still, you remembered that, back in your own world, your parent's research was considered very experimental and cutting edge, which is why they were able to receive all those government grants that kept them from having to foreclose the house. Maybe there were things they had been doing in their lab that you hadn't even dreamed about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire busily worked out some figures on her notepad, so Arthur turned back to you and said, \"Regardless of your age now versus your age then, I think there's something more important, at least as far as we're concerned. You said you thought four feet tall was normal, at least for an eight-year-old, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up a little again, not quite understanding where he was going. \"Yeah, I did.\" You looked up at the high ceilings again as you did, a thought starting to cross your mind. \"Why? Are people bigger here? You guys look about the same size as the adults back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're partially right,\" Arthur nodded. \"We're what's considered 'normal height' here. However, there has been some\u2026 developments, shall we say, in the last twenty years that have changed our perception of what 'normal' really means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Developments? What the hell does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arthur, if you'll let me?\" Claire put her hand on her husband's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be my guest,\" Arthur said, motioning for her to take over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire stood up and started pacing back and forth on the tile kitchen floor. \"A little over twenty years ago,\" she started in, \"an asteroid crossed into Earth's orbit and was pulled in by our gravity, disintegrating on contact with the atmosphere. As it did, some sort of element from the asteroid dissolved in the air, spreading throughout the globe. We were in grad school then, and all the scientific community studied the phenomenon: physicists, meteorologists, biologists; no one could make heads or tails of it, and as it didn't seem to have any measurable effect on anything, the public quickly forgot about it. That is, until about nine months later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nine months?\" you asked as wheels began to turn in your head. \"So... I'm guessing it had some sort of effect on pregnancies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're pretty smart, Eric,\" Claire remarked, obviously impressed, \"whether we're talking for an eight-year-old or for a thirteen-year-old. Yes, something in the elements had an unknown effect on the DNA of every human on Earth. Any babies that were conceived after the incident, up to this very day, seem to experience substantial growth throughout their lives. While newborns that are delivered weigh in only slightly bigger than average, as soon as they begin to breath the air, they start to grow at a substantial rate. A one-month old could weigh fifteen pounds, and by the time of their second birthday, the average child is almost six feet tall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazed, you whistled, leaning back in your chair. \"Wow! A six-foot-two year old! That would be a sight to see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's just the average!\" Arthur chimed in. \"Some are not that big, only being a foot or so taller than 'normal', but some are even bigger, up to eight or even nine feet tall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned forward, intrigued, excited, and amazed at the story they were telling you. \"So, does this mean that they've grown into adults by the time they're two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire shook her head. \"No, it isn't that simple. They still look like two-year-olds, still have the same intelligence and attitudes children that age should have. They are simply bigger. And the growth doesn't stop at two. They all continue to grow, bigger than the adults that have given birth to them before they even start kindergarten. School buildings, public places, even homes like ours have had to be modified to fit their incredible heights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big do they grow?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It varies depending on the person,\" Arthur answered. \"Some stop at around twelve or thirteen feet tall, while others tower high above them, getting almost twenty feet tall. Recently, a few boys have broken even that barrier, and seem to still be growing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" you said, stunned. This was certainly an amazing story, one that you probably weren't going to truly believe until you saw definitive proof with your own eyes. \"So, they keep growing into adulthood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Claire stopped her pacing, and looked at you, unsure of what to say. Her and Arthur kept looking back and forth at each other. \"Uhhh\u2026\" Arthur stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you asked. \"What's the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Claire sat back down at the chair on the opposite side of the table and looked at you straight in the eye. \"No, Eric,\" she said, \"it doesn't continue into adulthood. And the reason why is\u2026\"</span></div></div>",

The best idea that's been thrown out there is that the changes in the DNA that causes the accelerated growth in the first place also causes the cells to eventually stop replicating, meaning that the body cannot keep up as old cells die off. Eventually all the major organs shut down, and the boy or girl dies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-that's horrible!\" you said, still stunned. \"While they're still children?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Claire stood up again and looked out the window. \"The child that has lived the longest so far was a girl who had only grown to be a little more than nine feet tall, and she lived to be fifteen. But most don't get to become teenagers...\" Her voice trailed off as she stared at the back yard, and you could see her eyes starting to moisten. Looking at Arthur, you noticed he, too, looked very saddened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take you too long to put two and two together. \"You... you two had a child who... who didn't make it, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire sniffed and turned back towards you. \"We lost him last year. He-- he was only twelve -- your age, I guess. Joseph... That was his name. He... He...\" Unable to control her emotions, she quickly stepped out of the room and up the stairs, and you heard the bedroom door shut loudly behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slouched in your chair, upset with yourself for being so insensitive. Looking into Arthur's somber eyes, you shook your head and sighed. \"I'm sorry... I didn't mean to...\" You weren't sure what to say; all this information was incredibly overwhelming, almost too much to handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur stood up and walked over to you, placing his hand on your shoulder in a warm fashion. \"Don't be sorry, Eric,\" he said. \"You're here to try and help us fix everything, so that we can go back to the way things were and so that other parents don't have to go through what we, and countless others, have gone through. It's...\" He swallowed hard, trying to keep his smile on his face, and continued, \"You're our best hope, our greatest chance to save humanity. I know with you here we can do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at Arthur and smiled. \"Okay,\" you said, jumping to your feet. \"I'm in!

Once you were lying down on your back, he quickly strapped you down, sending your mind reeling. \"What... What are you doing!?\" you asked, alarmed. \"Let me up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please calm down, Eric.\" said Arthur. \"These tests are going to take a while and some of them require you to remain very still, thus the need for the straps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou relaxed slightly as Arthur then vanished into another room, returning a few minutes later, dressed in medical garments. Your eyes widened slightly as he prepped a table with an assortment of surgical tools. He presently turned back to you, producing a sterile syringe before piercing the needle into your arm. \"We will start with a few blood samples.\" he said. \"This will help us determine if you have any conditions unknown to our world....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter countless of tests, varying from embarrassing to physically painful, you were finally released from the straps but you were too weak to sit up. The tests took nearly twenty hours to complete, leaving you soar and drained. You curled yourself into a little ball, quietly moaning and sobbing. Arthur winced, seeing your discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am truly sorry, Eric.\" he said, softly. \"I will get to work on the tests immediately after I get some rest, I suggest you do the same.\" he gave you a faint smile. \"Once I get all of the results, we will have a much better idea of what you are able to eat here and I promise you will be fed and given something for your pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he covered you with a sterilized sheet and blanket before leaving the chamber through an airlock.

Sorry if I woke you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at the digital clock on the wall, which read 9:13, you tried to smile, shaking your head. \"Nah, I guess I should be up by now anyways. What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held a stack of computer printouts in his hand. \"I processed the test results this morning. Mostly good news, I'm happy to report. First off, you're completely compatible with virtually every kind of food and drink in our world. Claire's actually fixing you a big breakfast upstairs to celebrate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww,\" you said. \"How nice of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur smiled. \"You have no signs of carrying any unknown disease or contamination, and shouldn't be susceptible to anything we have in our world. There also should be no detrimental effects on your body from our atmosphere or anything else in our air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear. Though I suppose if that were the case we would've already noticed it when I fell to the floor gasping.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Arthur continued looking at the readouts. \"Furthermore, your genome seems to match up nearly perfectly with ours, as far as the basic building blocks of your DNA that make you human are concerned. It seems pretty likely that, if we hadn't seen Earth affected by that asteroid twenty years ago, our universe would be practically identical to yours, give or take a few details.\" He looked up again, excitement building in his face. \"It looks like we hit the jackpot when we pulled you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, stifling a yawn that had suddenly struck you, the effects of sleeping on a stiff table and being woken up so quickly. \"Anything I should be worried about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really.\" Arthur quickly flipped through the paperwork. \"The only thing is...\" He paused for a moment, his eyes scrunching up as he read. \"Well, this is certainly peculiar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" You stood up and walked up next to him, trying to peak at the printouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised I didn't catch this before,\" he said, pointing to the paper at a table that had several large strings of numbers, seemingly meaningless (to you, anyways). \"But according to the cellular decay and regeneration analysis, something about your body structure doesn't match up with how your genetic code is laid out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes bugged in confusion. This didn't sound good. \"What are you saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Arthur thought for a moment. \"This might explain and confirm your claims of being thirteen instead of eight, like we first thought when we saw you and the computers initially claimed. Your DNA has the markings of a person that was originally conceived approximately fourteen years, two months, and eleven days ago. Which would make you just under thirteen and a half years old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's exactly how old I am! See! I told you!\" Your heart started to beat faster, excited at your story finally being corroborated. \"So something happened to my body when I shifted dimensions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it, but I'll have to do some more tests to find out exactly what.\" He looked up at you, a serious expression on his face. \"The only thing is... this readout shows your body structure as currently being highly unstable. Nothing lethal, I think, but--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think?!!\" you exclaim, a slight sense of fear and anger now setting in. \"I'm not sure if I can deal with you just thinking that I won't be killed by that...instability, or whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Eric.\" Arthur tried to force a strained smile. \"We'll do examinations and scans twice a day while you're here -- don't worry, nothing nearly as intense as yesterday's. If we start to detect anything harmful, we'll do everything we can to reverse it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't much of an assurance, but it was all you had. \"Okay. Fine. So...what exactly are we going to do now? What's the ultimate plan for all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for starters, we need to map your entire genome in order to have something to base the adjustments we need to make to our own humanity's genetic code. That'll take a while, probably a dozen days of scanning, twice a day, like I said before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll take that long?\" you asked, a disappointed look on your face. \"Why not just do one more long session, like we did yesterday? I'm not jumping at the chance to do that, but if it means I can get home sooner...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur shook his head. \"That works for an initial scan, to get us a starting point.\" He indicated the printouts, waving them in his hand. \"But in order to obtain the 99.99% accuracy we need, the computer is going to have to process the information to a painstaking level of detail. For every ten minutes we scan your body and your DNA, the computer has to spend over ten hours of time comparing and analyzing what it sees. I wish there was a faster way, but the setup we have now costs over a billion dollars of government funds and private donations each year to set up and maintain, and even with ten times that amount, it would still take a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" you sigh, sitting back down again on the table, your shoulder's slumping. \"I'm stuck in your universe for a couple of weeks. What am I going to do until then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur patted your shoulder, and you looked up at his eyes, which had just begun to twinkle. \"Well, Claire and I were just talking about that.

Shouts of protest from both mom and dad reached your ears and you hurried along the wall, hoping to find a door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on!?\" you asked yourself, wincing with each painful but hurried step. \"Dad builds these things for the government, why would they want to shut him down!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding a door, you pushed against it but it would not budge. You banged against it and it whooshed open, allowing you to run out into the open. Seeing you come out of the glass chamber, everyone froze, including you. The men looked at you, stunned as, unknown to you, no one expected to find a living being to enter the room from the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze as everyone, minus your mom and dad, looked like the characters from the Stargate universe television program that had aired every Saturday. It was your favorite show. <i>\"Are they shooting a movie here?\"</i> you thought. <i>\"I wish they would have told me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you rose one hand. \"Um... hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax looked at you stunned. \"Impossible...\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha also looked at you stunned, tears flowing from her eyes. \"Eric...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I'm sorry if I wrecked something.\" you said, tearing up. \"That thing pulled me in like a giant vacuum, you saw me get thrown in...\" you paused, seeing everyone's confused looks. \"Didn't you?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall man, in military fatigues, who seemed to have been in charge, pointed at you. \"Get that boy into containment!\" he ordered. \"I'll question him later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo soldiers quickly walked towards you with their guns drawn. \"Just take it easy, young man.\" said the first man. \"There's no need to panic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with us quietly.\" said the second man. \"We won't hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you struggled, the two soldiers made short work of handcuffing you. As one man carried you, protesting, towards the stairs, you heard the man in charge speak to who you thought or hoped was your mom and dad. \"Do you two realize what you could have brought upon us by creating and opening your own Stargate?\" he asked. \"The general is going to hit the roof with you two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sergent Harris, you need to listen to me.\" protested Max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Sergent Harris, you turned pale but still chuckled. \"If that's a Stargate, its a bad mock up.\" you said. you then described exactly what a real Stargate looked like before adding, \"With some modifications, it'll be a great movie prop but you should really tone down its power. I mean, talk about over kill...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the room paled but the man in charge quickly recovered and turned to you. \"Son, I don't think you realize the true seriousness of your situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you respond?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rubbing the back of your head, you pulled the covers off yourself to find that you were wearing clothing suited for a toddler. A moan escaped your lips as your clothes back home were specially made in styles for a teenager. \"I hate wearing this stuff.\" you muttered, \"It makes me feel like a baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing yourself off the bed, you walked over to the door, you guessed was the way out. Only the door was locked tight and you noticed a card lock on the wall a little higher up. Looking around, you saw no windows and the only other door lead to a small washroom with a toilet, sink, and shower. \"I've been kidnapped.\" you said, angrily. \"Why did I have to answer that phone today!? Even working out with Trevor is better than this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the door beeped and you turned to see a middle aged man enter with a small tray of wrapped sandwiches and two large cups of what smelled like hot chocolate. He placed the tray down and sighed, looking at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Major Paul Davis of Homeworld Command.\" he said, tiredly. \"The good news is that the doctors gave us the okay to feed you our food, they examined you while you were out cold.\" he motioned to the tray. \"Sorry its not much, I had to raid the vending machines but its better than nothing and its not half bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the tray but did not move, even though you were starving. \"Kidnapping is a crime and so is assault, Major Davis.\" you blurted out. \"Where am I and why are you holding me here!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, now!\" scolded the man, looking stern. \"First, we had no idea what our sedatives would do to you so a blow to the head was necessary to pacify you. Second, be thankful we detected the opening of the portal before the Lucian Alliance. Third, you are being detained at homeworld command as you may have invaluable information we can use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, your anger fading. \"Sorry, I'm having a bad day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis nodded. \"I've had those myself.\" he said, sitting down. \"Let's start with getting some breakfast in and then I want to ask you some questions regarding your knowledge of Stargate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you and Davis shared the cold sandwiches and hot chocolate from the vending machines, you told Davis about the movie that had launched the number of television series. Davis listened carefully and jotted down notes as he asked the occasional question, which you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now.\" said Davis. \"Tell me about the Lucian Alliance, as you know it from your television series.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a breath. \"After the Goa'uld regime went down, much of their resources and technology fell into the hands of the humans they had controlled. Some of these guys banded together and formed the Lucian Alliance, an organization very similar to the Mafia but on a galactic scale. Although humans mostly run the show, the Alliance also has members from other races, including Oranians.\" you began. \"This group is formidable, as I'm sure you've learned from experience but its not not without its weaknesses. The Alliance is largely controlled by mercenaries, smugglers, and other criminals, its leadership is touchy at best, with a lot of conflict at the top. Members live dangerous lives, being killed for the slightest offense or simply when a rival desires their territory.The Alliance rules with fear and intimidation, and punish defiance with swift retribution... this makes them a lot like the Goa'uld.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis nodded, taking down notes. \"Any idea who their leader is right now?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I remember right, its a guy named Netan.\" you replied. \"Don't quote me on that, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis grunted. \"anything else you can tell us?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they're headed by a single leader, who divides responsibility, territory, and resources among his 'sconds'.\" you replied, thinking. \"About 20 of these guys take care of things like smuggling, extortion, racketeering, and trafficking in kassa, a corn-like grain that's addictive.\" you paused. \"That's what they use to keep their pee-ons in line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.\" said Davis, jotting down more notes. \"Go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Alliance has quite an armada of Goa'uld vessels, including Ha'taks, Al'kesh bombers, Death Gliders, and Tel'taks.\" you continued. \"They have spies <i>everywhere</i>. Don't underestimate them, major, they are a credible threat, especially to the Tau'ri and the newly formed Jaffa government.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis sighed. \"Some of this we already knew but this kassa you speak of, that explains a lot.\" he said. \"I'll let you rest while I make my report.\" he gave you a smile. \"Welcome to our world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he walked to the door and swiped a card. The door buzzed and opened, allowing him to walk out. \"Wait.\" you said, walking to him. \"Don't I get a tour or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis roughed up your hair. \"I'll see what I can do.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then walked out, closing the door, sealing you inside. You huffed before walking back to your hot chocolate. \"I'll see what I can do.\" you said, mockingly. you took a sip. \"This is good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What can you tell me about him?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a breath. \"In the series I know, Ba'al was a Goa'uld, and one of the last System Lords. He had left Ra's service to become a ruler himself elsewhere.\" you began. \"After the Goa'uld fell to the Replicators, he became the only known surviving System Lord and was determined to rebuild his empire and his return to power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on.\" urged O'Neil, writing something down on a pocket notepad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \"Ba'al succeeded, somewhat, with a number of clones but those copies were killed with the 'last' being extracted by the Tok'ra.\" you said. \"The real Ba'al was finally killed by Colonel Cameron Mitchell who set a nasty ambush for him when he tried to change time. Ba'al never returned to the series after that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you stressed the word last when you spoke of Ba'ad's clones being killed.\" said O'Neil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"The series hinted that one of his clones had survived.\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nO'Neil sighed. \"The kid's a walking encyclopedia of our reality.\" he muttered under his breath. he then turned to you, forcing a smile. \"I think you'd make a valuable member to our team, what do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With all due respect, general.\" shaking your head, you said. \"I just want to go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that's not possible, Eric.\" said O'Neil, seriously. \"The portal that brought you here is being dismantled as we speak to be studied with a fine toothed comb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?!\" you screamed, standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down!\" yelled O'Neil, startling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou folded your arms in defiance. \"You never had any intention to send me home!\" you accused. \"I'm helping you the best I can, what do you want from me!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit.... down!\" repeated O'Neil, more slowly but also more forceful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrudgingly, you sat down as O'Neil took a breath to calm himself. \"Look, Eric, does your world have anything to match the technology of our world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat question took you off guard and you slowly shook your head. \"No... we haven't even met our first alien yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nO'Neil suppressed a short chuckle. \"Suppose we kept the portal up and managed to send you back home to your world.\" he said. \"The Lucian Alliance has shown interest in Max and Natasha's inventions, they went as far as to kidnap their son to get them on their team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face paled. \"This world's version of me.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nO'Neil nodded. \"As far as we know, that Eric is dead.\" he said. \"The point I'm making is that if the Lucian alliance gets a hold of that portal and learns how it works, they could come to your reality and take over Earth all too easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, your face completely drained of any color and you began to cry. \"So that's it.\" you said. \"I'm stuck in a parallel world with no way home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how hard it is to lose a family.\" said O'Neil, placing a hand onto your shoulder. \"We are keeping you here to protect your world, keep it safe. You can make a difference in this world by helping us keep it safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where would I live?\" yo asked, still crying. \"What would I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nO'Neil sighed. \"You'll live here, at homeworld command.\" he said. \"You're knowledge will make you dangerous to our enemies, they will try to silence you, if they ever learn of you.

The senior members of homeworld command turnd to you, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, what's this about a kid from another universe?\" asked a man you recognized as Cameron 'Cam'  Mitchell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We found an unauthorized gate being constructed and tested.\" glancing at Major Davis, O'Neill said. \"We managed to shut it down, but not before a kid was pulled through.\" he sighed. \"His name is Eric Summers, his world has nothing to compare to ours, we can't take the risk of sending him back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We haven't dealt with another reality in a while.\" said Mitchell, eying you. \"If his world doesn't have anything to compare to ours, why is he here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's more to this, Mitchell.\" pausing, Jack said. \"Our reality is a TV show in his universe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone's jaws dropped, suddenly eying you.

Mitchell occasionally mentioned his Bible-thumping grandmother in comparison and contrast to the Ori religion.

Col. Samantha Carter, stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not everything, Lieutenant Colonel Carter.\" you said. \"The television series focused more on the Stargate missions than anyone's individual private lives.

Don't go blabbing off what you know about anyone unless it is relevant to our current mission and I or Mitchell order you to reveal it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... I understand, sir.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack nodded the gave you a small grin. \"Lighten up, Eric.\" he said. \"We're just covering the ground rules so we can work together as a team and do our job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any information he may have of future threats would be beneficial.\" said Teal'c, quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's already given us a heads up on a Goa'uld, named Ba'al.\" pointing to a folder in front of each team member, Jack said. \"All the data is in the report.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ba'al was in the service of Ra.\" said Teal'c. \"I thought he had perished years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently not.\" replied Jack. \"It seems he has made clones of himself to increase his odds of survival.\" he paused, looking at his team. \"Sam, I'm putting you in charge of looking after Eric.

Once you were out of ear shiot, Jack turned to Sam. \"I picked you to look after the kid because you are the first person he responded to immediately with no back talk or argument.\" he explained. \"I don't know why but he seems to respect you greatly and we need him to stay cooperative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked at Jack, surprised. \"He back talked to a general?\" she asked before giggling. \"I must have some power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack gave Sam a half smile. \"He thinks we're keeping him here as a 'trump card'.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we?\" asked Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll reassign you to a two bedroom dorm.\" said Jack, not answering the question. \"You'll have to make due for tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam walked passed Jack and left the room. \"Come on, Eric.\" she said, taking your wrist. \"I'll escort you to our quarters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am.\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can drop the 'ma'am' crap.\" irritated, Sam stated. \"Just call me Sam, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...

A green light came on, followed by a buzz and the door opened, allowing them to walk inside. \"Rule number two, Never answer the door for anyone when you are alone, I have a key and Jack has a master key, understand?\" you nodded and Sam continued stating the rules...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rule three: If my bedroom door is closed, do not enter before knocking unless you want the beating of your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rule four: Do not go wandering off anywhere without me at your side. There are guards here who, if they do not recognize you, will shoot first and ask questions later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rule five: Even with me with you, do not enter my lab or the gate chamber. The lab is my personal space, I will slap you silly if I catch you in there. As for the gate chamber, remember the guards I mentioned?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped and nodded but did not speak as Sam continued...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rule six:  You will follow my orders immediately and without question as I am in charge of your safety.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, rule seven: For tonight, you sleep on top of the covers while I sleep below them. When we get our own rooms, you will keep your door open at all times unless I order otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, tears forming. \"Yes, Sam... I understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam sighed. \"Look, I know it sucks being trapped on an 'alien' world.\" she said. \"I live with that fear every time we go out on a mission but at least you are on a world you somewhat know and where you can make a differnece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do the best I can, Sam.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam smiled, roughing up your hair. \"I heard you only had those nasty snacks from the vending machines to eat.\" she said, walking into the kitchen area. \"How do you feel about left over stew?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged. \"I'll try anything once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam giggled.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He placed a large folder onto the table in front of them and sat down across from them. \"You two are in serious trouble right now.\" he said, flatly. \"When you left homeworld command, you were caught with blueprints to a gate. After confiscating them, we warned you not to attempt to build your own gate system.\" he paused, looking at them. \"What were you trying to accomplish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We- We were trying to reach our dead son.\" said Natasha in tears. \"Heaven is nothing more than another world, we were trying to reach that world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack shook his head. \"Do you have any idea how insane that sounds?\" he asked. \"Even if it were possible, you could have opened the gates to the other place, dooming us all.\" he then turned to Max. \"Would you like to try to explain this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax sighed. \"We were trying to reach but a world parallel to our own, which we obviously succeeded in doing.\" he said. \"Our goal was to find a world where our counterparts were killed in an attack on homeworld command instead of our children. It was our hope to adopt those childeren and be a family again.\" he paused. \"We were making a test run of the gate when we accidentally locked onto a gate on the other side, we thought it to be a great success.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack sighed, opening the file. \"Well, your great success has marooned a small boy onto our world.\" he said. \"He says that his world has nothing in comparison to our own but he's just a kid so, there's no telling what his world is capable of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will become of our portal, our research?\" asked Natasha, tearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be more worried about what the courts will do with you two.\" replied Jack, standing up. \"You're no longer military but what you did is a threat to our planet, you will be facing a military court.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of our son...\" asked Max. \"Can we see him one more time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack rose to his feet, taking the file with him and opened the door. \"He's not your son.\" he replied, coldly. \"I'm sorry your children died but kidnapping a child won't bring them back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he walked out, slamming the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was really good.\" you said, helping Sam wash dishes. \"You're a pretty good cook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I try.\" replied Sam, smiling. \"Mind if I ask you why you wear your hair so long, you look like a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled. \"A lot of people mistook me for a girl, even with short hair.\" you explained. \"I finally decided to keep my hair long and let them guess for themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam smiled, shaking her head. \"Well, you should at least style it a little. Would you like some help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged. \"If you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam motioned you to a chair as she walked into the other room. As you sat down, she returned with a brush and comb. \"I've seem many a man wearing their hair in a single ponytail.\" he said. \"It will serve to keep the hair out of your face and make you a little more presentable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she began...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Staring back at you was a boy in strange but stylish robes, you guessed them to be alien garments from one of their excursions. Your sand blond hair was tied back into a long, single ponytail, showing your gentle blue eyes which accented your new sprayed on tan very well. For once in your life, as you looked at yourself,you felt more like a boy than a girl. \"Is that... me?\" a smile forming, you asked. \"You did a great job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam giggled slightly. \"It doesn't take much to make you look more masculine.\" smiling, she said. \"All you lack is confidence in yourself. I can probably help you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled more at that but paused as an urgent knock came to the door. \"Who could that be?\" curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay where you are.\" drawing her sidearm, Sam said. \"I'll go see.\" she walked to the door. \"Identify yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Security.\" replied a deep voice. \"I have been orders from O'Neal to tag the boy with a tacking device.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam turned the safety of her weapon to the off position then cautiously opened the door. Only, no sooner the door opened ajar, it was violently pushed open by Max as he charged in. He kicked the gun out of Sam's hand then ran straight for you! \"You need to come with me!\" urgently, he said. \"Its our only chance to get our son back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Step away from the boy!\" landing a firm kick to Max's head, Sam warned. \"Get out while you can still walk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax responded with a powerful right hook to Sam's jaw, sending her stumbling before he then took up a chair and broke it onto her head, stunning her. \"They have my son!\" turning back to you, Max said. \"You can help me get him back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Max approached you, something in your gut told you that he was not who he claimed to be. Then, you remembered that, in one of the series, a device called the Mimetic was used by the Stragoth to mimic the outward appearance of other people, usually used in conjunction with a mimetic thought processor. This device was used to get close enough to their enemy to strike. Alarms sounded everywhere in your head as the knowledge you possessed had already begun to spread and you were a target!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you, a sudden storm had struck outside. The wind blew forcibly as hunting sounds of thunder sounded with lightning streaking menacingly across the sky. Inside, you rose you hands in defense as 'Max' moved to grab you but a powerful force rushed through you and 'Max' was violently thrown across the room and out the door, crashing through the wall into the next room!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her forehead and her cheek were swollen from the blows which she had received during the brief, but violent exchange, which had ended so sudden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEric\u2026 Oh, Eric!\u201d Sam said, as she quickly ran into the kitchen and pulled and ice-pack from the freezer. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine\u2026 I\u2019m just\u2026 a little\u2026 Uhh\u2026 I\u2019m a little shaken up!\u201d you reply, as you\u2019re still trying to process what had happened over the past three minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 Eric\u2026 How\u2026 HOW did you get rid of him?\u201d Sam asked, as she walked up to you while holding an ace pack against the side of her head. \u201cOne minute, he had kicked me in the face\u2026 The next, he went flying across the room and through the wall and\u2026 Out the door!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Sam stared at the hole in the wall as Sam closed and locked the door to the apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped and stared at the wall again, before she glanced over at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2026 How did you do THAT?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 I don\u2019t know! I REALLY don\u2019t!\u201d you say with a trembling voice. \u201cI just wanted him to go away! I wanted him GONE! I wanted him to get OUT THE DOOR!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam squatted down and looked you in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEric\u2026 I think this episode must have unlocked some hidden power that you possess! We must learn more about it! But\u2026 Uhhh\u2026 I got such a headache right now!\u201d Sam groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou gotta lay down, Sam!\u201d you suggest to her. \u201cYour face is swollen!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026 Well, just get some rest, okay? And, don\u2019t open the door!\u201d Sam ordered, as she walked into her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed and turned around, feeling scared and confused. You needed some time alone. Time to think. Time to reflect .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you begin to think about what had happened earlier, when \u2018Max\u2019 tried to kidnap you. You tried to remember what you did. You wanted to repel the attacker. You just wanted to move the man OUT of the house! Then, you remember feeling some great, invisible force awaken from deep within you\u2026 some amazing, invisible but mighty POWER that was unleashed! Max couldn\u2019t do ANYTHING! He was rendered totally helpless against\u2026 this unseen POWER\u2026 which came from deep within\u2026 YOU! This unseen force\u2026 was yours! It came from YOU! You realize that you needed to figure out how to summon it again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat on your bed, looking around the room. You had some toys, small figurines, and a small bowl of grapes on your desk with a spoon and a fork. Sam must have left those on your desk before Max came in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder if you could call upon your power to levitate the porcelain bowl. You frown as you concentrate really hard on the bowl rising above the table. Nothing happens. You\u2019re trying too hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou focus on the glass of water, which sat next to the bowl on the desk. You\u2019re thirsty. Without thinking too hard, you just wish for the glass to come to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it happened!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glass began to rise up from the desk, and it began to float towards your hand. You held your arm stretched out! The glass just floated straight into your hand! You closed your grip, and you held the glass, without ever standing up! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got it! I did it!\u201d you cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drink the water, as you gulp it down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you loosen your grip on the glass. Without concentrating very hard, the glass just hovers out of your hand, and floats back to the desk, and lands next to the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u2026 I got it\u2026 It\u2019s like I\u2019m using my hands and my arms\u2026 but they\u2019re invisible!\u201d you chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you understand this new\u2026 Power! You feel this new talent working in you! You begin to master this amazing new gift! You glance at the bowl, and with no effort at all, the bowl rises up and floats towards you, stopping right by your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fork magically rises up and pierces a grape. Then, it flies out of the bowl and hover in front of your mouth, waiting for you to open wide. Lastly, the fork gently places the grape on your tongue, so you can bite down on it with your teeth. As you do so, the fork pulls out and flies back to the bowl, which is still hovering in mid-air. You take a few minutes to eat your grapes without ever using your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally make the bowl set down on the desk, with the fork in it. You smile, as you feel your power growing within you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head and stare at the dresser which contains your clothing. The dresser drawer opens on its own, and a clean t-shirt, underwear and shorts float out from the drawers and they fly to your bed. The shirt and shorts you\u2019re wearing slide off of your body without you even touching them with your hands!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as you walk over to the bathroom, your clean clothes hover next to you. You feel your power increase at an exponential rate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you stop at the window in the hallway. The lights flicker due to the raging thunderstorm outside. You raise the sliding window and glance outside for a moment. All you see are dark clouds, flashes of light, and the rumbles of thunder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stare at the dark clouds and you imagine them just breaking up, clearing a hole in the sky so that you can see the bright moon and the stars. Then, just as you envision it in your mind, your wish actually comes true!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clouds begin to break apart and the storm begins to leave! It takes only two minutes for the storm clouds to move in all four directions, clearing the sky so that you can now enjoy the bright moon and the stars overhead. Your jaw just drops open as you realize that you had actually caused the weather to change!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way\u2026\u201d you whisper. \u201cNoooooo wayyy! Did I do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly close the window and continue to the bathroom, with your clothes floating right behind you. The shower doors slide open automatically and the bathroom door just closes on its own. You just grin as you realize that it your new powers don\u2019t come with an on/off-switch. Now that you\u2019re doing everything with your cool new telekinetic powers, you don\u2019t know how to stop using them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a quick shower, making the bar soap pass all over your body. The water turned on and off again, without you even touching any of the levers. And, finally, the bath towel just came off the rack on its own, rubbing against your wet body like it was a living object. You just stood there, with your arms hanging from the side, as the towel just dried you off. When you felt completely dried, the towel flew back and hung itself on the rack, like magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clothes floated over to your body and they dressed you! Your body lifted three inches off the floor, so you could put on the underwear and shorts. Finally, the shirt came over your head and pulled over your torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked back to the bedroom, where you made a comic book fly off the bookcase. It opened up to the first page, as it hovered before your head. You had just started to read it, when you noticed that someone was standing in the door opening, looking at you in complete awe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Sam\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was no doubt in your mind that it was her; she had made up her own style of martial arts and her stance was unique to all others. \"Don't you dare touch my son!\" Furious, she thundered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then turned to Sam as she pulled herself to her feet. \"We are working on bridging the gap so we can bring our son home.\" Firmly, she said. \"Any attempt to stop us will be perceived as a hostile act and will be met with a hostile response.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With all due respect, madam; from what your son has told us, your world has nothing to defend itself against our foes.\" With equal firmness, Sam replied. \"Attempting to enter this world may bring certain doom to your world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom chuckled. \"My son knows very little of our world.\" Bemused, she said. \"He has not yet reached the age of reason.\" She then turned to you. \"Hang on, sweetie.\" Cooing, she said. \"Your father and I are working on getting you back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please hurry.\" Wincing, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom turned as dad's voice was heard in the background. \"We have to cut this short, Natasha.\" Disappointed, he said. \"Their world is pulling out of range. We will have another chance when the orbits align again in about a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A week?!\" Frustrated, you wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you again in a week, honey.\" Wincing, mom said. \"Stay strong. We will get you back home, that's a promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom's image then vanished from view. You reached your hand out to where she was, crying then gasped seeing the 'Max' look alike being dragged away by armed soldiers.

Sam sighed then turned to the door to see Jack standing in the hall. \"It seems as if we need to move our guest to a more secure location.\" Frowning, he said. \"I expect a full report from both of you first thing in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, you and Sam were moved into a two bedroom apartment setting.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as you were lead outside by the two military police officers, you began to feel something odd. The strange rays of the sun were having an effect on your body! It was odd, but it was a good effect! You began to feel stronger, in a way. You felt your muscles harden a little bit as you realized that you were becoming stronger\u2026 A lot stronger! Did the rays of the sun have something to do with that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the officers opened the back door of the car and forced you in the back seat, you began to hear several faint voices from the distance. In fact, everywhere you turned your head, you heard voices and sounds which appeared to be coming from miles away! Your hearing suddenly became more amplified, and it seemed to become even stronger with every passing moment. The same counted for your eye sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you stared out the windows of the moving car, you looked at the buildings before you. Whenever you focused on one building, you could see the walls become transparent and you could see everything and everyone who was living inside of that building, from the ground floor to the rooftop! You suddenly had the ability to hear everything and see everything! Nothing could escape you anymore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the car finally stopped, at the end of a short ride, one officer opened your door and signaled for you to come out. Then, the officer grabbed hold of your arm, and led you inside of a large building which appeared to be located on a military base. Inside, you were escorted to a holding cell and locked up behind bars of steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just sat down on a small bed, while your hands were still handcuffed together, wondering when they were going to release you. Finally, one guard walked by and delivered a glass of water and set it down on the table next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to go home!\u201d you said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I have orders to watch you! You must remain here for observation!\u201d the guard replied sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? I didn\u2019t do anything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re an alien being from another world and we must isolate you from the rest of the population!\u201d the guard replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? That\u2019s crazy! You can\u2019t keep me here!\u201d you replied angrily. \u201cIn fact\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you spread your arms farther apart, snapping the chain between the handcuffs! You were just as surprised as the guard, when you realized how easily you broke the steel chain which held your handcuffs together!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarn! Those are cheap handcuffs!\u201d you giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, while using your fingers, you pried the cuffs off your wrists like they were made of thin wire. It almost seemed like they were incredibly flimsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY! You\u2019re not supposed to take those off, young man!\u201d the guard shouted. \u201cNow, I\u2019ll need to get another pair!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard turned around and walked into another room, leaving you by yourself for a moment as you walked up to the metal bars, which were holding you in the cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarn it! I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m being held in here just by these stupid\u2026\u201d you grumble as you grabbed hold of the iron bars, which were running vertical from the ceiling to the floor. The bars were about an inch thick each, and they you grabbed hold of two bars with your hands and you started to press against them out of anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKKKRRRRUUUNNNNCHHHH!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCRAP!\u201d you gasped, as you looked at your hands and realized that you had bent both iron bars with your bare hands! \u201cNo way! No freaking way! Can I be THAT strong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down the hall and realized that the guard had not returned yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you placed both of your hands on one of the bars, and you started pulling it in one direction, realizing that the bar started to bend very easily! Then, you bent the bar right next to it in the opposite direction, creating a wide gap, big enough for you to slip through! Finally, you were able to slide through the gap, and you were free from the cell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold it! FREEZE!\u201d the guard shouted, as he came running towards you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around and head down another corridor when you discover\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Next thing you knew, you saw everything become a blur, and you were standing at the end of the corridor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh! Dead end!

POW!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt something hitting you in the arm, then then shoulder, then your chest\u2026 But it didn\u2019t hurt and you looked down and realized that you weren\u2019t bleeding and there was no wound! Finally, when you looked down at the concrete floor, you spotted three bullets on the floor by your feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShoot him! KILL HIM!

You become very scared, but you realized that nothing can hurt you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you turn towards the wall and you stare at it. The wall becomes transparent and you see the outside sky! Freedom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI gotta get out of here!\u201d you shout, as you extend your arms and place the palms of your hands against the wall and you press as hard as you can. The wall begins to crack and the bricks begin to give way to your superhuman strength as you burst your way through the brick wall with great ease!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump through the hole you just created and you hit the grassy field outside! You begin to run towards a high metal fence! You reach the fence in a matter of seconds but sparks come off the metal the second you touch it. The fence is charged with electricity!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I can\u2019t touch it, then I\u2019ll have to jump over it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a few steps back and run towards the fence and with one mighty leap, with arms extended, you soar over the fence by leaping almost ten feet through the air. But, you never even come down, for you begin to fly through the air! As long as you keep your arms extended, you continue to ascend higher and higher through the air as you fly towards your house!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! I can fly! This is sooooo cool!\u201d you cheer, as you look down at the soldiers, who are still firing their guns at you from the ground, until you\u2019re too far away from them. \u201cThat was just too easy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to fly home, but how long can you stay there until the soldiers come after you again? Why do they want you anyway? Then it dawns on you: You are superhuman and you\u2019re a threat to the military!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On the other hand, it wasn't nice having soldiers shoot at you all the time... like... now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOW!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tabitha! What was that? I think I saw a bullet...\" you say to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOW!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Land! I have to land! Now!\"you say as you take over and make you land on a patch of grass in the middle of a park.\"Somebody's shooting at us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric! I'm scared!\" she says as she begins to tremble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're really not feeling that scared anymore. You know that their bullets can't hurt you. But... What about HER? Then, you turn to face her. You realize that you can at least protect her for a little while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place your hands on her shoulders and a blue force field forms around her like a bubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There! That should hold until the greatest danger is---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOW! POW! POW!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around. There are suddenly three... eight... twelve... No... Twenty soldiers running towards you, carrying rifles! Behind them, and to your left... to your right, and behind you... TANKS! Firing at YOU!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOW POW BAM BOOM BANG POW BOOM BANG RATTATATTA BAM BOOM!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ERIC!!!!!\" Tabitha screams at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me?\" you shout at the soldiers and tanks. \"Come and GET ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your fists and point them at the approaching enemies. Your anger makes them fire plasma blasts at them, causing the first two tanks to blow up into amazing fire balls!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBUZZZZZZZZZ FLOOM!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whhhhhhaaaaah!\" the soldiers scream as their tanks blow up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one you set their tanks on fire, using your plasma beams! Each explosion takes out a set of soldiers as well, and the force of the explosions set the grass and the trees on fire! The entire area is burning everywhere!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you turn around and grab hold of Tabitha. She is trembling, shaking, crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take off, looking down in silence, as you leave behind a scene of total destruction. You know you're really wanted now. You just destroyed the army single-handedly. You're in deep trouble. All you wanted to do right now was hide...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The Characters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric Summers (You): Very shy but kind, you are very small and slender for your age of 13 (4' 0'') with gentle blue eyes and longish dust blond hair. You are often mistaken for a small girl, you have become used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya Summers: (Older sister): An out going, athletic tomboy (15) with wild green eyes and long auburn hair. She stands at a towering 6' and is very protective of you, trying to get you to become more out going. She often takes you with her when she goes out with her friends to keep you safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaximilian Summers (Father): A 35 year old inventor/scientist with short dust blond hair and wild green eyes. He works for the government. building devices to 'benefit' man kind. He never used you to test his inventions but Tonya fears that he will, someday, be tempted. Her fears are realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha Summers (Mother): A muscular 32 year old adventurer/explorer with long auburn hair and gentle blue eyes. She has a passion for risk and danger, she happily tests her husbands inventions for him. (thus your condition) She is constantly trying to make you more adventurous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany Lore (best friend): A feisty/energetic pistol of a girl (13) with long sun blond hair and piercing green eyes who loves you for your gentle nature and is determined to bring out your 'wild side'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrever 'the tank' Powers (Tonya's best friend): Strong and outgoing (15) with crew cut black hair and hazel eyes. He sees Eric as a 'little brother' and strives to make him stronger in hopes that he will grow because of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE RULES:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1: New characters are welcome, this includes Anime characters as long as they go well with the previous chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2: Do not kill the main character and have him work to find his way home unless you intend to have him somehow jump from world to world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3: Try to change Eric's size only by perspective, ie: he is in a world of tiny people or a world of giants making him look like an infant by comparison. Making him younger or older works as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4: Eric's gender can change by what ever means but make it believable. ie: The energy of the portal does it to him, Bethany or Tonya is a witch, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Eric can become fused with an object, pulled in with him but, again, make the reason how it happened believable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's it! Have fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story begins as you accidentally walk into one of your father's experiments in the basement of your house...<br>\r\n</td>",
