Sharing a dorm room with her friend Willow and spending a great deal of her free time hanging out with her closest friend Marianne, Mackenzie balances her school work and social life expertly. This particular day, however, saw the attractive woman sleeping in, finally roused from sleep after the third slap of the snooze button on her alarm clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie had been up late the previous night studying, but that didn't change the fact that she had things to do this morning. Knowing she couldn't stay beneath the covers any longer, Mackenzie slid out of bed, yawning and rubbing are her eyes as she did so. It was a big day, and the redhead had plans to keep to. The first order of business, however, was a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a towel and a basket of shower supplies, Mackenzie stepped out into the dorm halls and sleepily made her way to the bathroom.

She had chosen to look casual for the event, sporting faded blue jeans and a light pink button up blouse. The curvy redhead joined up with a large group of other hopeful girls standing outside the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made some small talk as they waited. Everyone was nervous and no one knew what to expect. This chapter of Epsilon Nu Phi was by far the most popular of the sororities on campus. A few of the current members could be seen exiting the house, wearing pink T-shirts with Greek letters emblazoned on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girls, listen up!\" One blonde girl shouted loudly enough to be heard easily by all. The chatter immediately died down. \"Every year we get a lot of pledges trying to make it into our sisterhood. Because we're the best damn sorority around!\" The other members cheered loudly at that line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we manage to stay that way, by only taking in the best and most determined new blood. So if you really want to be one of us, you're gonna have to show us how badly you want it!\" At this, some of the uninitiated girls around Mackenzie cheered, and she found herself joining in with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad.\" said the blonde who seemed to be in charge, \"Now to get things going, we'll be issuing you all something special. Ladies, this is your first and easiest task for Greek Week. Here is what you'll be wearing for the next five days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the girl stepped aside to reveal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The front garden of the sorority house was not very private and the girls would all be in full view of the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd get a move on if I were you,\" the blonde advised. \"The longer you take, the bigger the audience you'll attract.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls instinctively turned around to see that a small crowd had already gathered at the front fence and more students, mainly boys, were approaching from both directions, obviously aware that something interesting was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the pledges hurriedly began to strip, whilst others just stood around indecisively. A curvy brunette with a rose tattoo on her shoulder was the first to bare all and tried to claim her toga, but the sisters blocked her path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast,\" said the first, a tall, olive skinned beauty with a ponytail of dark hair down to her waist. \"<i>Everyone</i> has to be naked before <i>any</i> of you can collect your togas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you all need to put your clothes into that hamper,\" added the second, indicating a large wicker box to the pledges' right. \"To keep with the Roman theme, anyone wearing sandals can keep them, but any other footwear goes in the box. It'll all be returned at the end of the week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie groaned inwardly at this as she has worn comfortable canvas deck shoes to the meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose girls who had already begun to strip started to encourage the others to join them, as they didn't want to spend any longer naked than absolutely necessary. Within five minutes, twelve of the pledges were in the buff, including Mackenzie, and just three nervous hold-outs steadfastly refused to bare all. As the commotion from the street increased and the growing mass of spectators struggled to get the best footage on their 'phones, Mackenzie decided that something had to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strip them!\" shouted the shapely nude redhead, leaping upon the smallest of the remaining clothed girls and trying to pull off her tank top. As if a dam had broken, the others followed suit, grabbing and quickly overpowering all three. Mere moments later, all the pledges were naked and their clothing safely stored in the sisters' hamper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde sister nonchalantly sauntered over to the box, closed the lid and slipped a padlock through the clasp, while the decidedly less-nonchalant pledges huddled together, trying to hide their charms from the eyes and cameras of the boys on the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited for a full ten seconds, although to the naked girls standing in front of her it seemed more like ten minutes, then said \"Alright, go and get your togas!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie and the others sprinted to the table as if a starting pistol had fired and grabbed the only garments they would be permitted to wear for the next week. Mackenzie was surprised by how light her toga was, but was immediately distracted by being shoved out of the way by the girls coming after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling to one side of the well-manicured lawn, the redhead shook out her toga and saw at once why it had seemed so insubstantial.</span></div></div>",

She swiftly wrapped the toga around her curvaceous body and looked down to see that it was exactly as she had feared: the thin fabric did nothing to conceal her supple flesh and both her pert pink nipples and flame-red landing strip were entirely visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse still, the silky smooth material didn't seem to want to stay put and wasn't quite long enough to tie in place, so she had to grip the hem firmly at all times to stop the toga sliding off her slim frame completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Mackenzie saw that the other pledges were in equally dire straits, having to hold their practically-invisible togas on, making it much harder for them to conceal their intimate secrets. Meanwhile, the sisters were falling about with laughter, delighted at the success of their cruel trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sisters' blonde spokeswoman wiped the tears of mirth from her eyes and told the togate teens to return to the sorority house that evening to learn about their next task. As the embarrassed young women turned to leave the garden, she called after them that they were expected to continue to attend all their usual lectures, classes and extra-curricular activities, including eating in the cafeteria, so hiding in their rooms until the end of the week was not an option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie shuffled out, past the assembled crowd, trying her best to keep the toga on and her pudenda covered, not that she could do anything about her delectable derriere. Groups of boys broke off from the mob to follow the girls as they left, making lewd suggestions and requests. With no shoes, Mackenzie knew that she couldn't escape them.</span></div></div>",

They expected something far more extravagant from the best sorority on campus, and instead all they got was a lousy bracelet. Even the less popular sororities probably got a dress or even something funny like a toga or bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie worked up the courage to ask some of the senior members of the sorority for an explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm excuse me, sorry if this sounds a little vain, but is this seriously it?

You see, these bracelets are the most daring outfit of all Greek Week costumes. Much more than any toga or bikini or whatever else those other sororities think passes for 'risqu\u00e9.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pledges looked at each other once more in confusion. How could a stupid bracelet be more risqu\u00e9 than a bikini??<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, I see you still don't get it. Maybe I haven't made it clear enough for you.\" She continued. \"Pledges, these bracelets ARE the costume, not a mere accessory. For the entire week of Greek Week, these bracelets are the ONLY thing you will be wearing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So wait, what do you mean the bracelet is the only thing we'll be wearing?\" A brunette pledge  named Emily spoke up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean exactly what it sounds like. For the whole week, you will not wear a single other item of clothing or jewelry. No tops, no shirts, no bras, no pants, no shorts, no underwear. Nothing. So basically you will be nude except for the bracelet, and shoes if you so choose.\" the blonde replied with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie's heart sank, while her head filled with dozens of questions.  Are they serious? Is this just a prank? How is this allowed? She looked at her fellow pledges and most were equally as shocked as she was. She hoped this was just some kind of joke and the real costumes would be revealed shortly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell you're all in a  bit in disbelief, so I'll just come out now and say that yes, this is real. We are completely serious about this, girls. If you're wondering how this is allowed, there's a bit of a story. Last year our rival sorority beat  us in the Greek Week costume competition. We thought wearing only togas all week would be enough, but they wore incredibly revealing bikinis, some looked practically invisible. Though we won the whole competition, we knew we had to come up on top again with our costumes. So we called some alumni and they pulled some strings to change the school dress code so that only one item of anything is required to be considered properly dressed. There's no way those bitches at Alpha Zeta would even think of something like this, so with your help there's no way we can lose this thing!\" the Senior blonde girl concluded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pledges were silent. They couldn't believe what they just heard. Walk around campus wearing nothing but a bracelet, and shoes? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for girls? Time to start stripping! It's easier if you get it over with now.\" An older redheaded girl yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie was frozen. She looked around at some of her fellow pledges. Some were just as frozen as she was, some already began taking their clothes off, and a few simply left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're too chicken to show pride in this sorority, that's perfectly okay.\" the blonde called to those leaving. \"But just know, you're kissing your chances of initiation goodbye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie was faced with quite the decision. She desperately wanted to be in this sorority, but could she bring herself to walk to her classes, to the cafeteria, or  anywhere else on campus butt naked? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Mackenzie decided to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Was she seriously going to strut around campus  wearing only a bracelet? How would her friends, classmates, and professors react to her naked body? Mackenzie tried to shove those thoughts away for later as she continued stripping off her clothes. After taking off her jeans, Mackenzie stood for a second in only a bra and panties, before taking those off as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed a few older girls admiring her as her large creamy breasts sprang free from her bra. Mackenzie blushed and instinctively covered, causing one of the girls to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There will be no covering up this week! You must not show embarrassment when representing our sorority. Keep your head high and your arms away from your chest and crotch at all times.\" The girl spoke to all the pledges, but this was clearly addressed to Mackenzie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gulp, Mackenzie uncovered her boobs and slowly removed her panties, resisting the urge to cover her pussy as it came into view. Now she was standing stark naked  with about fifteen other equally naked freshmen, nervously anticipating what was to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! We're so proud of all of you for making it this far!\" The older blonde beamed. \"Now come up and receive your bracelet for this week. I must remind you, you are to remain naked except for this bracelet AT ALL TIMES, no exceptions. You must have perfect attendance this week, or your initiation will be delayed, until which you will remain naked. You will confirm your attendance by taking a selfie with at least 3 other classmates, and it must be clear you are wearing the proper 'costume'. We have all of your class schedules, so we'll know if you're telling the truth. Also, you must eat at the cafeteria at least once a day. We're trying to make sure no one hides in their room the whole week so no one sees them. Is this all clear?\" she concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one the girls stepped forward to receive their bracelets, and Mackenzie couldn't help but check each of them out as they did so. Finally Mackenzie walked up to receive her bracelet, her breasts lightly bouncing with each step. Mackenzie groaned as she realized everyone she knew on campus was about to see her perfect bouncing tits as she walked to class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter every girl received her bracelet, the older blonde spoke for the last time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome, I can't wait to see how you all fare this coming week. Remember, selfie for every class and absolutely no covering. Be proud of your bodies, they're what got you this far! Now it's time for you to head back to your dorms, good luck!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie was dumbfounded at what had transpired. She had just stripped naked for a sorority and now was going to walk back to her room in her birthday suit! Not to mention the rest of this week! She looked around for her clothes, maybe this wasn't such a great idea, but she watched in horror as a couple of the older girls started picking up everyone's clothes! She didn't want to appear weak now, so Mackenzie reluctantly accepted her naked fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie walked towards the front door of the sorority house, took one big breath, and stepped outside to the cool fall evening. She slowly made the trek back to her room, which was only about a ten minute walk from the sorority house but would feel like hours. Though there was no one else around at this time except for the other equally naked pledges, Mackenzie still had to fight the urge to cover herself, and grit her teeth as she put her boobs and labka on full display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she encounter anyone else on her walk back to her dorm?</span></div></div>",

Whoever had a lower test score was the loser. Of course, since it was possible for both of them to get the same score, the tie condition was that they'd both have to take the loser's forfeit.

Mackenzie couldn't run quite as fast as she'd have liked, lest her skirt fly up too much, and one hand pressed firmly over the front of her skirt helped to keep that under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Mackenzie pushed open the front doors of the building it was hard to tell if she was still wet from the shower or wet from the sweat of her unplanned sprint across the school grounds. Mackenzie's breaths were starting to come out in ragged pants as her legs carried her to her classroom, and she knew she must have been quite a sight as she stepped into the classroom with mere seconds to spare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry... overslept...\" Mackenzie managed between pants, trying her best to ignore the odd looks the professor and class were giving her as she grabbed a copy of the test and turned to find a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe classroom was in a theater layout, with the seats arranged in ascending semicircular rows with the teacher's desk and board at the bottom and center of it all. Being the last person to arrive, Mackenzie had the worst seat left open for her, in the highest row and directly in front of the professor's desk. With her short skirt and nothing else below her waist, Mackenzie was sharply aware of how dangerous a seat like this was, but she really had no choice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking her seat, Mackenzie made a point to remember to keep her legs clamped firmly together and focus completely on her test. The test was likely the only thing that kept people from whispering to each other about her state of dress. After all, it wasn't every day a person with Mackenzie's figure traipsed into class without a proper shirt on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe test was all that should matter, Mackenzie told herself. Just focus on it, finish it and hand it in, and then get back to the dorm and get dressed properly. This would all be over soon enough, and it'd just be an embarrassing memory she can hopefully laugh about later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't meant to be, however, as things began to take a turn for the worse for the half-dressed beauty.

She was standing in the middle of the crowded lecture hall completely bottomless! All eyes in the room were on Mackenzie, now wearing only a bra, still standing by her seat in the top row.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping out of it, Mackenzie whirled back to her seat and the skirt stuck to it. She began frantically trying to yank the skirt free, not realizing that she was now offering the entire room an unobstructed view of her ass as she did so. Despite her valiant efforts to free the clothing, Mackenzie only managed to rip it further to shreds with her haphazard yanks and tugs. All that she managed to get free from the wood were a few small scraps of cloth totally incapable of providing any sort of cover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now the stunned silence of the classroom had given way to laughter and even a few cheers. Only the rule against having cell phones out during a test kept Mackenzie's plight from being filmed by the scores of onlookers. Mackenzie finally gave up on the skirt and began running for the exit, one hand clamped over her pussy, the other holding her test in front of her ass. She dropped the test on her teacher's desk, relinquishing her only other meager form of cover, while the teacher desperately tried to quit down the energized students. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie burst through the door and into the hallway, which was mercifully empty at the moment. The bra-clad beauty continued her sprint, eager to get back to her dorm room. As the exit came into view, Mackenzie had to make a split second decision. She could take the most direct route back, which would take her outside through the bustling quad. Or, she could take the longer way back by going through the underground tunnels. They were bound to be far less populated than the quad at this time of day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie made up her mind and headed for the...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She continued her sprint, her exposed skin quickly drawing the attention of the many nearby students. With her hands still trying to cover both her pussy and her ass, there was no way Mackenzie was able to cover her face. She simply kept her head down and barreled through the quad as best she could. This time there was nothing to stop those around her from pulling out their phones and recording Mackenzie's predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie tried to block out the shouts and taunts from the people around her. But she did manage to catch a few.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Check out the naked girl!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got a streaker!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even one particularly loud shout of \"Raise those hands, baby!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for the redhead, both her hands were occupied and she was running at a full sprint. This meant her breasts were bouncing significantly, and her bra was left to take the full force of those bouncing breasts. In her rush to dress this morning, Mackenzie had grabbed one of her older bras. It was one that had seen plenty of wear and tear and now it was paying the price. Mackenzie was about halfway back to her dorm when the bra's clasp was finally pushed beyond its limit. It burst, releasing Mackenzie's breasts from their constraint. The opened bra immediately fell down Mackenzie's arms and came to a stop around her forearms, exposing her tits to the ever growing crowd. This elicited a louder round of cheers and Mackenzie's embarrassment redoubled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no time to refasten the bra, Mackenzie simply moved her right hand from covering her backside to covering her boobs, slipping her right arm out of the bra strap in the process. This left the bra dangling between her legs, hanging solely from one strap around her left wrist, since her hand was still clamped in front of her pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie couldn't believe that she was essentially streaking her college campus like this! She was almost at her dorm building now and was entirely focused on just making it inside. She made a beeline for the entrance, jumping over a small bush beside the path. Mackenzie gasped as her left hand was yanked away from her womanhood as the bra strap was swiftly pulled down her wrist.. She had cleared the bush fine, but the dangling bra had gotten hooked among the branches. Mackenzie didn't even think about turning at this point. The dorm entrance was just in front of her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Mackenzie was completely naked as she sprinted to the door. Dozens of students cheered and laughed at the nude beauty who was just barely managing to keep her most intimate parts covered from the crowd. But as she finally reached the door, she had to remove her arm from her chest to quickly yank the door open. A few surprised onlookers inside caught the sight of Mackenzie's bared breasts as she rushed past them into the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to risk an elevator ride, Mackenzie ran to the stairwell instead. She was finally out of the public eye as it was blessedly empty inside. Not daring to slow down, Mackenzie continued her run up the stairs. She was completely out of breath as she reached her floor and stepped out into the hallway. Her slight bit of good luck continued and the dorm hallway was empty too. Mackenzie gave a huge sigh of relief as she finally made it to her dorm room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naked young woman reached for the doorknob and discovered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The pink, flowery garment in her hands was what Mackenzie would call an oversized sweater, though her great aunt insisted on calling it a jumper for whatever reason. It had been a gift, as most disastrous wardrobe items were, and meant for winter wear. The fabric was thick and itchy wool, meant to be worn as an outermost layer, not as a dress over bare skin and certainly not in warmer weather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, that was exactly what it would have to be if Mackenzie was going to get to her test in time. Slipping her feet into a pair of sandals as she hoisted the garment over her head and slid it on, Mackenzie grimaced at the scratchy, itchy fabric rubbing against her skin. This was going to be the most uncomfortable test of the redhead's life, by the way things were feeling. Even worse, the weather had been particularly warm and sunny lately, and the thick fabric of the jumper was already starting to feel a bit stifling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to push the discomfort out of her head, Mackenzie made a beeline for the exit door, hear thoughts and gaze fixed on the building she needed to reach for her test.

With a shaky grip, Mackenzie placed her hands on Willow's thighs and guided her forward to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow's lips were already wet, and Mackenzie couldn't help but contemplate the taste on her tongue. Salty, and a tad sour, but not unpleasant. It certainly wasn't the worst taste Mackenzie had ever experienced. The redhead might have been inexperienced in giving oral pleasure, but she still seemed to have enough instinct to get Willow moaning in short order. The bisexual girl straddling Mackenzie's head began to rock her hips back and forth against Mackenzie's tongue, running her lips up and down her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie, meanwhile, was trying to figure out why she felt herself getting turned on by the sounds of Willow's moans, the feeling of her soft thighs, the musky scent of her wet entrance. Mackenzie could feel her heart beating faster, a warmth growing in her own loins despite their recent climax. Was she... was she really enjoying this? She hadn't been with a woman before, not counting that drunken night between her and Willow. While they had only kissed, Mackenzie couldn't actually remember the events clearly due to the booze. Convinced of her sexuality, she assumed it was just the alcohol at work, and she couldn't have possibly enjoyed it that much. Yet, with her body's reaction now, was the truth possibly different?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie pondered this, her tongue eagerly working away at Willow's core. She had to get her off fast...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mackenzie really did try to bring herself over the edge.  She worked her fingers with desperate fervor in an attempt to climax before it was too late.  She knew that having something, anything decent to wear was better than just a towel, which would be a glorified streak across campus to her test.  She tried to fixate her gaze on her own body, with her hands stimulating her wet snatch and swollen nipples, and imagine she was alone in her room having this private moment in actual privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as much as she wanted to put herself in that headspace, she knew that her roommate was just at the foot of her bed, watching her like a cat as she not only exposed herself, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just too embarrassing!  Mackenzie couldn't help but look over on occasion, and the sight of Willow looking back at her with that stare of hers, it just made her too nervous.  Stage fright was a real thing when you were well-prepared, and Mackenzie was anything but well-prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, Mackenzie was finding herself alone in her head and finally coming close to the edge.  Nobody here but herself on which to focus her pleasure...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust focus on the pleasure, and on release...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mack, you might wanna check the clock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow's comment was accompanied by her cool hand on Mackenzie's thigh, snapping her out of her thoughts in a flash.  Mackenzie barely opened her eyes, nothing left on her mind but her labored breathing and a fleeting sense of something precious nearly had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why, I was so close...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow looked over the shameless sight of her roommate. The nude but properly embarrassed girl of just a few minutes ago had been replaced entirely. Mackenzie was now panting visibly, her legs splayed widely in a lewd display of her sensitive breasts and wet crotch.  The fingers of her left hand were still absently working their way in and out of herself as they had been at a much faster pace just a few moments prior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good look for you, but you might want to cover up and head out if you want to get to class on time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie's already flushed face turned an even deeper shade of red as she quickly did her best to cover herself.  In truth, her hands didn't have to move far from where they already were.  She averted her gaze to the clock, partly to avoid making eye contact with Willow, and gasped.  The clock showed that 10 minutes had gone by from when she had begun masturbating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?  No!  Willow, why didn't you tell me I was taking so long?\"  Mackenzie scrambled to her feet and grabbed her shoes, abandoning all modesty in favor of speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seemed like you were so close, and I was rather enjoying the show, so I guess I let things drag on a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie was only half paying attention, this was a serious problem.  She had just 5 minutes to get to a class that was 10 minutes away at a brisk walk's pace.  Class technically started 5 minutes ago, but her professor gave her students a little more time to file in on important dates such as these.  She'd cut it close before but had never had to run the entire length there.  She'd have to j-walk both campus lanes and hope not to get run over at this time of the day, she'd have to cut through the cafeteria and rudely push her way through half the lunch line, and she'd have to actually run through an auditorium class in session to get through a building instead of going around it, not to mention she...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie caught herself standing in front of the mirror, gazing at first into her own eyes, then further down.  Her perky breasts sat brazenly in view, unrestrained by any form of cover.  Between her hips, also covered only by absolutely nothing, were her moist lower lips, still glistening with fluid that trailed down her inner thighs.  The only clothes she did have on were her shoes and socks, sitting outside the frame of the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Not to mention she was still naked!  She couldn't leave the dorm room like this, much less cross campus to take an exam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Willow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I really need them here, I don't have much time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you shouldn't have spent so much time enjoying yourself on the bed.  You know the terms,\"  Willow said, lazily manipulating in her hands the bath towel Mackenzie was wearing earlier.  It was clear that despite the redhead's plight, her roommate was not going to budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie was angry at Willow for taking advantage of the situation.  Mackenzie was flustered about her nude state being magnified by her having to beg for clothing.  Mackenzie was even more embarrassed than before at that jab at her \"enjoying herself.\"  But Mackenzie was definitely out of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-Fine, just... give me the towel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you don't want to make the trip in the buff?  That might be fun, yeah?  Goodness knows you're worked up enough, the sexual tension might propel you to speeds you didn't know you had.  If you don't cum somewhere in transit and pass out nude on the grass, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give it to me Willow, fuck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie took two large strides over to her roommate and snatched the towel out of her hands, her breasts swaying unrestrained throughout the motion.  Blushing, Mackenzie pretended not to notice as she wrapped the towel around herself and made her way to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't going to be the last time we talk about this, Willow!\" She said, as she exited their dorm room with a slam of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chill struck her instantly.  Mackenzie rubbed her bare arms with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-c-cold.\" Mackenzie looked at the thermometer on the porch.  52 degrees Fahrenheit wasn't too off the mark for this time of year, and properly dressed, she would enjoy this weather.  The redhead was not properly dressed this morning, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need to get moving...\" Mackenzie told herself as she set off for her class at a jogging pace.  It was the only way she was going to get there on time, but she knew that her lower body was on the verge of exposure with every step she took.  Mackenzie didn't have to look, the breeze told her that.  Whether her intimates were on the verge of exposure or past that point...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did not have the heart to check and confirm that, she needed to have an optimistic mindset right now.  That would be hard to maintain, however, as...</span></div></div>",

It would not do for not only her classmates, but the teachers to see her in this state. As much as Willow liked having fun with her, she assumed that the girl had <i>too much</i> fun at her expense, which was telegraphed in how she was dressed currently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing in defeat, Mackenzie strode down the corridor, making little jumps at every sound, thinking it was another person. Always seeing that it wasn't, she took her hand away from her chest in order to calm her heart, but it was hard to do with her heightened senses. As she strode however, she kept mentally telling herself not to worry and she'd get through this, then be out before anything really happened to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an inner monologue she shouldn't have started, because her fears of people being around her were true. Case in point, when Mackenzie had exited the dorm in just her towel, Willow had decided to follow her friend with some extra planning in mind. Sure it might come across as a little mean, but with Mackenzie so self-conscious about her beautiful figure, she enjoyed embarrassing her red-headed friend. Keeping Mackenzie from seeing her though was a difficult thing to do, because numerous times she knew Mackenzie's nerves were firing strongly within her to make her so high strung. Giggling softly to herself, Willow admired the red-head's swaying hips and the tight butt just barely covered beneath the towel that was the sole clothing for the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAS Mackenzie reached her classroom, she closed her eyes briefly, hoping desperately no one would comment on her clothing. It was an almost impossible hope to come true, but she desperately wished it would, for she couldn't stand it if her undressed state were to be made known to everyone. Even worse, she might risk getting kicked out for indecency and that would be the end of her college days!<br>\r\nLetting out a breath she had been holding, Mackenzie opened the door and strode through, her eyes instantly locking onto her classmates. For all intents and purposes though, she need not have worried, for everyone was too engrossed in the test, teacher included, to pay much attention to the barely dressed girl. Smiling slightly, Mackenzie went over to her own desk, and sat down, then quickly began to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to her, Willow had snuck in behind her, and chosen a seat directly behind Mackenzie in order to tease her more. Taking all her clothes in the dorm wasn't enough for her, as she wanted to see that pretty red-headed form nude in more places. Smiling to herself, she waited for the perfect opportunity...</span></div></div>",

She was facedown, with the sheets only partially covering her - and what made Mackenzie stop was the fact that she was obviously naked. Her back was angled towards the wall, but the arm that dangled over the edge of the bed was bare, as was her entire shoulder, and the leg and hip that wasn't covered by the sheets showed that she wasn't wearing anything on the bottoms, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow had never slept nude before. She must have gotten pretty drunk last night or something. As Mackenzie stared at her naked roommate - ogling slightly, she had to admit, Willow <i>was</i> a looker - an evil idea occurred to her. <i>No, I couldn't do that, that'd be too mean...but on the other hand, when am I going to get another opportunity like this...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl shifted in bed, now lying on her back with her hips swiveled alluringly, one hip draped over the other. She was still covered by the sheets, but it was enough to make Mackenzie give in to temptation. Her heart thumped in anticipation as she tip-toed to the door, clutching her towel to damp body, then took a deep breath to steady herself. She opened the door, looked quickly out into the hall to make sure no one was around, and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Willow! Come quick! You have to see this!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an audible yelp, Willow was shocked awake, sitting bolt upright in bed, holding the sheets to her breasts. \"Wh-what?\" she exclaimed blearily, her long brown sleep-mussed hair in her eyes. \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a naked girl out in the hall! Somebody played a prank on her or something! Come on, come look!\" Mackenzie waved to her eagerly, pointing to the hallway. \"Quick, before she runs away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all Willow needed to hear. \"No way!\" she laughed, wrapping the sheet around her as a makeshift covering and jumping out of bed, now jolted wide awake by the promise of being proxy to another girl's public embarrassment. \"Was it the sorority, maybe? I heard they get a kick out of doing that kind of stuff!\" Running over to stand at the doorway next to Mackenzie, half-tripping on the trailing sheets, she peered out into the hall eagerly. \"Where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie moved behind her, a wicked smile on her face. \"Right...<i>there!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the back of Willow's sheet and <i>yanked</i> with all her might. Surprised, Willow's lost her grip instantly, and Mackenzie pulled them completely off and threw them away behind her, now treated to the sight of Willow's naked and curvy behind. Pressing the element of surprise, Willow barely had time to screech before Mackenzie planted a foot on her bare butt and pushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow was kicked into the hall, colliding with the door on the opposite side of the hall. \"<i>Mackenzie! No!</i>\" she screamed, spinning around, only to see a grinning Mackenzie slam the door in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly she heard Willow pounding frantically on the door. Mackenzie managed to turn the lock a split second before Willow tried the knob, and she heard a gasp of horror from her friend. \"Mackenzie! This isn't funny, I'm naked! Let me in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie was having trouble laughing, she was giggling so hard, but she managed to say \"Actually, it's funny <i>because</i> you're naked! I told you there was a naked girl in the hall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Mackenzie! Someone's going to see me!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you?\" More ideas began to come into Mackenzie's head. Just how mean did she feel like being...? \"I tell you what, I'll let you back in if you do something for me!\"</span></div></div>",

You can either knock on someone's door and have them see you naked for a second, or you can stay out there all day and have the whole building see you naked. Maybe somebody'll be nice and give you clothes...but I wouldn't bet on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother moment of silence passed, and Mackenzie could tell Willow was doing furious calculations in her head. They both knew that the girls in this building would find Willow's predicament hilarious - Willow herself had found it hilarious when she had thought it was happening to somebody else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Fine!</i>\" Willow's exclamation was so sudden it startled Mackenzie. \"I'll do it!

Then, covering her nudity with her arms as best she could, she half ran, half tip-toed to the nearest door and knocked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Willow was back at the door to their room. \"There!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Willow raised her head to look at the new witness to her humiliation, the first thing her gaze focused on was a pair of large and perfectly shaped breasts, held in a tight black tank top that showed just enough cleavage to be jaw-dropping without being outright scandalous. <i>No. Oh no.</i> Her legs turned to jelly. She recognized those breasts, from having snuck countless covert peeks at them when she thought their owner wasn't looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing her gaze away from the other girl's endowments, she looked with dread to see the single person in the entire world she least wanted to see her like this. It was Beth - the head cheerleader, and, as far as Willow was concerned, the most beautiful girl in the world. Curvaceous and stunning, with a body that turned heads everywhere she went and golden-brown hair that fell almost to her waist, Beth was truly beautiful. At the moment, her pretty face was frozen in an expression that showed a mixture of surprise and confusion. \"Um...yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guh,\" said Willow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth blinked. \"Can I...help you with something?\" She looked down at Willow's body, her privates hidden only by her trembling arms. Willow cringed. \"Why are you naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muh,\" said Willow, shaking from head to toe. Her race was beet-red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you, I think,\" said Beth thoughtfully. \"Wanda or something, right? Winona?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Willow,\" managed Willow, stammering past the lump in her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Willow. Um, Willow...why are you naked and knocking on my friend's door? I was just here to help her study, is it her you're looking for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in their room, Mackenzie was straining her ears to listen eagerly to every word they were saying. She could hardly believe her luck. It was <i>Beth?</i> Beth, who Willow had the biggest crush in the world on? Willow was naked in front of Beth? Her sides were shaking with suppressed laughter - she was never, ever going to let Willow live this one down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow was still trying to talk, with mixed results. She had literally had nightmares about being naked in front of Beth. Now it was happening - but she wasn't going to wake up from this one. \"R-roommate. M-my roommate. Um. Locked me out. N-n-naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Beth blinked her long eyelashes again. \"Played a prank on you, did she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah. Sh-she made me knock on your door, or she w-would leave me stuck out here. You know. Like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas that sympathy on Beth's face. \"Yeah, I've been there. When I first joined the cheerleader squad, they put me through a little hazing ritual that involved stripping me naked, tying my hands behind my back, and making me streak the whole campus during the busiest time of the day.\" She flushed pink at the memory. \"Not that they told me about it in advance, of course - they wanted it to be a surprise. I don't think they liked me much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow felt her nipples instantly stiffen under her arm. The thought of Beth being paraded around naked in front of a whole crowd of people was...exciting to her, she had to admit. Then she remembered that she was the one who was naked right now, and standing right in front of Beth, and she squeaked and hugged herself tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth seemed to notice the change in her demeanor, but didn't react other than raising her eyebrows almost imperceptibly. \"Anyway, now that you've knocked on my door and talk to me, will your roommate let you get dressed now?\" Yawning, she stretched, which did things to her breasts that made the already-flustered Willow's eyes almost pop out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She better,\" mumbled Willow miserably. Talking to Beth should be the best thing that ever happened to her, but instead it was the most humiliating experience of her entire life. The only thing right now that was keeping her from wanting to sink into the floor and never be seen again was the desire to get revenge on Mackenzie. Slow, nasty revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey approached the door Willow and Mackenzie's, and Beth reached over and knocked, saving Willow from having to uncover her breasts or crotch to do it herself. She nearly fainted at the kindness of the gesture. <i>Does she like me? Maybe she likes me!</i> \"Hey, you in there?\" called Beth. \"She's knocked on my door and I've seen her naked and stuff, she's pretty embarrassed. You can let her back in now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had already gone far better than Mackenzie had ever dared to hope. She'd humiliated Willow enough for one day.

Stepping aside, she leaned against the doorframe to allow Willow to enter. \"No hard feelings, Will. Just a little fun. It's not like you wouldn't think this was hilarious if it had happened to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth had been silent throughout this exchange, but as she cast her one last timid glance before rushing inside, Willow saw that she was staring at Mackenzie with an odd look in her eye. Her mouth was smiling, but her eyes were...calculating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since her humiliation at the hands of her fellow teenagers, Beth had hated bullies. Being forced to run through campus naked had instilled in her a sympathy for underdogs, and a deep dislike for the kinds of girls who got off on embarrassing other people. Admittedly Beth didn't know Willow particularly well, but she seemed cute, and as far as Beth knew she hadn't done anything to deserve being locked out of her room with no clothes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn other words, Beth was thinking about bringing a little karma to bear.</span></div></div>",

Willow flinched, not expecting the sudden contact, and stiffened as Beth leaned in close to whisper to her - so close that Willow could feel her breath tickle her ear, and smell her sweet scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come talk to me tomorrow,\" whispered Beth. \"I want to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she released Willow's arm and turned around without another word, walking casually back to her room, her long hair swishing behind her.

Beth saw me naked!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie shrugged, trying not to crack up. \"So what? Nothing she hasn't seen before! Besides,\" she now failed to keep the laughter from breaking through, \"you needed to work up the nerve to talk to her anyway! So when you think about it like that, I actually helped you out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow was grabbing random clothes from the pile on the floor and pulling them on as quickly as she could. \"You're going to pay for that,\" she hissed as she lay on her back trying to yank a pair of skinny jeans over her hips, her bare breasts shaking with the effort. \"I swear to God you're going to pay for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please.\" Mackenzie waved a hand dismissively as she picked up her own clothes and headed back into the bathroom to get dressed. \"Just admit I won and get over it. It was just a prank, Will - not that big of a big deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Willow was trembling again, but not from humiliation this time. She was trembling because she was having coffee with Beth, and this time it was like a dream come true instead of a nightmare. They were sitting in a corner booth of the campus cafe, and Beth was wearing tight pants and a sleeveless blouse with several buttons undone, exposing quite a lot of-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. My eyes are up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, Willow jerked her gaze up guiltily. \"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth took a sip of coffee. \"So like I was saying, it was really shitty what your friend did to you. I've been there, and I know from experience that it's not fun to be paraded around naked in public. Only I didn't have the option of covering up. And there were a lot more people watching.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow blushed redder, trying not to shiver with excitement as she pictured this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what I'd like to do is help you get even. Give Madison a taste of her own medicine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mackenzie,\" Willow corrected, almost apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. Basically what I'm saying is, if you're up to it, I'll help you prank Madeline back. And if you want,\" Beth leaned in and spoke in a murmur, \"we can make it ten times worse than what she did to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thrill passed over her.

Mackenzie knew from experience that she was on a scavenger hunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what is it you need for your hunt?  A pool towel?  A spare flotation board?\" Mackenzie asked calmly, wondering what made her classmate so nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I--um, no.  What I need... for this scavenger hunt is... your swimsuit.  Or a spare lifeguard swimsuit.  It doesn't have to be wet or--um, your size or anything,\" the coed said while red-faced; apparently, she was embarrassed by the request as well as by the redheaded lifeguard's beauty and shapely body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Mackenzie said, as she looked at her dainty feet and felt her cheeks starting to blush too.  She knew the swimsuit she had on was the last one available for now, since the rest had been taken to the laundry room by the flirtatious custodian, Sota.

This made Mackenzie not notice Pedro, Jasmine's teammate, peek around the corner and admire her well-rounded booty.

I just needed a way to lure you in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-\" was all Mackenzie had time to say before hands grabbed her from behind.

Twisting her head around as she fought, she saw that she was being pinned down by several grinning college-age girls. The blonde was watching with obvious satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this? Who are you?\" Mackenzie demanded, struggling. \"Let go of me, I'm the lifeguard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde walked over to squat beside Mackenzie, looking her right in the face. \"Hi, Mackenzie!\" She beamed. \"Recognize me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie frowned, nonplussed. \"Nooooo...should I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably. I'm Sarah - from your trig class?\" She was still smiling, but now two spots of color were reddening her cheeks. \"Last year, you and your sorority friends thought it would be funny to lock me outside wearing nothing but my panties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't...oh wait, I remember now! You were wearing a pink thong. And you had to run all the way home like that! Everybody saw you, pictures got on the Internet and everything.\" Mackenzie giggled at the memory, and immediately regretted it when Sarah's smile vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well,\" continued Sarah, blushing harder now as her past humiliation was revisited. \"I remember you thought that was awfully funny then too. I wonder...is it still funny when it happens to <i>you?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bottom dropped out of Mackenzie's stomach. She barely had time to get out a <i>\"noooo!\"</i> before she felt hands yanking the straps of her swimsuit off her shoulders. She was pulled upright and her arms were worked out of the straps despite her protests. Sarah, looking Mackenzie dead in the eye, reached out a hand to grip the front of her swimsuit, wink, and say \"Payback time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she yanked down with both hands, pulling Mackenzie's swimsuit all the way down to her thighs. Mackenzie screamed again as she felt a shock of cold air over her entire now-naked body, her round breasts and mostly-shaven crotch totally exposed. Sarah took advantage of her shock to pull her swimsuit completely off. Mackenzie was now fully nude from head to toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to cover herself, but her arms were still being held by Sarah's friends, and she wound up doing nothing but making her bare breasts jiggle as she struggled. \"Let me <i>go!</i> This isn't funny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure thought it was funny when you did it to me! This is just a little cosmic balancing of the scales.\" Sarah folded her arms and surveyed Mackenzie with satisfaction. \"Question is...now what?\"</span></div></div>",

Fortunately for Mackenzie, all of them knew how to swim perfectly well, which meant that there wasn't a whole lot for her to do right now. An hour or so ticked by with her spending more time on her phone than paying attention to the poolgoers, and she was starting to fall into a bored reverie when suddenly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEEEEK! NOOOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJolting upright, Mackenzie looked for the source of the woman's shriek, thinking someone must be drowning after all. There was what looked like some sort of commotion happening over at the deep end of the pool, but no one seemed worried. In fact, everyone seemed to be laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Mackenzie jumped down from her lifeguard's seat and ran over to see what was happening. Getting closer, she saw a small group of girls in swimsuits standing at the poolside who seemed to be laughing at a girl in the pool - an attractive young woman with dark brown hair, who was treading water and hugging herself awkwardly for some reason. One of them was holding something in the air just out of her reach, and Mackenzie recognized it as...<i>oh.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bikini top. The girl in the water was topless, and trying her best to cover her breasts with her arms. \"Come on!\" Mackenzie heard the girl holding the top say, waving it over the topless girl mockingly. \"Come on out! Come and get it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" pleaded their victim, red-faced. \"This isn't funny guys, give me back my top! Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Angie, I think it's pretty funny,\" said the girl holding her top, eliciting enthusiastic assent from the others. \"Now come on out of the water! Don't you want your top back? Or would you rather that we come in there and take your bottoms, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody was paying much attention to Mackenzie. The girl in the water - Angie - was too focused on attempting to preserve her modesty, and her \"friends\" were occupied with thoroughly enjoying her embarrassment. Mackenzie had a feeling that as lifeguard, she had a responsibility to try and do something to help the half-naked girl...but at the same time, a slightly cruel part of her wanted to see how this would play out...</span></div></div>",

And the girl <i>was</i> awfully cute...she would probably be even cuter if she was naked and panicking in front of a whole crowd of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFolding her arms under her breasts but otherwise unmoving, Mackenzie grinned, eager to see what would happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last chance, Angie!\" sang the girl holding the top. \"Are you going to come out, or are we going to have to come in there and get you? If that happens, I can't guarantee that your bottoms will make it out with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe threat seemed to work. \"<i>Okay!</i>\" said Angie, red-faced. \"I'm...I'm coming out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping one arm clamped firmly over her breasts as best she could, Angie gripped the grab rail with her other hand and slowly hauled herself out of the water. She was met with a chorus of cheers as she straightened up, dripping wet and topless, moisture shining on her mostly-bare body. \"You win, okay Sarah?\" she said to her friend with a slight tremor in her voice. \"You got me. Very funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I did get you pretty good, didn't I?\" said Sarah, looking her up and down. \"I guess you probably want your top back now, huh? That was pretty funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding furiously, Angie stretched out a hand for it. Mackenzie noticed with appreciation that one arm wasn't exactly adequate for fully covering her bare breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething seemed to occur to Sarah. \"But you know what would be even funnier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngie barely had time to register dread before Sarah ripped off her bikini bottoms. Angie shrieked, and for a moment her entire nude body was on display for the crowd of spectators as she forgot to cover herself. Recoiling, she tried to cover her breasts with one arm and her crotch with her other hand, but the crowd was encircling her now and her round bottom was fully exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie had her hands clapped over her mouth, her eyes glittering with glee. And to think she had thought this job would be boring. It wasn't every day that she saw someone get stripped totally naked in public - and best of all, it wasn't her this time.</span></div></div>",

Whipping it off the chair, Mackenzie danced backwards, waving the towel at the naked Angie. \"What, you want this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it!\" gasped Angie, horrified. \"Just give it to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie caught Sarah's eye and saw that the other girl was looking at her with surprised delight.

Another few moments, and Angie might actually be stripped naked in public. Conscience won out - or possibly just Mackenzie's desire to not lose her lifeguard gig.

Reflexively, Mackenzie threw up her arms to try to protect her face, but this proved a serious error as Angie wasn't going for her face. Straddling her on the ground, Angie grabbed the front of her one-piece swimsuit and, without hesitation, pulled it all the way down to Mackenzie's waist, exposing her entire torso. Shrieking, Mackenzie tried to fend her off with one hand while preserving her modesty with the other, but was unable to break Angie's grip on her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strip her! Strip her! Strip her!\" the crowd chanted. Angie was trying to wrestle Mackenzie's swimsuit down over her hips, but was having trouble with it since Mackenzie was lying on her back on the ground. Seeing an opportunity, Mackenzie grabbed a fistful of Angie's brown hair and yanked, causing the other woman to finally release her grip and paw at Mackenzie's hand in pain. Rolling her body forcefully to the side, Mackenzie threw her off and scrambled to her feet, a few strands of hair still caught in her first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie tried to use the moment to fix her swimsuit and cover her breasts, but Angie was back on her in a second, this time managing to get her in a headlock from behind, forcing her down to one knee. The back of Mackenzie's head was sandwiched in between Angie's bare breasts as she struggled to break free. Angie was once again tugging at her swimsuit, trying to finish stripping her entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One swimsuit - two chicks!\" shouted Sarah from the sidelines. \"Who gets to wear it? Place your bets, ladies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pinching pain shot through Mackenzie's breast as Angie suddenly gave up on trying to get her swimsuit off and instead grabbed her nipple and twisted. The unexpected move made Mackenzie jerk in shock, and it was enough for Angie to wrestle her facedown to the ground before she knew what was happening. Cold air flooded her nether regions as she felt her swimsuit slither all the way down to her thighs. \"NOOO!\" she shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just to make sure everyone's clear on the stakes!\" continued Sarah. \"The winner gets the ultimate prize - the swimsuit. While the loser?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two undressed girls paused in their fighting to stare at Sarah with apprehension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled, the smile of someone who knew that she won no matter what happened. \"The loser gets to be tied naked to the hood of my car and driven around town. Slowly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother moment of silence followed. Mackenzie and Angie made eye contact once again, with Angie looking down at her while Mackenzie looked up over her shoulder from her prone position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd broke into raucous applause and cheers, shattering the silence. <i>\"Give me that suit!\"</i> screamed Angie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No!\"</i> Mackenzie managed to roll over onto her back and held on to her suit for dear life as the two engaged in an undignified tug-of-war, with Angie trying to pull it over her knees and clean off and Mackenzie desperately trying to keep it on her body, even if it no longer provided any modesty.</span></div></div>",

Mackenzie caught a glimpse of the hashtag \"#NakedLifeguardChick\" on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCold metal pressed against her back as she was pushed down onto the hood of a bright red sports car. Her wrists and ankles were bound with zip ties, forcing her into a humiliating spread-eagled position, with no possible way to preserve her modesty. \"You can't do this to me!\" she pleaded. \"I'm the <i>lifeguard!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah brightened. \"Hey, that's right, you are!\" Plucking the whistle from around Mackenzie's neck, Sarah tossed it to Angie, who had followed them along with the rest of the spectators. \"Hey Angie - wanna be our promoter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching the whistle deftly, Angie nodded, still looking dizzy with relief. \"Y-yeah. Hell yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, <i>come on!</i> I tried to <i>help</i> you!\" exclaimed Mackenzie, almost hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, somebody's getting humiliated here, and I figure better you than me,\" said Angie with a shrug. \"Besides - you pulled my hair. I like my hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No good deed goes unpunished, Lifeguard Girl,\" said Sarah cheerfully, climbing into the driver's seat of the car, still in her blue bikini. Angie climbed into the passenger's seat beside her. Sarah looked around at the crowd. \"<i>Everybody ready to do this?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd roared in approval. Sarah started the engine and Mackenzie felt it thrum to life beneath her bare skin. Angie blew a blast on the whistle that people could probably hear from four blocks away. \"Please, no! Come on!\" Mackenzie was practically babbling at this point. \"At least put a towel over me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where would be the fun in that?\" asked Sarah with a roguish grin, putting on a pair of sunglasses. \"<i>Let's ride.</i>\"</span></div></div>",

She pulled them up her legs before realizing she had put them on backwards. <i>Ugh, why are these lights still off?</i> After pulling them off she eventually was able to successfully put them on. They seemed tighter than she remembered for some reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the lights were on Mackenzie might have noticed that these weren't the black comfy panties she wore into the bathroom, but were actually a pair of pink skimpier panties that weren't quite her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDismissing the tightness, Mackenzie pulled on her pajama shorts next. After she had them over her hips, she tied the drawstring to keep them secured. She didn't notice the large slits that had been cut along both sides of the shorts. Her pale thighs were still completely in view on her right and left, even showing a bit of the panties she wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Mackenzie picked up her pajama top, a soft, long sleeved shirt with four buttons running up the front. She slid her arms through the sleeves and began buttoning up the front. It took her longer than usual since she had to feel around for each button. The top three buttons eventually closed fine, but the bottom button seemed to be missing, showing just a bit of her stomach. <i>Shoot! Did I break it?</i> Mackenzie thought to herself. She felt around on the ground for a few moments for a spare button before giving up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't notice that the top button (the one that controlled how much cleavage she was showing: None or Tons) had come undone when she was bent over. In fact, all three buttonholes had been significantly loosened, allowing the buttons to slide free with relative ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie gathers up her shower supplies and begins to make her way slowly out of the stall.

She gently squeezed her full breasts, her fingers teasing and lightly pinching her hardening nipples. One hand stayed on her chest as her other slowly rubbed its way down her flat belly. As her fingers drifted over her strip of wet scarlet curls, Mackenzie could already feel the aching need in her loins bubbling up. Finally, unable to tease herself any longer, the redhead slipped two fingers into her needy core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, yeah...\" Mackenzie moaned, throwing her head back as the initial wave of pleasure hit her. The adrenaline always seemed to make things more intense, as she had discovered one night as Willow slept in the bed beneath her. Playing with herself, trying to keep her noise down to avoid waking her roommate all the while had been what started this little game of dangerous pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, shrouded in darkness and with the warm water cascading over her, Mackenzie felt that same sensation. It was some kind of heaven. As her pleasure grew and her knees became weak, the gorgeous redhead leaned back against a shower wall, sliding down into a sitting position with her legs wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie's imagination went wild, imagining her hands as those of another. A generous and talented lover that knew just how to make Mackenzie's toes curl in delight. Mackenzie could practically see this dream lover, envisioning the two of them together in the dark shower. All that was missing was the rest of their body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie's moans became louder as her hands went wild. The hand on her breasts began tweaking and pulling on her erect nipples, while the hand between her legs was almost a blur. Finally, after what felt like ages, Mackenzie came. Her hips bucked lewdly against her hand as her juices mingled with the shower water and washed away. Gasping to catch her breath, Mackenzie simply sat against the shower wall in post-orgasmic bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Mackenzie decided that she'd had enough fun, and it was time to get out of the shower. Turning the handle, the redhead felt a little saddened at the loss of the warm water. She reached to where she'd left her towel to dry herself off, but stopped as she felt only wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must've slipped.\" Mackenzie muttered to herself, kneeling down and groping blindly in the dark for her fallen towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet there was no towel to be found. Mackenzie's fingers felt only the cold tile of the bathroom floor. That would have been bad enough if it weren't for the fact that she should have at least also felt her clothes! Even in the darkness, Mackenzie knew where she had left them. There's no way her things just moved on their own, but that would mean... someone else had taken them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie's heart jumped into her throat. Somebody else had been in the bathroom with her! What's worse, they'd stolen her belongings! Not just her towel and clothes, but her key to her dorm room that she'd stowed in the pocket of her shorts! She was so stupid! What had she been thinking, letting herself get so distracted like that in the shower?! Now someone had taken advantage of her foolishness!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least they had no way of knowing what she'd been up to in that shower stall, Mackenzie thought to herself. Still, this was a huge problem. The only place she could easily solve this problem was her dorm room... down the hall... locked, and needing the key she didn't have. Assuming Willow was still in the room, she was probably asleep, and Mackenzie didn't exactly fancy letting her roommate see her naked anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't going to be easy. Not at all. Still, Mackenzie saw little choice in the matter. She'd need to brave the dorm hallway completely naked and hope that she could get into her room without trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking several deep breaths, Mackenzie made her way to the crack of light indicating the bottom of the bathroom door. Slowly, the redhead pushed the door open, stepped out into the light of the hallway, and...</span></div></div>",

Just as her fingers found the fluffy fabric of her towel, however, the quiet of the dark room was shattered by a piercing siren, startling Mackenzie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a second to recognize the noise as the dorm fire alarm. Mackenzie let out a frustrated sigh, bemoaning her luck. The redhead was at first planning to simply ignore the alarm and get dressed before heading outside, but then a small voice in the back of her mind spoke up. What if the lights going out was connected to the fire alarm? This might not be a drill...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of running into the hall and out of the dorm building altogether in just her towel was embarrassing, but Mackenzie would rather look silly than burned. Quickly throwing her towel around herself, Mackenzie carefully guided herself to the door back to the hallway, letting the light from under the door guide her. Stepping out into the hall, Mackenzie saw the rest of her floor's residents already filing out, most clearly roused from their slumber by the shrill alarm. Quietly slipping in at the back of the group, Mackenzie followed the herd down the hall to the exit doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We'll just stand outside for a few minutes while they make sure everything's safe.

Looking down, she knew that she was a sore sight. The towel she had grabbed was more or less completely saturated with water.

The split in the fabric seemed to move upwards as it creeped across the towel. An inch of towel at the corner became three inches of towel as the split circled around to the right edge of her ass. And that increased to six inches by the time it had reached her left hip. Mackenzie's towel barely covered her ass anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally noticing the sensation of the cloth leaving her body, Mackenzie began to look behind her, but hit another muddy spot and began slipping forward. As she crashed to the ground, there was a loud ripping noise and the towel finished it's split. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie quickly got to her feet and muttered \"Oh no...\" as she realized her towel had been basically ripped in half along the diagonal. What was once a long rectangle to wrap around one's body was now a long triangle to wrap around one's body. The right side Mackenzie held in front of her still covered from her breasts to her thighs. But the left side was the opposite. She had just enough fabric to cover her left breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie now began jogging towards the door, holding her towel together at the top with her left hand and pulling the bottom in front of her crotch with her right. She garnered more cheers and whistles from the few remaining onlookers, making her blush even more furiously. She kept her head down as she walked past the fireman holding the door open. He chuckled appreciatively as Mackenzie's nearly bare ass jiggled past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlad to finally be out of the rain, Mackenzie hurried back to her floor. The halls were still bustling with people and Mackenzie was still getting plenty of attention. Rounding the corner, the bathroom from earlier came back into view and Mackenzie hustled through the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights were back on, thankfully, and Mackenzie quickly moved into the same stall as before. She turned on the warm water and began washing the mud and dirt from her body. It felt heavenly compared to the freezing downpour. And the privacy felt similarly wonderful compared to the exposure she had just endured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more voices were entering the bathroom now as other girls were beginning their days as well. Mackenzie finished up and reached for her towel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right.\" She said upon remembering the current state of her towel. She looked around the stall, but her pajamas were nowhere to be seen. <i>What the heck! Did someone take them?</i> They had, after all, been left unattended for the past fifteen minutes or so, even if the building was unoccupied for most of that time. <i>Just perfect...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie resigned herself to her towel once again, wrapping it around her body again. After all, it did offer <i>some</i> coverage for her. But, as she reached the door, Mackenzie realized she needed a free hand to use the knob. Cursing to herself, she kept her towel together up top and let the bottom swing away from her womanhood slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting the bathroom quickly, Mackenzie booked it down the hallway towards her room. Then, the thin slippery towel end fell from her hand and Mackenzie let out a small noise of surprise. It swung down, leaving Mackenzie's entire backside bared for all to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her room in sight, Mackenzie clutched the towel in front of her body and just plowed ahead. There were less people out now, and Mackenzie only passed two girls on her way. Both offered raised eyebrows and long stares but said nothing to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie burst into her room and quickly shut the door behind her. She let out a long sigh as she finally allowed herself to relax and catch her breath. Then she noticed she had let the towel fall completely in the act of closing the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Mackenzie realized that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The shelves where Mackenzie usually stored her sheets, towels, and extra clothes were empty.

Even the blankets and bed sheets had been removed. And Mackenzie was still very much naked (not to mention still dripping wet). She crossed her arms over her chest and pressed her thighs together as she nervously sat there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I. Have. Nothing. To. Wear.\" she said as if in a daze. She glanced at the clock and saw it was 8:57. Her first class was starting in 3 minutes. \"Given the circumstances, I don't think I'll be making it to that one.\" she muttered wryly to herself. Mackenzie grabbed her phone off her desk and quickly texted Willow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>hey some of my stuff is gone, did you take anything?</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a moment later she got a response:<br>\r\n<b><i>no? why what's missing?</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie bit her lip, debating whether or not to tell Willow that all of their clothes were missing. In the end she sent:<br>\r\n<b><i>some of my clothes. yours too i think</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>well i didn't take any of your stuff. not today at least lol<br>\r\nanyway class is starting, let's sort it out when i get back around 2</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gut told her that Willow was telling the truth. But then who had taken everything? Mackenzie gave a small shiver, realizing how cold she suddenly felt. She was slowly drying off, but she was still pretty wet, especially her hair. Rubbing her hands up and down her arms helped a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now what...\" she thought to herself. Willow would be back in about 5 hours, and Mackenzie really didn't want to still be naked when she arrived. She could try to see if a friend might be able to bring her some clothes to borrow, but she knew most would probably be in classes by now. Couldn't hurt to ask, though!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtherwise, she would have to go and get some clothes, one way or another. But there was no way she could do that naked! But if she had even one outfit, she could ask some acquaintances who lived on the floor to loan her something to wear. Heck, if she had just one outfit she could go out and buy a week's worth of clothes with no problems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need clothes in order to get clothes.\" Mackenzie said aloud, \"Perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering her options, Mackenzie decided...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Despite their closeness, Mackenzie was still too embarrassed to tell Marianne that she had literally no clothing at the moment. She probably figured Mackenzie had at least SOMETHING to wear.

Amanda brings me one outfit, then I can actually go out in public to buy a couple outfits, and then Willow and I can track down the clothes thief from there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie found herself actually smiling for the first time that day. After a brief and bouncy happy dance, Mackenzie sat back down and waited for Amanda to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout twelve minutes later, there was a knock on the door and Mackenzie sprang to her feet. \"Amanda?\" she asked through the closed door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's me.\" Amanda replied from the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda had dark brown hair and lightly tanned skin. She stood about the same height as Mackenzie, but she had a leaner and more muscular build than the redhead, having a skinnier waist and B cup breasts. She stood in the hall wearing some baggy sport shorts and a tank top with an open jacket over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok this is kinda weird\" Mackenzie began, \"but if I open the door a crack can you just hand the bag through and give me a second to dress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Amanda asked with a chuckle as the door opened a few inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn open hand reached out from behind the door as Mackenzie pleaded, \"Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kenz, what are you, ten?\" Amanda handed the bag over and the hand grabbed it quickly. Then, in the same motion, Amanda muscled her way through the doorway, ignoring Mackenzie's request. \"I'm not waiting out in the hallway. I'll turn around while you change if you're really that self-co...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trailed off as she turned and noticed the naked girl standing behind the door. Amanda was at a loss for words as she took in the sight of Mackenzie, holding the small bag of clothes in front of her crotch and trying to cover her breasts with her other arm. Her skin was pale, except for her face, which was quickly turning almost as red as her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda!\" Mackenzie shrieked as she quickly shoved the door closed. \"Can you not look please?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh yeah. Sorry!\" Amanda said after a moment, turning around to face the wall. \"I didn't uh... didn't realize you were already naked there. Sorry about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie sighed as she relaxed her arms and opened the bag. \"It's alright, I probably should have just told you I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait why <i>are</i> you naked?\" Amanda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story.\" Mackenzie muttered, digging the clothes out of the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah I brought a couple options for you.\" Amanda added upon hearing the rustling. \"One's an old sundress of mine, and the other's just a skirt and a couple shirts that go with it.\" After a pause she added, \"I, uh, didn't think you would need me to bring any underwear or shoes or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's, yeah, no problem.\" Mackenzie stuttered as she blushed again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the four pieces of clothing, Mackenzie decided to put on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was just a tad small on her, falling half an inch short of the top of her skirt and leaving a thin band of stomach uncovered. It also felt a bit tight around her breasts, and she noticed two bumps where the shirt covered her nipples. But it was much better than wearing nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's much better. Thanks again, Amanda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem!\" said Amanda, turning around. Her eyes moved over the newly clothed girl briefly before she spoke again. \"So, why <i>were</i> you naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Mackenzie started hesitantly before deciding to fill Amanda in. She told her about the fire alarm interrupting her morning shower and the building evacuation. About the humiliating display outside and the partial destruction of her towel. And about the disappearance of every stitch of clothing in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's awful!\" Amanda said finally. She did feel bad that her friend had suffered, but she guiltily wished she could have seen more of Mackenzie's plight. Amanda had gotten a small crush on Mackenzie when they first met, but had later gotten the impression that the redhead wasn't into girls. She was fine to let it go and just be friends. It certainly wasn't the first time she had had to. But all this was certainly reigniting that initial crush. <i>Is this her way of trying to get my attention?</i> Amanda thought. <i>There's no way this whole scenario is real, right?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda's mind snapped back to the conversation. \"But who could have done this? I mean, taking literally EVERYTHING? Even the sheets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\" Mackenzie said in despair. She failed to pick up on the slight tone of disbelief in her friend's voice. \"Willow and I will have to figure that out once she gets back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda still wasn't sure how much to believe, but her friend seemed genuinely distressed. \"Well you can count on me to help, too.\" she said supportively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie smiled again. \"Thanks, Amanda. That means a lot.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now?\" asked Amanda. \"Should we just start knocking on doors? Try to track the culprit down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" Mackenzie said hesitantly, \"I was planning on getting a few more things to wear first. Just in case we don't find anything immediately.\" <i>And to get some fucking underwear back on!</i> Mackenzie added mentally. She was grateful to have some cover on her body again, but she was still acutely aware of her lack of panties and bra. She had never really liked going commando, and wanted to remedy her discomfort as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\" Amanda said without enthusiasm. \"I'll go with you either way. But it might diminish our chances of finding your wardrobe...\" <i>And if you put a bra on, then I won't get to see those perky little nipples poking out anymore.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie thought it over and decided...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her original room key was in the pocket of her stolen pajamas. <i>Which explains how someone got into the room, I guess.</i> she realized. Amanda put her dress and shirt back into her bag and slung it over her shoulder. At 10:00, the girls exited the room and Mackenzie locked the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they made it outside, Mackenzie abruptly realized that she still had no footwear. <i>Maybe that should be the first thing I buy.</i> She walked carefully down the wet sidewalk, trying her best to avoid puddles. The downpour from earlier had alleviated and there were only occasional sprinkles of water coming down now. Only once did Mackenzie slip enough to lose her balance, just before they reached the bus stop. She was able to mostly break her fall, but she did fall forward and partially into a small puddle. Amanda helped her up and they arrived at the bus stop just as the bus pulled up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter climbing on the bus and sitting down next to each other, Amanda noticed that part of Mackenzie's shirt was pretty wet from her spill. A very important part of her shirt. The area around her chests was now soaked through, and Amanda could clearly see every bit of Mackenzie's big breasts. The shirt clung to them, outlining then perfectly and making her nipples all but visible. Amanda tried not to stare as she took in the lovely sight at her leisure. Mackenzie hadn't seemed to notice, though she absentmindedly seemed to peel the shirt away from her skin from time to time, somewhat aware of its wetness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the bus pulled up to its stop at the nearby mall and the girls rose from their seats. As they exited the bus, Mackenzie caught a brief glimpse of herself in the mirror and quickly crossed her arms over her chest and hurried off the bus. As it drove away, she turned to Amanda and worriedly began whispering \"Oh my god, Amanda! This shirt's practically see-through now! What am I gonna do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, I'm sure it's not that bad.\" Amanda tried to reassure her, knowing it wasn't quite the truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie moved her arms away from her chest as if to prove her point, giving Amanda another long, uninterrupted view of her technically covered breasts. <i>Well that was a pretty not so subtle hint.</i> Amanda thought to herself. \"Okay, maybe that is pretty bad. Let's get you a new shirt first then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie put her arms back over her chest again and they entered the mall doors. The instant Mackenzie's wet bare feet stepped on the smooth mall floor, she almost lost her balance again, but Amanda helped catch her. \"Actually,\" Mackenzie said, feeling some adrenaline pounding, \"I think I'll get a pair of shoes first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea.\" Amanda agreed, \"Wait a sec, I've got this one. You chill here and I'll be right back with just the thing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, okay...\" Mackenzie replied as Amanda briskly walked off and into a nearby store. Mackenzie carefully made her way over to a nearby metal bench and took a seat, leaning backwards and relaxing on the bench's back for a few moments. She kept her arms crossed over her chest, but tried to relax and not be so nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd not three minutes later, Amanda happily strode out of the store with a pair of sandals in her hand. They were the extremely cheap kind, made mostly of some sort of soft foam. She handed them over to Mackenzie and said \"These should do until you find some actual shoes. They were only like two bucks.\" she added with a giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie smiled, \"Good idea! Thanks, Amanda.\" She leaned over at the waist, slipping the sandals over her feet and Amanda's eyes were drawn to the skin of her lower back sliding into view as the shirt rose slightly. And she also noticed that the waistband of the skirt was being pulled away from Mackenzie's waist. Puzzled, she moved forward a step to see, and saw the metal fastening device of the skirt was caught on the underside of the bench's back. And then Mackenzie put her hands on the bench, moving to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KENZ, W-\" was all Amanda managed to get out before the rip sounded. The fastener of the skirt was designed to keep the two ends of the waistband together, and keep them together it did. Unfortunately, that meant the entire fastening device was ripped away from the skirt, taking the two edges of the waistband with it. Mackenzie stumbled slightly as she stood, surprised by the unexpected resistance and taking an extra moment to find her balance. But the skirt wasted no time. With a break in the waistband, it no longer stayed securely on the girl's hips, and instead began dropping to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was originally going to be a \"WAIT\" from Amanda turned into a \"whoa...\" as she was treated to the sight she was so close to seeing back in the dorm. Her bare thighs,the small patch of matching hair, and an unobstructed view of Mackenzie's bared womanhood. And just as quickly as it was revealed, the sight was gone, as Mackenzie crouched in place and grabbed the fallen skirt around her ankles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OhmygodOhmygodOhmygod\" she repeated, shaking her head in disbelief. \"Not again, no more please!\" She carefully rose back up, keeping both hands on the skirt and assessed the damage. Her red face fell when she realized the fastener was completely detached, and a moment later she looked up at Amanda. \"Oh my god Amanda I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to! Your skirt... I... It was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda quickly raised her arms in a placating gesture, \"Kenz it's fine! It was an accident, no worries.\" <i>Hell, for a show like that I'd gladly give up that skirt.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie took another moment to compose herself and the two girls made their way to a nearby store. Mackenzie kept one hand firmly clamped on her skirt, which was the only thing keeping it up at all now. Her other arm was draped across her breasts, trying to at least somewhat cover them from onlookers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich item(s) was Mackenzie buying first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mackenzie entered the store, an underwear store for women, and began looking around for a suitable underwear replacement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda grabbed Mackenzie's wrist and said, \"Oh, look.\" She was pointing towards a promotional sign at the back of the store. It read: 'CLEARANCE: Buy Set of 6 Bras, Get Set of 6 Matching Panties Free!' \"That's perfect, right?\" she asked happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie nodded at that thought. She could quickly pick up enough underwear to last her a week! And the sooner she could put some on, the better. So, the girls made their way over to the back of the store, and began perusing the large rack of bras in various sizes. The bras on sale were normal underwire bras with varying patterns. Each set of bras had six, with the same six patterns in each set. There was a plain black bra and a plain white bra. Plus a light grey bra with pink trim and a yellow bra with dark purple trim. Also, an aqua blue bra with white polka dots, and a deep red bra with black polka dots. These all seemed fine to Mackenzie, who wasn't super concerned with the styles of the garments at the moment. She found a set labeled 36C and took it off the rack, careful to only use one arm. Then, she moved on to the rack of panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were also together in sets of six, each having a matching style to the six bras. Mackenzie quickly found one labeled 'M' and picked it up. As she turned to begin moving to the register, she bumped into another woman who was nearby the rack. The bump jostled Mackenzie's right hand from holding up her skirt, and she immediately grabbed for the garment with both hands before it could fall, sending the underwear sets tumbling to the ground. She caught it in time, the skirt only having dropped an inch or so in the short span. Mackenzie let out a small sigh of relief before apologizing to the woman, who had dropped what she was carrying as well. The woman was kneeling down, picking up her dropped items from the ground. She gave Mackenzie a wordless annoyed stare before standing up and walking away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me get these for you Kenzie.\" said Amanda as she reached down to pick up Mackenzie's dropped items. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks Amanda.\" she said gratefully. Amanda carried them to the register, allowing Mackenzie to use both arms for cover. The cashier scanned the two sets and put them in a shopping bag. Mackenzie paid and Amanda grabbed the bag. \"Where are your changing rooms?\" Mackenzie asked the cashier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the back,\" replied the cashier, \"but I wouldn't use the ones here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why not?\" asked Mackenzie, surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corporate policy doesn't let customers walk out wearing the products. Even if they've already purchased them. Some bullshit about reducing shoplifting.\" she said, almost bored, \"I mean, I'm just assuming you were planning on putting one of those on.\" she added, her eyes drifting down to Mackenzie's still nearly visible breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie moved her other arm over her chest again, blushing and said \"Uh, thanks...\" before quickly exiting the store. Amanda followed closely behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that's a shitty policy.\" Amanda complained as she caught up with the redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I gonna put these on now?\" Mackenzie asked forlornly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda paused for a moment, torn with indecision. She had immensely enjoyed being able to take in the sight of her friend's breasts while she was browsing the items. She would love to immediately pull Mackenzie into a nearby store and urge her to start shopping how she was. But, she figured the comfort of her friend was probably more important. She spoke up, \"There's a mall bathroom nearby. Let's use that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pushed the door open and the bathroom seemed empty. Mackenzie entered an empty stall and locked the door behind her. She took her skirt off and laid it over the top of the stall. With both hands finally free, she opened the set of panties and pulled out the yellow pair with a purple waistband. She slid her feet through and began pulling the underwear up her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for the redhead, when she had bumped into the woman back in the store, that woman had accidentally grabbed Mackenzie's picked out underwear sets. It wasn't a big deal for her, as she soon noticed the mistake and went to pick out her correct sizes once more. But that meant Amanda had inadvertently picked up the stranger's underwear sets. And Mackenzie hadn't had a chance to notice the difference as Amanda carried them to the counter before they were placed out of sight in the bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the shapely young woman stood in the bathroom stall, unknowingly pulling a pair of 'XS' panties up her legs. She struggled to get them up her thighs, and had to really pull and yank to get them around her hips. Eventually, she managed to get them into place. <i>Jeez, these are REALLY tight. </i> she thought. <i>I guess that's what I get for buying cheap underwear. But they're more than good enough for now.</i> Peeling off the wet shirt, Mackenzie laid that over the stall too. And began taking the yellow bra out of its packaging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, let me see if I can dry that shirt a little.\" Amanda said as she whisked the shirt off from outside the stall. Soon the hand dryer could be heard blowing out hot air nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Uh... okay, thanks.\" Mackenzie said surprised. She pulled her arms through the bra and moved it over her breasts. After a few moments of straining, she managed to get the clasp fastened on her back. She tried to tug at the edges of the bra to get everything in place, but it still didn't feel quite right on her. <i>This feels tight too...</i> she thought. And that was because she had put on a 34A bra instead of the 36C bra she was expecting. Mackenzie's breasts were pressed tightly upwards and together. And even the band of the bra strained slightly on her torso. But Mackenzie tried to be positive, despite the discomfort. <i>I've finally got some underwear on! Plus enough for the foreseeable future. Even if we can't find out who took my clothes for a while, I won't be stuck naked anymore.</i> She ran her hands over the cups of the bra, happy that she could no longer see or feel her nipples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" Amanda said, putting the shirt back on the stall, \"it's a <i>little</i> drier at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Amanda.\" Mackenzie said as she pulled the shirt back on. Glancing down, she could see the outline of her new bra through her shirt, but it didn't seem quite as transparent as before. She pulled the damaged skirt up her legs and resumed her grip on the waistband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out of the stall, she was greeted by a \"Feeling better now?\" from Amanda. Glancing down briefly, she noted that Mackenzie's bra was visible through her shirt, but only slightly. Just a bit more than its outline could be discerned. But... were her breasts bigger? Taking a longer look, Amanda saw that Mackenzie's breasts were now straining against the fabric of the t-shirt. Before, when the shirt had clung to them, they were sitting nicely at rest on Mackenzie's torso. But now, they were raised and seemed to be shoving themselves as up and out as possible. <i>Once again, not so discretely grabbing my attention...</i> Amanda thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Mackenzie said, letting herself relax slightly. \"Much better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh good!\" Amanda added, still a bit distracted by the impressive rack in front of her. \"So, uh, what's next for the new wardrobe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls strode out of the bathroom together as Mackenzie thought it over. \"Well, the plan was to have one complete outfit on before shopping for the rest. But, this skirt isn't doing me much good now.\" She paused before adding, \"Sorry again about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda waved her concern away. \"Don't even sweat it. So should we go look for a new skirt next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I've had more than enough of open bottoms for the day.\" Mackenzie said resolutely. \"Next on my list is to get a pair of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Another option down the drain. At this rate it seemed like the only thing left for the naked redhead to do was wait for one of her friends to come to her room and help her out. A glance at the clock hanging on the wall reminded her of how long of a wait that was. \"Afternoon\" was a vague term, but probably the earliest one of the three answers she'd received. That still left a good three or four hours at the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree hours, stark naked, stuck in her dorm room by herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was assuming that nothing else happened to make Mackenzie's situation somehow worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat hadn't occurred to Mackenzie was that there was a high likelihood that one of the friends she'd texted was in fact the culprit responsible for her clothes disappearing. Willow had unrestricted access to the room, of course, and Marianne or Amanda could have stolen her spare key during the whole debacle with the fire alarm. There was, of course, the chance that someone else was responsible, but the possibility did exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck me...\" Mackenzie muttered to herself as she stared up at the ceiling. \"What do I do now?\"</span></div></div>",

It was dirty, ripped, and soaking wet, but it was still the only piece of fabric in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe i can use it as a skirt or something...</i> she thought to herself. She picked it up and tried to wring it out slightly, then hung it on the bed post. Hopefully it would dry a little faster that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay...</i> she took another look around. <i>Oh my god, there's nothing!</i> she thought frantically, searing through her desk as well as Willow's. There was certainly enough loose paper sitting around, and she did have some scotch tape, but Mackenzie really didn't think she was brave enough to pull that off. Not to mention, it was still raining outside, so that was a big reason to vote Nay on paper clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie sighed in frustration. The only other possible idea she could come up with was to use her backpack somehow. If she flipped it around maybe she could use it as makeshift cover for her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't like either of these options, but she might only need something to get her down the hall for a few minutes.

The trouble would be keeping it securely in place. It was designed to stay on her shoulders, but not for much else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting her arms through the loops, Mackenzie tried positioning the bag over her breasts. The material felt rough on her nipples as she held it in place. Then she let go of it, allowing it to slide down a few inches before being halted by the thick straps on her shoulders. The bag covered some of her torso, coming down to the level of her hips.The top of the bag was just an inch above her nipples, leaving the majority of Mackenzie's chest bare and the shape of her breasts very visible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie felt her face reddening at the thought of wearing this around in public. She took it off and adjusted the length on the straps, shortening them as much as possible, and put it back on. Now it rested higher, covering almost all of her breasts and down to her navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr rather, it covered almost all of her breasts from the front. It did absolutely nothing to cover the sides of her breasts, or the side of her body for that matter. Combined with her nearly bare shoulders and completely coverless back, and Mackenzie knew it would be obvious to anyone that she wasn't wearing anything but the bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Mackenzie tried wrapping the still damp towel around her waist. Shifting it around so that it completely covered her rear, Mackenzie found it also did an adequate job of covering her right thigh and an almost adequate job of covering her left. But the diagonal shape of the towel left her left hip completely uncovered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three quarters of a skirt, I guess.\" she mused aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was just enough fabric to tuck the towel into itself. Fastened in place, it lasted a full five seconds before coming apart and falling down along her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make that three quarters of a shitty skirt!\" she sparked in frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the second of two downsides was that it would also not stay together easily. Mackenzie was able to put a few safety pins in the tucked towel and and it seemed like it would hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at herself in the mirror, she realized again how little cover this really was. She could see so much of her reflection's bare skin. \"I can't believe I'm doing this... But it's just to get through the hallway. It just has to hold for a minute or two before I can get something better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand shaking and her face a deep red, Mackenzie opened the door slightly and peeked into the hallway. No one was there. Taking a deep breath, Mackenzie strode out into the hallway, hands worriedly holding her \"clothes\" in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe franticlly knocked on the door two rooms down and hoped Kim would be there. They weren't really close friends or anything, but they were friendly with each other and Mackenzie was desperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie glanced around nervously as she waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She whirled around to face the hallway, putting her bare back up against the door. And she felt the door's handle slide into the gap of her makeshift skirt. <i>SHIT!</i> She tried to twist away, but the handle tugged back and wouldn't relinquish its grip on the towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe safety of her room was just a few feet away, but she wouldn't be able to get the towel free in time!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Not wasting any more time, Mackenzie took off for her room, letting the towel split apart and remain on her neighbor's door handle. The bottomless girl didn't bother trying to cover herself as she sprinted down the hall and quickly opened her door. Once inside the room, she quickly closed the door and locked it. Mackenzie realized her heart was pounding as she sat back down at her desk. <i>Okay... Calm down. I'm safe here.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe backpack had gone wildly askew during her burst of speed and she settled it over her front to cover her breasts again. She glanced down at her nude lower half. <i>Great. Now I've only got this stupid backpack left to cover myself.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie was startled by a loud knock at the door, followed by the soft sound of quickly retreating footsteps. She gulped and slowly walked towards the door, both hands covering her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" she tentatively called. There was no response from the hall. Mackenzie waited another minute before slowly turning the handle and opening the door a few inches. She kept her mostly bare body behind the door as she did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one was there. The hall seemed completely empty again. She chanced a quick glance further out and saw that there was no towel-skirt where she had abandoned it. There was, however, something resting on the ground next to her door. It looked like a dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh my god, yes! Clothing. Thank god for... wait, this is MY dress!</i> She quickly grabbed the garment and retreated into the room again. <i>This is definitely my sundress! </i> she thought as she held the garment up and examined it. It was a breezy sundress, mostly light purple with a pattern of small yellow flowers. It rested on her shoulders via two thin straps and fell down to just above Mackenzie's knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least, it used to. <i>This is definitely shorter than it used to be. Who the hell cut up my dress!?</i> Mackenzie quickly dropped the backpack and slid the dress on. It now came down to just a few inches below her ass. But the light and loose dress could easily be blown up to reveal her lack of underwear. There were also several slits cut along the sides of the dress, showing small windows of Mackenzie's skin. One was nearly at the top and conspicuously showed the world that she was not wearing any sort of bra underneath. But, the now skimpy and holey dress was a hell of a lot better than she had had a few minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Mackenzie noticed the piece of paper that had been folded up with the dress. It read: \"Fantastic show this morning, my dear! You were absolutely breathtaking out in the rain. Such a wonderful warm up act! Now the fun can truly begin. Do you like scavenger hunts? Because I like to think of this as a giant scavenger hunt for your wardrobe! Doesn't that sound fun?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh I hope you don't mind, but I've taken the liberty of removing any clothing you might feel tempted to use. That wouldn't be fair now, would it? Wearing something you hadn't earned back? No that won't do at all! I'm willing to give you this dress back as a freebie to start, but from now on, if you want your clothes back, you'll have to follow instructions and earn them back! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd no wearing other people's clothing, either! That's cheating. And cheating would result in a penalty. But hopefully I'll never have to bring that up any further. Just stick to the clothes you earn and there won't be any problems! And believe me, I'll know if you're wearing something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So this is the same asshole that stole all my clothes! And now they want me to run around getting them back? I can't fucking believe this bullshit! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept reading: \"So, I won't hold you up any longer. I bet you're dying to get started! I know I sure am. I'll start you off with an easy clue, and we can ramp up the difficulty from there. Sound good?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) If you want to earn back your black panties, then listen up.<br>\r\nYou'll find them where you were last wearing them.<br>\r\nGood luck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took Mackenzie a moment to remember. <i>I wore them to bed last night. So I had them on when I got up and went to the shower... The shower!</i> She grabbed her backpack and headed to the door before stopping for a moment. <i>Wait, am I really gonna go running around just because this asshole of a thief says so? I've got at least some cover now. Maybe I should just wait it out til Willow gets back...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie thought for a moment before deciding to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I can go check and see if the panties are actually there. If so, then I've got some underwear back. If not, I haven't lost anything but a few minutes.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfident in her decision, Mackenzie left the room and began walking down the hall, keeping one hand on the bottom of her dress. She tried tugging it down a little further as she moved, but thought she heard the sound of tearing fabric when she did. <i>Better not try to pull too hard on this. I don't want to widen any of these holes.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few guys loitering farther down the hall, but they hadn't noticed Mackenzie, and she quickly entered the nearby bathroom before they could. The bathroom seemed empty as the redhead strode over to the shower stalls. She opened the one she had used this morning and found a pair of black panties dangling from a hook on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well damn! Just like the asshole said.</i> She pulled the panties down, eager to put them on, and noticed the piece of paper attached to her underwear. She yanked it off and cursed as she noticed that it had been stapled to the garment, coming away with a small of chunk of the underwear. Bending over to put the underwear on, Mackenzie cursed again as she heard the sound of her dress ripping under the strain. Her shapely hips had caused the lowest slits to rip a little higher. She pulled the panties up her legs slowly, and the dress made no further protests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out of the stall, she looked at her reflection in the mirror and saw the slits in her dress rose up above her hips. Her black panties could easily be seen on both sides of her dress. And further slits revealed the sides of her stomach, and just the barest hint of the sides of her breasts. <i>Just great. Now I look like I tried to cut my own dress up to show more skin. Well what's this next paper say...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice job! But that was a pretty easy one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) If you want to earn back your black bra, then listen up.<br>\r\nYou'll find it hiding beneath a Common comfort.<br>\r\nGood luck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie thought as she stared at her reflection again. <i>A common comfort? That could mean anything! Under a bed maybe? Those are pretty common in the dorms.</i> A few moments later she made an exasperated sound and angrily walked out of the bathroom. Her hips swayed as she walked, working the tears in the dress slightly farther. <i>This whole thing is stupid. I'm not running around from room to room... oh! The Common Room! That's why it had a capital C.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Mackenzie stopped and reversed her direction, heading toward the small room her floor shared. Her smiled quickly faded when she saw the loitering guys from earlier were still there. Their conversation faded as they all focused on the lovely girl walking towards them, their eyes catching the bare skin of her hips that peeked out of her dress with each step. Mackenzie blushed and avoided eye contact as she ducked into the Common Room a few feet away from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, there was a couch there, and Mackenzie wasted no time in dropping down on her stomach and looking under it. She thought she saw something at the back. Her outstretched arm was just able to grab hold of it and pull it forward. She slid herself backwards on the floor, raising her ass slightly as she did, and pulled the matching black bra into the light. As the girl sat up with her prize, her dress gave further tears in protest. Mackenzie nervously glanced down and noticed the side slits now reached well up to her ribs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not to move too much, Mackenzie read the note:<br>\r\n\"I think you're getting the hang of it now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) If you want to earn back your leather belt, then listen up.<br>\r\nOn the ground floor, it's behind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could finish though, she heard the chuckles of the boys watching her from the doorway. She was suddenly very aware that she had just pulled a bra from under the couch and was sitting there with it in front of these guys. Her face quickly began turning red. \"It, uh, it's not...\" she tried to stammer briefly before she took off running down the hallway again. With both hands holding the bra, her short dress bounced freely up and down, giving them all a view of her newly acquired panties underneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie made it back to her room once more and slammed the door behind her. And finally the dress reached its limit. The tears became one giant slit on each side, revealing the girl's pale skin from thighs to shoulders. Mackenzie gasped as she felt the release in the tension of the fabric. <i>Great, now that asshole has fucked my dress up beyond belief.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the mirror, the dress was now basically a double sided apron. Or even worse than an apron, as Mackenzie had no way to fasten the fabric close to her body. Instead, it drifted away from her body at the slightest movement, trailing behind. <i>That belt would be pretty useful right about now...Fuck it. I'll hold the dress in place and go get that damn belt!</i> While she still had the nerve to do so, Mackenzie walked back out into the hall, determined to get the belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that determination was short lived. Mackenzie tried to move the dress slightly, and the whole thing slid forward over her shoulders. The back rose up until the fabric hit her neck, allowing the front of the dress to dip well below her breasts. Despite the emptiness of the hall, Mackenzie gasped in surprise and quickly tried to cover her breasts with her hands. She retreated to her room and began frantically repositioning the dress. <i>This is almost useless now! I'll have to keep both hands on it to keep it in place.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she noticed the black bra still laying on the floor. <i>Oh yeah! Well it's at least somewhat helpful...</i> She shrugged off the dress (a task far easier than it should have normally been) and donned the bra. She fastened it in place and tugged the torn dress back over her body. <i>Well, this is as stable as my outfit's getting without that belt...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeighing the risks, Mackenzie decided to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The amusement park where the redhead worked was an impressively large complex, boasting all sorts of different attractions. Due to the park's popularity, it wasn't uncommon for workers to get stressed out doing the same particular job day after day, so in the name of fairness, a semi-random system was implemented wherein workers would have a different task every day. This allowed rotation of employees to keep everyone up-to-speed on the different aspects of the park, as well as give respite to employees that might otherwise lose their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis, of course, meant that some days were far worse than others depending on what work a person was assigned. As Mackenzie stepped into the employees' building and made her way to the work board, she silently hoped for good luck today. Maybe she'd get something nice and low-key like ride operation. She wouldn't have to deal with swarms of people all day that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there was also the chance that she'd be stuck with one of the crappier jobs. Mackenzie shuddered at the thought of having to wear the mascot suit. The big, bulky outfit was an absolute heat sink, uncomfortably warm even on cool days, and today was already promising to be on the sunny side. Not as bad, but still not pleasant, was the chance of getting stuck with water park duty. Something always seemed to be going wrong in that part of the park, whether it be troublemakers up to no good or one of the fountains malfunctioning.

The red head wiped a bead of sweat from her brow; Just looking at the outfit was making her feel the heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't exactly smiled upon, but some of her coworkers had talked about 'breaking dress code' by not wearing their uniforms under the costume.

Rebecca said no one really cared whether you wore the uniform or not.

It wasn't fun to wear to begin with, though, so she would just have to put up with it. Finally she picked up the mask. Mackenzie scowled at the goofy smile on the cat's face, looking like it was taunting her, and put it on, now experiencing possibly the worst part of the suit- the almost complete inability of the wearer to see. A little mesh on the inside theoretically let you see out the eye-holes while keeping the guests from seeing your eyes, but all it really seemed to do to Mackenzie was horribly blur the limited vision you already had. Tunnel vision didn't even describe it.

At least this (admittedly insane) plan might allow her to keep her job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving the suit head, Mackenzie took a breath of fresh air as she finally had a chance to cool off since putting on the ridiculous thing. Blushing intensely, Mackenzie set about unbuckling the straps that held the costume in place, slowly exposing her naked body to the midday sun. A cool breeze whipped through the park, chilling Mackenzie's sweat-soaked body and making her nipples stand at attention. As if she really needed a reminder that she was really naked in her workplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I just... I just have to run back to the employee area. My uniform should still be in the closet where I left it. I can grab it, get dressed, and run back before anybody's any wiser.\" Mackenzie whispered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe task was easier said than done. The employee area was clear across the park, which was currently full of people. There was no way around the fact that she'd be easily spotted as she made her run. The redhead realized that she'd need some way to protect her identity, lest she be recognized as the streaker later and lose her job anyway. As much as Mackenzie wanted to cover herself with her hands, for the sake of her job and dignity, she instead opted to cover her face. With any luck, she'd be able to hide her identity... at the expense of sacrificing her modesty to countless people...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little (or rather, a whole lot) of embarrassment was still better than being fired and possibly arrested, Mackenzie rationalized. So, trying to ignore the racing of her heart and the butterflies in her stomach, the nubile redhead covered her face, took one last deep breath, and burst out from her hiding place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice tits, baby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, look!

That fact didn't make the whistles and catcalls and jeers any less humiliating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to put these unpleasant thoughts out of her head, Mackenzie kept running.

Her cover was blown, so she used her free hand to cover her crotch- not that it helped her feel any less naked. She couldn't help shouting, though.

The duo had started their act small, and it had taken time to work their way to this point, but they were actually proving themselves as an act that could draw a crowd. The building wasn't sold out, but it was as close as the two performers had come, and not too far off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!\" Ellen said in a silky tone. Ellen had never been one to shout to address a crowd, instead using her sheer force of personality to get people's attention. \"I hope you're all ready to be amazed and entertained. Tonight's show will be one you'll never forget!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, Ellen.\" Mackenzie chimed in. \"There might be plenty of magicians in the world, but none will leave you as amazed as us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd clapped in response once again. There was no denying that the two attractive magicians had strong personalities that made it easy for crowds to love them. Mackenzie and Ellen both knew that this was at least partially responsible for their success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe show's introduction proceeded as it always did. The girls got some laughs, some cheers, and plenty of applause as they told their jokes and performed a few minor tricks. Soon enough, it was time for the first real event of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now, prepare to be amazed as I showcase my powers of hypnosis!\" Ellen stated, her confident voice carrying across the theater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was what Ellen had been waiting for. While she never mentioned it to Mackenzie, the cute blonde had a habit of looking for criticism of her act. One of the big complains was that her hypnosis was allegedly \"clearly fake\" and only possible because of plants in the audience or using Mackenzie as the subject of hypnosis. That simply wasn't true; Ellen's talent was the real deal, and she intended to prove it tonight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, she hadn't consulted Mackenzie about her plan, but surely her redheaded assistant would understand, right? Proving her powers could be a huge boost to their popularity!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo went through the usual motions. Mackenzie focused on the swinging pocket watch, and Ellen waited to see Mackenzie's eyes glaze over. Once they did, she knew her assistant was under her control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Mackenzie. You'll obey any command I give you, with no complaint or hesitation. Do you understand?\" Ellen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" Mackenzie answered in monotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.

She wasn't sure just how good her hypnosis was, and it was possible that such a demand might be too much for Mackenzie's subconscious to allow. Once Mackenzie slowly began to reach for the top of her corset, however, Ellen knew she had complete control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience watched with bated breath as Mackenzie's fingers slipped into the cups of her corset and slowly pulled them down. Inch by tantalizing inch, Mackenzie's heavy, pale breasts came into view, her pretty pink nipples erecting slightly in the open air. An amazed silence fell over the crowd, none could believe what they were seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you've got a hell of a rack, if you don't mind me saying, Mackenzie!\" Ellen said, slapping her assistant on the shoulder. Mackenzie stood impassively, still bearing her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen couldn't be more proud of herself. Not only was she proving her powers, but she was knocking Mackenzie down a peg or two. Ellen was proud enough of her own perky B-cups, but she knew that it was Mackenzie's chest her audience really ogled. It was high time the redhead give the audience what they wanted, Ellen figured. Besides, it'd help get her out of her shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Mackenzie, tell me something.\" Ellen said, pacing around Mackenzie as she spoke. \"Would you ever flash an audience of this size willingly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Mackenzie answered curtly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if you found yourself topless in front of such a crowd, what would you do?\" Ellen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would run away, trying to cover myself. I would be overcome with embarrassment and humiliation.\" Mackenzie replied in monotone. \"My modesty means much to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was something Ellen could work with. If Mackenzie was so conservative about her privates, then Ellen could prove her hypnosis beyond a shadow of a doubt by pushing things even further!

Ignore what's being said and don't stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie nodded and quickly made Ellen's smile disappear.  With her ample, luscious jugs jiggling in their naked splendor for the crowd to see, Mackenzie quickly moved over to Ellen and pulled down her corset.  Ellen's own perky fun bags bounced out, fully visible to the audience, and the crowd seemed to be eating it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mackenzie?!  What the hell are you doing?\" Ellen shouted and moved her hands to cover her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie, being faster and stronger than her alleged master, grabbed her wrists and pulled them down.  \"Don't stop.\"  Mackenzie repeated hollowly and head signaled for a stage hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen tried to pull away from Mackenzie, but with limited success.  \"What?!  No, you stupid cow!  I meant you should get buck naked.  Stop--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ellen could give a proper countermand to Mackenzie, the bemused stage hand had brought out a tray magical paraphernalia: rope, blindfolds, handcuffs, rings, balls, deck of cards, etc.  Mackenzie, with the sleight of hand of a magician and determination of a voodoo zombie, let go of Ellen's wrists, grabbed the blindfold, and gagged her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignore what's being said,\" Mackenzie intoned.  Ellen, whose hands were reflexively covering her boobs, were again pulled away by Mackenzie; she put Ellen's hands behind her back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't stop,\" Mackenzie said and looked at the stage hand.  The young man was more confused than ever at how he got involved in an apparent BDSM act with two attractive topless magicians, but assumed it must be part of the act.  He held onto Ellen's wrists; it was a short hold, as Mackenzie cuffed Ellen like she was a veteran cop taking care of a fugitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen blinked a few times as she tried to comprehend how the tables had turned so quickly.  As an experienced magician, the gag and handcuffs would be easy enough if this were an act, but  right now she didn't have the distraction or concealment of an act and she had someone actively resisting her.  <i>My assistant that I've hypnotized, for God's sake</i>!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen nodded her head violently and pulled against the cuffs in a panicky, vain hope of getting the gag and cuffs off quickly.  All this did was cause her boobs to bounce to which the audience applauded.  Their interest in seeing magic had probably reached an all time low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie stood still again.  The stage hand, tentatively, left after putting the tray on the nearby table.  Her conscious was cloudy as she had fulfilled her instructions as she interpreted them, but was unsure what to do now that her command was to ignore what's being said.  If the lovely, bare-breasted young woman had an old-time sci-fi computer brain underneath her red hair, it would certainly be exploding at the paradox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw three interpretations.  One: don't stop and keep on stripping Ellen.  Two: don't stop and finish strip herself and Ellen.  Three: don't stop and listen to audience for instructions as the de facto master.</span></div></div>",

Got all that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Mackenzie replied once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect.\" Ellen grinned, \"Now on 3 you shall awaken from your deep trance. 1... 2... 3!\" Mackenzie blinked a few times and gasped, feeling like she was suddenly waking up from a dream. \"And how do you feel awakening from your trance, Mackenzie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel fine!\" Mackenzie replied enthusiastically. Now she was back to her onstage personality, full of energy. \"And I have no idea what you had me doing while I was under, believe it or not.\" she added for the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I think they believe you.\" Ellen replied, drawing some chuckles from the crowd. \"Let's have another hand for my wonderful assistant, the Mystic Mackenzie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience erupted in applause as the half naked redhead took a bow. Mackenzie was surprised at how energetic the crowd seemed tonight. This just might have been their best show yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now if my assistant can <i>please</i> give me a hand with this next trick...\" Mackenzie quickly pulled off one of her gloves before helping Ellen set up the next trick, generating further cheers from the audience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the show continued, with an oblivious Mackenzie peeling off her gloves and stockings throughout the night. By the end of the duo's grand finale, Mackenzie was onstage in just her hat and panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience cheered as the two girls took their bows. But Ellen knew the true finale was still a few moments away. \"And <i>please</i>, let's once again hear it for my lovely assistant!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie obediently slid out of her panties and took a bow. With her hat in her hand she was now completely naked onstage. The crowd went nuts at the sight of the beautiful young woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mack!\" Ellen shouted, unable to hide her grin. \"Why are you <i>naked</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you-\" Mackenzie glanced down at herself and froze in disbelief. She was stark naked in front of a huge crowd of people! The nude girl gave a brief shriek as she sprinted offstage, desperate for some cover. That final display earned Ellen a standing ovation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowing again to the audience, Ellen gathered up Mackenzie's discarded clothing around the stage and headed backstage to try and explain herself to her friend. Smiling to herself, she could still hear the cheering even as she got to the dressing rooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen was already thinking of ways she could explain herself to Mackenzie. The truth didn't seem like a very appealing option, so Ellen decided to lie and try to convince Mackenzie...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But it's really not that big of a deal.\" She had an idea of how she could explain herself to Mackenzie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie opened the door and glared at Ellen. \"Not that big of a deal?! I was completely naked out there! How did that even happen?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie stood in the doorway wearing jeans and a black bra but nothing else. <i>Oops,</i> thought Ellen <i>I said fine, so she thinks she's fully dressed again.</i> \"Look, when I put you under hypnosis, one of the suggestions was that you would think you were naked when I said a certain word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought the audience would get a kick out of seeing you all embarrassed like that. And it worked! Tell me that wasn't our best show ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie did have to admit she had never seen the audience so thrilled by their routine before. \"Well what was the word?\" Mackenzie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly, Ellen said \"Please please <i>please</i> don't freak out okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen's quick thinking paid off as Mackenzie unhooked and removed her bra. \"I won't freak out this time.\" Mackenzie promised, stepping out of her jeans. She had no underwear on underneath, apparently having only the pair of panties she had left onstage today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naked.\" Ellen stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Mackenzie gasped, quickly covering her breasts and pussy out of reflex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" Ellen grinned, \"Hypnosis is powerful stuff, Mack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I guess.\" Mackenzie relented, slowly lowering her arms. \"So I'm fully clothed right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" Ellen lied, \"But if it makes you feel better you can go through the motions of getting dressed again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I think I'm gonna do that.\" Mackenzie replied, still embarrassed. She closed the door and came out a few minutes later fully dressed in what she had come to work in earlier that day. A t-shirt under a light blue sweater and jeans. Though, Ellen now knew, with no panties underneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls loaded up into Ellen's car and headed towards Mackenzie's place in silence. Mackenzie was still obviously uncomfortable with how the evening had ended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look don't worry Mack.\" Ellen began as she parked the car outside of the redhead's apartment. \"These hypnotic suggestions are short term. One good night's sleep and it'll be gone.\" <i>Though, it wouldn't be too hard to add in new ones at the next show...</i> Ellen thought, her mind buzzing with potential ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, El. That makes me feel a lot better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey how about we go out to breakfast tomorrow? My treat!\" Ellen offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we did just have our most successful show yet.\" Mackenzie admitted with a smile, \"Sounds good to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen headed home and Mackenzie walked up the steps to her apartment. Feeling drained, the redheaded beauty quickly washed off her makeup and changed into some light pajamas before promptly going to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Mackenzie sleep that night?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In it, she had been back onstage with Ellen, who was begging for help with some unknown problem. But soon the crowd of people in the audience had begun begging for help too. Their voices blended together with Ellen's until she could no longer tell them apart. And then they had begun to point and laugh at Mackenzie, who realized she was naked. She desperately tried to cover herself and flee but there seemed to be no escape from the mass of people around the stage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Haven't had a naked in public dream in a while.</i> Mackenzie thought to herself. She threw the blanket off of herself and was surprised to find herself naked in bed! <i>That's strange... I could've sworn I was wearing pajamas last night...</i> Mackenzie occasionally slept naked, but that was usually during the warmer weather of summer. She noticed her balled up pajamas at the foot of the bed. <i>Must have just been a warmer night,</i> the perplexed girl figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging it off, Mackenzie got up and showered, coming out of the bathroom in just a towel. She flicked on her radio then opened her closet doors, pondering what to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine with me Ted, but you've got to admit there's more to this story!\" Said a radio DJ to his co-host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie felt an odd sense of realization wash over her. She was already dressed perfectly fine as she was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please Todd. You know as much as I do that this story is just bogus!\" replied the other DJ hotly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie unfastened her towel and let it fall to the ground. Now naked, she began gathering up her purse and keys, ready to head out for the morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you wouldn't know the naked truth if it was staring right at ya!\" The radio argument continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie froze, suddenly feeling a chill over her entire body. In disbelief, she glanced down and found herself naked again. <i>What the hell?!</i> The nude redhead dropped her purse and rushed over to her closet, determined to get dressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Mackenzie, the hypnotic suggestion placed by Ellen had been altered and enhanced by her nightmare. Not only were the compulsions still there, but it now seemed like they could be triggered by anyone's voice. So as Mackenzie attempted to get fully dressed, the radio DJs continued their argument on the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow well does Mackenzie's dressing go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mackenzie barely had time to get ready before hopping in the news van and going downtown to cover the developing situation. The police had already blocked off the street by the time they arrived, their press credentials being the only thing allowing them to get closer to the bank itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera operator set up, framing the bank and the police surrounding the entrance behind Mackenzie. The operator gave Mackenzie a silent countdown to let her know they were live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are coming to you live downtown, where the Enfield &amp; Trustee Bank has just been robbed.\" Mackenzie began, quickly falling into her reporter persona. Now was the time for absolute professionalism, after all. \"Police have blocked off the streets and surrounded the building. We currently have no reports on how many suspects or hostages are inside the bank, nor have there been any demands from the suspects as of yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as if on cue, an officer approached Mackenzie and tried to get her attention from off camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, it seems the situation might be changing. Back to the studio while we learn what's going on.\" Mackenzie said, signaling the feed to cut. \"Yes, officer? What do you have for us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer seemed flustered, scratching the back of his neck as he avoided eye contact with Mackenzie. \"Well, ma'm, the suspects have given us one of their demands.\" the officer said. \"They're willing to release several hostages, but they want a way to address the public in exchange. More specifically, they want you and your camera inside in exchange for the hostages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie was understandably taken aback. They wanted to trade hostages for her? And the police were going along with it?! Wasn't putting a civilian like herself in harm's way contrary to what they came here to do? This couldn't be right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Mackenzie could protest, however, her earpiece came to life with her boss's voice.<br>\r\n\"We just heard about their demands, Mackenzie.\" her boss said. \"I'm telling you to go along with it. This is a huge story potential, and there's no way they'd hurt you on live television. Bank robbery is one thing, but murder is another entirely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo much for relying on her job to keep her safe. It looked as if the cops and her own workplace were willing to throw her to the wolves, and saying no would hurt her career... No, they were right. There's no way the robbers would hurt her, not with so many witnesses. She'd go in, they'd give their little speech, and the cops would eventually storm the place and arrest them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I'll do it.\" Mackenzie said with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer seemed relieved. \"Thank you, ma'm. You're doing something really heroic here, I want you to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did give Mackenzie some small solace as she approached the bank.

The scientists involved are extremely secretive about it. The only thing they've ever said is this is not a military facility or experimenting on anything too hazardous since it's too close to civilization and that the tight lips are mostly their own paranoia at work. In spite of this disclaimer, a huge cloud of smoke penetrated the building and warranted a hazmat team being sent in, as well as a joint effort from police and fire department to evacuate and cordon a small part of the city. A panic was spreading fast, and it was up to a news report to quell it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie and her team raced to the scene, and beat out their competition by a wide margin. Despite the lurches and shifts caused by the van's manic speed among common road hazards, most of the preparation were able to be completed en route, leaving their on site work restricted to preparing the equipment and adjusting Mackenzie's appearance. All the training in the world couldn't produce a team better qualified to mash up an unbiased and factual news report in the minutes they had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComplimenting their individual abilities was their team work. Mackenzie took care of her own make-up and her skirt suit personally, but the cameraman, Arron, was always ready to offer helpful hints. His keen aesthetic sense allowed him to establish the ideal angle, the one that would make Mackenzie \"outshine the stars\" as he unoriginally claimed, while also gauging the professionalism and allure of her appearance. At the same time, simple tongue twisters could be done to prepare for a public address, which was used to help test the sound equipment for Clark. And the tests from these two men allowed them to gauge the precise position and levels on their respective equipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe synchronization between these three was uncanny and made them feel like a family. This made it only more awkward when they weren't focused on the job. Compliments from Arron were usually an opening line when the Adonis tried to ask her out, and Clark's more casual attire was usually flashing his little friend from under his bulging belly. And every time Mackenzie would have to explain to Arron that she doesn't date coworkers or tell Clark to adjust himself and not wear sweat pants. All while ignoring their eyes clearly trying to undress her. It was practically ritualistic and immensely tedious, but thankfully it had yet to interfere with their professionalism. It might have something to do with their leader, Leah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the story was covered by Mackenzie and her admirers, ensuring the van's equipment was getting it back to the station and learning anything new on the story was Leah's role. She almost never got out of the van unless there was an emergency, but in exchange nothing short of a more important story ever interrupted the report, and any accidents were never broadcast over the airwaves, giving Mackenzie a reputation for care and quality. That is her official role. Unofficially meant keeping the team focused, ensuring these relationship dramas didn't send them into pandemonium. The petite blonde had more than enough pull around the studio to make her promises come true, as evidenced by Mackenzie having her name on the short list of potential studio anchors, beating out several more qualified newscasters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Leah running things, the team itself was flawless, even garnering rave reviews for giving all the facts instead of withholding elements to stoke the flames. If anything was holding them back, it was their equipment. Between the internet and the rest of the station's dubious reports, they weren't generating much money, and left them reusing older gear even though the age was starting to show. Thankfully this was a long standing problem, allowing teams to figure out plenty of ways to compensate, and none was more accustomed to these conditions than Mackenzie's team. Working exceptionally well in spite of this hindrance only earned the group more respect from their colleagues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince their own equipment checked out, Mackenzie crossed to the edge of the barricade, towards the busty brunette in a lab coat standing idle at the barricade. The gang was set to meet with one of the project's lead scientist at this spot, and all reason said this woman was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Nicholson?\" Mackenzie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman sighed. \"A month later, and they still haven't updated my file. It's Nicholson-Fontaine now.\" As she spoke, she flashed her left hand, and the rock adorning her gold band.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. For the interview, how about just Dr. Elysia? It's what everyone calls me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Works for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up, gang!\" Leah called through the earpieces. \"The monitors are running choppy again. My friends at the station mentioned we're coming in clear on the broadcast feed, so your equipment's all set. The problems are the van's monitors and the studio's live feed. I'm going to delay the signal back to the station to compensate while I try to fix things on our end. If anything happens before I'm done, it'll be up to you three to cut the power yourselves. The audio cutting will signal me and the studio to stop the broadcast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her earpiece Mackenzie could hear Michael, the studio anchor, already calling for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...bringing us the latest on this chemical accident is Mackenzie Fairbairn, on the scene. Mackenzie, how bad does it look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Thanks, Michael, and it's not how it looks that matters. As everyone can see, the cloud seems to dissipate well short of the barricade, but this doesn't mean anything. When the gas spreads out, it's diluting enough to not be visible, but not enough to reach a safe level for contact. It needs to keep spreading out before it's safe. So everyone watching at home, don't get any smart ideas about crossing the barricade just because it looks safe. Now, for further details on exactly what we're dealing with, we're fortunate to have Dr. Elysia Nicholson-Fontaine here to brief us. Dr. Elysia, thank you for your time. Now what exactly is this gas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wry smile and a shrug, Dr. Elysia says, \"'Exactly' is a little hard to define. The team had an accident and we're not entirely sure what this combination is. The good news is that none of chemicals our lab possesses are dangerous to humans, and no combination of them would react in such a manner to make them dangerous. The evacuation is more of a precaution due to the nature of our research.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up until now you've all been secretive about your research. With this accident and the public on alert, would you care to break silence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Elysia's smile turned into a grimace as her face became flushed. \"My team is employed by Winfield Pharmaceuticals. After the recent cold medicine they released was proven more effective at heightening stimulation and causing more powerful...reactions, the drug has been flying off the shelves. In response, the company has decided to continue research into...elation, for both traditional methods and more specialized preferences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Mackenzie began to blush. Researching aphrodisiacs, fetish tools, and recreational drugs? No wonder they were secretive, and why they sent Dr. Elysia. The other lead scientist on the file was a man - unless of course someone thought \"Hank\" would be a good name for a girl.

Since cutting out was left to her horny and rejected teammates, anything that compromised Mackenzie would leave them frozen in awe with their mouth's agape instead of sparing her any indignity.

The chemical that leaked was meant for female use, and research suggests men might not even be susceptible to the effects. However, with the possibility of the leak being contaminated by other materials, ah...\" Dr. Elysia trailed off. A flush was creeping up the doctor's cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if I'm understanding you, the gas is not actually dangerous to anybody's health. This containment is largely a safety precaution and preventative measure against collateral damage?\" Mackenzie pressed. It was paramount that she put the public's fears to rest.

Professionalism, in her opinion, meant tuning out distractions, not defusing them to return focus to herself, and the ear piece helped with this objective. At the same time, noise-canceling headphones were adorning the heads of her crew to allow them to hear only what the folks at home were hearing. The shoddy equipment ensured that was only the noise within about five feet of the microphone. Collectively, the bunch working on television couldn't hear anything outside their own circle, rendering the shouts from down the street an inaudible whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing around the bend was a group of four that a good number of the viewers could identify on sight. While much of their signature gear was missing, their faces were consistently plastered along every wall, and their fan base was ever growing. Even people who weren't big on their brand of music knew who they were, due in no small part to the lead runner's blue tresses. All four members of the local punk band Total Breakdown were racing towards the interview site, the only thing slowing them being their own inability to run a straight line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the direction was little more than an accident, their leader, Crystal, recognized an opportunity when she saw one. Of course, had there not been alcohol in her system, she may have recognized this was not such a good time for any efforts. And had her friends not been as wasted as her, they may have been able to come to the same realization. Instead, the group silently nodded their agreement to crash the interview and self-promote.

It made her blush heavily just to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie and Mackenzie often found themselves without customers, as they worked the day shifts, so to pass the time they usually played games.

Things got even worse as Mackenzie looked to her legs, normally when Debbie wore shorts she displayed her thong straps riding above it, but today they were nowhere to be seen, meaning she was going commando.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hello gorgeous!' Debbie greeted gleefully as she placed her handbag down on the counter, Debbie had a body rather similar to Mackenzie's.

Her outfit wasn't prudish! It just wasn't as revealing as what Debbie was comfortable parading around in. There was no point in debating that with the other woman, of course, as Mackenzie had learned before. Mackenzie hastily slipped into the stock room, using it as an impromptu changing room to keep Debbie from getting more of a show than she was already in for. Even having agreed to this stupid dare, Mackenzie couldn't help the shaking of her hands as she unbuttoned her blouse and unzipped her skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling down her stockings and peeling off her underwear was the hardest part. Mackenzie wanted to try and bargain with Debbie to keep at least her undergarments, but the terms of the dare were clear: they were going to swap their entire outfits. Besides, there was no way a bra would have worked with the tight halter top Debbie had elected to wear. Now standing naked in the stock room, Mackenzie gathered up her clothes in one hand and opened the door a crack, just enough to reach through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Here's my stuff. Hurry up and give me yours!\" Mackenzie pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie took her sweet time, likely relishing the idea of drawing out Mackenzie's naked helplessness. Eventually, however, the door opened once more, and the scant clothing was tossed through. Mackenzie wasted no time in getting dressed once more, stepping out from the stock room and back to the store proper. Debbie had wasted no time in \"modifying\" Mackenzie's outfit; the blouse was unbuttoned far enough to show off a great deal of cleavage, enough to make it clear there was no bra underneath. The skirt had been hiked up to show off as much leg as possible, and Mackenzie had a feeling Debbie had elected not to wear the provided panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead thought about asking for the panties if Debbie wasn't going to wear them, but knew better than to ask. It would have been useless to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy now?\" Mackenzie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now. The day is young, Mack.

The young couple giggling more as Mackenzie heard a few sucking noises coming from above before she realised they were going to start making out right above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCursing her bad luck, Mackenzie tried to calm her breathing and glanced down, through the open gaps in the floor she saw just how high the passenger car was being raised and her eyes widened. Normally she didn't have a problem with heights, but staring directly and unrestrained at the ground from meters high in the air made her stomach flutter, along with a few other feelings...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the girl above moan, Mackenzie quickly forgot about the increasing height between her and the amusement park grounds and attempted to look upwards to see what was happening. \"Oh Ty, this is so hot- oh ohhh...\" Mackenzie looked up and saw now movement that would indicate what was going on, a change in light to her right then gave her all the information she needed. The girl's legs were spread on the ground and her boyfriend was eating her out! Not more than a meter away from where Mackenzie was hiding, naked and still somewhat aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now's not the time to think about that.\" Mackenzie reminded herself, the moans coming from the girl above didn't seem to be ceasing any time soon and the boy eating her out seemed relentless in making her cum. Closing her eyes and ignoring the erotic scene surrounding her Mackenzie tried to forget the cool night air brushing against her exposed pussy sitting in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of enjoyment the girl finally came and spent most of the time panting in gratitude as the guy simply sat and kissed her neck, Mackenzie's hand slowly danced to her sex as she felt her arousal increase. Just before her fingers could begin to pleasure her she heard a ~clank~ noise and saw the passenger car door open, the young couple got out, still giggling and the amusement park employee moved away from the car. Carefully and slowly Mackenzie raised the compartment lid and peeked out the window, her breasts bare to anyone who might walk into the car, looking out Mackenzie saw that the park was closing, many of the rides had already been shut, the Ferris Wheel was usually the last one to close as it was a favourite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking her chance Mackenzie looked around further and saw no one in site except for a few park workers near the ticket collection area, Mackenzie hopped out of the compartment and steadied herself as she became used to steady ground again.

Surely it would be warm... Mackenzie realised what she was considering and asked herself if it was really worth it. The latch on the glass was a simple one that would come apart easily, and she was sure she could fit in without being spotted due to how bloody big the thing was. Suddenly as Mackenzie heard a ruffling noise behind her she made her decision quickly, covering her freezing breasts and pussy before sprinting to the machine for cover. Despite holding her breasts they jiggled uncontrollably with every pace as well as her ass bouncing tremendously as she ran. Looking back she noticed no one behind her, the noise must have been a piece of rubbish in the wind, Mackenzie sighed in relief and looked at the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing her hand to the glass she could feel the warmth from inside as the kernels popped away slowly, she carefully undid the latch at the top of the machine and pulled it down until she could comfortably lift her leg through, spilling a few pieces onto the ground she quickly jumped in and brought the pane of glass back up and heard it lock again. Standing up straight Mackenzie could feel the hot air blowing onto her thighs and sighed in pleasure, the warm popcorn gathered easily around her thighs and she saw that it reached just above the curve of her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling to herself, Mackenzie scooped up a small handful of popcorn from in front of her crotch and popped it into her mouth. Suddenly, her neck snapped to the side as she saw something in her peripheral vision, the vendor was coming back! Quickly ducking down Mackenzie completely surrounded herself in the popcorn after making sure none of her long red hair was showing. She felt it draw over her naked body as she ducked down as it parted for her easily, unfortunately she got plenty of pieces stuck in her asscrack and flinched a few times as they rustled over her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing she noticed was the smell invading her nose as she sat, huddled with her knees to her chest, the second thing she noticed not long after was the heat. The heating vent for the machine was blowing directly onto her crotch, shuddering tightly she bit her lip as a strange sense of arousal came over her as her clit started tingling along with her breasts as the popcorn continued covering her. Remembering the popcorn vendor she steadied her senses and tried to listen out for him, he seemed to be closing up shop as she heard the cash register clang shut and the bags being put away into the metal drawers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden she felt a shift in gravity as the machine was tilted and the heater was unplugged, he was wheeling the popcorn machine somewhere! Feeling her heart race Mackenzie began wondering where he was taking her as she began moving, the further away he took her the further away she was from coverage, and the possibilities got worse and worse as she thought on. The popcorn moved with gravity as it began pressing against her, with her eyes closed she clamped her thighs together as it continued brushing up against her crotch, continuing to make her horny, she pressed against the glass of the machine facing the ground, she felt her nipples squash into her breasts and winced as her weight pressed against it, praying it wouldn't break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Roger,\" yelled a voice from afar, \"you ready to leave yet?\" Mackenzie guessed she was another amusement park employee and her heart skipped a beat as the machine stopped wheeling momentarily. \"In a few minutes,\" Roger the popcorn vendor replied, \"I'm just off to...\"</span></div></div>",

Mackenzie then felt her gravity sway completely as she was thrown into the back of a truck, \"Oh shit, I'm really in for it now.\" Mackenzie thought as she lay sideways, hearing the other boxes being piled around her and on top of her. Escape was now, pretty much impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant truck door slid shut with a bang and Mackenzie's fate was now sealed, as she lay in the truck she breathed slowly to try and calm herself, she felt her naked butt shift slightly on the cardboard and unconsciously opened her knees, feeling her body calm. She felt her hands draw across her breasts and sighed in arousal, she hadn't yet come and smiled to herself, she was in a box, in the back of a van, completely naked and with no prying eyes around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie began rubbing and pulling at her nipples, letting herself moan as much as she pleased. Running a hand down her stomach her cold skin shivered to the touch and her thighs received a much needed touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like an hour, and one or two orgasms Mackenzie felt the truck pull to a halt. She swallowed, feeling her mouth dry up rather quickly. She heard some friendly greetings outside the truck and the large, door opened, some voices directed some other voices to a location and they began moving boxes. When Mackenzie's box was finally pulled from the truck she didn't hear anything to give her a hint to her location, there was some civilisation she heard in the distance but apart from that there was only the noises of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boxes were placed down and Mackenzie's brain went into panic as a sharp blade cut through the tape of her box!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie's panic was done away with quickly though as a voice told her carrier to help move more of the boxes, they all left. Mackenzie took her opportunity and peeked out of the box, she didn't know how many people were carrying the boxes, and she didn't know when they'd be back. Standing up quickly her naked body was once again bare to the world, before she could take a step however she felt the knots in her spine and did a few stretches, moaning as she heard her back crack. She giggled slightly as she imagined how she must look, completely naked with her crotch thrust forward and upper body bent back as far as it could go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up straight, Mackenzie looked around as she realised where she was.</span></div></div>",

She continued thrusting deep onto his dick as they kissed and she let out a long, pleasured moan, Mackenzie pulled her hands closer to her body though she convinced herself that was just for warmth. Moving her hand slowly down her stomach Mackenzie started slowly curling it along her lips, she let out a small moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple had no idea of Mackenzie's presence and so they fucked even harder, the man raised his legs slightly before carefully moving the girl to the ground and onto her butt, she leaned down on her elbows and he quickly slid into her, thrusting so hard into her that her head rolled backwards and her mouth curled into an \"O\" shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie began pumping her fingers in and out of her pussy as she grew more and more aroused, watching this couple screw out in the open turned her on to no end.

The script bearer leaned back in disbelief and walked off somewhere angrily as the Hawaiin shirt-guy slumped down in the Directors chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mackenzie was still struggling to take all of this in she saw a tent slightly further away from all the others with a few outfits inside, skimpy one no doubt but clothing she could use.

She then hurried to her right of the set where she came across a slightly smaller ledge and looked around carefully, once she was sure she was covered from the pornographers she hopped down from the ridge and carefully crept back in their direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling a branch downwards from a tree she saw the set and the tent filled with the clothing. Waiting for no more than a minute Mackenzie made the perfect dash to the tent as the Director called for everyones focus as he began talking to them all, in no less than a few seconds Mackenzie had made it inside the tent and let out a breath of relief as she began looking around.

She turned around to see the woman standing there, but she wasn't even looking at Mackenzie, she was searching through a large duffel bag on the ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie was about to speak up when the woman looked to her and smiled slightly, \"Don't mind me, I'm just looking for the 77mm lens, to be honest I find it kind of ridiculous that a shoot like this needs so many cameras but I guess you guys are all taking it seriously so I suppose I should be as well.\" She said casually with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie was lost for words, she had no idea why this lady was so chill about her blatant nudity. She was about to speak up when the woman continued talking as she noticed Makenzies hands on her tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about getting them up right now. I've been talking to the make-up squad, apparently they can make them look pointy from any angle, and I didn't even know that they used that much make-up in porn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie felt her blush deepen as she realised what was going on, the woman clearly thought Mackenzie to be a porn actress, it made sense since she was in a porn actresses booth completely naked with her hands basically feeling up her own tits. She thought quickly, if she corrected the situation that would lead to a very awkward scenario as people would question where a nude girl in the woods came from. If she took the persona of a porn actress, however, it would be understandable for her to be frolicking around in the buff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...... yeah.... sorry, I just...uh.....love to make sure they look go- good for the cameras!\" Her voice rattled as she spoke, she knew it wouldn't take anything other than her nudity to convince someone she was supposed to be on set but nevertheless she quivered in anxiety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman laughed, and stood back up as she pulled the camera lens from the bag, \"Well I'll tell the make-up crew you're ready for them, the director wants filming over within the next hour or so, so they'll probably rush you through it a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie's eyes widened and her heart began to beat even faster than before, a chill ran over her body as she realised she was expected to be filmed, doing what she had no idea but it would be lewd, no doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-um sure..\" She replied hazily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smiled at her one last time as she left the tent and began walking back to the set. \"Cynthia! Debbs! She's ready for you in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh god,</i> Mackenzie thought to herself, <i>they want me to get naked up there! Shit, how did I get into this mess, better yet how do I get out of it?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie's train of thought was interrupted as two gorgeous women clad in body-hugging clothes entered the tent. They were both young and carrying bags of make-up tools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hi.\" Mackenzie greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello sweetie,\" one replied casually in a Californian accent, \"I didn't realise we were using the understudy today, when did they bring you in?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie thought her answer through carefully, \"Um, just today, I got the call this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither one seemed fazed by this answer as they shrugged and began opening their make-up bags. \"So, should I sit down?\" Mackenzie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, just stay where you are, and take your hands off your chest, we can work on that.\" The other crew member answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then pulled out a blush brush and began powdering it over Mackenzie's tits, the tickling sensation was light at first, and she could feel her chest redden in embarrassment as she stood naked in front of two strangers as they polished her body with make-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yelped suddenly in surprise as she felt another brush around her ass, \"Sorry to scare you darling,\" The other woman said as she knelt on the ground behind Mackenzie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie spent the next five minutes being tickled, poked and brushed up as they applied foundation to her face, chest, thighs and ass. Funnily enough they applied much less to her face than she expected, only a light layer of eyeshadow to go with the blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go.\" Announced the Californian woman as she finished touching up the colouring of Mackenzies ass. To do this she was an all fours with her knees locked as she let the woman prod all around her behind, by the end of it she wondered if she even needed the blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two crew members then helped Mackenzie up as they packed away their things. \"Now, just head out to the set area and they can begin filming. Oh, and don't forget to tell them your name since you're an understudy, they have the list at the studio but if the main actress pulled out then they wouldn't have brought it with them.\" She explained sweetly, giving Mackenzie a quick pat on the behind as she left, causing her to jump slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked out and saw various people moving around the camera area, people holding lights, boom mics, sitting at the cameras, all pointed on one space in the clearing. Mackenzie could hear her heart beat in her chest, telling her to run away, but yet she moved, walking at a steady pace towards the tens of people who were expecting her to... she realised in that moment she didn't even know what they were expecting to do.

It was plainly obvious she wasn't wearing a bra underneath. One, the waistband was holding on just above her chest, with her bare shoulders baring no straps.

It hugged the contours of her upper body, and with the cold wind blowing up on the Ferris wheel, Mackenzie could count two more reasons it was obvious she didn't have a bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn contrast, away from the waistband, the skirt was almost <i>too</i> loose. It was long enough that, even the way she was wearing it, it still pretty easily covered everything she wanted it too.

As it was, even with her arms pressing it down, there was still a horrible draft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving situated herself as best as she could, Mackenzie turned her attention back to Willow, who had tied her jacket around her waist to make up for the lack of skirt.

The \"dress\" was definitely shorter than it had been a few moments ago!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Willow noticed the thread trailing behind the redhead and had to suppress an excited gasp. Checking the bottom of the dress again, it had already risen another half inch, even in those few seconds! The curve of Mackenzie's ass cheeks was starting to peek out as she walked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Mackenzie still hadn't noticed her newest predicament. She was intently focused on reaching the park entrance, still a few hundred meters away. One arm was draped halfheartedly in front of her chest with the other hand pinning the dress down at her crotch. And the rapidly rising edge of the fabric was quickly approaching that hand. If Mackenzie felt the dress rip away from her fingers, the jig was up for Willow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly, she tugged on Mackenzie's arm and stopped walking, \"Mackenzie, hold on a second!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" the distracted girl asked, coming to a stop a moment later than Willow. The extra distance let Willow hold Mackenzie's arm slightly away from her body as the dress continued its ride up her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow stared ahead at the entrance intently, as if critically examining it. \"Look at that crowd.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie followed her gaze towards the park entrance and the large crowd slowly entering it. She began to feel nervous as she took stock of how many people were walking around and bumping into each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might be best to find a side exit or something.\" Willow said helpfully, \"Unless you'd like to try to push through that crowd.\" Willow heard Mackenzie give a small gulp and smiled at her nervousness. In truth, alerting her to the crowd was for phase 2 of her hastily concocted plan. Phase 1 was to simply keep her hand away from her body while the unweaving continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd did it ever continue. Mackenzie's pussy was now completely in view, with the dress falling to the patch of hair accompanying it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do?\" asked Mackenzie, nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow pretended to think it over while she stalled for time. She wanted Mackenzie to be absolutely and completely \"ready\" for their exit from the park. The dress was making good time, though, already around the level of her hips, and now covering absolutely none of the girl's curvy ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Willow?\" Mackenzie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Willow said slowly, as if deep in thought. Truly the hardest part for her was stalling for time without turning to see the goods she knew were being exposed. But she knew it would be worth it soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long does Willow wait?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The former skirt was now only a foot and a half long, but at least it was no longer shrinking on the poor girl. She gave a sigh of relief as the freed thread was pulled towards the ferris wheel. Her relief was short lived as someone behind her suddenly shouted \"Whoa, nice ass!\" This snapped the girl back to reality and she suddenly remembered that there was a crowd of people behind her. Even worse, the shout had started to get the attention of others, and Mackenzie could already hear laughter beginning to bubble up from the crowd of onlookers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clamped one hand over her pussy and tried her best to cover her shapely ass with the other. Mackenzie stood frozen, face a deep red, as more and more eyes focused on her bare body. <i>This can't be happening this can't be happening no no no no!</i> There were several shouts and jeers to go along with the laughter now, and more than a few cell phones pulled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mackenzie!\" Willow shouted, trying to snap her friend out of it, \"Mack come on!\" That seemed to bring her back to her senses enough to notice what Willow was saying. \"Come on, let's get out of here quick!

Great, glad to hear it. See you soon, Lily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat name rang a bell. Lily was one of Willow's ex-girlfriends; the two had stayed on good terms after they split up, and Mackenzie had gone out on the town with the both of them a few times. The naked redhead didn't know Lily too terribly well, but well enough to know that the looks the other woman gave her weren't always exactly innocent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lily? Why'd you call her?\" Mackenzie asked, dreading the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew she'd be quick to drive over here when I told her about how you were naked and touching yourself in the middle of the amusement park.\" Willow stated. \"Don't worry, I asked her to bring you something to wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat actually put Mackenzie's mind at ease somewhat. Willow's logic for calling Lily made sense, even if it was perverted, and if it meant she got something to wear, well, all the better. That didn't make the remainder of the ride on the ferris wheel any less awkward for the bombshell redhead. Blushing, Mackenzie could only curl up on the seat and try to ignore the lecherous stare Willow was fixing her with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the car was reaching the bottom of the wheel, Willow looked out and smiled. \"There she is.\" she said. \"She'll be super happy to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily was indeed quite thrilled to see Mackenzie. Standing in the entrance to the car to block Mackenzie's naked body from the rest of the park's view, Lily drank in every detail of the redheads stunning form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So very nice to see you, Mackenzie. All of you.\" Lily said with a devious smile. \"Now, here's the clothing I promised. Though I'd suggest you not get too comfortable; it's just so we can get you out of the park without any issues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an icy feeling of dread, Mackenzie took the offered garment.

That's the deal, take it or leave it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow couldn't be serious. She was essentially asking Mackenzie to become her slave, subject to her every whim and command. But what could Mackenzie do to oppose her? She wanted to believe that Willow wasn't the kind of person to do something so cruel, but she also never expected her friend to do anything like this. Mackenzie wasn't sure what to believe about Willow anymore. There was one thing for certain: she couldn't risk letting that video go public. She'd be ruined! She'd never be able to look anybody in the eye ever again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... I'll do it. Anything you say, just don't show that video to anybody.\" Mackenzie said quietly, hanging her head in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! That's a good girl!\" Willow said excitedly as she hopped up from her seat. \"Now, with that settled, I do have something you can wear. It's not great, but it's certainly better than letting a bunch of strangers seeing that hot little body of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie quickly caught the wadded pile of plastic-feeling material thrown her way. Shaking it out, the redhead found herself holding a rain poncho. The poncho was semi-translucent, meaning her body would be fairly well outlined even while wearing it, but it would at least theoretically obscure everything it needed to. Still, it wasn't exactly built to stay put in harsh winds, or even anything more than a light jog...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and put that on. Meanwhile, I'll think of your first task as my new... er, let's call it... pet!\" Willow declared. \"My first command might come at any time. Maybe once we step off the ride, maybe later tonight, maybe a week from now! Who knows? Doesn't the prospect excite you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcitement was the last emotion Willow's words brought to Mackenzie's mind. She was terrified of what Willow might have in store for her, and when. Even worse, the mystery and suspense of when Willow's first order would come put the redhead on edge.</span></div></div>",

As the first cars crested the peak of the track, Mackenzie gripped the safety bar tightly with a mix of fear and anticipation. And then the cars were off, rocketing down the tracks at breakneck speed. The wind roared around Mackenzie as she let out a thrilled yell of her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the drop, Mackenzie's butt had risen slightly off the seat. The wind furiously pushed up her dress, but the tight safety bar against her lap had prevented the garment from riding up too much. Still, when her rear returned to the seat cushion, her dress had risen a little bit higher up her legs, and a little bit more of her thighs were in contact with the seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie didn't even notice as the ride continued, racing along incredibly fast. But then, the process repeated itself at the next drop. The dress rose up slightly higher, and by the end of the descent, some of Mackenzie's ass was also in bare contact with the seat. Again and again the roller coaster rose and fell, lifting the hem of the beauty's dress a little each time. And each time, the dress came closer and closer to being free of the restrictive safety bar holding it in place. Mackenzie was far too enthralled with the ride to notice the gradual sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the cars reached the peak before the final drop, Mackenzie's dress was only barely under her at all. Her pussy was only partially covered and her ass was almost completely uncovered. Only her positioning in the car shielded them from view of the other riders. Mackenzie steeled herself for the final drop. As she plummeted downwards, she threw her arms up over her head in wild glee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the last inch of the dress slipped free of the safety bar. The rushing wind immediately took hold of the dress. With no resistance from her arms, the dress shot up Mackenzie's body and was quickly whisked right over her head. Mackenzie was now completely naked in the roller coaster car! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie hadn't even registered what had happened quite yet when there was a sudden flash and the ride began slowing down. She could suddenly feel the wind all over her body. Glancing down, Mackenzie gave a shriek at the sight of her completely naked form. She quickly threw her arms in front of her body, right as the cars pulled back into the loading station where a crowd of people was waiting to board the ride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cars came to a halt and the crowd began cheering and shouting at the sight of the naked bombshell in front of them. Mackenzie wanted desperately to flee the crowded area, but the safety bar was still holding her securely in place. A few agonizing moments later it disengaged and Mackenzie wasted no time in exiting the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sprinted towards the exit sign, giving the waiting crowd a spectacular view of her ass while she ran. Mackenzie had no idea what to do! She was stuck in the middle of a busy amusement park with nothing but a pair of shoes. Her dress, her only form of cover, was gone. Surely it was now in some unreachable part of the roller coaster grounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Checking out different haunted house attractions was a bit of a hobby for Mackenzie, and she'd heard that this particular one had undergone some fairly major redesigns since she last checked it out. Needless to say, the redhead was curious as to what was new and improved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving along the queue, Mackenzie patiently waited for her turn, listening to the prerecorded screams and growls that added ambiance. With approval, Mackenzie noticed that the outside facade of the attraction was visibly improved from last time, actually giving forth a creepy appearance. Hopefully the inside would prove similarly improved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally stepping inside, Mackenzie's eyes took a moment to adjust to the low light of the main entrance. Right away Mackenzie could see that things were very different. Rather than a linear path, the entrance offered three different doors to choose from, each with a sign hanging above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Mackenzie's left was a door labeled \"Gardens\" with creeping vines and mist creeping out and into the main room. The door directly ahead had a lopsided sign saying \"Dining Room\", likely the main path most people were expected to go down. Finally, to Mackenzie's right, was a door labelled \"Basement\" with a set of stairs descending into darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready knowing what piqued her interest, Mackenzie quickly made her way toward the-</span></div></div>",

One, the carpet may have seemed nice around the table, but under the table, it was rather dirty.

She can't do something like that right here and now. sure the thrills, scares, and terrified feeling of uncertainty was a turn on but someone was watching... Unless they just lifted the dress and left to let her imagination run wild and do whatever came natural to her in private. This would be a really high quality haunted house if they put that much though and psychology into it genuine exhibitionists must love this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if they just lifted her dress and left then she could pull her dress down, and either keep looking for her shoes or back out safely, but then that would ruin the great illusion of fear they had going, and there is still the very scary possibility that someone was still there possibly even filming this though the the scarier the possibility the more thrilling it was also....

Being naked alone was uncomfortable enough, but now she'd be sharing the experience with another equally naked woman. In a way this just made the whole situation more embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, uh, let me think.\" Mackenzie said. She had to think of what to do. She didn't actually have any kind of plan, but Lana didn't need to know that. If at least one of them put forth an air of being in control, it might bolster both of them. \"Okay, these places usually have fairly standard layouts, right?

For one thing, she was a lot taller than Mackenzie. Secondly, while she wasn't as curvy as Mackenzie was, Lana was <i>very</i> athletic. The fact that she could just reach to the edge of the pool and hoist herself up from the water was testament to that enough but the view was another thing entirely.  Mackenzie was right behind Lana as she climbed up, and as Lana was bent over the side, she was giving Mackenzie quite an eyeful. Even covered in the red liquid as she was, Mackenzie could easily see how taut the Asian girl's muscles were, how toned her legs were, and how firm her as--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cough brought her back to reality, with Lana crouched at the poolside extending a hand to the red-head.

The library was crammed full of shelves reaching the ceiling, each packed tight with various dusty old tomes.

I swear, it's like this house is messing with us.\" Mackenzie said, plopping down in front of the fireplace as she watched the flames die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's kind of the idea behind a haunted house, but I get what you mean. Talk about bad luck.\" Lana muttered. Staring into the dying fire, however, the athletic woman noticed something Mackenzie didn't. \"Hey, I think there's something behind that fireplace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised, Mackenzie looked harder at the fireplace, and saw that Lana was indeed correct. The flames had hidden the open crawlspace at the back of the fireplace when they had been roaring, but as they shrank and fizzled out it came into view once more. Sure, a hidden tunnel in a fireplace wasn't the most inviting path in the world, but being locked naked in a library wasn't much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it'll lead us to something we can wear.\" Mackenzie mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took the words right out of my mouth.\" Lana said, wasting no time in quickly extinguishing the remaining flames and crawling into the fireplace. \"Ick, there's a lot of soot, just so you know. And we're gonna have to go one at a time. Just stay behind me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of crawling through soot wasn't exactly appealing, and crawling directly behind Lana's naked form would make keeping her eyes forward more than a little awkward, but Mackenzie wasn't about to try arguing. The less time wasted, the better. And pointing out the fact that Lana was effectively flashing Mackenzie in this plan was a conversation the redhead really didn't feel like having.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a reluctant sigh, Mackenzie slowly followed Lana into the crawlspace, unable to keep herself from occasionally glancing at the sight of the Asian woman's prominently displayed posterior. The light was low, but proximity still made it possible to see some of the other woman's more intimate details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie was so focused on trying not to focus on what was in front of her, that she was caught completely off guard as-</span></div></div>",

Of course, all she saw were books, books, and more books. None of that was exactly helpful. With an annoyed sigh, Mackenzie idly flipped the pages of an open book on a small table near the fire. However, the paper of the page stuck to her fingers, tearing away from the book as Mackenzie pulled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Mackenzie looked at the small scraps of paper clinging to her fingertips.

A few minutes of struggling accomplished nothing more than working up a sweat. Her hips were stuck snug against the opening of the vent, caught as they were along with the hem of her dress. That raised other problems on its own; every time she tried to push forward, she was stopped fast against the straps of her dress as her shoulders pulled them taut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis left Mackenzie with a very limited amount of options. She could just keep trying to wiggle forward. She had no lack of determination, that was for sure- but her common sense was telling her that pulling on the dress too much could mean trouble. Of course, that was only slightly more risky that the <i>other</i> idea she had. If she pulled her arms out from under the straps, maybe she could wiggle her whole body through the top of her dress. She'd be <i>naked</i>, yeah.... but only momentarily! Once she was all the way into the vent she could pull her dress in after herself. Mackenzie might feel a little vulnerable for a moment, but it was a better thought out plan than just brute forcing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to waste anymore time with her bare bottom sticking out into an open room, Mackenzie quickly started on her chosen course of action....</span></div></div>",

She yelped, her anxiety replaced by utter shock as she was forced slowly into the vent by this mysterious assailant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, she didn\u2019t actually move much; rather, the force of the push simply caused her rear to spread out as the stranger\u2019s hands sank into her soft ass. But, after a moment, the pressure proved to be too great, and she slowly but surely oozed into the vent entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mackenzie was sent into the pitch darkness of the vent, all she had to ground herself were a sequence of sounds: the loud rrrrrip of her dress being completely torn to shreds down the back, followed by a deep, spine-chilling laugh, finally punctuated by the unmistakeable CLANG of a metal hatch slamming shit behind her. Then, silence. Mackenzie was now nude and completely isolated in the vent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only good news was the fact that, with her dress out of the equation, she was no longer as tightly-packed into the vent as she had been, giving her a certain degree of mobility\u2014albeit, a very small one. Moving even an inch required quite a bit of effort, and the walls of the vent still pressed tightly on her shapely hips and ass, as well as sending a chill through her now-exposed nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way she saw it, she had two equally terrible options available to her: she could either press deeper into this seemingly very long ventilation shaft, or attempt to kick open the hatch behind her to back out. The former option seemed tiring and potentially dangerous, though the latter seemed impractical at best given how restricted her leg movement was. Additionally, if her mystery assailant was still in the room, she wasn\u2019t sure she WANTED to go back. It was bad enough that they had seen her exposed ass like that, but for them to see her completely naked? The thought was too much to bear. Plus, she didn\u2019t know who they were.

That was a blessing at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelaxing slightly, but unwilling to remove her arms from her body, Mackenzie approached the vent once again. She moved slowly, wary of the animatronic monster popping out again, but it never did. She leaned down and did her best to peer inside, hoping to spot her dress.

Her outstretched fingers searched tentatively for the feeling of fabric. She leaned in further, her head now inside the ventilation shaft. Mackenzie shuddered as the tips of her hanging breasts brushed against the cold metal bottom. Still no sign of her dress. Mackenzie huffed in frustration before resuming her earlier position. She was now half lying in the vent, and half awkwardly standing outside it, with her curvy ass and even more on display to the room behind her. Without the bunched up fabric around her hips, Mackenzie found she had just enough wiggle room to successfully shimmy herself further into the metal tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring she could always back out if she needed to, Mackenzie dragged her torso further into the shaft. The cold grimy metal slid under her body as her feet slowly rose from the floor behind her. A few more pulls and the naked beauty was fully inside the ventilation shaft. And she still hadn't felt any sign of her dress! <i>The animatronic must be able to move further down this than I realized.</i> she thought. <i>Maybe I should slide back out. Who knows how far this vent goes for!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a moment later, there was a metallic CLANG! from behind Mackenzie. She couldn't quite see in the tightness of the shaft, but was able to feel it with her feet. A metallic grate had slid over the entrance to the tunnel! Feeling a surge of panic, Mackenzie tried to press the grate with her feet, but it wouldn't budge. And in the tight confines, she couldn't even wind up her legs to give it a good kick. There was no way Mackenzie was coming out of the grate she'd come in. She thought about calling out for help, but quickly decided against it. She <i>definitely</i> didn't want anyone finding her in a position like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie gulped, already knowing there was only one way she could proceed from here. She began her slow crawl forward, moving through the dusty shaft inch by inch. Her whole body was in contact with the cold metal the whole way. Her nipples, already hard from the cold, got the worst of it. Every time Mackenzie advanced, her sensitive tips were dragged across the stiff, unforgiving surface. She stifled a noise between a moan and a whimper and soldiered forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter crawling for what seemed like hours, Mackenzie was reaching her wit's end. Covered in dirt, sweat, and grime, she was whimpering with each movement now. Mackenzie was exhausted and her poor nipples felt rubbed raw by now. Dress and dignity long forgotten, Mackenzie only craved to be free from this long tunnel that had tormented her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...\" she muttered, her mouth dry. \"Just end already...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, Mackenzie got her wish.

Looking at every mirror, she held a hand over her mouth to prevent any scream from lettin people know where she was. Everything was on display in every angle. She tried covering her boobs and crotch, but that just left her ass open. <i>Where the fuck is my dress?! Oh why didn't I put on at least some panties.</i> Mackenzie's thoughts were soon interrupted by the sound of teenagers laughing. She could ask for help, but in her state, did not want to be seen either. Despite just modeling not three minutes ago.</span></div></div>",

A large wave was forming behind her, and it quickly scooped her up in its wake, catching Mackenzie off guard and tossing her head-over-heels into the water.

Of course, any relief she felt washed away in the surf as her hands travelled lower along her body. Finding no fabric around her waist, she reached along the length of her legs, but still found nothing. Mackenzie gasped, before taking a deep breath and submerging herself, confirming her fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lower half of her suit has been swept away by the wave; evidently it's knots weren't tied as well as her upper half. Now, instead of the crimson cloth she had been wearing, the only red below her waist was in the patch of hair between her legs. Looking around under the water, Mackenzie couldn't see her suit anywhere, and as she resurfaced, her cheeks rapidly started turning almost as red as the missing garment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What am I going to do?</i> she thought, bobbing in the surf. Though the water wasn't perfectly clear, it was hardly good cover, so one of Mackenzie's hands had drifted over to cover her crotch, the other still helping her tread water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were plenty of people in the water closer to shore, which Mackenzie obviously wasn't happy about; still, maybe some kind soul would be willing to help her. Of course, the desperate swimmer also noticed how many of those people were women wearing two-piece suits like herself. Mackenzie didn't like the idea of stealing, or of letting someone else deal with the situation she was in, but when it came down to it, she'd rather walk out of the water fully dressed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot liking either of those options, Mackenzie noticed that there was a pier on one side of the beach. If she could swim there unnoticed, she would at least be one step closer to safety, if not modesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the shifting waters brush up against her bare backside, Mackenzie made the decision to...</span></div></div>",

The redhead felt comfortable enough in the water and was confident in her ability to maneuver swiftly and quietly. It wasn't the most honorable thing in the world, but the situation was desperate. The bottomless woman glanced around at the various women in the surf, assessing them from afar to find one that matched her figure the closest. If she was going to steal a woman's bottoms, she was going to steal ones that fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie found her best option about halfway between her current location and the shore. A curvy brunette laughing with a few of her friends, her figure flattered by her bright pink bikini. This wouldn't be easy.

The last thing Mackenzie needed right now was to be caught trying to steal someone else's bikini; it would NOT be fun trying to explain herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Mackenzie slipped beneath the surface of the water, quickly kicking her way over to her target.

As she made her way back to the resort, her situation seemed to fully sink in when she considered how different things had been as she made her way onto the beach that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach step she took was careful and timid, though it wasn't simply because of her ill-fitting wardrobe. It hadn't occurred to her she had also lost her sandals to the thief until her bare feet met with the blacktop, which now burned under the midday sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leering was making her uncomfortable as well, though in a different sense. On the way to the beach, she noticed plenty of people staring at her, and found it flattering at best, and only slightly off-putting at worst. Now, people weren't staring, they were <i>leering</i>. Aside from the fact that she was certainly showing more of herself, her demeanor had gone from confident to near-panicked, and the same heads she had delighted in turning that morning were now boring into her, lazer-pointed between her legs as she approached, and almost certainly catching every bounce as her backside came into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the worst part, Mackenzie thought, was the heat. The resort was air-conditioned, almost chilled, and that cool air had held her over until she had first touched the sand. But that had been what seemed like ages ago, and the daylight had only grown brighter since. Now, with the sun beating right above her, and the sidewalk sizzling beneath her, Mackenzie was sweating. The bottoms, already undersized and uncomfortable, clung even more to every curve, straining the strings as the fabric bunched up in some very intimate areas. Even her top was getting clingy, Mackenzie adjusting it as she walked, almost caring more about comfort than cover at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, with her awkward gait, constant readjustment, and sweaty skin, the inevitable happened.

For the sake of her tenuous bottoms, she didn't dare walk any faster, despite her topless state. One arm covered her bare chest and the other was pinned to the bikini bottoms to make sure they stayed in place. Although there were still a few people in the immediate area, the coast was relatively clear. Mackenzie only heard one more catcall before she successfully arrived at the entrance to her hotel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie gave a massive sigh of relief at the feeling of the cool air rushing over her body. The hotel lobby wasn't crowded but it was certainly far from empty as people milled about in every direction. Mackenzie gulped upon noticing that she was again drawing stares from most of the onlookers. She quickly made her way over to the concierge desk and had to wait an agonizing minute before a hotel employee was free. He was a young man looking to be around the same age as Mackenzie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I uh... help you?\" he asked with raised eyebrows as Mackenzie approached the counter. Her right arm covering her breasts did nothing to hide the fact that she completely topless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my, uh, room key was stolen.\" Mackenzie replied, her face red. \"Room 546.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" the concierge replied, peeling his eyes away from Mackenzie's bare skin. He typed on his computer for a few moments before looking up and asking, \"Mackenzie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's me!\" she replied sheepishly. Even facing the counter, Mackenzie could still feel all the eyes staring at her partially exposed backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You uh... don't happen to have ID do you?\" the concierge asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really... The thief stole my whole purse while I was out on the beach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my! Then we should be contacting the police! Did he steal your uh...\" the concierge gestured down at Mackenzie's chest, \"top as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no!\" Mackenzie blushed even further. \"That was just an, uh, accident on my part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, regardless, I'd be more than happy to call the police for you.\" replied the concierge in a friendly tone. \"I'm sure they could send some officers out here in no ti-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, no!\" Mackenzie interrupted, dreading the thought of explaining her situation to the police wearing nothing but some skimpy bikini bottoms. \"I can go through all that later, but for now I'd really <i>really</i> like to just get back to my room and get dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, of course.\" the concierge hurriedly replied. He whipped up a quick form and set it in front of Mackenzie. \"If you could just sign here, miss, then I'll get your new room key ready for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie, being right-handed, awkwardly tried to shift her left arm over her breasts while removing her right. She was able to do so almost seamlessly, only exposing one of her nipples for a moment. Blushing furiously, she grabbed the pen on the counter and leaned forward to sign her name. But the motion sent one of the bikini bottom's ties past its limit. In an instant, the knot slipped free and Mackenzie's only form of cover began to slip down her legs. With no hands free, the redhead quickly did the only thing she could think of: she shoved her groin hard up against the counter. The friction kept the bottoms from sliding down even further, but the impact jostled the other knot loose as well. The bottoms were barely held in place by the force of Mackenzie leaning into the counter, but it came at the expense of the back half of the bottoms swinging down, leaving Mackenzie's ass completely exposed to the entire hotel lobby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHand shaking, Mackenzie hurriedly signed the form and set the pen down. Her right hand now freed, she grabbed the undone bottoms and held them in front of her pussy. There was simply no way she could retie them with only one hand and absolutely no way she was exposing her breasts in the middle of the lobby! So while the new key was being generated, Mackenzie simply turned to face the lobby, keeping her bare ass up against the hotel counter and holding the bikini in front of her pussy. What took only about 60 seconds felt like an eternity as Mackenzie tried not to notice the groups of people blatantly staring at her while she was basically naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, Mackenzie!\" the concierge happily said as he held out the replacement room key. Mackenzie turned back to face him and froze, unsure how to grab the key with both her hands full. Mackenzie gulped nervously as she shifted her left arm slightly further across her breasts. It still covered her nipples, but now her hand was free. She leaned far over the counter and was just able to grab the card key, wrist and forearm still glued to her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" she replied nervously, leaning back. She turned to head for the rooms when she felt the bikini bottoms being tugged from her loose grip. She glanced back and saw that one of the string ties had gotten wedged in between the two edges of the counter's corner when she'd leaned in. She gave it a yank, but the tie was wedged tight. Instead of coming loose, the bikini slipped from Mackenzie's grip and swung down to the side of the counter. Mackenzie gasped and quickly clamped her hand down over her bared pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, need some help with that?\" the concierge asked, having clearly seen all of Mackenzie's exposed form just now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now completely naked Mackenzie was about to begin an attempt to rescue her final form of cover when she remembered two things. First, at this point it was barely even providing her with any cover. She could do just as well with her bare hand. And second, it wasn't even her bikini! That settled it for the young beauty, who turned and ran towards her room without another word, giving the lobby-goers one last look at her lovely round ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDreading the thought of sharing an elevator with someone in her current state, Mackenzie ducked into the first stairwell she saw and continued her run all the way up the fifth floor. She opened the door to a deserted hallway, much to her relief. And just a few moments later, Mackenzie arrived at her room, still very naked and now very out of breath. She finally let her arm come away from her breasts for a brief moment as she inserted the card key. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Mackenzie's new card key work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was frozen in place, having been interuppted stuffing Mackenzie's items into her bag, which seemed to be full to the point of bursting. It looked like it had everything Mackenzie had brought for her trip, as well as a few other amenities from the hotel room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie and the robber both stood frozen in place for a few moments, eyes locked on each other. Then the man's gaze swept down the rest of Mackenzie's bare body. That was enough to snap the redhead out of her shocked state. Mackenzie blushed deeply and quickly covered herself with her arms and crouched down low. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-don't look at me!\" Mackenzie yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robber snapped out of his reverie as well and ran for the doorway, bowling Mackenzie over as he ran out into the hall. Mackenzie went sprawling to the ground, taking a few seconds to get back up. The robber took advantage of that time and sprinted down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Hey!\" Mackenzie shouted, now fully realizing that her belongings were being stolen right in front of her. That was also the moment she realized she recognized the man currently running away with her valuables. It was the same thief that had stolen her purse and towel earlier when she was swimming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! You thief!\" Mackenzie angrily shouted after him. She grabbed a stray bra off the floor that had fallen from the bag and clutched it to her chest. But there was no way Mackenzie was going to chase the thief down, given her nudity. And to make matters worse, a few nearby doors opened as other hotel patrons poked their heads out to see who was shouting. Stifling a further shriek, Mackenzie followed her instincts and hurried back into the safety of her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie slammed the door and locked it, her heart hammering like wild. After a quick scan of her room to make sure she was truly alone, Mackenzie started to calm down a bit. Thinking more clearly now, Mackenzie moved to call the front desk or even hotel security. But, to her surprise, the room's phone was gone! She fumed at the thief as she tried to contemplate her next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>First thing's first I guess,</i> Mackenzie thought, still completely naked. She began opening the dresser drawers where she had unpacked her clothes earlier that day. But, to the redhead's dismay, drawer after drawer was empty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no no NO!\" Mackenzie said, becoming more and more worried as she desperately searched for something to wear. Karma had come back to bite Mackenzie in the ass tenfold for her earlier thievery. The bathroom towels were all gone, and even the bedsheets seemed to have been taken! The only thing left on the bed was the heavy and cumbersome queen sized blanket. Her bag was gone, the dresser was empty, and there was absolutely nothing for her to wear in the room but the single sky blue bra the thief had dropped during his escape. Dejected, Mackenzie put it on, deciding being bottomless was better than bring naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe I can pass this off as a bikini top.</i> Mackenzie thought to herself. She was at a beach resort, after all. But she knew that probably wouldn't fool anyone who looked for more than a moment. <i>Still a moot point if I can't find anything to wear for bottoms!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie gave a deep sigh before checking through the room again. Hoping against hope that maybe the thief had overlooked something, <i>anything</i>, Mackenzie lowered herself to the floor and checked under the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas there something under there for Mackenzie to wear?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Basically a big orange rectangle of fabric, it must have been left behind by a previous hotel customer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie dusted it off and wrapped it around her body, extremely grateful to have something she could use as a sort of strapless dress. Sure, her bra straps would show, but that didn't matter at all to Mackenzie, who had spent the last twenty minutes or so severely underdressed if not flat out naked. She looked at herself in the mirror and her happy mood was instantly shattered. The sarong was semi-transparent, meant to be worn over a bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw come on!\" Mackenzie groaned in frustration. She could easily see the bra underneath, and even worse, she could clearly see her pussy through the fabric! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping to thicken it up, Mackenzie took off the sarong and folded it in half. Then she wrapped it around her waist. Glancing at the mirror again, it was certainly less transparent than before, but not completely opaque. <i>It'll have to do, I guess...</i> Mackenzie thought as she tied the sarong together to keep it in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith just a bra and a slightly transparent sarong composing her entire wardrobe, Mackenzie pondered what she needed to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a knock at her door. \"Ma'am? It's the police. Just got a few questions for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie gulped and slowly opened the door. The policewoman in front of her seemed to be in her 30s with short, dark brown hair framing a cute face. It didn't escape Mackenzie's notice that the officer's eyebrows shot up in surprise at the sight of the underdressed redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, officer?\" Mackenzie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got a report from the hotel that you were the victim of a robbery on the beach earlier today?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Mackenzie sighed, \"Some guy stole my purse and everything in it while I was on the beach. But just now that same asshole stole everything from my hotel room too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer scribbled down a note before asking, \"Ma'am do you... want to get dressed or anything before we continue?\" She glanced pointedly at Mackenzie's crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie blushed and subconsciously shifted one of her hands in front of her pussy. \"I, uh, can't really. All my other clothes were stolen too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.\" The officer said, continuing to write notes. \"Mind if I take a quick look around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe policewoman took an inventory of all the stolen hotel appliances along with a list of all Mackenzie's stolen items too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" she said as she turned to leave. \"I'll need you to come down to the station to make your statement and possibly work with a sketch artist.\" She gave Mackenzie's body another once over before continuing. \"But that can wait until you're a bit more settled again. Swing by tomorrow and ask for me, Officer Clark. And call me if anything else comes up.\" She handed Mackenzie a business card. Mackenzie agreed and the policewoman left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie knew what she had to do next, but she was dreading it. She knew she needed to cancel her credit cards as soon as possible, but with no cell phone or room phone, her only option was to go use one at the hotel's front desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie gave one more forlorn look at her underdressed state in the mirror before taking a deep breath, grabbing her room key, and striding out into the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, after enduring countless stares by anyone walking through the lobby, Mackenzie had successfully cancelled her cards and ordered a new debit card to be expedited to the hotel for her. <i>Take that, you thieving jerk.</i> she thought, proud of her quick and decisive action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie's new card would hopefully arrive tomorrow, giving her some money to work with again. But in the meantime, Mackenzie had no money, no phone, and virtually no clothing to speak of. Luckily, her hotel stay was already paid for, and that included access to the complimentary meals in the dining hall (but room service would cost extra, which she couldn't afford for now). So Mackenzie wouldn't go hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about food made her stomach grumble, and Mackenzie saw that the dining hall was indeed open for lunch. It wasn't packed with people, but a small crowd was forming. Mackenzie looked down at her attire and sighed. She didn't look completely out of place at a glance. A few other women were wearing their swimsuits as well. But if anyone looked closely at the attractive redhead, it was fairly obvious that she was wearing a bra and had nothing on under her sarong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie sighed and headed over to the dining hall. She figured she'd have to endure it sooner or later if she ever wanted to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did Mackenzie's meal go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She heard a gasp, distorted by the water, and the brunette quickly turned her head to stare directly down at Mackenzie. \"What are you doing down - <i>hey! My swimsuit!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit.</i> Mackenzie swam upwards, breaking the surface of the water with a guilty smile on her face. \"Oh, this? This isn't what it looks like!

It's no skin off my back- and no clothes off yours- if you don't want to spice things up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie wasn't dumb. A little easily incensed, but not dumb. She knew what the girl was implying, and it was getting too hard to not want to humiliate her. \"...How would this work,\" she said after a minute, keeping her growing annoyance from creeping into her voice as best she could, \"if I were to take you up on this offer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl smiled, knowing she'd sunk a deal. \"There's 10 levels in this game; 3 stages with 3 sections each, and 1 final level with the difficulty jacked way up.\" She glanced her opponent once over. \"I'm assuming you're wearing something under there, so that'd be 5 items from where I'm standing: Footwear, 2 outer items, and 2 items underneath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie nodded. \"So at the end of each level, whoever has the lower score loses an item? What happens if there's more to the game after one of us gets, uh....\" Mackenzie coughed, \"if you runs out of items?\" The black haired girl just chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're deadset on embarrassing yourself at that point then I guess you can stick around and play for forfeits. I'll be nice and let you leave if you feel like it, but if you want to make things worse for yourself, then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie huffed. \"We'll see whose making themselves look stupid in a few rounds.\" And with that, she slotted a few quarters into the machine, grabbed her gun, and stood ready to fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" the girl laughed, doing the same. \"Name's Rosalyn by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mackenzie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a silent nod, and a grim look of determination towards one another, the two girls got ready to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game was a simple enough shooter. Two female cyborg-soldiers were decked out in some sort of futuristic armor that gave them superhuman durability and reflexes- the games 'health bar' tracked how well the armor was holding together, with each character 'dying' (read; unable to fight) once they'd lost too much of the suit. 1 to 2 players could hop in, blast a vaguely defined enemy faction, and try to get the highest scores they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, after only four rounds, it seemed pretty clear how things were going to go in this contest:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The gun and her arms covered her chest well enough, but only while she was firing; every time she lowered the thing to reload, she was assaulted by flashing cameras. Well, <i>more</i> flashing cameras, anyway. Her lower half was on display no matter what she did; closing her legs as best as she could meant she was off balance while shooting, so she tried to ignore the whistling and glaring as best as she could. Meanwhile, every time she jumped at an enemy suddenly jumping in from off screen, she could feel the leers boring into her bouncing backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make a long story short, what could have been an even match snowballed into a humiliating certain defeat. To Mackenzie's right, Rosalyn smiled triumphantly waving and pumping up the crowd. On the screen, with a score nearly twice as large as Mackenzie's, Rosalyn character was blowing the smoke from her gun barrel with a wink. On Mackenzie's side of the screen, the redhead saw her avatar's armor spark and sputter for a moment, before flying off in pieces, the words 'YOU' and 'LOSE' blinking in to cover her chest and crotch, respectively. As she shakily shelved her plastic firearm, Mackenzie wished she had even that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wish I could say I was surprised,\" Rosalyn started, Mackenzie turning to glare at her as her hands took up position over her privates, \"but at least you were a decent challenge. For a while. A little while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie, red-faced, had to force down a curse. Gritting her teeth, she asked, \"J-just... what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalyn's smile was nearly splitting her face. \"Well, I believe we decided on forfeits...\" Hearing this, an excited murmur ran through the crowd.

Come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie stumbled as Rosalyn half-led, half-dragged her along, keeping her head bowed in shame as they passed through the amused crowd. Looking up, she saw where Rosalyn was taking her, and dread filled the pit of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on.\" Rosalyn pulled back the curtain on the photo booth and pointed inside. \"Get in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBriefly Mackenzie considered trying to make a run for it, but she had seen how fast Rosalyn's reflexes were. Hell, it was the reason she was naked right now. Rosalyn would probably just tackle her, and then think of a way to make her humiliation even worse. Reluctantly, Mackenzie stepped into the photo booth. <i>Why did I make this bet in the first place? Now she's going to have pictures of me naked!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalyn came in after her, closing the curtain behind them. She hummed to herself as she flicked through the theme options on the touchscreen, then grinned and selected \"Romantic.\" Immediately the screen filled up with pink hearts and ribbons, and Rosalyn turned her attention back to Mackenzie. \"Come on, honey!\" She wrapped an arm around Mackenzie's bare body in a partner-like fashion, making her flinch again. \"Smile!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, they emerged from the photo booth - Rosalyn beaming with pleasure, and Mackenzie crimson-faced and shaking with embarrassment. From a slot on the side of the booth came sliding several glossy photographs, and Rosalyn held them up so Mackenzie could get a good look at them. \"You look so cute in these!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one was of the nude Mackenzie and the fully dressed Rosalyn, with Rosalyn wrapping a companionable arm around her unfortunate victim and leaning a head on her bare shoulder. Rosalyn had a beauteous smile on her face, while Mackenzie had her eyes screwed shut and her arms clasped over her breasts. In the second one, Rosalyn was planting an intimate kiss on Mackenzie's cheek, while Mackenzie stood there with her arms at her sides. (Rosalyn had insisted that she no longer be allowed to cover herself.) In the next one, Rosalyn had made Mackenzie raise her arms above her head, making her breasts thrust out prominently, and give a smile that would have been fairly convincing if it weren't for her beet-red face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother one featured Mackenzie with her back to the camera, both hands grasping her own exposed buttocks, while Rosalyn pointed to her bottom with an exaggerated look of shock on her face. In another, Rosalyn had made Mackenzie kiss <i>her</i> on the cheek, while she smirked with satisfaction at the camera. In another, Rosalyn was behind Mackenzie, using her hands to cover Mackenzie's breasts and crotch - which Mackenzie had found somehow more humiliating than having them uncovered altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went on like that. Rosalyn had had a lot of ideas for ways to pose Mackenzie, each feeling more humiliating than the last. Now she seemed at least triumphant and satisfied, having thoroughly established her dominance over the other girl. \"These,\" she said, waving the wad of photographs for emphasis. \"are all solid gold. Never going to let go of these. Might have to post 'em all up on Facebook. Maybe I'll tag you in them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea made Mackenzie gasp. \"You can't do that! I'd...I'd be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, humiliated? I think that ship already sailed, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie stared at her with a mixture of terror and abject loathing. \"Just...just give me back my clothes already. You won.\"</span></div></div>",

What Rosalyn didn't know was that Mackenzie was a talented dancer, having taken lessons from a young age and dancing for fun and even in a few small competitions. Simply put, Mackenzie was more than capable of dominating a game such as this. Of  course, that was the norm when she was confident, calm, and not stark naked in front of an audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, double or nothing.\" Rosalyn mused as she took her spot on the dance pad next to Mackenzie's. \"When I win, you have to do your forfeit, and... I keep your clothes.\" a mischievous grin spread across Rosalyn's face. \"Should make your walk home interesting. Now, if you somehow manage to win, I have to strip and you choose a forfeit for me. If we tie... hm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about, if we tie... the crowd gets to decide what we do?\" Mackenzie asked, hardly believing her own words. \"That's the fairest thing, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to risk being at their mercy? Alright, it's your funeral, bouncy.\" Rosalyn teased. \"Now get ready for a thrashing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game started, the music began to play, and both women focused on the commands in front of them. Neither wanted to lose, or even tie. Nothing short of crushing victory was on both of their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, as the final notes of the song began to play, the outcome became apparent.</span></div></div>",

She knew she had to win, or else even more humiliation was in store for her. Even if the victory in and of itself was humiliating; the red-head had to keep herself laser-focused on the game. Not on how she was dancing completely naked in from of a crowd, her bouncy bits and private places completely on display and enticingly active as she jumped, stepped, and shook all over her dance platform. Not on how half the crowd had their cameras out, zoomed in to capture each jiggle, jump, or peek between her legs when the game demanded two far apart panels be stomped. No, Mackenzie would deal with all of that later, and she'd have her sweet victory and Rosalyn's sweet, sweet humiliation to make her (and hopefully the audience) forget all about that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her credit, Rosalyn wasn't going down easy. Not as good a dancer as her naked opponent- who, much to Rosalyn's surprise, was completely forgoing modesty in favor of a high score- nor as physically fit, given her long hours spent in front of screens mashing buttons, both at home and here on the boardwalk. Rosalyn's first choice under normal circumstances wouldn't have been the dance game- not that she was bad at it, but there were many other games she would have rather preferred. To be honest, she'd chosen the dance game entirely to humiliate Mackenzie, and she was both annoyed and afraid that it didn't seem to be working! Of course, her expertise at video games meant her reflexes were second -to-none, easily able to keep up with the arrows on screen in her head if not her legs. She'd have been able to beat most of the people currently in the arcade- but she'd been banking on the redhead cowering and covering herself, not becoming an undressed dancing dynamo!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a number of minutes, the game ended. Rosalyn doubled over, having exerted herself quite a bit, and tried to catch her breath. Mackenzie, meanwhile, was doing a bit better, though still gasping, as she moved one hand between her legs and another across her chest. There wasn't much the crowd hadn't already gotten a good long look at, but any cover right now made Mackenzie feel better, and somewhere in the back of her head she hoped most of them had viewed the match from behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small dinging noise prompted both girls to look back up at the machine. Hope and anger burned in their eyes, only to be met with confusion. Both of the girls scored very high, and received very high marks on their dancing, Mackenzie for her speed, Rosalyn for her accuracy. Of course, the really interesting part is that both scores were, down to the last digit, completely identical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did...\" Mackenzie started, only to be interrupted by a loud \"Bullshit!\" from Rosalyn. The red-faced redhead and the irate arcade regular looked at each other, then to the crowd as a murmur of realization passed through it, and then back to each other. Their expressions held contempt, definitely, and a not insignificant amount of fear. But as the crowd started cheering louder and louder, their faces both softened into a look of mutual understanding and pity, if only slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two didn't even have time to exchange words before the crowd declared their sentence:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had made a mistake before, and she hated to think that deep down she found it fun.  Going out without a towel was a fair bit riskier than she was ready to do though.  She would have been more comfortable with easy access to one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Mackenzie climbed out of the hot tub, the water beading down her beautiful body.  After flicking a switch, the bubbles and jets had died down.  A freezing breeze made her shiver.  It felt a lot colder to her skin now that she was wet.  Maybe a robe would be better?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that was not a choice Mackenzie was going to get to make.  Once she reached her door, she put her hand on the handle, and the door did not open.

And there was only one place she was going to fight off hypothermia.  Quickly, the red head ran back to the hot tub and got in.  Feeling the warmth on her cold skin was a bit of a shock to her, but soon she had gotten back in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Mackenzie was at least warm, but she couldn't stay outside forever.

She knew that the adjacent cabin was close but hidden from view. Had the man heard her? The snow seemed to swallow her calling voice. This was turning from bad to worse. She could just hope that she could break a window on her hut, but that would be followed by a snow storm inside and a lot of emotionally painful explanations how that could happen. She rose into standing position and called louder again. \"HELLO. Over HERE\" and waved her hands. And she looked into the direction of the other hut. That was the wrong direction<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy was closing the distance to the next hut with the task that his father had assigned him. He could just hope that the neighbor was at home and would have the device. When he got closer he had the impression that a female voice was calling through the snow. Another crazy imagination, he thought. He had lost the path and was walking steeply uphill through ten inches of snow until he was stopped by a hedge with no leaves on it. Turning left he squeezed himself through a small opening and approached the back terrace of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he made his last steps in the snow he suddenly saw a female nude body rising from the a hot tub which was steaming like crazy in this cold. Nevertheless, her shape from behind was great, including a lovely firm butt. \"HELLO. Over HERE\" she yelled and stood bravely, exposing her bare wet skin to the winter storm. Then she even waived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe<br>\r\n1 - launched a snowball<br>\r\n2 - shocked her by calling loud from behind her<br>\r\n3 - politely stepped back and called her from safe distance<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was about the most humiliating position she could imagine being walked in on, completely naked and masturbating herself using the hotel hot tub. But that couldn't have really been the door to her room, she reassured herself. She was just paranoid because of her vulnerable position. No one could get into her room except herself and hotel staff, and she hadn't called for anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she thought at least, until she heard the unmistakable sound of voices from her room- heading toward her! She was completely caught by surprise when a man appeared at the doorway wearing a hotel uniform. He noticed her and stopped, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" Mackenzie demanded, scared and hoping to make him go away as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, I'm just showing our latest guests to their rooms. What are <i>you</i> doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is MY room!\" She wanted to add, 'so get out!', but was too nervous. Luckily the employee was still maintaining eye contact- and Mackenzie realized that the vigorous bubbling of the hot tub was concealing her. He didn't realize she was nude! She might actually get out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe employee smiled pleasantly. \"Of course, I remember you. There must have been a mixup at the front desk, this room and the one next to it are definitely reserved for the guests inside.\" Mackenzie felt a throb between her legs and instinctively clamped them together protectively, for all the good it would do.

Yeah, pretty weird, huh?\" Her arms were still laying along the sides of the hot tub as if she were relaxing. They were probably stuck that way, too! If she slipped them into the water to cover herself, like her embarrassment was begging her to do, they would know something was going on. It felt strange and awkward to be lying there naked within eyesight of four people she worked with, even if they didn't know it. She couldn't believe that the only protection her naked body had from them was bubbles- which if they looked closely, she was pretty certain they could see through!

The longer they stayed, the harder it would be to convince them to go, and the more turned on and distracted Mackenzie would get.

Speaking of which, mind if I turn it up a few degrees, Mackenzie, since you'll be leaving soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... I mean, no, go ahead...\" Mackenzie said sheepishly. What choice did she have? Maybe if she played along they'd go easy on her. The water started heating up noticeably- 'a few degrees' was apparently quite a lot, and it didn't help her arousal situation at all. Her head was starting to feel a little fuzzy, and she caught herself thrusting her hips gently, and stopped, hopefully before Anne and Sophie had seen. The jets had been teasing her for quite a while now- if she'd been alone she would have gone over the edge long ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at all these buttons too!\" Anne said happily, also grinning. \"I wonder what... <i>this</i> one does?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne pressed something on the control pad, and Mackenzie braced herself, as...</span></div></div>",

Somehow keeping her composure, the reporter briskly walked over to Mackenzie and knelt down, grabbing a handful of the redhead's long hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth do you think you're doing?!\" the reporter hissed, holding her microphone far enough away to avoid being picked up on the broadcast. \"Who sent you to ruin my shoot?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody sent me to do anything! This is all a bi- AAH!\" Mackenzie began, only to be cut off when the reporter yanked back on her hair and cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't give me that! Someone wanted to make me look like a fool, and I'm not about to let them win. Let's see how they like their little plan backfiring in front of everyone!\" the reporter sniped back, roughly forcing Mackenzie to her feet, placing a hand on the small of the naked redhead's back, and marching her back towards the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the two women faced to look at the camera once more, the reporter's face shifted back into the happy facade she put on when the broadcast began. Lifting her microphone back up to her mouth, she locked eyes with the camera lens and began to speak again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that folks, our guest here is a little shy! Not that I can blame her! Even doing something as brave as she is, you can't help but feel some jitters before your first live performance!\" the reporter began. \"We've got a special treat for you here at Extreme TV!

Looking back to her opponent, she swallowed her feelings of animosity, and broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look...\" she started, \"I don't know about you, but I'm tired, I've had enough of being naked on live TV, and if I stay out here any longer, I'm <i>pretty</i> sure I might actually freeze to death.\" Shannon continued to glare at her, but the cold breeze was making it hard to disagree with the sentiment; if they kept fighting, all it meant was spending more time exposed to the elements and the viewing audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Shannon said after a moment, \"we can head back into the lodge--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not with your cameras there, we can't!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon scowled at the interruption, but continued nonetheless. \"If we can get back to my crew, we can end the segment quick, hopefully under some blankets by the fireplace.

The snow was finally starting to cool her temper, and she was starting to realize her mistake. One outcome was that she'd be fired, or at least reprimanded, for taking her segment straight into 18+ territory. The other outcome, almost worse, was that the network would want more, and if an order for more came in while she was still at the lodge, she'd be obliged to follow. She shook the thoughts from her mind, returning her gaze to Mackenzie. \"We need to get inside,\" she argued, \"I'm willing to try and sneak in, but one way or another, we need to<i> not</i> get frostbite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Mackenzie said.

She'd rather end up online in a picture than in a hospital for severe full-body frostbite. \"...Either way, we need to move quick. You're friends are going to get up that hill eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon nodded. The two of them gave each other another awkward glance over, before deciding...</span></div></div>",

With the bitter cold, why go to the pool?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, are you thinking of fighting off the frost bite with a warm shower or a dip in a hot tub?\"  Mackenzie asked, as they made little footprints in the snow.  \"Their hot tubs are nice,\" she blushed at the memories that partially lead her to this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you know anything about being too cold?\"  Shannon asked.  \"You have to restore warmth slowly.  We need something more like blankets or towels.

She smiled at Mackenzie. \"All these different buttons... and yet I think I know exactly where to start!\" She reached for the control panel, and found exactly the jet Mackenzie was afraid of. Slowly but surely, the stimulation of her nether-regions intensified, until Anne was satisfied that Mackenzie was being thoroughly teased. Mackenzie bit her lip and clenched her free hand in a fist, moaning very quietly. The jet was almost more than she could take. She hadn't wanted to turn it up this high until she was just about to finish... which she now probably was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you shivering, Mackenzie?\" Anne asked, in mock concern. \"Let me turn up the temperature for you!\" Once again the water heated up, and Mackenzie felt like every inch of her skin was being stimulated. She managed to hold back somehow, but with the heat and the jet going as high as they were, she really wouldn't be able to keep from cumming for long!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops!\" Sophie giggled, dropping her nail brush into the hot tub. \"I'll get it, Mackenzie, don't worry.\" She reached into the water and shocked Mackenzie by giving her pussy a small stroke. It was so unexpected, and she was already so close to the edge, that she almost lost it right then and there. \"So, are we finally going to learn whether the carpet matches the drapes? Hee hee!\" Sophie whispered in her ear, retracting her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne continued to tease Mackenzie, gently altering the strength of the jet, up and down, up and down, until Mackenzie was swaying her hips in rhythm with the changes in strength.

Go get settled into your room while the three of us do girly things!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys departed without much protest, promising to spend time with the girls later.

At least now that they were in public, she would get a chance to regain control of herself, without something (or someone) constantly touching and teasing her. As she left, she thought she saw Anne stuff something into her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... where am I going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welllllll, let's see!\" Sophie said enthusiastically, following her out the door, \"there's the restaurant, a bonfire, the spa, a heated pool outside, a game room...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...all of which we'll have time for later,\" Anne interjected. \"First thing's first- we're going to the bar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a haze of arousal, Mackenzie made her way to the bar, breathing deeply and trying to think un-sexy thoughts. Mercifully, she got a brief respite from Anne and Sophie's antics on the way. She was uncomfortable enough already, only having just emerged from what looked like near-certain exposure, and still dressed awkwardly. Her coat was warm and furry but had no zipper in the front, only a length of fabric tied around her waist. It did its job of covering her up well enough, but it felt more like a bath robe than clothes, and the furriness felt a little too nice on her skin. She stepped carefully to keep her crotch from coming into contact with the coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got to the bar, and Mackenzie found herself wedged firmly in between the other two girls as the bartender strode over to them. Sophie was ordering a drink when Anne's hand began snaking its way up the inside of Mackenzie's leg, making her shake involuntarily. Her mouth opened in a silent moan as Anne's hand found its way to her clit and rubbed it gently under her coat. Mackenzie was vaguely aware of Anne also ordering a drink. She was snapped back to the present when she heard the bartender addressing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am?\" He was giving her a strange look. \"Did you want something?\" She blushed, wondering if he knew what was happening to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Mackenzie?\" Anne asked. \"Go on, order something! It's on us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her clit feeling like it was on fire with arousal, Mackenzie managed to respond, \"Oh, um, yes. I'll have... mm... brandy, please?\" The bartender nodded and Mackenzie was thankful to see him turn around to get them their orders. It seemed Anne and Sophie weren't going to let up on her anytime soon. They were getting a huge kick out of having caught her masturbating and were going to make the most of it, and unfortunately it was working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir drinks arrived, and Anne and Sophie chatted happily over Mackenzie, Anne still getting her worked up beneath the bar.

Why else did we all wear our bathing suits under our clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sauna was in sight. Mackenzie had to decide quickly how to deal with this. She could try to play stubborn and just wear her coat into the sauna, although that was certain to be extremely uncomfortable, and it might not even be allowed.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mackenzie gave a small sigh on contentment. This little dip had proven to be quite relaxing and fulfilling. Fun as it was, it was probably about time to get dressed and be on her way. With that thought in mind, Mackenzie turned to where she had left her belongings, only to find empty ground. Mackenzie's heart began to beat like a jackhammer almost immediately. Where were her things?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No, no NO!\" Mackenzie muttered to herself in a panic, running through the water back to shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the two young men responsible for the disappearance of Mackenzie's clothing and bags snickered quietly to themselves, enjoying the tantalizing show Mackenzie was putting on for them as she searched high and low for her missing items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. They have to be here somewhere. The didn't just grow legs and walk away!\" Mackenzie whispered to herself as she scoured every nearby bush and shrub, desperately hoping she'd simply mis-remembered where she put her things. \"Unless...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gravity of the situation hit Mackenzie like a ton of bricks. Her things wouldn't have disappeared on their own, of course, but that meant something, or some<i>one</i> else moved them! Somebody stole her stuff! Mackenzie had been so enamored with her skinny dipping that she hadn't even noticed! What if they saw her? What if they were still watching her?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gorgeous and frightened redhead immediately curled up, covering as much of her glistening naked flesh as she could with her own body. The idea that someone, anyone, could be watching her from some hiding place was utterly humiliating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that a small, desperate corner of Mackenzie's mind spoke up. Maybe the situation wasn't what she feared? It's possible that somebody saw her belongings, but not Mackenzie herself, and assumed they were lost. Perhaps someone, believing themselves to be a good samaritan, picked her things up and took them back to the park's visitor center? Of course, this wasn't without downsides. The visitor center wasn't exactly close by, in fact it was a good several miles away. Getting there would mean trudging through the forest completely naked, jumping at every little sound, on the off-chance that her missing things would be there. And that wasn't considering how she'd deal with the people at the center...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie was at an impasse. She could either continue to search the area in the vain hope that whoever stole her things didn't take them far or she could start trekking across the forest to the visitor center. Although, perhaps there was another option... There was no telling where that stream led, and the refreshing water also might serve to conceal Mackenzie's nudity. Maybe she'd find other hikers or campers willing to help her in her time of need?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three options were honestly unappealing, but they were the only options Mackenzie really had.</span></div></div>",

The sun was slowly but surely arching across the sky, night would come soon.  The girl sighs, perhaps there was a chance, a chance that her stuff was nearby.  With new resolve she pads off around the area, pushing into the foliage, searching head to toe.  She grits her teeth as the soft leaves brush against her lower lips, sending jolts of distracting pleasure to her brain.  Each step she took sent more and more tingling tickles up her spine, \"Focus\" she mutters to herself, trying to block out the dumb leaves.  Suddenly she gasps as one leave slips up into her, flicking at her clit once, coaxing out a long moan.  She pushes the bush out, blushing madly, \"Damn,\" any more of these intrusions would end...messy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe two men watch her, grinning and giggling quietly.  For them this was the best thing ever, they got to see a very hot naked woman, the growing bulges in their pants would attest to that.  Mackenzie climbs over a rotted log only for the wood to give out and send her plummeting to the soft forest floor, the woman groaning as she rolls onto her back, \"Owwww.\"  She opens her eyes, widening them with a gasp upon seeing none other than her stuff!  Her bags where hung on a large tree branch along with her clothes, socks, hiking boots, jeans, t-shirt and jacket were all there.  Another big relief was her underwear, strewn like a flag on the end of the branch, a dark blue bra and full coverage, lace trimmed brief panties, also called 'granny panties' by many.  Sure they were geeky as all hell, but darn it they were comfy!  Mackenzie quickly runs to the tree, smiling wide as she starts to go get her things.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Minutes pass with no issue, the girl taking a deep sigh, \"They...must have left\" she whispers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt took a while but the woman was able to retrieve her things from the tree, quickly pulling her panties on, covering her butt totally.

It had been at least an hour since she found her clothes, and that was all well and good, but now she was totally lost, her camp nowhere to be seen!  The hiker pushes her way through the dense foliage, grunting as a branch pokes her in the cheek, \"Ow, grrr\" she pouts.  Branches poke her all over, some going at her jacket, though the rough material saves it from damage, sadly her t-shirt wasn't as protected and the thinner cotton gets poked and tugged on, nothing too bad, that is until she blindly ran into the thick branch jutting from a stump.  \"ow!\" she shouts as the thick branch jabs her in the belly, the momentum causing her to flail forward and with a loud tear a large chunk of her shirt was torn away, exposing her stomach and a hint of her bra, \"Ah, damn\" she blushes, checking herself out for injury, thankfully finding none.  Mackenzie mumbles, \"Man, can this day get any worse?\" she sighs and continues on.  Poor choice of words on ehr part as the next thing she knew she was stepping right off the edge of a hill!  \"GAHH!\" she screams, quickly grabbing a low hanging branch cluster, now hanging on for dear life!  She had few options at that moment, either attempt to pull herself up or take her chances by trying to make a controlled fall down the hill.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking down, Mackenzie weighed her options. There certainly was plenty of foliage along the steep hillside. That meant she would have a plenty to cling to in order to slow her descent. The ground was only about 3 feet under her feet, so the immediate fall wouldn't be too bad, and Mackenzie was fairly confident she could stop herself shortly after that. Besides, she had to get down the hill one way or another to get back to her campsite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here goes nothing.\" she muttered to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteeling herself, Mackenzie let go of the branch and dropped to the ground. She tucked and rolled, absorbing the impact, but quickly found herself rolling wildly out of control down the hillside. She reached out, trying to grasp onto anything she could, and was buffeted by an onslaught of prickly branches and bushes all over her body. The needles and thorns tore at her clothes and skin as she tumbled through them. She gasped as a thick branch hit her square in the face, leaving the redhead slightly dazed as her descent suddenly came to an abrupt halt. Her jacket had become ensnared in a thick bush, yanking Mackenzie to a stop almost halfway down the steep hillside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow...\" Mackenzie winced as she felt several cuts and scrapes along her body. She slowly stood up, freeing herself from the tangled jacket. \"Maybe this wasn't the best way down after all. But at least it-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the unsteady dirt beneath her feet crumbled, dropping the redhead down the hillside once again. Mackenzie shrieked as she bounced through a particularly dense patch of thorny bushes and vegetation, her clothing taking the brunt of the damage. This time there was no reprieve. Mackenzie didn't stop until she finally landed at the bottom of the hill, finally rolling to a stop at the mostly level ground. Mackenzie was now covered with dozens of small scrapes. Luckily none of them were deep or serious, but they still stung as the girl unsteadily got to her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer wardrobe, however, had fared far worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mackenzie dusted herself off gingerly as she took stock of her situation. She was unharmed for the most part, but the same could not be said for her clothes. Her t-shirt, already ripped before her fall, had been torn to absolute shreds. The sleeves had been completely removed by the sharp foliage, along with the lower half of the shirt. It was now the size and shape of a small crop top, hanging by just one shoulder strap and showing off plenty of cleavage. And to make matters worse, Mackenzie had somehow lost her bra during her descent! A particularly aggressive branch had exploited the opening around her midriff and inserted itself directly into the bra's clasp before whisking it away as Mackenzie continued her tumble down the hill. Mackenzie groaned as she realized that her shirt was now so short that it barely covered her breasts. Even standing there, a hint of underboob could be seen. The redhead would have to be very careful about raising her arms, lest she risk exposing even more of her ample breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her wardrobe troubles didn't end there. The durable material of her jeans had held up much better against the onslaught and suffered far fewer tears. However, that durability had backfired on Mackenzie when her jeans had become caught and snagged in a dense bush of thorns. Instead of ripping free, the jeans had stayed put, and poor Mackenzie had tumbled right out of her pants. Plus, with their outer layer of protection gone, her panties had taken quite a beating as well. They were torn up and provided plenty of small windows to the pale skin underneath. They still covered her pussy, thankfully, but a few exposed the red hair accompanying it. Not to mention, most of the back of the panties had been torn away completely. What were once full coverage panties had been turned into a functional waistband and a torn mess of fabric, barely holding together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to make matters worse, Mackenzie had lost both her hiking boots in the fall as well! Her only remaining footwear was one of her socks. Definitely insufficient for the rough landscape on the trek ahead. Mackenzie sighed in despair as she realized how underdressed she now was. She desperately wished she had some further form of cover, but all her other supplies were back at her campsite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a renewed determination, Mackenzie headed off in what she hoped was the right direction. \"I hope my campsite is nearby...\" she muttered to herself. Her arms self-consciously covered her midriff and waist as she slowly began her walk through the woods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat fate befell Mackenzie next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was doing her best to avoid stepping on anything painful, but so far she was failing miserably. There was simply far too many rocks and branches covering the forest floor. It had only been 10 minutes or so, but to Mackenzie it had felt like an eternity. She had already stopped covering herself, her arms getting tired. It wasn't like anyone was around to see her anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her luck wasn't all bad. The forest had begun to thin out, so the redhead was easily able to skirt around trees and bushes. Her meager wardrobe didn't suffer any further damage from the great outdoors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" Mackenzie winced again at the pain in her foot as she trod upon yet another small rock. \"If I'm where I think I am, the campsites <i>should</i> be right around this area.\" she said to herself hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, a minute later Mackenzie heard voices emanating from somewhere up ahead. Her first thoughts were excited and optimistic. <i>Surely they could help me find my way back onto a main trail. Maybe they could even lend me some clothes!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she remembered her current attire. <i>Oh right. My clothes. If you could even call them that at this point.</i> Seeing no real alternative, Mackenzie steeled herself. She once again draped an arm over her midriff and a hand over her nearly exposed womanhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie proceeded forward until she could see the campsite while still being hidden amongst the trees. There was a fire going and it was surrounded by a few logs for sitting. Two nearby tents and a few coolers showed these people were well supplied. Certainly far more so than Mackenzie was at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting around the fire were three people around her age. A good looking dark haired guy had his arm draped around a short brunette next to him. On the other log sat another man with light blond hair and blue eyes. Just then, a second woman appeared from behind a tent carrying several beers. She handed them out and sat down right next to the lone man. Two young couples out camping, it appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie was about to resign herself to make her humiliating introduction when she noticed several bags next to one of the tents. Indecision struck the girl as she thought about the possibility of checking the bag for clothes. If there were any, she could grab just a few things and try finding the main trail herself. After all, she now knew that she was in the general area of the campgrounds. Her tents couldn't be more than maybe a mile away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, it was getting rather late in the afternoon. And there was no guarantee that Mackenzie would be able to find her camp before sundown. If she was stuck out in the woods after dark she was <i>seriously</i> in trouble. Mackenzie shivered at the thought of being totally helpless and alone in the dark wilderness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could take the more risky route and save her modesty for now, or she could take the humiliating route and not have to be afraid for her safety. Mackenzie gulped and decided to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She made sure to keep a hand in front of her crotch and draped the other across her bared midriff. As embarrassing as this encounter was going to be, at least she wouldn't wind up lost in the woods at night. She held onto that thought as she emerged from the woods. The four friends were talking happily and hadn't noticed her approach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie cleared her throat and meekly said, \"Excuse me. Hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation abruptly halted as all four sets of eyes turned to the redhead. Mackenzie stood there with her few scraps of remaining clothing. Her skimpy top hung from one shoulder and covered most of her breasts, but showed off a fair amount of underboob. Aside from a single dirty sock, her only other piece of clothing was her torn up panties. They provided some cover in the front but were all but gone in the back, completely exposing Mackenzie's ass to anyone behind her. The four campers continued to gape in stunned silence <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several more moments, Mackenzie continued. \"I don't mean to intrude but do you think I could get some help please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Oh yes of course!\" the girl with amber hair said, finally coming to her senses. \"Let me go grab you something!\" She rushed off into one of the tents, leaving Mackenzie alone with the other three campers. Mackenzie stood there awkwardly, not sure what to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, uh, jungle girl theme you've got going there.\" the blond haired guy said, finally breaking the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie blushed even more. \"Y-yeah I had a bit of trouble on my way back to camp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A <i>bit</i> of trouble?\" the brunette asked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot of trouble, I guess.\" Mackenzie corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh here!\" the dark haired guy said gesturing to the spot next to him, \"Please come sit by the fire. You must be cold with your uh... outfit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Mackenzie demurely replied. She took a seat and immediately felt the warmth begin washing over her body. The air was starting to get chillier. Mackenzie rubbed her hands up and down her arms to further warm herself. Her jiggling resulted in her breasts dipping just slightly lower, showing off even more of the bottoms of her breasts. She was acutely aware that all eyes were still on her mostly bare body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the other girl returned, carrying a water bottle and a granola bar. She handed them both to Mackenzie. \"Here, please have these. You seem like you could really use them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie had assumed that the other girl was getting her some type of clothing to wear, but wasn't about to turn down any supplies at this point. She opened the water bottle and took a few swigs. Suddenly Mackenzie realized how thirsty her long trek had made her! She leaned back and took several big gulps, downing almost half the bottle in one sitting. But leaning back turned out to be a mistake for her. When she did so, her top was pulled even higher. And it was just enough for her breasts to pass the point of no return. They both instantly spilled out from under her flimsy top, jiggling slightly before they came to rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" the two guys both yelled in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie sputtered on her water and quickly grabbed her shirt. She yanked it down as fast as she could, ripping the material on her shoulder in the process. The garment now loosely hung over the middle of her breasts, but far less stably than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think, maybe, I could borrow some clothes?\" Mackenzie asked the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course!\" replied the one who had given her the water. \"Here, you can come change in the tent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you so much.\" Mackenzie gave a huge sigh of relief. She moved to stand up from the log. But, her shredded panties had plenty of frayed edges already, and it didn't take much movement for one of the edges to get stuck to the rough bark of the log. As Mackenzie rose, the last chunk of fabric covering her pussy was ripped to shreds, leaving nothing left of her panties but the waistband. By the time she was on her feet, she was completely bottomless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" yelled all four of the campers this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie gasped and quickly tried to cover both her pussy and her ass with her hands. The rapid movement shook her flimsy top loose from her chest and it tumbled down her body before coming to rest around her hips. Blushing furiously, Mackenzie removed her hand from her ass and quickly clamped her arm over both her breasts as best she could. The stunned silence returned as Mackenzie stood there, essentially naked, in front of the strangers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh wow. Here, uh follow me.\" said the slackjawed girl as she guided Mackenzie to the nearby tent. The virtually naked girl didn't even bother trying to cover her backside as she hustled away from the onlookers, too embarrassed to say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.... wow.\" the dark haired guy said once she was out of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette gave him a sour look. \"Easy there Mike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Come on, babe, I'm just saying. Wow.\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you could try staring just a bit less.\" she replied bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, wow is completely right, Nicole.\" supplied the blond guy. \"You can't really blame him for looking when a naked chick literally comes waltzing out of the woods into our camp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\" Nicole replied. \"What about you Ben? I bet Audrey won't be too thrilled with you drooling all over her like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might be surprised.\" Ben said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the amber haired girl returned and sat down next to Ben. \"Wow.\" she said emphatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right?\" Ben agreed. \"What are the odds of someone looking like <i>that</i> just randomly showing up naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of them continued to discuss the bombshell that had mysteriously appeared in their campsite nearly naked and then managed to destroy her remaining scraps of clothing. A few moments later, Mackenzie exited the tent wearing a yellow t-shirt and black shorts. The t-shirt was a little tight, but about the right size, and the shorts were a little loose on her. She also had on a fresh pair of socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry again about not having any shoes to lend you.\" Audrey said while Mackenzie returned to the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no that's totally fine.\" Mackenzie said gratefully. \"This is more than enough. Thank you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what did you say your name was?\" Nicole asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, Mackenzie.\" she said, realizing these four people had all seen her naked before she had even introduced herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the four introduced themselves to Mackenzie and began chatting amicably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again for your help.\" Mackenzie said, \"But I should really get going if I want to get back to my camp before dark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could crash here for the night, if you like.\" Mike happily suggested. Nicole gave him a slap on the arm and glared at him for that comment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're more than welcome to.\" Audrey replied seriously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that way you don't have to worry about wandering around at dusk.\" Ben added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie had a pretty good sense of how to get to her campsite from here. And it was only about a half mile away, so she could easily make it there before dark. Besides, she was eager to put this whole embarrassing situation behind her. \"Really that's very nice of you, but I'd rather get back to my own campsite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie said goodbye and promised to return the borrowed clothing tomorrow. Then, with a fresh water bottle and granola bar, she made her way along the trail. With no further surprises on her trip, Mackenzie was able to find the main trail and then her own campsite in no time at all. She unzipped her tent and crawled inside. Laying down on her sleeping bag, Mackenzie gave a huge sigh of relief. She was happy that her long ordeal of a day was finally over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day had started wonderfully with an exhilarating skinny dip, but had quickly turned to a nightmare when her things had been stolen. Luckily she had been able to find them, though it still unnerved her that someone might have been watching her whole ordeal. But then she had gotten horribly lost in the woods. And to make it all worse, her reclaimed clothes had been torn up and stripped away by mother nature. And then she had been exposed in front of a group of strangers! It was literally a nightmare come to life for Mackenzie. But at least she had made it back here in one piece. All these thoughts swam through Mackenzie's head as the exhausted girl drifted off to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie woke up to sunlight streaming into her tent. She shielded her eyes and sat up, noticing that she was once again naked. She panicked as she desperately looked around for her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And the day was certainly warm enough already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie changed back into her own clothes. She slipped on a fresh pair of panties and a sports bra this time. Then she put on a pair of short hiking shorts and an athletic tank top. Perfect attire for a hot summer day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick bite to eat later, Mackenzie stuffed the borrowed clothes in her backpack and set off to return to the other campsite. She arrived to find the quartet of campers packing bags of their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again, Audrey.\" Mackenzie said, handing her back the shirt and shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sweat Mackenzie, happy to help.\" she replied, \"So, how did you end up like that in the first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh...\" Mackenzie blushed, \"It's a long story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll definitely have to tell us all about it sometime.\" Nicole said deviously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hey, we're going on a short hike in a few minutes.\" Mike said, \"Want to come with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that would be great!\" chimed in Audrey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie paused, considering the offer. She did have enough supplies with her to tag along, after all. But she was still terribly embarrassed by yesterday's ordeal. They had all seen her naked! Being around the four of them would serve as a constant reminder throughout the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, Mackenzie decided to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mackenzie now had a choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could either move deeper into the forest before angling herself back towards where she imagined her clothes would be, to avoid possible encounters with other hikers that would lead to even further embarrassment.

If the redhead had to give this hotel one compliment, it was that its shower was nothing short of divine, a top of the line installation that made every use a wonderfully relaxing experience. The only major problem was Mackenzie's own fault, as her lengthy shower made the confined quarters warm and humid, the effect even seeping out into the rest of the hotel room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapping herself in a fluffy white towel, Mackenzie stepped out of the bathroom and took a seat at the edge of the bed, idly turning on the television as she worked a second towel through her silky hair. Both the towel around her body and the one drying her hair quickly became saturated and uncomfortable, and a naughty thought crossed Mackenzie's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sharing this room with anybody else, and she could slip a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on her door to avoid any unwanted visitors. The blinds were drawn across the window, preventing anybody from peeking in. What harm would there be in a little fun? With this logic and a small smile, Mackenzie undid the towel around her, letting the damp fabric peel away and piled around her shapely hips on the edge of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie couldn't deny that some small part of her got a kick out of doing things like this. Walking around naked always felt taboo, and doing so never failed to send a tingle of excitement up her spine. Of course Mackenzie also made sure that a situation was never too risky, as she was fairly sure she'd die of embarrassment if she were caught running around nude. Thanks to the privacy of her hotel room, however, Mackenzie had nothing to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie reclined on the bed and watched TV as she let her body air dry, waiting for the oppressive heat from her shower to dissipate. When it never did, however, the bombshell beauty started to get agitated. She'd loved her room's shower, but she hated its AC unit, mainly because it was apparently faulty. Sure, it had snagged her a nice discount on her rates, but that was proving itself to be a small comfort in this muggy warmth. Simply put, Mackenzie needed a way to cool down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIce! Of course. Mackenzie could go fill a bucket of ice from the machine down the hall. It'd only take a few moments and she'd have her fix to the warmth problem. Of course, doing so would also mean having to get dressed... or would it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting her lip, Mackenzie imagined herself stark naked and dashing down the hotel hallway, ample assets bouncing and on display for anybody that thought to step out of their room. A tingle ran up Mackenzie's spine as well as between her legs as she thought about it. It would be quick, nobody would see her, and there was no denying the thrill...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, Mackenzie strode purposefully to her hotel room door, grabbing her ice bucket and room key along the way. It'd just be a few seconds, she kept telling herself. That didn't stop her hand from shaking as she gripped the handle on the door and turned, willing herself to step out into the hall before she could chicken out. The door clicked shut behind her with a sense of finality. She'd already come this far, might as well keep going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bare feet padded along the carpeted hallway quietly, the racing thumping of her heart seeming faster to the naked redhead. She reached the ice machine before she knew it, quickly pulling open the cover and grabbing the scoop. The blast of cold air from the machine sent goosebumps across Mackenzie's fair skin, her pretty pink nipples hardening in the chill. At least she'd have an excuse for that if she were caught, she jokingly thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that her luck could change at any moment, Mackenzie filled the bucket as quickly as she could. Unfortunately for Mackenzie, this speed mattered little, as-</span></div></div>",

The busty woman picked up her pace as she turned a corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie was left stunned.  This hotel was clothing optional?  There were no notes about that at all anywhere in the brochure that she could remember.  It had to be a lie, but what would that woman gain from lying to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm over thinking this.\"  The redhead said to herself.  Focused on completing her mission, she turned and faced her bucket towards the ice machine.  There was a hot blush on her face, and her nipples had hardened due to the cold air.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were lingering thoughts about what had happened.  How bold that woman was to drop her towel in the hallway.  The things she implied.  The fun she could have.  What if it <i>was</i> true?  But what if it wasn't?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took her bucket, now full of ice, and walked passed the towel on the ground.  Even if it was true, being naked in the privacy of her hotel room was going to be enough for her.  <i>Maybe</i> she'd grab a swimsuit, and carefully re-read the brochure on her way to the pool.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether it was true or not, Mackenzie didn't exactly want to be out in the hallways completely naked.  She took her key card and swiped it through the lock on her door.</span></div></div>",

Cover!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie left her ice bucket at the foot of her door and ran for the towel, picking it up.

She shut the door behind her and walked towards her bed, where she had left her own towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still very humid in her room, but that was after all, why she had gotten the bucket of ice.  She took one of the frozen cubes and began to rub herself around the neck with it.  She shuddered, finding the cold ice cube refreshing as the it glided over her smooth skin, leaving a moist trail.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had rubbed it all over her body, like it was a bar of soap until it seemed to have melted.  Mackenzie reached into the bucket for another, and started to repeat the process.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, however, the ice cube had slipped from her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh!!\" She said in surprise.  The ice cube had fell onto her legs and slid down between her thighs, to a very sensitive region.  Mackenzie shuddered, feeling the cold moisture on her little pink treasure.  She seemed almost unable to move for a moment, until the ice cube had fully melted.  The redhead was unable to tell the water from the melted cube from her own moister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to rub her naked body with the ice cubes, even taking the time to rub her more intimate areas with them.  But eventually, they had all been melted, and Mackenzie was left a little unsatisfied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was <i>still</i> too warm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Mackenzie did the only thing she could think to do.  Since the air conditioner clearly wasn't working, she walked up to the window and opened it, letting a cool breeze in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping away from the window, Mackenzie looked at her luggage in thought.

People were coming, and if she didn't move soon, she would be exposed to all of these people!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking about, she was still holding her ice bucket and her room key.  She frantically looked around for a place to hide.  There was little room for her to work by the ice machine.  Mackenzie quickly ran to a wall of the hallway, facing the ice machine.  She looked around to make sure nobody was coming, and tried to listen.  Some people were probably just getting in.  She'd wait for them to get in their room, and sneak back into hers!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled to herself.  It was a step more risky than she liked, but there was no denying there was a bit of a thrill to it.  Perhaps a lingering urge could be tickled when she got back into that sauna like room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Mackenzie's naughty thoughts were interrupted by a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets see... they said it's on this side.  401, 403, 405... ah here we go!  407!\"  It had sounded like a gruff man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie froze.  407 was <i>her</i> room!  She peeked to her right around the corner to see what was going on.  There she saw two men in work jumpsuits.  One was holding a toolbox, while the other was getting a door key ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's up with this room?\"  Said the younger looking of the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last person that used it said the AC is busted.  I just gotta switch a few parts but that involves taking quite a bit of the thing apart.\"  Said the older.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie cursed silently.  Yes, they were going to fix her air conditioning.  She wanted that to happen.  But not while she was outside of her room completely naked!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long should it take us to fix it?\"  said the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This kind of repair... about an hour.  There's currently someone renting the room, but we'll have it fixed.  Fun fact, most people are out sight seeing instead of lounging around the hotel while on vacation.\"  He used the room key, and the door opened.  Both men went inside, and shut the door behind her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie was in trouble now.  Someone was in her room, and it wasn't her.  She had no clothing of any kind, only a bucket and a card key.  Both offered little in the way of coverage.  The red head would have to wait at least an hour before getting back to her room!  She tried to calm herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to think rationally, Mackenzie knew she might have to switch hiding spots, depending on when other people showed up.  She set her ice bucket aside, and looked to a chair near the ice and vending machines.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better not lose this,\" Mackenzie said to herself.  She slid her card key under the seat cushion.  If she had to run, it would be better to hide her key card, so she would know where it would be.  It was better than losing track of it elsewhere!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a noise almost made her leap out of her skin.  Squeaking wheels.  She had forgot about those!  But she couldn't see a luggage cart down the hallway.  That's when she turned to her left, and noticed the echo of the voices from a large group of people.  They were all female voices from what Mackenzie could tell, not that it helped either way.  If she was seen, she was seen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie looked around quickly to see if there was any way she could run. Near her, was the elevator doors.  She could ride the elevator and hide from whoever was coming.  It was the closest, but a bit risky if someone was waiting on the other side of the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked to her right, and at the end of the hallway was a stairwell.  She could hide there.  Being on the fourth floor probably meant it wasn't used often.  But the trip there would increase her risk of exposure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she could try to stay put in those hallways, and circle around the hallways of her floor as needed.  It was risky, and anyone could walk out of those doors at any moment.  </span></div></div>",

So, she abandoned rational thought for a moment and turned to the elevator.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeart racing, the redhead had one arm covering her breasts, while the other was between the warmth of her legs.  The hand between her legs abandoned it's spot to frantically press the button to summon the elevator to her floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, come on....\" Mackenzie said, feeling very exposed out in the open in front of the elevator door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe approaching sounds of people were making her breath quicker.

She let her arms fall to her sides as she caught her breath.  Her eyes glanced to the walls of the elevator.  They were all reflective metals.  In each one she could see her curves, her rising and falling chest, and a bit of moisture between her long, smooth legs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, not wanting to distract herself.  Being caught masturbating would be worse than being caught naked.  Mackenzie had to make a plan of some kind.  It was going to be an hour before she could go back into her room.  Then something crossed Mackenzie's mind, what if that luggage cart was heading towards the elevator she was in?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened in thought.  She needed to get further from whoever was coming!  In a sudden jump, she ran to the buttons for the elevator and looked at the buttons.  Inside her head, her brain was simply screaming \"get out of here,\" as she pressed the button for the ground floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill ran through her body as the elevator began to move downward.  What was she doing?  Every second she was moving further and further from any access to her own clothing.  And she didn't know who was going to be on the other side of that door!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was nobody there! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn wobbly legs, she slowly walked towards the elevator door.  She carefully glanced around and saw the main lobby.  There didn't seem to be anyone around for the moment.  Perhaps the desk attendant was on break?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the case, the red head was in a bit of luck for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the elevator dinged, and the doors started to shut.

But unlike the elevator, it wasn't a very hidden area.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie tried to think of what she could do as she glanced at a wall clock in the lobby.  She guessed only a few minutes had passed, which meant it would still be almost an hour before she could even attempt getting back into her room.   This meant one of two things : Finding a better hiding spot, or finding a better way to cover herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around, and down the hallway she could see the entrance to the pool room.  Glancing back at the clock, it was late at night.  So there was a chance she could hide in there alone.  Maybe there would even be a towel she could use!</span></div></div>",

One of her breasts slipped free of her arm.  Having a hand between her legs while running wasn't helping her calm down either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she reached the door the pool room.

There was an echo about with each step.  The red head frantically looked around.  Once again, she was thankfully alone.  She covered herself again and stepped away from the door, looking around for something she could cover herself with.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgotten clothes?  A lost swimsuit?  Pool toys?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie giggled.  Knowing her luck, if she did find a swimsuit, it wouldn't fit right.  It was a funny to think of trying to cover herself with a pool noodle.  Then Mackenzie's gaze locked onto something that she probably should have kept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a towel rack.  With a towel on it!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naked beauty smiled, and quickly grabbed the last towel towel.  It seemed warm to the touch, as if it was recently taken out of the drier.  Mackenzie was quite happy now, with decent coverage, she could probably even get back inside her room, and have the repairmen get out until she could get decent.  Or if nothing else, grab some clothes and get into her bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly wrapped the towel around herself, relieved to find coverage.  It wasn't much though, in fact it seemed noticeably smaller than the one from her room.  Mackenzie couldn't quite cover enough of her self at any one time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeld vertically, it could cover both her breasts and her womanhood, but would leave her backside completely exposed.  Wrapped horizontally, she could only adequately cover one part of her.  Attempting to cover both would leave her currently pointy nipples at the very edge of the towel, and so would the lips between her legs.  It was very risky to even consider.  Not to mention difficult to hold as the towel seemed barely big enough to wrap around her, leaving a little of her side exposed.  There was no way it would stay on without one of her hands tending to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept wondering about what she could do, and glanced at a clock that was in the room.  What felt like an eternity was only a few minutes.  Mackenzie looked around the pool room, thinking of something she could use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the room, there was of course a pool, a hot tub, a sauna, a couple of changing stalls, and further in the back appeared to be a restroom.  There was a sign that mentioned a shower room inside the restroom.  Searching all of these for any sort of forgotten clothes would take time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought a little more... did she really have to leave?  The pool room had plenty of hiding spots if someone came in, even though it seemed unlikely others would come in during the evening.  The low risk of intrusion meant she could enjoy the many offerings in the pool room.  Doing that while naked was a rare opportunity that sent a tingle up her spine.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red head tried to shake the naughty thoughts away before they got her in more trouble.  Whether she caved on some feelings or found a lost swimsuit, what mattered is she could wait out the rest of the hour and then head back to her room, when it was more likely the repairmen would be gone, and she could avoid them altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mackenzie bit her lip and looked around.  She was alone in the pool room.  Nobody seemed to be coming... and needed almost an hour before she could go back to her room anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in control,\" she told herself.  A smile appeared on her face, and she had a naughty giggle.  She walked around the pool room glancing at the things she could enjoy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changing stall?  It was the safest place, and technically it would be okay for her to be naked in there.  She could even listen for anyone else coming in.  Being in a naughty mood however, the red head felt that was simply boring.  On the off chance someone came in, she'd try to get in, but what fun would there to be had inside a privacy stall?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pool?  The water seemed pleasant and cool, as Mackenzie dipped her foot.  She swirled around, before pulling her foot away.  Skinny dipping did seem fun, and very daring in a hotel pool.  The water could even cool her off and calm down her body down some.  However, she would be immediately seen if someone walked in.  Hiding her nudity wouldn't be so simple, especially since she couldn't keep her towel on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie glanced at the hot tub.  It presented a similar problem, she couldn't wear her towel in it.  However, she did think about letting a jet tickle a certain spot.  Though that could lead to her making quite a bit of noise, she couldn't deny that it was tempting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the sauna.  Her hotel room basically was one a while ago.  It was basically it's own small room, sealed from the rest of the pool room.  The red head did like the steamy warmth though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast, was what appeared to be the rest room.  Mackenzie held her towel to her naked body as she walked towards the ladies room.  It had a few things she expected.  It was a bathroom, and there seemed to be a few shower heads along one of the walls.  Though not quite as nice as the one in her room, it was very open and offered no privacy.  Unusual, but exciting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie stepped out of the rest room, and looked over the pool room one more time.  The naughty thoughts were beating out common sense.  Most of the things she could used weren't exactly towel friendly.  It wasn't big enough to begin with.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red head's heart picked up and she trembled a little.  She released her towel, and let it fall from her body.  Now entirely naked again, Mackenzie closed her eyes as she was exposed to the openness of the pool room.  Her erect nipples pointed outward, and her lips appeared moist.  Her legs wobbled slightly, as she closed them.  It seemed crazy, but she was really going to do this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie then walked towards...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A nice soak to kill the time and then she'd worry about getting back to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle slapping sounds of her feet against the tiles of the floor echoed as she anxiously walked around the pool towards the hot tub.  She had briefly thought if it was wise to put so much space between herself and her towel.  It was on the other side of the room from the hot tub.  As was the little changing rooms.  There would be no easy escape if someone walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Mackenzie's gaze glanced towards a knob near the hot tub.  It was a timer, with a maximum time limit of ten minutes.  The worry about the towel was gently pushed out of her mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her hand that was covering her breasts, she reached over and turned the knob.  The hot tub suddenly bubbled to life.  Then the red head carefully stepped into the heated water, submerging every curve of her body into it's warmth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a little red faced, but her worries quickly melted away as she stayed somewhat low in the tub.  From outside, it was easy to tell she had not bikini top of any kind on, though her lower half was covered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie sighed finding a little relaxation for the moment, and let her feet dangle in the water some.  She felt a jet in the center of the hot tub, pressing upwards.  As she looked around, she noticed there were many jets at work, pressing around.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother naughty little idea crossed Mackenzie's mind.  She looked around one more time, and lowered herself a little more into the hot tub.  Only her head was above water, but the area between her legs was in clear path of a jet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt caused a sudden gasp to come from Mackenzie.  Pleasant tingles ran through her mind, as she rocked her hips with a rhythmic motion.  She bit her lip, she was using the hot tub to pleasure herself.  With all the risk she's taken in the night, none were quite as dangerous as this.  It would be a lot of trouble if she was caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quiet moan escaped her as she was heading towards her limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was almost there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, all that arousal quickly changed.  Suddenly, the pool room door opened!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red head's heart jumped, as she ducked down, looking towards the door in horror.  There she saw two girls entering the pool room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth were, from what Mackenzie could tell, around her age.  One was a brunette, the other was a blonde.  The brunette was wearing sandals, and a seemingly over sized t-shirt, the bottom of it reached down to her thighs.  The blond, was barefoot and had wrapped a towel around herself very tightly, she seemed nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie gulped, glancing at them.  They hadn't noticed her yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red head cursed her decision to leave her towel over there.  It was on the other side of the pool room.  Even if it was flimsy cover, it was enough to reach the changing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dared not to move, not wanting to be seen.  But this was a problem, as her already tempted body was still being pressed on by the hot tub jets.  She wasn't far from making a lot of noise.  She tried to listen to what they were saying.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond seemed to be whispering \"I can't do this,\" as the brunette seemed to argue the contrary.  Then the blond cast a glance in Mackenzie's direction, which made her even more nervous, but they both seemed to look away.  The brunette looked and then shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" the brunette said.  \"Here, we'll do this first.\"  She then led the blond into the sauna.  They both entered and shut the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie was alone again, with her lips trembling.  She gritted her teeth, she wasn't going to be able to stop the oncoming orgasm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the jets went quiet.  Ten minutes already?  Mackenzie glanced at the knob, and sure enough, the hot tub was mercifully finished.  Taking a breath, she wondered what she should do.  She wondered what was going on with those two, but she had problems of her own.  For the moment, the hot tub hid her body, but if someone came close, they would see everything.  Alternatively, she could try to get her towel back, which was on the other side of the room.  If one of those girls came out, they would also see everything.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe longer Mackenzie waited, the more likely she'd be seen, so she decided too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mackenzie stayed low in the warm water.  She was worried about what was happening, as the pool room was no longer all her own.  Why did she even think it would stay that way!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced at the clock, it was still a half hour before she could attempt getting back into her room.  The more she looked around the room and thought about those two girls, the more she wanted that towel!  Mackenzie stood up to climb out of the hot tub, when suddenly the sauna door opened.  The red head knelt back down into the water in surprise.  When the steam cleared, the brunette was walking out, holding a towel in her hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nonchalantly whistled as the words \"no wait!\" were heard before the sauna door closed.  Then the brunette noticed a towel on the floor nearby.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops!  Can't leave this behind!\"  she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie's heart sank.  That was the towel <i>she</i> needed!  But the beauty couldn't find her voice, as the brunette cast a glance in her direction.  Mackenzie looked away, as the brunette opened the door to the pool room and left.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear ran though Mackenzie's mind, as now she didn't have access to any clothing!  Her stupid exhibitionist itch just wouldn't stop digging her deeper!  Now how was she going to cover herself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie tried to think, she needed a hiding spot that was less open.  That left the changing stalls across the room.  She had to get there before that other girl came out! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly and carefully, Mackenzie climbed out of the hot tub, covered herself with her hands as best she could, and walked around the pool.  Each step felt like it took forever.  Her aching lips had yet to reach a finish that she craved.  She was so focused on reaching the changing stall, she hadn't realized the sauna door had opened.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Mackenzie's shoulder bumped into something, causing a slow slide making her fall down.  It had only slightly hurt, there was no serious injury.  However, Mackenzie quickly realized she had bumped into someone!  It was the blond girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHH!!  D-D-ON'T LOOK!  D-DON'T LOOK!\"  They screamed in unison while they covered themselves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie wanted to curl into a little hole and disappear right then and there.  She had been caught.  However, when the screams and gasps didn't get followed by a scolding, the red head opened her eyes.  The blond girl, was also naked from head to toe.  There eyes had met, and had a long awkward silence.  They were both tightly covering their intimate areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who are you?  W-why are you naked?\"  Mackenzie said, trying to sound firm but failing utterly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was several moments before the blonde could speak.  \"H-hina.\"  She closed her eyes, took a deep breath.  \"T-that other girl I was with... dared me to... get to my room... naked.\"  She looked at Mackenzie for a moment and tried not to stare.  \"S-so... what about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie didn't quiet want to explain a mild bit of exhibitionism kept getting worse for her.  But she also saw little point in lying.  \"I'm Mackenzie... and I got locked out of my room... and I ended up hiding in here.  D-do you know that girl?  Is she going to come back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHina shook her head.  \"We were talking about the pool room, how it would be nice to swim.  And she was really pushy.  I think her name was Emily.\"  She bit her lip.  \"She wouldn't even let me grab a swimsuit.  We were in here before I realized it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie thought Hina's tale was a bit difficult to believe, but never-the-less, the girl was in a similar plight to her own.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... since we got the... same kind of problem,\" Mackenzie started.  \"M-maybe we should work together and try to get into one of our rooms, and maybe lend each other some clothes.  The thing is... I think someone is in my room, they're fixing the air conditioner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHina looked up.  \"Wait... are you on the fourth floor?  I think I saw some guys leave a room near an elevator with some repair stuff!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie's eyes widened.  \"Really?  Maybe they're done fixing it... that means my room could be safe.  Is anyone in your room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but Emily said my key would be hidden near it.\"  Hina said.  \"But um... I'm on the fifth floor, kind of near the stairwell.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" Mackenzie was in thought.  Neither way was easy.  Mackenzie's room was near an elevator, and she knew where her key was hidden.  But someone might be there.  The repairmen simply could have needed another part and would come back.  Not to mention, just getting to the elevator was risky.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Hina's room more firmly promised privacy.  Plus, the stairwell was easier to reach from the pool room, and as they climbed further up the stairs, people were less likely to use it.  </span></div></div>",

It was a longer trip but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think getting to your room might be a better idea,\" Mackenzie said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-why can't we stay here?\"  Hina said.  Clearly she was more nervous than Mackenzie, and covering herself a lot more tightly than Mackenzie was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Mackenzie didn't want to expose herself either, she also knew she needed to be able to do more than cover herself in these times of trouble like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no reason to stay here, I already looked for swimsuits and towels.\"  Mackenzie said.  \"Come on Hina, if we can get to your room, we can get to your clothes, and this'll be over.\"  The red head reasoned.  \"Um... if you're willing to let me borrow some of yours that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHina gulped, and looked around.  \"I... I guess you're right.\"  She stood up on wobbly legs, still tightly holding herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie stood up a little easier.  She was embarrassed at her exposure, sure.  But Hina almost seemed helpless by comparison, as if the nudity almost paralyzed her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" Mackenzie said, walking towards the door, showing her entire uncovered backside to Hina.  She moved her hand from her pussy, and waved Hina to follow her.  \"The sooner we get to your room, the better,\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHina gulped and slowly followed forward.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both reached the door, and Mackenzie opened it.  She cautiously looked around, and saw there was nobody in the hallway.  Not too far away, was the door to the stairwell.  Mackenzie looked back to Hina, and said, \"alright, lets move.  Nobody uses the stairs when there's an elevator, we'll be safe!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\"  Hina said hunched over.  \"What if...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie looked over Hina.  She clearly seemed more experienced in getting out of a tight spot.  Was that something to be proud of, or ashamed of.  Rather than thinking about it, Mackenzie motioned Hina to follow her.  \"Just keep quiet and follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two naked girls covered themselves as best they could do with just their hands.  Mackenzie seemed a little quicker on her feet than Hina, but together they were able to reach the stairwell without much trouble.  Once inside, they were, as Mackenzie predicted, alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew,\" Mackenzie said with a hand on her hip, as the other brushed the hair out of her eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-um, Mackenzie?\"  said Hina.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\"  The red head quickly covered herself with a blush.  \"Sorry... lets um... get going!\"  She said.  Mackenzie then slowly ascended the stairs and had a strange thought.  It small tingle in the back of her mind, but she didn't quite mind that brief moment where Hina saw everything.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing she'd be in front, Hina would have her bare tush in her field of view the whole way up.  She let the hand covering between her legs move to the handrail to steady herself, which allowed her lips to be in view, if someone from behind were to look closely.  Hina  had blushed and tried not to stare, but slowly followed Mackenzie up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie didn't know why she purposefully exposed herself to Hina, she didn't even really know the girl, but it did give her an odd thrill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they ascended the stairs, Hina finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mackenzie?\"  she said in a meek voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\"  the red head replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... have something to confess... I um...\"  She fumbled words.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two turned to get on the next set of stairs for the second floor, Mackenzie noticed Hina had a deep blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... wanted to try some of this stuff out... running around naked.  But... I can't do it!  It's just crazy!\"  Hina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie blushed.  \"It is kind of risky but...\"  She bit her lip as they went up the next set of stairs.  \"It can be fun too... as long as you don't bite off more than you can chew... I um... tried to do a little lounging around like this.  That's how I got locked out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why you're so brave?\"  Hina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brave?\"  Mackenzie said.  \"I wouldn't say brave... more like...\"  Her face was about as red as her hair.  \"...Experienced with bad luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie chose not to elaborate on what that meant.  She didn't want Hina thinking that she enjoyed getting naked and sneaking around.  She enjoyed nudity when she was in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long climb of stairs, they finally reached the fifth floor.  Mackenzie wasted little time in peeking around the door to make sure they were alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which room is yours?\"  Mackenzie whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"502,\" Hina said.  \"But we need my key!  I dunno where it's hidden?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we're going to have to look.\"  Mackenzie said, stepping out into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The red head gulped, covering herself as best as she could, looked around to make sure nobody was coming, and took a step forward.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeek!\"  Hina pulled her back.  \"Are you crazy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie looked to Hina.  \"Hina, we gotta get that key!  I don't want to be seen either, but the sooner we get it, the sooner we get to safety.\"  She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you go get it!  I'm not going near that window.\"  Hina said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie looked back at the key card.  Hina was giving up using her as a human shield, but if she was quick, none of that would matter.  She took a deep breath, and did a quick run down the hallway towards the key card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was completely exposed, her breasts bounced with each step, the right one almost slipping free of her covering arm.  A nipple was now visible.  Her ass also had a bit of a jiggle as she ran.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer naked feet brought her to the window, as Mackenzie grabbed they key card.  She looked out the window, and saw it overlooked the beach.  Looking down, she could see a bell-hop down on the side walk sipping a bottle of water.  He glanced up, looking around the sky, then towards the building as if to walk back.  Mackenzie saw his eyes widen in surprise as he tripped and dropped his water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie gasped and stepped away from the window.  Did he see her?  She peeked back over to make sure the guy wasn't hurt, and saw he was getting up, and still looking up.  The red head jumped away.  Had he seen her?  Would he be able to recognize her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mackenzie, do you have the key?\"  said Hina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh, right!\"  Mackenzie said, as she turned and ran back to Hina.  The two naked beauties ran to room 502.  Mackenzie slid the key card into the slot, the light turned green and clicked.  The door opened and the two quickly got inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there was a bit of a problem.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two naked women quickly got inside the room, and slammed the door shut.  Both were breathing heavily with their backs to the door.  They smiled at each other though.  This little streaking adventure was over.  Then they looked at Hina's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hina?\"  Mackenzie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah?\"  Hina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's all your stuff?\"  Mackenzie repleid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHina's eyes widened as they took in the sight of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were no suitcases, no bags.  There were no blankets, bedsheets, or even window curtains.  They looked in the bathroom and saw no shower curtains or towels either.  There was <i>nothing</i> they could use for clothing.  All that remained on the bed was a body pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHina fell to her knees.  \"This can't be happening!  I can't go out of the room naked!  I just can't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie knelt down and put a hand on her back.  \"Take it easy, we'll figure a way out of this.\"  The red head said.  She knew this meant they were going to have to try and get to her room, before they could even think about asking the staff to look for stolen items.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before that, she needed to do something about Hina.  She glanced at the clock, about twenty minutes left before the repairmen would supposedly be gone from her room.  Assuming they were even still there.  That's when Mackenzie hatched a little idea.  A bit naughty, but maybe it would just work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hina, are you um... in the mood?\"  said Mackenzie through red cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I in the <i>what</i>!?\"  She said in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, the mood, with an itch to scratch?  Between the legs?\"  The red head said, her face getting redder by the second.  She had yet to thoroughly scratch her own itch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I am not!\"  Hina said, almost angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay, look, it's like this.  Sometimes having that itch... can make you a lot braver.  We're gonna have to get to my room, but if you're too scared to move, then we'll get caught.\"  Mackenzie reasoned, unable to believe what she was saying.  \"If you were a little braver...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you suggesting that I masturbate first?  You're crazy!\"  Hina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no, just get yourself a little horny.  Maybe take a nice hot shower, that got me going,\" Mackenzie bashfully admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHina sighed, \"I guess a shower does sound nice...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde got up and went into the bathroom, while Mackenzie sat down on the bed.  She heard the shower turn on, so Mackenzie sat and waited, letting her hands trace her inner thighs.  In these moments of privacy, Mackenzie did think Hina was a tad cute, in spite of everything.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers danced over her smooth skin over the thoughts of Hina in the shower, lightly touching her lips.  She needed to stay in the mood as well.  Mackenzie did not like the fact that she even understood this.  She squeezed her own breasts and laid down on the bed as she touched herself, as her mind drifted back to all those wild moments of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie's trance was shattered though, when she heard the doorknob jiggle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Knowing time was limited, Mackenzie got up and darted toward the bathroom.  As the room door opened, so did the bathroom door.  Mackenzie slipped in and pulled it shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!  Mackenzie!\"  Hina shrieked, and covered herself.  Red faced, in a steamy room, her hands were covering her breasts and pussy.  \"D-do you mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, someone came in!\"  Mackenzie said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shower only had a glass door, that was slightly fogged.  It seemed fogged from the steam of the shower, rather than being made that way.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me in!\"  Mackenzie said, climbing into the shower and pulling the door shut.  It was a flimsy hiding place if anything.  A little steam?  That hid nothing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened, and a brunette entered with a grin on her face as she shut the door behind her.  Emily!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Hina, you made it back!  And you even found a friend!\"  she said with a giggle.  \"Come on out of there you two!\"   She said as she slid open the glass door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie stepped out, blushing furiously.  Hina appeared to be paralyzed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to barge in on you two, I guess you were just getting to know each other!\"  Emily said.  Then she took a good look at Mackenzie.  \"Hey, weren't you in the pool room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....yes.\"  Mackenzie said quietly.  She saw the bit of fear in Hina's eyes, and tried to put her foot down.  \"J-just what are you doing to this poor girl?  Leaving her alone in the sauna, n-naked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh relax.\"  Emily said.  \"Nobody was in any danger.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\"  Hina said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let you guys in on a few things.\"  Emily said, as she tugged on her shirt and pointed to a logo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You work here?\"  Mackenzie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily shook her head.  \"Nope, I <i>own</i> this place.\"  She walked towards a wall, which appeared to have a laundry chute.  \"I own it, and I make the rules, and I like to have a little fun.  See these chutes are meant for hotel towels.  But right now...\"  She grinned as she pulled on the bottom of her shirt up, and over her body, easily sliding it off, stripping herself as naked as Mackenzie and Hina.  She opened the chute, and dropped the shirt in.  \"It's for my shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie and Hina looked at each other and then at Emily as if she was crazy.  \"Why did you do that!?\"  Hina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I like to show off, and I like to mess with the good looking girls.\"  Emily said.  \"Here's another little secret for you guys.  The hotel is entirely clothing optional.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clothing optional?\"  Mackenzie said.  \"So we were never in trouble for being naked?  Why didn't the brochure say anything?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where would the fun be in that?  Some like a risk, while others are cute when they squirm.\"  Emily said.  \"I got camera's all over the place, so I know who was daring and who's prone to bad luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... FILMED EVERYTHING!?\"  Mackenzie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax!\"  Emily said.  \"The footage wont leave the building unless you want a copy!  Besides, I gotta be able to save someone who's in danger of getting hurt.  It's a safety thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-where's my stuff?\"  Hina said, shaking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little bit of fun, it's on a cart in the lobby.  You can go get it if you want.\"  Emily said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I can't go out there!\"  Hina shouted fearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you can.  It's perfectly allowed and legal in here.  If you want it brought to you, then maybe you do something else like... finish your shower.\"  Emily winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me?\"  Mackenzie said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...\"  Emily scratched her chin.  \"I think your AC's all fixed up.  Your free to go back to your room or explore the hotel.  Just try to keep the clothing optional thing secret!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie had a small smile, she could get back to her room.  If she was caught she wouldn't be in trouble, as embarrassing as it would be.  Though then she looked at Hina, who was a bit scared.  Emily seemed like try to keep her safe, though she didn't like seeing a friend so stressed...</span></div></div>",

They seemed like decorations.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few of these are actually camera lenses.\"  Emily said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie blushed deeply.  \"In... all of the rooms?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\"  Emily replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red head couldn't look her in the eye.  Emily probably saw every attempt at masturbation Mackenzie took.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mackenzie, if you wanna go,\" Hina gulped.  \"G-go ahead.  I'll be okay.\"  She smiled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're sure,\" Mackenzie said.  She didn't want to leave Hina up to chance, but Emily didn't seem to by lying.  The blonde was probably safe.  \"I'll see ya later,\" The red head smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie took a deep breath as she left the bathroom and heard the shower start up again.  She looked at herself, remembering that she was completely naked.  The red head would just have to go down one floor, grab her key from it's hiding place, and she could finally get back inside her room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there was the other things Emily explained.  Mackenzie had free run of the hotel.  She could pleasure herself anywhere she wanted and not fear getting in trouble.  That could mean finishing what she attempted in the pool room hot tub.

Time seemed to slow down as the door to Hina's room shut and clicked.  Knowing it's hard to hear in the shower, Mackenzie knew neither Hina or Emily would hear her knock trying to get back in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down the hallway towards the elevator.  Her objective was to get back to her room where she could put this naughty adventure behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red head held herself tightly as she walked down the hallway, thinking about what Emily had said.  The whole hotel was clothing optional.  With another naughty tingle, Mackenzie let her hands fall away.  For just this short walk back, maybe she'd try to avoid covering herself.  Her pointing nipples and moist pussy were now on display as she slowly walked forward.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody seemed to step out into the hallway, as Mackenzie reached the elevator.  She pushed the button to call it up and waited.  When it finally showed up, the door opened, and Mackenzie's eyes widened.  She nearly screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a hotel worker, with a hat that read security.  He leaned back in similar surprise.  Had it not been for the sudden shock of everything, Mackenzie might have thought he was handsome.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn instinct, Mackenzie covered herself, and felt her heart racing.  \"A-ah!!\"  She was starting to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!  Calm down!\"  the security guard said.  \"Is everything alright?  Is someone trying to hurt you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie gulped, appearing terrified.  \"N-no... I just wanna get back to my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\"  he said, with a chuckle.  \"Sorry if I scared you, which floor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm not a streaker!\"  Mackenzie suddenly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't ask about that,\" The guard said with a small blush of his own, trying not to stare.  \"And whether or not you are, it doesn't matter.  It's not against the rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie looked at him confused.  \"S-so what the owner, Emily said... it's true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!  Now if no body is trying to hurt you, which floor is your room?\"  The guard said, trying to do his job.  Though Mackenzie could read his eyes wandering her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-four.\"  The exposed red head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Floor four it is!  Enjoy your stay!\"  The guard said, pushing the button and stepping out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie could no longer look him eye to eye, she just ran into the elevator as the door closed.  She let out a large sigh as she was alone again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" she said to herself.  She had been seen, but it was true.  There was nothing wrong with what she was doing.  Her hand that was covering between her legs seemed more moist now.  Did she enjoy that exposure?  Her face was a deep shade of red just thinking about it.  Looking at the reflective walls of the elevator, she could see what the guard saw.  The naked curvy body was moist, having a little bit of sweat from all that running around, and never being properly dried at any point since she left her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator began to move down towards the fourth floor.</span></div></div>",

This was it, a chance to get back into her room.  A chance to get easy access to clothes.  And a chance to scratch a long awaited \"itch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe covered herself, and crept around the walls, listening for if anyone was around.  Nobody was in the hallways, this would be a clean escape!  Mackenzie then crept around toward her door and jiggled the handle.  It did nothing in response.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The key!  Of course!\"  Mackenzie said.  She turned towards the ice machine and chairs.  The red head crept towards it, looked around, and found the chair.  She knelt down and slid her hand under the seat cushion, feeling for the key.  She didn't remember hiding it so far in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, she reached deeply under the chair cushion, both hands abandoning any sort of cover to herself.  Panic set in as she couldn't find it.  She lifted the cushion and saw that it wasn't there!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" Mackenzie said, standing up in frustration.  \"Now what am I going to do...?\"  She sat down and saw her ice bucket.  Now it contained cold water.  She looked forward to the open hallway, gasped and shut her legs.  Everything was on show for a moment.  That key had to be around somewhere!  Mackenzie frantically looked around under the chair.  This meant her backside was lifted up, exposed and visible to anyone who might walk by.  Modesty wasn't Mackenzie's concern anymore though.  Even though it was allowed, she didn't want to have to go back to the ground floor to get a new key, while completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she found her key under the cushion of the other chair.  A wide smile spread across Mackenzie's face, as she snagged it up.  She felt she should lose her ice bucket, so she picked that up too.  The red head happily stepped back towards her room, used her key card, and the door unlocked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, it was over.  Mackenzie set the ice bucket aside and put her room key down by her things.  It was all over!  She noticed the room was a lot cooler now, thanks to the now steadily running air conditioner.  The red head smiled and giggled, unable to believe her luck over the course of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie took a seat on the towel she left on her bed, now there was more freedom available to her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The red head had a slight blush, as she took a deep breath, looking at her naked self.  Slowly, she ran her hands up and down her body, brushing her fingers against her hard nipples, and let out a slight gasp.  A tingle shot through her as she gave it a light pinch.  Then she felt herself, running down her stomach and then tracing her inner thighs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie let out a subtle moan.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bit her lip, thinking about all the things that happened over the course of the night.  It had started with a simple mistake, followed by a lot of luck and close calls, only to find out later there was nothing to fear, aside from a bit of embarrassment.  This state of arousal had pushed her there, and it was time to answer her needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst Mackenzie stood up, and spread out the towel on the bed.  Then she laid down on it, and spread herself out, loving how open and free she felt.  Maybe she could make this hotel a regular vacation spot.  But for now her hands began to wander and trace her smooth skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, one was stimulating her breasts, as the other was rubbing her aching lips.  Her motions were slow at first, but soon she began to increase in speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie's head swirled at all the thoughts of exposure.  She started to squeeze her breast tighter and rub her pussy harder, earning louder moans of pleasure.  She lifted her hips and curled her toes.  The red head clenched her teeth and closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fantasies ran around.  She imagined doing these lewd things everywhere.  Mackenzie thought of pleasuring herself in front of the ice machine, doing it in the elevator waiting for someone to find her.  Letting that hot tub jet finish her.  Those thoughts surged the arousal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Mackenzie crashed into orgasm letting out a scream as her moist lips were making a mark on the towel underneath her.  She rubbed herself furiously, and opened her eyes, as she came again.  She bucked her hips and bounced on the bed some.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand fell away, as she panted.  The lingering arousal hung in her mind.  This hotel was clothing optional, and judging by what Emily said, she could get away with all those things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled to herself.  For the rest of her time in the hotel, she decided she would be naked.  She would lounge in her room without so much as a sock.  A swimsuit would never conceal her nudity here.  Maybe she would even finish what she started at that hot tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie's stamina had been spent from finally getting relief.  She laid on bed completely nude and dozed off with naughty thoughts.  During her little nap, her hands drifted towards her stomach, but did little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Mackenzie slowly woke up.  She had blushed as she remembered everything she thought of doing.  Now that she was less horny, all those ideas sounded crazy.  Maybe she could stand lounging around her room naked, but didn't want to risk more than that, regardless of the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a subtle rumble in her stomach, so she thought to put some clothes on and then order room service.  So the nude red head willed herself up to her feet, and looked toward her suitcase.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I could just wear the towel when the room service shows up...\"  Mackenzie said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of cute, AND bold!  I like you!\"  said a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie's blood ran cold, and looked toward her door.  Emily, still naked, was standing outside her doorway!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEEK!\"  Mackenzie scream, ran up and shut the door.  Her heart nearly jumped out of her chest as she covered her body with just her hands.  She could hear Emily laugh outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Mackenzie, I've seen everything, let me in.\"  Emily said.  \"I wanna chat!  Really, it's fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie tried to calm herself.  Emily owned the hotel.  She wondered if she was in trouble.  Mackenzie thought to wrap herself in a towel first, but did Emily really care?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mackenzie crept up to the door and opened it, and Emily happily pushed it wide open.  Mackenzie squeaked in shock, as Emily shut the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it easy Mackenzie, I just wanted to say a couple of things.  First, I saw your door was open when you got back to your room.  You forgot to close it.\"  Emily said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I did!?\"  Mackenzie said, her face suddenly burning red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, I saw you lay down on the bed and give yourself what you wanted.\"  Emily said.  \"Now if you're gonna do that, I recommend closing the door.  If you wanna show off, then you don't have to.  But sometimes a scream can wake up other guests.\"  She winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie barely heard any of that, the thought of her masturbating with an open door shook her a little.  The thought also made her uncovered nipples stick out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you set a courtsey towel, you can just throw that in the laundry chute.\"  Emily said, pointed to the subtle stain from Mackenzie's self pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I...c-courtesy towel?\"  Mackenzie said, still appearing stunned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah.  Better that gets on a towel then on the blankets.\"  Emily said with a giggle and sat down, pushed the towel away, and patted a spot for Mackenzie to sit.  \"Have a seat and calm down a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie slowly sat down on the luxurious fabric of the blankets, lightly tickling her as she sat down.  \"So um... what happened to Hina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She got her clothes back after finishing her shower as promised.\"  Emily looked at Mackenzie.  \"Hey, I love messing with some of our guests, but I stand by my words!  And I can tell you had a lot of fun here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie blushed, trying not to look Emily directly in the eye.  But eventually she admitted, \"This is a nice hotel... and um... I guess it's... kind of fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily giggled.  \"I'm glad you like it.  You're welcome to streak the place anytime during your stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree run of the hotel.  Mackenzie just couldn't believe it.  She had done things this night that would normally land most people in jail.  It's like the hotel was meant for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks... I was kind of thinking of making this place, a bit of a regular vacation spot.\"  Mackenzie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily's face lit up.  \"I'm glad you feel that way!  I just know you'll love this then!\"  She then handed Mackenzie a plastic card on a lanyard.  It said VIP with a special bar code.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"  Mackenzie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a VIP pass.  You can stay here whenever you like and streak as much as you want!\"  Emily said.  \"Flash it to the room service guy while you're naked and you'll get free food!\"  Then the brunette got up.  \"It's also kind of a master key to the hotel.  You can get in anywhere you want.  Just reserve a room if you don't want to be bothered.\"  She stretched her naked form.  \"Well, I got hotel owner stuff to do!  Enjoy you're stay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie looked at the key card as Emily left.  This reminder of all the free run Mackenzie had was not keeping her calm.  She picked up the towel and took it to the bathroom and dropped it in the laundry chute.  She wanted to relax but was also feeling daring again.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The only button pressed on the panel was for the ground floor, so why the stop? Had someone on the third floor called the elevator too? Mackenzie's heart began to race as she anticipated the opening of the doors with dread... but they didn't budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...?\" Mackenzie asked nobody in particular. If the doors weren't opening, and the elevator wasn't moving...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie's blood turned to ice as she realized what this meant: the elevator was stuck between floors!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. No no no! This can't be happening right now!\" Mackenzie wailed. Of all the times for the elevator to break, it chose the moment she was in it at her most vulnerable?! What cosmic being had she angered to deserve this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a loss for what to do, Mackenzie found herself startled once again as a voice erupted from the button panel of the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, hello, miss? Can you hear me?\" the voice said, as Mackenzie realized there was a speaker next to the emergency call button. The system must work two ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can.\" Mackenzie replied. \"The elevator's stuck and... wait. How did you know I was a woman before I said anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see you on the security camera.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie's eyes widened as she whipped around and saw the camera she'd failed to notice when she ran onto the elevator in a panic. In her efforts to hide, she'd unwittingly given some lucky security guard a free show! Quickly and ashamedly clamping her arms over her nudity, Mackenzie blushed as red as her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, there's no need for that. I've kinda seen it all already.\" the voice said. \"In fact... that's why I hit the emergency stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did this?! On purpose?!\" Mackenzie cried, her voice torn between despair and rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I could have let you go all the way to the ground floor. I'm sure the people waiting for an elevator would appreciate it. I'm helping you out here, trust me. The group stuck waiting down there would have a field day with you.\" the security officer's voice explained. \"And for this kindness, all I ask is for a simple favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And that is?\" Mackenzie asked, fearing the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy! Sit down facing the camera, spread those gorgeous legs of yours, and have a little fun! You do that, I'll move you back up to the fourth floor and you can hurry on back to your room unseen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie's stomach was doing flips as she considered the man's horrible offer. Could she honestly bring herself to do something like that? Play with herself for some stranger's pleasure? Hell, could she even trust his word? For all Mackenzie knew, there wasn't anybody waiting for the elevator on the ground floor.</span></div></div>",
