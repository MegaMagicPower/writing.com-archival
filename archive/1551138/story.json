He didn't have the extra pair of arms. He reached up to feel the back of his head. He still felt hair. Just as he lifted up his other arm, the other two burst out of his sides. His skin now four arms red. He was now growing taller. He guessed he was at eight feet now. Not as tall as four arms.He was enjoying the growth. He looked down at his body, he saw his feet, they were not two toed. \"That's odd,\" he said. He continued to look at his body. His abs now showing under his shirt. \"Cool,\" he thought. He \"walked\" over to the lake to see himself. When he got their, he saw his reflection. He was surprised. He still had \"human\" feet. He was about 16 feet tall, taller than four arms. He had a very large, very visible 6-pack. Veins were also visible. He did a bicep flexing, the veins bulging even more through his thick skin. He looked at his face, he was even more surprised.He still  had his hair, but it was a bit shaggier. He had four arms eyes, but only two of them. He had become a humanoid four arms. Ben wanted to test his new form. He ran over to the nearest tree and picked it up with ease, then threw it. \"I'm so strong now,\" Ben's new deep four arms voice said. \"I wonder when I'm going to time out. He looked over to his shoulder and saw the omnitrix piece wasn't on either shoulder. Ben was stuck.... forever.</span></div></div>",

As they reach there, a beam was shot to their direction. Ben and Gwen evades the shot by jump to the opposite side. Ben lands infront of the Forever Knights King.\"Well well well. If it isn't the great Ben Tennyson. Now how do you intend to stop me ha?\"said the King in a cheerful tone.\"Like this! Its hero time\" Ben said as he turn the dial on the new and improved Heatblast annd slammed the omnitrix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOM!!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay of green light fills the area.

Heatblast's arm which was once skinny was beginning to bulge with muscle and power making it grow to the point where in his gravel skin like state looks like a mountain of muscle, rock hard muscle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Heatblast's chest and body area began to develop mountainuous proportion of muscle which almost make him seemed like an immobile musclebound hero except that in his growth, the body had grown taller and longer too which would free grant movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally his lower area where was beginning to become exhausted from supporting the heavy muscle above began to explode with tonnes, of muscles and strength. The thighs are filled with gigantic muscle which fits well with Heatblast's other body part and his calves muscle which seems like a set of bowling balls being stacked along its calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere stood the musclebound hero which is 20 feet tall pile of mountainous pure muscle and strength covered in flame which began to ingnite much more rapidly that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeaaaah Im the Super Powercharged HEATBLAST!!! Warghhh!!!!!\" Roar Heatblast in a much lower manly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well its looks like the tables had turned isn't it\" Gloats Heatblast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(To see how Heatblast looks like, use this link &lt;http://muk100.deviantart.com/art/Max-Heatblast-84278848&gt;)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeatblast with ease defeats the King and all the other Forever Knights.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
