And unfortunately for you, you happen to be on the scrawny side. Most people of your disposition would fear predators, always shying away from them for fear of getting shoveled down their maws like so many unlucky meals. But for some reason, you can't help but find yourself... drawn to predators. Fascinated by their sheer power, their gluttonous tendencies, and their ability to turn whole people into pure soft layers of plumpness. When one of them happens to catch your eye, you can only wonder... will you be able to win their heart? Or will you end up as pudge on their hips like so many prey before you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before we can delve into that, you have to declare... what sort of predator would most catch your attention?</span></div></div>",

That's right - if you fail to pay your debts around here, you'll end up gurgling away into pudge while your stuff gets repossessed. Outside of her job, though, she's quite a friendly and kind woman, but you'll have to have a high tolerance for predators if you want to hang out with her, as all her friends happen to be debt collectors too, frequently chatting together while ignoring the protests and squirms coming from all their engorged guts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Larae<br>\r\nAge: 23<br>\r\nSpecies: White Reed Frog<br>\r\nBio: Larae\u2019s found that just about no pair of pants will be stretchy enough to contain her wide, thick hips for long, and at this point, she\u2019s just stopped trying, going around in nothing but a black hoodie. Nobody dares complain about her bottomless, though, as she has a reputation as an open predator! Liking to climb up onto buildings or into trees and reach her long, sticky tongue down to grab people below. From there, she makes her cash by stealing everything they have on them, before either just swallowing them whole, or licking them all over to lube them up before slipping them up her ass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Alida<br>\r\nAge: 29<br>\r\nSpecies: Opossum<br>\r\nBio: Dedicated to caring for the weak and feeble. While not a typical predator by any means, being on the scrawny side herself, she has a knack for shrinking others down. Luckily, she mostly uses this for good - she has the ability to heal or soothe others with her womb, which she puts to good use in her job as a nurse. Of course, if a patient is just rude of annoying, she might just slip them other places instead - no harm in some \u2018vanishing\u2019 every once in a while. Mainly, though, if you show her kindness, she will return that kindness tenfold back to you.</span></div></div>",

Flicking a lot of copper red hair out of your face, you slumped down onto your Craigslist couch and grabbed the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt twenty-three years old, the solo bachelorette life was comfortable. You worked a modest gig doing advertising for a local club - it didn't pay well, but it was enough to keep a roof over your head and one of Zinnia's slummy districts. Of course, the apartment life wasn't all pizza and glamour; it meant putting up with a constant racket from your neighbors, and tonight was no exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know much about the scuzzy guy living across the hall from you, but he seemed to be engaged in a particularly heated argument with someone and had decided to carry on in the hallway right outside of your apartment. With an irritated sigh, you set the remote and leftovers down, and padded back across the kitchen on socked feet before pressing a curious ear to your door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">--- --- --- --- ---</div><br>\r\n\"...Look, I already told the last guy what came 'round - <i>I don't have the money right now,</i> so why don't you tuck that pretty tail where the sun don't shine and get lost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Despite whatever finely-articulated argument you may have used to  with the previous collector - I won't be so easily persuaded. I'm with a different agency, you see, and if you are unable to make the minimum payment right now at this very moment, we will be forced to use <i>other means</i> to recoup the remainder of your debt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iz'at supposed to be some kinda threat? You think I'm scared of you, scrawny little lemur bitch?? How's about you step in 'ere and I show you how we deal with paper-snatchin' pricks like you around-<i>WHOA WHAT THE-mmph!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">--- --- --- --- ---</div><br>\r\nYou had been listening to the altercation with a detached interest, but the sound of your neighbor's tirade suddenly cut short - and followed by a muffled, squelching noise - set your heart racing. Standing on tiptoe, you pressed your eye to the tiny peephole in your door, but were met with a cloudy grey blur. You cursed quietly to yourself; you'd forgotten that the glass lens was busted. Pushing your ear back to the door again, you could hear what sounded like gulping noises, followed by a contented feminine sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour curiosity got the better of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the knob firmly as you turned it to avoid making any noise, you gently prized your door open just a crack and peeked out into the hall. There, with her back turned to you, was a slender lemur-woman in a form fitting blazer and pencil skirt. You missed the visual cue of her tufted grey ears twitching to tell you that she had heard your intrusion on the scene, but it became obvious enough when she wheeled around, swinging into view her exposed, massively distended - and energetically squirming gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden movement and the sight of your now obviously swallowed neighbor startled you enough that you fell clumsily backward and away from the door, causing it to swing to open. The lemur-woman was now standing in full view in your doorway, staring down at you in nothing but your panties and a t-shirt, and she looked...</span></div></div>",

Straight from birth this woman was raised to be an assassin, having her body both trained and heavily modified to kill anyone. Her infamy has been respected and feared by those that dwell in the underworld; however, whenever she's up top, she's mocked about the stereotyping of her species stinking, though after being modified, her gas can literally kill a person with a single whiff. As a predator, she's satisfied with either gulping up her targets or pushing them up her rump, which gains most of the fat after digesting them and later expelling them out as more gas to kill her future targets. During a usual assassination job, she encounters you, which makes her heart melt immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Sabrina<br>\r\nAge: 25<br>\r\nSpecies: Crocodile<br>\r\nBio: Serving eleven years in the military, she's now stationed in Zinnia City and despite not being active in the military, she still has a bit of power among the ranks as a drill instructor. Strict and somewhat sadistic, but well disciplined, if any of her students misbehave or don't cut it, down the hatch they go, where she'll work them off until they're nothing more but nutrients for her already big, buff muscles. After her friends signed her up on a dating site, she's currently nervous for the first time, as they're aware that she's a predator and now waiting for you outside the base she's at, which ironically you have a connection to.</span></div></div>",

The kicker being that Victoria doesn\u2019t know any other pred who eats even half as many prey as dear old momma. Of course, this double standard only applied to her own consumption. Victoria wasn\u2019t allowed a single prey the entire time she lived at home. So now she\u2019s ready to completely and totally cut loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully she has no clue how to hunt. Thankfully as long as you bring her prey you\u2019re off the menu. Unfortunately, you\u2019re figuring this out on the run yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Melody<br>\r\nAge: 23<br>\r\nSpecies: Great White Shark<br>\r\nBio: One of the meanest and toughest preds around, at least when she\u2019s hungry, Melody makes it a point to keep off the pounds as much as possible. It makes you slow, and slow lets the coppers catch you. A huge pred is much scarier, but a slim pred is often underestimated even when her pale belly and leathery gray back warning others to beware. Her boss knows how to use this well, and Melody has been the primary enforcer in the gang for a while, with a steady elimination rate for the worst performers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after meeting you and going straight, Melody will have no other option but to eat her way out of the gang, out of the jail and out of crime for good.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Normally, Elephants don\u2019t really have to worry about becoming prey for an average pred. Standing a full head taller than a Grizzly and beating even most sharks in height, only the Orca, Great White Shark and vanishingly rare dinosaur and mythical anthros are both carnivorous and larger than the Elephant. Not to mention the sheer girth of the Elephant that made the average healthy weight of the largest land mammal fully 5 times what most Wolves and Humans weigh or a couple dozen times what rodents like Rats or Mice might weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, this makes Elephants a truly rare delicacy that those few extremely large or especially voracious preds who can stomach so much meat dearly love. And you are an absolute runt that the average pred could potentially manage! Your still big by human standards, standing 6\u20196\u201d and weighing just over 300 pounds. But that puts you a head shorter than the average Grizzly with a huge host of potential preds that most Elephants never need fear. Wolves, Lions, Jaguars, Panthers and Tigers could all prey on you if they wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour grandmother, the matriarch of the herd as you still thought of your extended family that lived in the same specially made apartment complex, hadn\u2019t wanted you to leave yet. If she\u2019d had her way, you\u2019d have been even with your mother\u2019s 8\u2019 even before leaving. But you couldn\u2019t control yourself anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young bull Elephant, your instincts demanded that you exercise full freedom and take control of your life. Which led to endless fighting with the hierarchy of the herd until finally they decided you had to go. They were nice about it, sending you to college for free and packing you up, but you knew what this was. It was the boot from the herd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour grandmother did have some last advice for you before you left though. \u201cJeremy,\u201d the elderly matriarch began. \u201cYou have to be careful in this cruel world, and protect yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, rolling your eyes. \u201cI know that Grandma. If someone wants to eat me the law gives me the right to resist with anything short of lethal force. Isn\u2019t that why you taught me so many ways to knock out a pred?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour grandmother smiles. \u201cThat will keep you safe from the short term pred who simply tries to gulp you down on sight. But what is far more insidious is the girls who play a longer game. If you give your heart to a girl who thinks with her stomach that\u2019s where you will find yourself sooner or later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did not sound like advice you wanted to hear. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that it fairly clearly could save your life someday you\u2019d have walked out rather than listen to this annoying garbage. \u201cAnd I bet you\u2019ve got some kind of sage advice for how to tell which girls think with their stomachs?\u201d You challenge, beyond ready to get out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour grandmother nods, smiling slightly. She sat down so that she\u2019d be looking up into your eyes instead of looking down on you, taking your hands to grasp your attention fully. \u201cI do. Two ways, neither perfect alone, but both solid and nearly perfect together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe first is to pay attention to her species. Herbivores like Zebras, Giraffes and most Whales are rarely preds. Omnivores like Gorillas, Bears and such are twice as likely to be preds and carnivores like Lions are ten times as likely. It\u2019s simple instinct. The second is her weight. A fat girl eats a lot, and the chances that includes prey are rather high. Chubby girls probably aren\u2019t ruled by their stomachs, but some exercise to cut weight gain as much as possible to keep from scaring off prey. But skinny girls almost certainly are not vicious preds because there\u2019s simply no way to eat prey every week and stay thin. Nobody has a metabolism that good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t really argue with the advise, and rolled your eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t worry Grandma. I don\u2019t plan on being what rips some fatass\u2019s pants.\u201d Despite your assurance to her, you know full well that you wouldn\u2019t follow both guidelines strictly. It was obvious to stay away from the fat carnivore, but you refused to be limited to scrawny herbivores. Thin carnivores and thick herbivores would both get your attention, as would chubby omnivores... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, maybe not chubby omnivores. Two maybes is a lot more dangerous than one solid no. This might take some more thought after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you made it to campus, long since having grown frustrated trying to figure out what to do when neither extreme was present and setting up your room in high bad humor. Which only got worse when you saw your roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe introduced himself as Harry, and you couldn\u2019t help thinking his parents must have had a sense of humor. You\u2019d never seen someone with so much hair! Every inch of the enormous Sea Otter\u2019s 5\u20193\u201d 500 pound frame was covered in thick, thick hair so that you couldn\u2019t see his skin to save your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven worse, the marine rodent clearly had someone\u2019s remains in his stomach, and you could feel him eyeing you for a possible meal. You figured immediately that it would be a good idea to remind the punk that size alone wasn\u2019t the only reason that Elephants were rarely prey for others. Another reason is an incredible degree of strength that made Elephants kings of physical strength among prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you grab him by his neck and pin him against the wall, forcing him up off of the floor in spite of his weight. When his eyes are level with your own you give him a deep glare. \u201cDon\u2019t get any funny ideas Harry. I\u2019m stronger than you.\u201d It was half bluff, but you\u2019d already proven it was only half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreds inevitably were much stronger than prey, but the gap wasn\u2019t always absolute. Each species had their own advantages over others. If Harry were to try to eat you in the pool you\u2019d be practically defenseless against his ability to hunt in the water. But if it were a contest of pure muscle? You could handle that much, especially when you were as pissed as you were right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe threat worked like a charm though, and you see fear in his eyes. The idiot probably thinks your a pred yourself. You drop him and the heavy thud almost makes you wince as Harry lands on his immense butt. Then you turn away to find somewhere to blow some steam and find some chicks. Maybe spend the night with one and lose the V card that the herd had made it impossible to get rid of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do some looking around, eventually finding a good hangout with great music and gorgeous gals. Checking out the place and the selection you see several excellent picks, but you hold off. You want to find the perfect woman for tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, hearing the door open and turning to look, you found her. The cheetah girl was an absolute knockout. She was 5\u20195\u201d wearing a black outfit that called complete attention to her slender figure and hypnotic spots. You doubted that she weighed more than 100 pounds, but she carried herself with such grace that it awed you. Then she looked in your direction, and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBusted for staring! Damn. Now you had to make a move. For a moment you hear your grandmother saying that carnivore species are far more likely to be preds, but just look at this girl! She\u2019s clearly never swallowed a prey in her life! It will be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way over to her and strike up a conversation. She introduces herself as Victoria, and soon proves both witty and smart. As you chat she keeps giving you this look that sends shivers down your spine, a look that says that she is hungry for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Alright, I admit I took some liberties with the whole \u201cprey weaker than the pred\u201d thing. Here\u2019s the thing, Jeremy the Elephant here is strong enough to bring Victoria other prey, but he is too slow for facing a Cheetah. When Victoria decides to eat him she\u2019s able to dodge every one of his haymakers and then to gulp him when he\u2019s exhausted. The balance of power between them is just barely enough that Victoria doesn\u2019t feel like fighting him into her belly as long as he\u2019s bringing her plenty of other prey. But if he lets her starve or pisses her off there\u2019s a lot she can do about it, including eating him.)</span></div></div>",

However, he was semi-confident in himself that his move to the large and well-funded Zinnia College would be the last time he would have to go through the experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was definitely heart wrenching for him to say goodbye to his family, but the idea of the University Lifestyle and the thought of being on his own was far too enticing for someone his age to resist. It was slightly concerning that he did not even have a proper idea of what he wanted to major in, but these fears were dashed as he remembered his old and, quite frankly, uneventful life. He wanted a change of pace, meet some new people and perhaps make some friends that would stick around. Today was to be the first day of his assigned classes to start, and he was certainly passionate for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just because he was enthusiastic did not mean he was fearless. Patrick repeated to his mental self over and over again as he walked from his room in the hallway of the boy\u2019s dormitory to just be confident. But it had no effect. Why would he be so scared? It had to do with his species, which stood out amidst the overloaded and fast breeding rodents and other mammals that flooded the hallways with timid prey trying to look as small as possible. It made him a target, an easy one at that for some predator to snatch him up and turn him into pudge. He was a...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Like most squirrels, Patrick was just about a ball of anxiety! Anxious that he\u2019d make a bad first impression in front of his professors, anxious that he wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with the college workload, anxious that he wasn\u2019t going to be nearly as smart as any of his peers, anxious that he\u2019d end up losing his scholarships and going into endless debt, anxious that he\u2019d never come up with a major to declare\u2026 and, of course, most of all, anxious about getting eaten!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaculty were forbidden from eating students\u2026 which was a good thing, too, as a lot of them looked like they\u2019d be extremely dangerous. On the other hand, students were allowed to devour other students \u2018on a reasonable basis\u2019 - whatever that means. And college tended to be where most predators got their \u2018awakenings\u2019, so\u2026 well, a recent study found that the Zinnia College student body shrinks by about 18% over the course of each school year. And as far as prey went, he stuck out like a sore thumb!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day progressed, though, his anxiety slowly faded. The dawn of the fall semester seemed to be a cause for celebration, and songs were playing and free food was being offered all over campus. Huge anthros who he thought were intimidating predators turned out to be pretty chill when he talked to them. His professors seemed to be interesting and funny, and he was already a tad fascinated by the glimpses of the material he was being given. Overall, the jubilant atmosphere on campus calmed him down, and convinced him it wouldn\u2019t be so bad here\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he had about an hour-long break inbetween classes, so he slipped away from the crowds, heading into one of the less used buildings to get some space. The opossum girl behind the counter gave him a smile, but beyond that, and the occasional student wandering around, the place seemed pretty empty, since there were no classes here today. He got even more privacy when he tucked himself away at one of the booths, his short figure obscuring him from anyone around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, he took out his laptop and started going over the syllabi, making a little calendar of every assignment that was going to be due over the semester. As he did, he couldn\u2019t help but overhear something\u2026 what sounds like heavy hooves, trotting down the hallway. Heavy enough to shake the table ever so slightly. He raised his ears, fearing that he may be alone with some giant predator\u2026 only to breathe in relief as he saw it was just a campus custodian. Since she was a faculty, there was no way she would be allowed to eat anybody\u2026 right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he couldn\u2019t help but be fascinated by how big he was. Sure, she was a hippo, and hippos were supposed to be pretty big\u2026 but she was large even among them! She stood quite a few feet taller than Patrick, with a heaving, fat belly that poked out beneath her overly strained shirt, easily dragging a much smaller cart around as she lazily trotted down the hallway. She didn\u2019t seem to notice him in that booth at all, which gave him the opportunity to steal a few shameful glances at that humongous, pudgy rump, barely contained by her overworked pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she passed, you went right back to working on your laptop\u2026 but eventually you noticed that she seemed to be loitering around this section of the building a lot. She didn\u2019t seem to be cleaning anything, and it\u2019s not like there was anybody even over here\u2026 what was she doing pacing around so much? Eventually, you notice something. There was a wolf guy sitting at one of the other booths, and every time she passed, she seemed to pause, glancing at him nervously. Did\u2026 she have a crush on him, or something\u2026? You suppose he was pretty hunky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you work, you occasionally glance up at the amusing spectacle of a custodian apparently crushing on one of the students, maybe trying to work up the nerve to speak with him. That might be an interesting show! However, one time, as she\u2019s passing, you hear something other than just her hoofsteps\u2026 was that\u2026 her massive stomach growling? You freeze up as you start to rethink the situation. Were those\u2026 hungry looks she was giving him? No, that wasn\u2019t possible\u2026 faculty weren\u2019t allowed to eat students\u2026!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could react, though, she had stopped right next to his table this time, and stood still there long enough for the wolf to notice and look up at her\u2026 only to see a massive hippo lady licking her lips! You can only watch in horror as those giant, pudgy hands reach up to grab him by the sides, suddenly lifting him out of his seat as he\u2019s dazed by the sight of that massive, slobbery maw sliding open, her warm, foul breath washing over him! He can only let out a fraction of a yelp before those jaws slam down around his upper body, muffling his protests!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anxiousness of the hippo seems to fade away as she\u2019s overwhelmed with his taste, a satisfied look on her face as she suckles on and licks all over the student in her maw, his kicking legs dangling from her lips. Apparently, she must have not noticed you, and figured there would be no witnesses to her little work snack! You wanted to do something, but\u2026 you were sort of mesmerized by the sight of her tasting him, as his entire upper body is lodged in his maw. Like a deer in headlights, you sit there, trying to process the situation...</span></div></div>",

The soon to be pudge desperately attempted to push her off of him, but the hidden power that she possessed was far too great for him to fight back against; he was food and he knew it. His canine head was pushed into her esophagus with an audible glurk, wet slime coating his face and lubing him down to his inevitable fate <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick watched on as the rest of the Wolf slid past the janitor\u2019s blunt teeth, hungry for squirming meat as he kicked his paws at her fat breasts and tummy. The sounds that the Hippo women made as she swallowed this stranger made the squirrel squirm with disgust and arousal, opening her mouth wide with a great big \u2018ah\u2019 before the last bit of wolf was snugly entombed in her maw. She slurped up the drool pooling in her mouth and dropped on the floor before swallowing his legs whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick didn\u2019t do anything to help. He just sat there, mesmerized at the disappearance of his peer. He watched the hippo\u2019s blubbery neck bulge with the last bit of his body as he was deposited into her stomach with ease. Her shiny, rubbery belly had ballooned with its new occupant, wobbling and quivering like a plush waterbed, making all sorts of glooshing and glorping sounds like an organic orchestra. With her eyes closed in contentment, the squirrel watched as she began to walk towards his booth to rest her, her plump rear end nearly squishing him as he shifted to the side at the last second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick was now pinned between a wall and the biggest predator he had ever seen, her fat gut only slightly squirming as she sucked her hands clean before letting out a huge, rolling belch of satisfaction. \u201cA-ahhhhh\u2026\u201d The big Hippo purred in an almost angelic voice as she gripped both sides of her distended gut to snake it, feeling her prey move in panic under her thick fat. \u201cYou freshman...you just keep getting tastier and tastier each year\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo licked her fingers again, savoring the taste of her former meal and making disgusting sucking noises. \u201cMmmm\u2026and they always taste better when they don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, too.\u201d The squirrel watched on, disgusted with himself as he felt his member harden against his will from just observing at the ball of blubber the wolf had gone to, jiggling and shaking like an ocean. He was so entranced by it that he didn\u2019t notice the hippo\u2019s eyes finally opening again and landing on his body. \u201cEEEEP!\u201d She let out a shriek of shock, her domineering persona quickly fading as fear and panic crept back into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...oh God, were you there this whole time?! I didn\u2019t even see you...oh no!\u201d. The hippo\u2019s relaxation had come to an abrupt halt as she realized that she had been caught in the act. \u201cOh god, n-now you\u2019re going to tell on me, and I\u2019m gonna lose my job, and-!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no\u2026\u201d Patrick spoke up as he cautiously scooted closer to the Hippo in his booth. \u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone\u2026\u201d. He probably should though, when he thought about it. She was a faculty member who broke the rules, she had just eaten a fellow student right in front of him! And yet, despite how wrong it all was...the look of fear and hopelessness on her face utterly devastated him beyond the rest he witnessed. He wanted to help, even though he knew he shouldn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha...what?\u201d The Hippo spoke in between sobs and hiccups as Patrick\u2019s words registered in her head. \u201cB-But I-...Oh!\u201d Suddenly, she let out a gasp as she turned her head to face the witness to her crime, only to find him pitifully trying to cover up an obvious bulge in his crotch. She blinked a couple of times, and slowly smiled, turning the rest of her body towards the squirrel to make it seem like she was even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaww, you like me, don\u2019t ya, lil\u2019 squirrely?\u201d The giant hippo women cooed as she rubbed her bulging belly hypnotically at the entranced squirrel in front of her. Patrick didn\u2019t want to admit it, but...he did indeed. He had never witnessed someone getting eaten before, he had always heard stories about it but never seen it in person. It was both horrifying and kind of beautiful, seeing someone just fade away as more of someone else replaced them. The custodian gently grabbed one of the paws hovering over his bulge and pressed it to her rubbery gut, letting it sink into her fat. \u201cGo on, now. I know you want to rub it, it\u2019s all over your face!\u201d She giggled as she shook her tummy tauntingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, Patrick began to rub little circles in the hippo\u2019s flab, the giant sphere offering so much plush softness for his fingers to play with. He didn't object when the hippo grabbed his other paw and placed on her gut as well, nor did he when she scooted his body even closer to her, his whole torso practically squished up against her. Within minutes, he was outright hugging the predator with as much as his arms could wrap around, his chin resting atop the slowly squirming dome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm...my name is Darline~\u201d The custodian purred as she fondled Patrick\u2019s bushy tail, the appendage wrapping around her and giving her a pleasing tickle. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, squirrely?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick sighed and let his face fall into the stomach he was massaging, the last of the wolf\u2019s squirms dying out as it was converted into more plush fat. \u201cIt\u2019s...Patrick\u2026\u201d He let out, his voice muffled by the layers of flab pushing into his tiny mouth. This was all so weird for him. He knew he should have been disgusted with himself for what he was doing, but...he was just so won over, so relaxed with Darline. \u201cAre you...gonna eat me, too?\u201d He breathed out, lifting up his face to meet the grinning hippo\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm...no, squirrely. At least, not now. That wolfy will keep me going for a couple of hours...you p-promise you won\u2019t tell anyone about this, right?\u201d Darline stuttered a little bit, revealing her inner shyness for a split second. Patrick nodded and forced himself off from her comfy paunch. He could spend hours fondling the great sphere, but he knew if he spent too much time around it, he could end up inside as well. \u201cWhere are you going, Patrick?\u201d She smiled mischievously, knowing fully well she had him trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, uh...I g-gotta go back to my dorm, study for my new classes\u2026\u201d Patrick explained as he tried to find some wiggle room to shimmy across the hippo\u2019s midriff, finding none. \u201cUm...could you let me through?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could...if you do me a favor~\u201d Darline grinned at the blushing squirrel.</span></div></div>",

Having to sneak a student down her gullet while hoping nobody would happen upon what was happening was always a fright\u2026 plus the sheer sensation of having a tasty student wriggling in her fat stomach! It was always the biggest thrill in her otherwise extremely boring days on the job. When she turned and saw Patrick, though, her heart just about leapt out of her chest! Instead of dooming career like she expected, though, she was treated to another sort of thrill\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick seemed\u2026 fascinated by her! That bulge obvious in the front of his pants as he twitched and squirmed there in his seat, filled with arousal at what he had just seen. This turned the hippo\u2019s cheeks just as flaring red, as it took her completely by surprise! It had been so long since anybody had\u2026 desired her before. And to be able to be so fascinated by her after what she had just done\u2026 it made her feel so\u2026 beautiful! Desirable! All the big hippo ever really wanted was to be loved\u2026!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOvercome with these feelings, shortly after asking for a favor, she reached those chubby hands down and lifted patrick from his seat! He immediately knew that this was it\u2026 it was over! He wasn\u2019t even going to make it through his first day of school without being packed away into somebody\u2019s fat, sloshy belly! He tensed up, his heart beating out of his chest as he was raised to those massive lips. But instead of eating him\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 she pulled him in close for a kiss! Wrapping her arms around him, pressing him against that firm, gurgling gut as she passionately made out with the squirrel. He was immediately light-headed from it all, but still managed to return her barrage of kisses\u2026 even after she laid down on the booth\u2019s seat, her giant rump in the air as Patrick\u2019s lower body was squished beneath her heavy gut, as she continued making out with him! He felt like he might just pass out from how overwhelming her sudden barrage of affection all was, especially feeling that bulge in his pants get pressed against that giant gut\u2026!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, though, she finally pulled her head back, her face all red and an expression like she\u2019d been just as surprised by all that as he\u2019d been. She left Patrick limp and dazed on the seat as she pulled back, trying to take a moment to compose herself. \u201cAaahh\u2026 that was\u2026 oooh~\u201d She tried to get over these shivering feelings spreading over her huge body. Eventually, now that her fat belly hid any evidence of the student she just swallowed, she finally felt comfortable trotting off back to work. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll\u2026 be seeing you around, squirrelly~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick just laid there, just sort of staring at her huge ass as she trotted off back to work, one of his fellow peers now packed away in her huge stomach. Eventually, he knew that he had to leave too\u2026 just sort of waddling back towards his dorms trying not to let his sheer arousal show. He knew he needed to take care of this before next class\u2026 even as he walked, his mind was a dreamlike haze of fantasies and daydreams, all involving that huge hippo. Maybe he was having his very own \u2018awakening\u2019...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stumbled back into his dorm, basically sliding his shorts off the moment that he knew that his dormmates weren\u2019t there. He definitely wasn\u2019t going to be doing any \u2018studying\u2019. Instead, he could only collapse back onto his bed, looking down at his vividly pink, unsheathed manhood, just as hard as it had been the moment he had witnessed that macabre display. As he slowly reached down for it, all sorts of images flashed through his mind. The hippo suckling on that wolf\u2026 that bulging gut\u2026 the sound of it gurgling and glurping\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis every muscle was tense, an overwhelming sensation washing over him as he wrapped a hand around his manhood and started to gently stroke along its thick length, thinking back to that kiss, and just wishing he could\u2019ve done more with her. Picturing that pudgy gut and fat ass fully bare\u2026 he\u2019d always had sort of a thing for those much larger than him, much as he didn\u2019t want to deny it\u2026 and he had sort of daydreamed about what seeing a predator eat somebody would be like\u2026 but it all came to a head here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was practically thrusted his hips in bed, all of these thoughts driving him crazy. Knowing that that wolf guy was still imprisoned inside that pudgy stomach, even now\u2026! It was only a few minutes, at that rate, before relief finally came to him, and he let out a shuddering moan as he finally rode out his climax, picturing himself being pinned down beneath that huge, perfect tummy! It was all enough to leave him panting and sweating there in bed, feeling like everything was going to be different from now on\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed, things changed. Largely his fantasies. Over the course of the next few days, he\u2019d occasionally glance down at the guts of larger students and daydream about how much prey they might\u2019ve packed in there. But ultimately, as the days went on, he slowly started to compose himself, getting back into the college lifestyle. Slowly making friends, studying for classes, connecting with his professors\u2026 though he was still thinking about that hippo. And apparently, she was still thinking about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to see her around campus way more than any other custodian. Almost like she was learning his schedule, positioning herself to bump into him every once in a while. He even took the opportunity to playfully tease him whenever he passed by. He tried not to overthink things, but he kept passing by her on a daily basis\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis couldn\u2019t last forever. Eventually, the two had to speak to eachother again!</span></div></div>",

Navigating the crowded corridors is hard enough, but it is an even more difficult situation at his lithe size. He had made friends with some of his new peers since his first day, but the underlying fear of being eaten by them is still present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick's heart gave out a flutter as he remembered his first day and Darline. Not only was it the first time he witnessed a predator eat another, but it was also his first hug from outside a family member, and his first kiss. Ever since that fateful encounter, he had developed quite the crush on her, and their brief interactions in the weeks that followed only strengthened it. She would discreetly shake her rump at him, give him a wink and an air kiss. She had been stalking him, he reasoned, as time went on he saw her more and more each day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, however...today he did not see her at all. Had she possibly lost interest in him? Patrick certainly hoped not, because he had not in her. It was so hard to forget about her, she had stolen his heart with her big, fat tummy that was capable of digesting him into more soft pudge. It was at this time, right when he began to fantasize about Darline again, walking towards his dormitory, his phone vibrated. Willing himself back into reality, he took out his phone to see he had gotten a text message from an unknown number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown / 1:08 P.M: Hi they're, Squirrelly! It's me, Darline!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick's knees almost gave out as he felt his heart flutter once more, this time more intensely. He leaned himself up against a wall to regain his balance as people walked past him. He quickly entered Darline's number into his list of contacts. How did she get his number? He thought hard on what to text back, finally deciding on a good response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick / 1:12 P.M: Hi to you too, Darline. It's great to hear from you again, but how did you get my number?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick began walking again to his dormitory when his phone vibrated again, showing her response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarline / 1:14 P.M: Well, that's a silly question to ask!<br>\r\nDarline / 1:15 P.M: I work here, which means I get to see all your private information! ;D<br>\r\nDarline / 1:16 P.M: So...I was thinking, do you wanna maybe...hang out sometime? I know we don't know each other that well, but I've been totally obsessed with you since that day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick\u2019s face went warn, his blood rushing underneath his fur in embarrassment. He knew he should have been creeped out that Darline, who was still a total stranger to him at this point, knows stuff that only he and some family members knew, but instead...he felt flattered. Did she go out of her way to learn about little old him? It made him feel wanted. He quickly responded back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick / 1:16 P.M: I mean...sure! Where would you like to meet up?<br>\r\nDarline / 1:16 P.M: Your dormitory. Don't worry about giving me the room number, I'm already there~<br>\r\nDarline / 1:17: Haha, I must sound like a creepy stalker right now, huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squirrel held his phone close to his body and slowed down so the people around him could pass him by as he responded back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick / 1:19: To a normal person, probably. But to be honest...I've been thinking about you a lot, too!<br>\r\nDarline / 1:20: Aw, Patrick! You're sweet~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick felt his heart rush as the hippo complimented him.  He quickly deposited his phone and rushed up into the entrance to his dormitory. It was for boys only, but female staff members were allowed. It took him three more minutes for him to get to his room since it was all the way at the end of the building. He swung the door open, not surprised that the lock had been picked, to reveal the same hippo he had been fantasizing for weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarline had grown from their last encounter, as he had been observing over their brief interactions, but it was only here, in his personal room, that he truly took it in.  She had gotten even pudgier, eighter by eating regular food or eating other students like the wolf. It was most likely the latter. She was in a barely fitting tee shirt with the logo of her favorite Anime emblazoned on it, and a pair of distressed, acid washed jeans so tight that the front button was on the verge of popping off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sitting in the same bed that he had climaxed to her when he came in, and immediately got up to greet him. \"Hi there, Squirrelly...\" She giggled nervously, having planned all this out, yet still scared something could go wrong.  She wrapped the lithe squirrel in a big hug against her belly and bosom, squishing Patrick into the depts of her tummy as the fat folded over him. \"I missed you~\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umph...I missed you too, Darline!\" Patrick wiggled his head upwards to greet the big hippo, once again finding himself entranced by her soft, plush body.  She began to play with his fluffy ears and bushy tail like he was her own pet. The way she was so casual with her domineering size, coupled with her adorable social awkwardness, put a smile on his face as he was pressed even tighter into her body. \"I uh...think you've gotten bigger since last time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That lil' wolfy didn't keep me as sedated as I thought.\" Was all Darline said in response, staring into Patrick's wide and expressive eyes before releasing him from her embrace. In a bit of a daze, he stumbled to the door and shut it closed, so that they could have some privacy.  \"So, now that I'm here...what do you wanna do?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a very good question. Despite having wanted to be with Darline again for the past few weeks, he barely put any thought into what he actually wanted to do with her. his fantasies mainly consisted of him groping and massaging her bulging stomach as he fed her his annoying roommates. And although that is what he wanted, he didn't feel like that was the best way to get to know someone. Thankfully, the answer to his dilemma was literally right in front of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god.\" He mouthed as he finally was able to make out what her shirt had read. It was so warped with tears that it was almost impossible to read, but after turning his head and squinting it was made clear to him. \"You watch Samurai Brawlers?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, Darline began to clam up. \"U-um...well, you see...\" She began to sweat bullets as her anxiety kicked back into high gear. It hadn't even been five minutes and she was blowing it! Why did she have to pick that shirt of all choices?! \"Um...it's my...favorite anime-\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine, too!\" Patrick grinned widely, catching Darline by surprise. \"I thought I was the only one who liked that show, hell, even know about it! It's so off the radar and underrated only a geek like me could-...oh.\" The squirrel wished he could have inhaled the words back into his mouth, regretting them the second they tumbled past his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick was about to apologize profusely for accidentally insulting Darline, but the hippo cut him off by grabbing his shoulders and lifting him up into the air with ease so that their eyes were level. With a smile that threatened to split his face in two, she asked: \"Do you wanna watch the whole first season with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...why stop at just the first?\" Patrick smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the evening was a blur of Anime binging, snack food eating, and personal bonding. Patrick was blown away at how much this campus custodian had in common with him, and her vice versa. They seemed like such polar opposites from afar, but that evening, it felt like the two were made for each other. Soon, however, the last episode of their favorite media drew to a close, and they were reminded of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow! I didn't know I was here that long.\" Darline checked her phone, the time reading out 8:41. Patrick raised his head from its position atop the hippo's stomach, the organ inside churning away at countless liters of soda and potato chips. She looked down to meet his gaze and gave him a big smile. \"Thanks a ton for all the fun, Squirrelly~\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime...\" Patrick buried his head back into the hippo's big tummy one last time before he let go of it completely. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If there was one thing Patrick didn\u2019t really like about the college experience, it was his roommate. He hadn\u2019t been too picky about what sort of roommate he wanted, figuring he could just be open-minded and meet someone new and different. That didn\u2019t turn out well. His roommate turned out to be the kind of guy who was just annoying enough that he made you want to talk with him about much, but not annoying enough for you to do anything about his presence. He was just tolerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were having the most wonderful night of your life, going into in-depth discussions on your favorite animes with someone who seemed to have just as much knowledge as you do. And of course, getting to feel the inside of her maw whenever she let you feed her, and getting to nuzzle and use her belly as a pillow while you watched anime together. Everything just seemed picture perfect\u2026 which was why you froze up when you heard your roommate walking down the hall. You knew tonight was too good to be true!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately jumped up, knocking a bag of chips over and alarming the once relaxed, placid hippo. \u201cDarline! You\u2019ve got to hide!\u201d You frantically whisper. Not knowing what this was all about, she still seemed to react, lifting up her big, heavy, heaving body as fast she could. Before she knew it, you were pressing your hands against her rump, pushing her towards the bathroom! \u201cHide, hide, hide, hide\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to slip her into the bathroom and close the door just moments before your roommate finally walked in! Todd\u2026 that shark guy, with more brawns than brain. He was clambering back into the room, looking bored\u2026 only for his expression to change to something unreadable as he looked over the room. He would immediately see you staring at him like a deer in headlights\u2026 along with an uncountable amounts of empty bags of chips and soda strewn over the floor\u2026 with some dumb anime playing on the screen, featuring some fox girl with huge, goofy breasts battling samurai!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, he had to cover his mouth to muffle his laughing, as he just about barrels over! Your heart was still racing, but your fear quickly turned to frustration as he laughed at you right to your face. \u201cDude\u2026 what are you doin\u2019, man? Having a bit of a movie night?\u201d Todd laughed, chips crumpling beneath his feet as he trotted into the room, looking at you like you were pathetic. \u201cJeez, how many bags of chips can one man eat\u2026!? You\u2019re gonna be a fatty in no time at this rate, man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Todd\u2026\u201d You glared at him, before going and sitting on your bed, not even wanting to deal with him right now. However, instead of giving you your space, he plopped down on the bed beside you, wrapping a muscular arm around your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what\u2019s this yer watchin\u2019? Some of that japanese stuff?\u201d He raised a brow, only to laugh when he saw the sheer jiggle physics on offer in the show. \u201cDude, this is just some weird porn stuff! Get a real girlfriend, man!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not porn, it\u2019s\u2026\u201d You sigh, deciding that wouldn\u2019t be the best hill to die on. \u201cListen, I was just trying to wind down after some hard classes, alright, man? Give me a break.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy sit around watching anime all night when you could\u2019ve been at Leonard\u2019s party, dude! Leshawna ate, like, three dudes at the same time! It was awesome!\u201d He laughed. Okay, he had a point there. You definitely wouldn\u2019t liked to have seen that. Still, though, he stood up. \u201cWell, whatever, bro. Sorry if I \u2018hurt your feelings\u2019 or whatever! I was just messin\u2019 around! No need to be a baby about it.\u201d With that, he started to walk towards the bathroom. Your heart skipped a beat, knowing Darline was in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d You raised a hand, stopping him in his tracks. Todd turned to you, incredulous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 I\u2019m just going to brush my teeth, man,\u201d he raised a brow. \u201cWhat\u2019s going you all worked up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 welll\u2026 umm\u2026\u201d You wrung your hands nervously, trying to come up with an answer. \u201cThe\u2026 the toilet is broken\u2026 and like\u2026 the repair guys said it was extremely dangerous in there\u2026 you could drown if you walk into that bathroom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed, not believing you for a moment. \u201cDrown? What the hell do you mean? You expect me to go sticking my head in the toilet bowl or something just cause I\u2019m a shark?\u201d As he argued with you, behind him, you notice the door start to open up behind him, slowly and inaudibly. Before he could say anymore, he was suddenly interrupted by someone tapping on his shoulder behind him. His voice cut off as he turned around to the bathroom\u2026 only to see an absolutely huge hippo woman standing over him, licking her lips!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she knew nobody was around to witness this aside from you, she felt free to just lift him up by his sides, giving him the most hungry grin you\u2019ve ever seen as he wriggles futilely in her grip. Before he could say a word, her huge tongue lulled out and licked over his face, covering him in that warm, meaty saliva! \u201cHehe! My, my\u2026 I knew you were a gentleman, Patrick, but I didn\u2019t expect you to bring me such a tasty treat~!\u201d She smiled, mostly just to tease him rather than actually talking to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell-!?\u201d He stuttered, trying his best to wriggle away as he started to strip his clothes off, licking him all over with that long, slick tongue as she savored his flavor. He turned to you, knowing you were his only hope. \u201cP-Patrick! You gotta help me\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPatrick\u2019s not gonna help you\u2026\u201d She smiled, grabbing him by the top of his head to turn his face until he was looking her in the eyes. \u201cRemember how you said he should get a girlfriend? Well, guess what? He has a girlfriend already\u2026 and guess who?\u201d His eyes widened as he was filled with horror at the realization of what was happening! Before he could let out another cry, that huge maw slid open\u2026 and those jaws came slamming down on his upper body, just like that wolf from before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naked shark guy could only kick his legs as his entire upper body was thoroughly massaged by her tongue, as she suckled idly on him as if trying to suck out every last bit of his flavor. You were, of course, in utter awe at this\u2026 and soon felt that same, uncomfortable tightness in your pants. You didn\u2019t have to deal with that this time, though, as you were alone\u2026 so, to relieve some of that tightness, you work the courage to slide your pants and underwear, letting you rigid cock flop free as you watched this display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the time to tease you some this time, doing a little belly dance for you as the shark\u2019s legs dangled from her maw. She opened her maw every once in a while just for a second, to give you the slightest glimpse of what it was like in there before she sealed it shut once again. She fell to her knees, clutching her belly\u2026 as she leaned her head back, and finally began to swallow! You shiver with arousal, you had to fight the urge to jerk off as his kicking legs started to disappear down her lips, a bulge growing in her throat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it, his legs had disappeared\u2026 and the bulge in her throat had disappeared, too. She let out a long, blissful sligh as he finally settled inside of her huge stomach, her new little prisoner inside her gut. Her belly was already so fat, his bulges could barely be seen - you could only see them if you knew what you were looking for. Your cock grew even harder somehow as you stared wide-eyed at her huge gut, unable to help yourself as you can see him get locked away inside her big jail cell of a gurgling tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhh~ Ugh, let's give this tummy some room, huh?\u201d You were hit by another shiver as she easily slid her shirt off, leaving her topless besides her bra, finally showing off that huge tummy in all its glory! She giggled as she strut forward, plopping herself down back on the bed beside you with a huge, triumphant belch! With that settled, she wrapped an arm around your soldier, and snuggled you against her belly. \u201cThanks for that meal, Patrick! He definitely soothed my appetite~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in awe, shivering as your head was leaned against that huge gut! \u201cI-I didn\u2019t expect for you to eat him! I just wanted you to hide!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused\u2026 before shrugging. \u201cOh well. All\u2019s well that ends well, I suppose!\u201d She shrugged, before grabbing the remote and hitting \u2018play\u2019, continuing your anime marathon like nothing ever happened, just sort of idly rubbing her huge belly as your roommate squirmed inside for his very life. You shiver imagining just how gross it must be to be imprisoned in there, what with all the soda and chips she\u2019d already eaten. Still, you couldn\u2019t help but wonder\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Darline\u2026?\u201d You stutter. \u201cWhen you mentioned\u2026 that girlfriend thing, did you mean\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over, staring at you.</span></div></div>",

She grabbed her squirrel\u2019s shoulders and moved his body further up the bed, getting his body in position so that she may roll on top of him. He let out a faint gasp as his whole body was suddenly enveloped by her, just like the first time he had met her. \u201cPatrick...of course, I meant it.\u201d The fat hippo leaned in and gave him a kiss on the forehead, warming his cheeks to a rosy tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can feel it, you know.\u201d Darline blew a gust of warning air into one of Patrick\u2019s ears, making him squirm. \u201cIt\u2019s so tiny and small, just like you...I don\u2019t think anyone has ever had a hard on me before. I\u2019ve always just been the dumpy little hippo everyone gets to pick on. I thought that when I got my \u2018awakening\u2019 thing would get better. But it turns out, I needed someone like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPatrick\u2026\u201d Darline continued, wrapping her pudgy arms around her squirrel's frame. \u201cYou...you\u2019re the first person who\u2019s made me feel beautiful, like someone wants me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s true.\u201d Patrick spoke up, taking Darline by surprise by planting a kiss on her lips. She widened her eyes but relaxed as she leaned into it, his little, tiny tongue swishing around her slobbery maw. He pulled back. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing, Darline. I don\u2019t know why no one has ever told you that before. I want you, so badly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Darline purred seductively as she wiggled her expansive boobs on top of his face, smothering him. \u201cI\u2019m so much women to handle...and you\u2019re not helping by feeding me such delicious treats.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt...that was an accident, with Todd.\u201d he responded, though he voice was muffled under layers of boob flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe it was. But you didn\u2019t help him, did you?\u201d Darline gave Patrick\u2019s smothered face a big lick in between her cleavage, lubing the flesh and making it shine. \u201cYou didn't help when I ate that wolf boy, either. You love to see me eat, to get bigger, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-y-yeeeeesssss.\u201d Patrick moaned as his dick hardened at Darline\u2019s words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re going to help me get even bigger.\u201d Darline rubbed her belly around the hardening cock of her new boyfriend...her first boyfriend. \u201cYou are going to get me more boys like that shark roommate, whatever his name was. You\u2019re going to lead them back here, where I\u2019ll eat them and grow bigger for you, more for you to love and cuddle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Darline!\u201d Patrick gasped. He was so close. He needed relief, but there was so much pure flesh in the way it was impossible for him to get it. \u201cHelp...me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, Squirreley~\u201d The massive hippo got off the bed, but before Patrick could reach for it, she bent down and deposited the throbbing organ into her mouth. It was so slimy and soft, it was the same maw that had doomed his roommate just moments ago. He let out a scream as he came into her maw, his new girlfriend guzzling down his seed like it was a milkshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm...tasty.\u201d Darline smacked her lips as she finished the job. \u201cAww, my little Patrick is all tuckered out. Don\u2019t worry, Squirreley, I got ya\u201d. With that, the great hippo flopped back down on top of Patrick\u2019s body, having gone limp from the stimulation of pleasure. He held his goofy grin all the way until he finally succumbed to sleep, his lover\u2019s body cushioning him and providing him warmth...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That feeling of warmth and closeness followed him through the whole night, and he definitely ended up having some\u2026 interesting dreams. When he woke up, though, she found that his lover was gone. Probably smart. Getting caught dating a student would get her in trouble just as fast as eating one. Trying not let his thoughts of last night distract him, Patrick rolled out of bed and lazily shuffled over the bathroom, taking a quick shower and brushing his teeth, thinking about how much nicer his room was now that his roommate was\u2026 ahem\u2026 absent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis college career was off to an interest start, to say the least. He had apparently met his first girlfriend, and, well\u2026 she\u2019s his soulmate, in the most macabre of ways. He noticed that, during his first week, he was often getting distracted from classes and schoolwork, his mind always wandering to kinkier places. He didn\u2019t know if it would be the best idea to let this hippo dominate his mind like this! Speak of the devil, though, the moment he stepped out of the bathroom, he got some texts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarline / 9:23 A.M: hey babe! \u2764\ufe0f i had a TON of fun last night!<br>\r\nDarline / 9:23 A.M: ur lil roommate has been settling in nicely~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused, blinking, at the image she sent him along with those messages. It was an image of her huge belly, now soft and round, looking even bigger and fatter than it did before now that your would-be roommate has been completely gurgled away. He clenched his eyes shut with a sigh, already feeling a tightness arising in his pants. He didn\u2019t want to deal with this already in the morning! Just looking at that pic makes him shiver\u2026 and then, another thought occurs to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick / 9:26 A.M: Darline you can\u2019t send me pics like that!<br>\r\nPatrick / 9:26 A.M: What if somebody finds this convo somehow?<br>\r\nDarline / 9:26 A.M: lol<br>\r\nDarline / 9:26 A.M: u just don\u2019t want to admit the sight of my tummy drives u wild~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe huffs. Indeed, that image alone was enough to apparently make his heart race in his chest when he looked at it, his dick hardening in his boxers as he fantasized about being there, feeling that perfect belly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick / 9:28 A.M: Fair point\u2026<br>\r\nDarline / 9:29 A.M: anyway u don\u2019t have anywhere to be today right?<br>\r\nDarline / 9:29 A.M: why not take a break from that campus and hang with me this weekend?<br>\r\nDarline / 9:30 A.M: we can do whatever we want without having to worry about getting in trouble \ud83d\ude1c<br>\r\nDarline / 9:30 A.M: i\u2019ll pick u up<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pauses, thinking this through. Really, she was calling herself his girlfriend, but\u2026 she was still a predator. Once he was off campus, really, what was stopping her from just\u2026 devouring him? He loved the sight of her belly, but with her hygiene, he doubted it was very pleasant on the inside, and he really didn\u2019t want his college life to end after the first week. As he was contemplating this, though, he looked at the screen to realize he had already typed a yes! Apparently, his body moved on its own, compelled by true love\u2026 or at least, arousal\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d normally spend her saturdays at home, but when Patrick said yes to her offer, she drove all the way to campus just to pick him up. He saw her driving one of those huge cars designed for people of her immense size, which still seemed to creak under her weight as she climbed out, wearing a black hoodie and jeans as she smiled at him. Before he knew it, she had her arms wrapped around him, squeezing the air out of him as she lifted him off of his feet into one of her signature bear hugs! \u201cAaaaa! Hey, baby! I missed you\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually set you down before you could pass out from her squeezing. You composed yourself as you looked up at her, seeing that that massive gut of hers even poked out between her hoodie somewhat. Great. \u201cI would\u2019ve stayed with you all night, but I couldn\u2019t spend the night in a student\u2019s dorm! Just too risky,\u201d she shrugged, before wrapping an arm around your shoulder, leading you back towards her car. \u201cDon\u2019t have to worry about that this weekend. We are going to be inseparable! Don\u2019t hafta worry about a single thing\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, wait, wait,\u201d you paused, overwhelmed by just how fast this was all going, as you were shepherd into her massive car. \u201cWhere are we going, anyway?\"</span></div></div>",

It was a little chilly on campus that morning, but the beach would probably be scorching!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarline, however, just rolled her eyes and started up her car. \u201cWell, if your feeling overdressed, you can always go nude.\u201d She put a band up to her mouth to stifle a laugh as she noticed his bugged out expression. \u201cWhat? Zinnia City has some pretty lax laws about clothing, you know. Besides, haven\u2019t you ever been to a nude beach?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...i've never been to beach at all.\u201d Patrick relented, shifting uncomfortably in his too big seat. \u201cI grew up inland, the biggest body of water I\u2019ve ever saw is that one crappy lake my dad took me fishing at.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou poor thing~\u201d Darline affectionately fondled Patrick\u2019s bushy tail, making him blush. \u201cWell, now I just have to take you. You haven\u2019t lived until you stick your feet out in the cool embrace of the sea.\u201d. The drive to the Zinnia City Coast was spent pouring over knowledge each other had about obscure anime and video games. They had an intense debate over which episode of Samurai Brawlers was the best. Darline said it was the season five finale, while Patrick said it was the origin special. They got so wrapped up in it that they almost missed the turn into the Beach parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis conversation is not over, Squirrelly.\u201d Darline smirked as she shut her car off. \u201cBut we can talk anime later, for now, look out the window.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick unbuckled himself from his seat and stood up to get a good view out of the high window. They're, beyond a thin strand of white sand and a couple of volleyball courts, was the ocean. To Darline, it was an everyday sight, to him it was a gigantic jewel that sparkles in the sun. \u201cWoah\u2026\u201d the squirrel breathed out, tears welling up a tad in his ducts. \u201cIt\u2019s...beautiful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm, yeah, I guess.\u201d Darline chuckled, getting out of the car to circle around to Patrick\u2019s side, quickly taking off her hooded and jeans. \u201cAlthough, I think I can do you a view better~\u201d Suddenly, the squirrel\u2019s eyesight was engulfed by the now almost nude Hippo. With her overlay clothes discarded on the asphalt, all that was left was a bra and a bikini bottom, leaving the rest of her gloriously fat, curvy body open to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick grunted as his member pressed tightly against his boxers. While the ocean was certainly a very pretty sight, it was Darline that got the bigger reaction. He opened the door, immediately assaulted by the sun\u2019s blistering heat. \u201cWooh! I didn\u2019t know it would be this hot\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know how to solve that.\u201d Darline smiled, quickly grabbing Patrick\u2019s sweater and lifting it over his head before he can react. He sputtered, grasping at the garment now hovering just above his reach as the Hippo held it out. \u201cOh relax, look around! You might be the most overdressed at the beach!\u201d She gestured to the other people in the parking lot walking by to the sand, most of them naked. The squirrel turned his head away as he saw predators that made his pitiful erection  look like a toothpick. Defeated, he reluctantly took off the rest of his clothes, letting his member flop out into the open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello they're, lil\u2019 guy.\u201d Darline greeted Patrick\u2019s erection with a wave, making the squirrel turn as red as a tomato. The hot asphalt scorched his paws as he kept hopping on one to the other to alleviate the pain. Darline, with her padded feat, was barely affected, but noticed her boyfriend\u2019s plight. \u201cOh, let me help you with that.\u201d She carefully lifted him into the air and cuddled him up to her bosom, as if he was a baby. With that, she began walking towards the sand, while Patrick\u2019s tried his best not to get harder as his firm made contact with her plush boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beach wasn't too crowded, just some other couples like Patrick and Darline enjoying their time together...some of them more than others, as the squirrel observed a husky and a fox do it without any shame and in open public. Things sure were different in Zinnia City. \u201cSo...\u201d Patrick asked as Darline set him down into the warm sand, tickling his paws. \u201cWhat\u2019s the first item on our agenda?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The huge hippo got ready for a nice day at the beach, laying out an absolutely HUGE towel on the hot sands, with an umbrella prepared next to it and a basket of nice snacks for them to munch on. She donned a pair of sunglasses as she relaxed on the beautiful beach, shoveling some snacks into her huge maw while Patrick covered his skin with special sunscreen. After that, Patrick just wanted to go leap right into the ocean! He had never swam in such a huge body of water before~! Before he could, though, he was stopped in his tracks by Darline\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d She complained, interrupting him. He turned back, confused, only to see her lowering her sunglasses at him, giving him an incredulous look. \u201cYou weren\u2019t just about to let your girlfriend waltz right out into the ocean without any sunscreen, were ya? On a sunny day like today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 hippos don\u2019t need sunscreen, do they\u2026?\u201d Patrick tilted his head, confused. Aren\u2019t hippos evolved to wade around in the water all day? He was pretty sure hippo\u2019s sweat acts as a natural sunscreen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Darline didn\u2019t seem impressed. \u201cStop overthinking everything, hun,\u201d she said, flopping onto her back with a tail and wagging him over with a finger, showing off that huge, round, soft, squishy fat tummy of her\u2019s! \u201cJust get over here and rub me down, will ya?\u201d His cheeks flare red once he quickly realizes just what she was really trying to do, gazing down at that smug grin of her\u2019s\u2026!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-C\u2019mon, Darline\u2026!\u201d Patrick tensed up, twisting his legs a bit as he could feel his erection grow even harder under the burning sun as he stared at that huge, perfect gut, shivering at the feeling of being so exposed in public.  \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of the beach\u2026 and I\u2019m already hard enough as it is\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot as hard as that guy!\u201d Darline laughed, pointing over to that husky guy down the beach who was still apparently banging his girlfriend. Well, he had to concede the point. Before he could say another word, though, she suddenly grabbed him and hugged him tight, and he shuddered as he felt that cock press against that squishy gut! \u201cHehe! Relax, hun! People come to the beach to have fun! Nobody cares if yer giving yer girlfriend a belly rub~\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe takes a deep breath when she finally lets him go, trying to calm himself down as he looked at that fat, perfect, glorping gut. \u201cAlright\u2026\u201d Taking a moment to compose himself, he finally covers his hands in sunscreen, and hesitates before pressing those palms against that soft gut, already feeling a little light-headed from it all. As she let out little sights of relaxation, he starts to knead and rub along that distended flesh, lathering the lotion thoroughly across that heaving gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026 baby, were you a masseur before or something?\u201d She let's out a moan at how well he\u2019s able to massage the sheer softness of her tum. \u201cGod, you work my tummy good~\u201d Her moans and compliments only make him even more red, and yet, he continued, kneading his thumbs down into the squishy soft pudge along her tum until he can feel the firmness just beneath. How could he be so turned on by somebody\u2019s gut\u2026? Maybe it\u2019s the sheer size\u2026 and the softness\u2026 and the knowing how many people she\u2019s imprisoned within\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, now, hun. I know my gut\u2019s worth protecting, but don\u2019t go wasting all the sunscreen. You\u2019ve still got the other side!\u201d Before he could react, her huge, heaving body had flipped over, revealing his soft back\u2026 and that absolutely huge, fat ass! He flustered red at the sight, of course, but seeing that sly look on her face, he was determined not to let her get to him! With a look of determination, he sat on her huge back and went to work kneading the most sensitive spots, listening to her gasp and shiver in delight as his thumbs massaged the small of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he moved to her rump\u2026 but resolved not to let her get him too worked up, as perfect as that huge ass is. He could handle this. At least, until she started to slip her bikini bottoms off\u2026! \u201cHere, let me get this out of the way\u2026!\u201d Sure enough, he could feel his cock jump straight up again, his face flowing red as he was suddenly presented with that huge, pudgy rump! His lip quivering, he felt like he had no choice but to start rubbing and kneading those huge, soft, squishy cheeks, his mind filling with fantasies of burying his cock between those cheeks\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as he was doing that, Darline only came up with more mischief...</span></div></div>",

She could feel the little Squirrel\u2019s cock brush up against her plump cheeks as he went with his work. It was so easy to get him worked up! She almost felt bad, had it not been for her how fun teasing him was. She had the perfect idea of how to help her boyfriend's plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick\u2019s worldview was suddenly thrown into disarray as Darline shifted her body, sending him tumbling off onto her side at the towel. \u201cH-hey!\u201d He protested with a bit of a huff. \u201cI wasn't...d-done yet...:\u201d He blushed in defeat. The fat hippo merely gave him a content smile and got off from her comfortable position on the towel. She grabbed the squirrel\u2019s shoulders and move him to the center of the towel...right, where there was an ass shaped indent in the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold still.\u201d Was all she said before she turned around, giving her little squirlley one last good look at the world before she let herself fall backward, her plush and plump butt smothering his pelvis. Patrick let out a scream of pain and pleasure, mostly the latter, as he felt the full weight of the hippo come crashing down on him, his voice muffled by her back flab. \u201cAhhh...I thought you would like that, squirlley~\u201d She smiled and bounced a little on his crotch, making his throbbing erection bob in between two big boulders of pure flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick tried to protest his predicament as Darline began to lay back further, trapping him underneath her, but his whole body was enveloped in flab, and his voice could not carry to her ears. Despite what his mouth wanted to say, the experience was far from undesirable. It felt heavenly, actually, to be totally at the mercy of such a big, hulking predator with a vice grip on his dick, knowing full well it was all in good fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick smiled underneath as he began to pump his hips as much as he could into Darline\u2019s perfect rear end. The hippo smiled in return as he felt her squirrel get out some well-needed tension. She had never had someone hot dog her before...and it wasn't too bad a thing to happen. She remembered to get up very often, just a little so her prisoner had a chance to breathe, before flopping back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Patrick had found his climax as the already lubed flesh of Darline\u2019s ass cheeks were covered in milky essence. Her squirlley satisfied, she rolled over to observe a very happy and very goofy looking prey, his cock still shooting the occasional stream. He looked up at her and lazily cuddled up to her perfect tummy, breathing a sigh of contentment. \u201cI love you, Darline.\u201d No one had ever made him feel the way the hippo offered, made him feel so good before. Perhaps he was rushing things with their relationship, but he was tired of going slow. \u201cI love soooo much\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarline\u2019s heart swelled as she scooped up her Patrick, planting a barrage of kisses on his smiling face. \u201cI love you too, my lil\u2019 squirlley!\u201d She finished her assault with a big, slobbery finale on his lips, leaving him dazed and in lack of air. \u201cLet\u2019s get cleaned off in the water, you made quite the mess~\u201d She carried him away towards the ocean, his throbbing cock finally dying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water was incredibly cold, which was confusing to Patrick as the day was so unbearably hot. Darline had set him down waists deep into the water, making his member shrivel up, but also cleansing it of any cum that remained. Darline sat her big rear end down to was herself as well, enjoying the cool sensation tickle her body. \u201cHehe, cold?\u201d She asked as Patrick shivered from the water\u2019s cold embrace. \u201cHere, let me warn you up.\u201d She wrapped her pudgy arms around him in a hug, providing a nice balance between warm and cold for the little prey. He sighed, wondering how this day can get any better. His answer came to him in the form of her girlfriend's stomach let out a loud gurgle of hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops! I knew I shouldn't have skimped out on breakfast.\u201d Darline giggled, scanning the horizon to see if she can find a quick meal. Outside the campus, she could be as voracious as she wanted, and she was eager to show off her true gluttony to Patrick. She spied a couple playing around in the water not too far away, a horse and a cheetah. Perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStay right here,\u201d Darline winked before letting go of her hold on Patrick. \u201cAnd keep your eyes on those two, over there.\u201d She waded out into deeper waters and suddenly plunged underneath the waves, leaving before the squirrel could ask what was going on. Confused, he obeyed and began to stare at the couple. Than the Jaws theme began to play in his head as he noticed a familiar outline began to circle them in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a spectacular display of gluttony and grace, Darline erupted from the waves headfirst underneath the unsuspecting couple, grabbing both of their legs into her wide maw. She did a sort of backflip in the air and descended back into the waters, dragging the poor cheetah and horse along with her as droplets of water rained down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...woah\u2026\u201d Patrick uttered as he witnessed the scene unfold. \u201cThat was...that was incredible!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, you really thought so?\u201d Patrick spun around to face the hippo, surprised that she had made it back to his spot so fast, and blown an away by how big her gut was! Evan with two people inside, it barely moves, only some slight quiverings to indicate what was going on underneath all that perfect fat. \u201cI thought a little grandeur was in order, it wasn't too showy, was it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no!\u201d Patrick smiled. \u201cNot at all, it was like a water show! And I can\u2019t believe you managed to eat two people in one go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaww, Squirlley!...you know, ever since I met you, it's been getting harder and harder to fill this gut of mine up...\" She traced her fat fingers around her wrecking ball of a stomach, feeling the squirms of her prey within.\"Ever since I found someone to love me, pudge and all...I've just been non-stop! That wasn't even the first time I ate two people, it was just the first time you got to see me do it!\" She waded her way towards Patrick and bent down so that their eyes were level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm gonna keep eating, just for you my little squirlley.\" She guided Patrick's right paw towards her chest, right on top of her heart. \"I'm gonna keep eating and eating, grow bigger and bigger, all for you. They'll be so much for you to play with, so much for you to love!\" Patrick was both creeped out and enamored by how possessive Darline was being, how passionate she was for their relationship. It's as if he had unleashed some sort of monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-are you sure you don't wanna stop?\" Patrick piped up, his voice going dry and horse. \"Everyone has limits, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Patrick,\" Darline smirked. \"Do you have a limit to how much you want to see me grow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick was surprised by his not having an answer for Darline's question. Did he have a limit? He tried to picture the hippo at bigger and bigger sizes, and each time he did, his cock twitched in arousal. A bead of nervous sweat ran down his head. This was...slightly concerning information for him.</span></div></div>",

It seemed that the lifeguard at the beach had spotted Darline swallow that couple! You were terrified, certain you\u2019d face seriously consequences for this\u2026 meanwhile, Darline just grimaced and turned to the source of the sound, ready to devour whoever was trying to ruin her little date with her new soulmate! However, she seemed to calm down immensely as the massive figure trotted slowly up to them\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat were you thinking? That backflip was way too kickass for this beach!\u201d You were in awe at the figure standing before the two of you, her footsteps shaking the very earth as she walked! She was probably a few feet higher than even Darline, and so fat that her belly looked like it could probably fit the hippo inside it with some effort. Her red lifeguard one-piece swimsuit was barely straining over her massive form. You\u2019ve lived a sheltered life, admittedly, but it was rare that you\u2019ve seen somebody of THIS size! \u201cI\u2019ll have you know that we here at Zinnia Beach have strict limits on the level of coolness we allow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Darline only laughed, giving the larger shark a playful light punch to the shoulder. \u201cJeez, Barb! You really scared us! I thought I was about to have to swallow up some scrawny lifeguard,\u201d the hippo laughed, before turning to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you already have a little snack right here!\u201d The huge shark looked down at you, licking her lips as you were frozen in her massive shadow, mesmerized by her round pear figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarline suddenly wrapped her huge, chubby, powerful hands around your side, holding you up with your back against her similarly huge tummy. \u201cLittle snack? Well, sure\u2026 but he\u2019s MY little snack!\u201d She giggles, giving you a lap along your forehead playfully. \u201cBarb, meet Patrick, my lil loverboy~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shark girl\u2019s eyes widened a bit with the realization! \u201cOh! Your boyfriend\u2026? See, I told you! Guys love girls with huge guts, they\u2019re just too scared to admit it!\u201d Instead of that hungry look from earlier, the shark now looked at you with a warm expression, like you were a friend. \u201cI knew you\u2019d find a boy who\u2019d give that tummy the love it deserves~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet he does!\u201d Darline gives you a smug look as she pats her gut. Meanwhile, through all of this, you were just a blushy, sheepish mess. Especially staring at that gut, and noticing the faint movement through that soft fat! How many people does she have packed inside, and why-!? \u201cPatrick, meet Barb! An old friend. Me and her went to highschool together, you know!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, lil buddy! Nice to meetchya! I\u2019m the lifeguard \u2018round here! Although, really, I mostly just protect the beach. Everybody has to follow the rules, or face my own sorta justice~\u201d She smiled, leaning back and patting her huge, bulging belly, the bulges of faces and hands appearing from within. \u201cI\u2019ve even got about six troublemakers right here~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gawked down at it, your eyes wide, your breath catching in your chest. Your hardon was, against, throbbing and in full view, and you almost didn\u2019t think you could handle both of these massive women. Still, you needed to know. \u201cW-what did they do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I mean\u2026 not exactly. It\u2019s very rare that any actual rulemakers come to the beach, and I get bored and hungry a lot, so\u2026 pretty much, I just eat whoever looks tasty.\u201d She giggles mischievously! \u201cIf my boss asks, I can just tell him they were littering or drinking, though!\u201d She smiles with the expression of a girl who truly loves her job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSix people\u2026 just imagine if I could fit six people in here, baby! Or ten, or fifteen, or twenty\u2026 mmm\u2026\u201d She smiled, licking her lips, her eyes glazing over with gluttony as she imagined packing some insane amount of people into her belly all at once, gurgling countless people into another huge layer of soft pudge. Your heart was beating out of your chest at this point. What sort of monster were you unleashing? If she ever reached THAT point, she\u2019d have gone way overboard, and would definitely be forced to stop or become an outlaw. Besides, all the lives that would be lost\u2026 but then again, imagining her with a packed gut bigger than a building\u2026 urgh! Shut up, boner!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh! Look at the little guy! What\u2019s the matter, Pat, can\u2019t handle two gurglin\u2019 bellies at once\u2026?\u201d The shark smiled down at you, causing you to shiver.

She must have been the biggest girl he had ever seen! She almost wanted to tease him about her other, even bigger friends...but she assumed that all his blood would flow down to his boner and cause him to faint, so she kept her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she turned her attention back to Darline, whose eyes were still glazed over in a haze of gluttony, imagining herself being big enough to take on tens of prey at once. \"Wow, Darline, I don't think I've ever seen you so excited about eating before!\" The Shark exclaimed, taking a step closer to snap the Hippo our of her trance, and to purposefully smoosh Patrick into her own tummy, making him blush like mad. \"It's like you're a whole new person now, what gives?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarline blinked a few times to get back to reality before answering Barb's question. \"Well...before, I never really had much of a reason to. It's always a treat to sneak some student down when no one's looking, but...meeting Patrick has been sort of my second awakening.\" She reached Down in between the two great bellies to give her squirrelly a fondle on the ears. \"He loves me, pudge and all. And I wanna give back to him by being the biggest I can be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarb was a bit shocked by how Darline's demeanor had changed as of late. Before, she was a bit shy and awkward, only ever feeling comfortable around her group of friends from high school. Now, she seemed more confident of herself, more relaxed, and possibly even happy! \"Well...if you're serious about this, now, I still have that holiday bonus from a few months back. How about we ditch this place and go treat ourselves somewhere special...like Orlando's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...get out.\" Darline gasped, not believing the words coming out of her friend's mouth. \"Barb, that place is way too expensive! I love you, but I can't let you take the bill for that! Besides, don't you still have to work here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarb gave out a smirk and patted her tummy, the prey inside slowly giving out fewer and fewer squirms. \"Eh, nobody ever gets hurt at the beach, they just have me here to make people feel safe. Besides, if anyone ever did cause some major trouble, they know it's only a matter of time before their Shark food.\" Darline smiled and wrapped her pudgy arms as much as she could around the larger predator. \"Aw, don't go thanking me just yet! We still got a Hippo gut that needs to be filled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting back on their clothes, the hippo's now much tighter on her body, Barb, Darline, and Patrick made their way across the sand towards Downtown where Orlando's was located. The main hub of Zinnia City wasn't too far away from the beach, so they decided to leg it to work up an appetite. The squirrel had to have the situation explained as he couldn't hear the tan earlier, the fat of their bellies muffled out the sound. After hearing a description of what the alleged restaurant was like, he was naturally...concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Darline?\" Patrick stuttered as he tried to keep pace with the two, bigger women walking down the concrete. \"You know I'm all for you getting bigger in all the right places, but...don't you think you might be going a bit...overboard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Overboard?!\" Darline waved off Patrick's concerns with a roll of her eyes. \"Squirrelly, Orlando's may be expensive, but eating there doesn't make me some sort of crazed monster. It means I'm a glutton, sure, but not delirious. I thought you loved it when you see me eat.\" She faux huffed, throwing her arms around her expansive bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I do! I really do, don't get me wrong!\" Patrick defended himself, slightly surprised at the words coming from his own mouth. It was true, he really did love it when he saw Darline eat that random wolf, and Todd, and that unsuspecting couple in the water...but that didn't mean she wasn't killing people! \"It's just that...how many do you have to eat to call yourself one, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think what your little snack is trying to say is that he's scared you're gonna lose yourself.\" Barb hanged back to wrap an arm around Darline's shoulder. She turned back to the little squirrel and gave out a reassuring smile. \"Don't worry, kiddo. No one here is eating whole stadiums in broad daylight, we know how to police ourselves. They wouldn't be any cute little squirrels left if we didn't have some restraint!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baaarb!\" Darline playfully pushed the Shark away, hip checking a lamp post in the process. \"Don't scare him like that, no one's gonna gobble him up! Not if I have anything to say about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick felt a bit better that there were laws that kept predators from going all out ballistic, and having Darline as a shield against other would be preds wasn't too bad a though either. He just hoped he would be able to handle the hippo if she wanted to get so big in the future, he could barely handle her now! Soon, the three came across Orlando's after a few more minutes of searching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the outside of the hole in the wall joint, the place looked rather inviting and pleasant. Five, golden stars were laid across the thick stones that made up the facade, signaling it's quality and good reviews. It was tough to see through the darkened windows, but everyone sounded happy and well entertained from the outside. Wasting no more time as they're former prey and long digested, the two predators walked in boldly while Patrick followed behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they entered the famous restaurant, they were welcomed with a barrage of amazing and exotic scents. Food from all over the world was served here, in great quantity as well. One of the waiters, working up a sweat from the work but still very polite, came up to the podium to sit them down. The place was packed with people of all shapes and sizes, though most of them were far larger than what Patrick was used to. Predators seemed to be the primary clientele, as shown by the sight of prey willingly hopping down the patron's throats. Patrick, Darline, and Barb took a booth at the far back where they could have some privacy to themselves, as it was the least congested part of the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the waiter from before comes to take their order. Barb and Darline...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The waiter was a rather petite and cheerful cheetah girl - you figure, working in a place that caters to predators, she would indeed go above and beyond to try and keep customers satisfied. \u201cWelcome to Orlando\u2019s! My name is Jessica. Anything on the menu caught your eye~?\u201d She smiles, seeming completely unafraid even as the two huge, pudgy predators look down on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, wow, didn\u2019t know they had such yummy-lookin\u2019 waitresses here,\u201d Barb gave a big, toothy grin, licking her lips as she leaned down to eye-level with the cheetah woman, her warm, meaty breath washing over her. \u201cYou don\u2019t happen to be on the menu, do ya, sweetheart?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Jessica seemed unafraid, simply giggling in response before looking down at the little menu thing she was holding. \u201cHehe! I\u2019m afraid not. But for predators, we do have a nice special today! One very rare and extremely tasty albino deer!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm. Tempting, but I think \u201cI\u2019ll just have one of the standard prey, please,\u201d Darline nodded, seeming eager to eat again! By now, both of the women\u2019s big, powerful bellies had already digested their multiple \u2018prisoners\u2019 down into chyme, and they now ahd room for more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll have two!\u201d Barb smiled. But Darline gave her a funny look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, change my order, please,\u201d Darline corrected, raising a finger. \u201cI\u2019d like three.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarb paused, blinking\u2026 before giggling. \u201cOh, change my order too, then! I want four!\u201d Your heart seizes up as you realize they were about to turn this into a macabre competition!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFive!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick grabs Darline\u2019s arm, trying to interrupt this little competition of their\u2019s before it could get out of hand. \u201cD-Darline, what are you doing\u2026?\u201d Patrick says, his voice as anxious as it was tempted. \u201cYou can\u2019t fit\u2026 five prey in there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t know what your limits are until you push them, right? Besides, I can take some to go, can\u2019t I?\u201d Darline giggled, squeezing a hand into her plump gut and showing just how thick the layers of pudge went.  \u201cSeein\u2019 that yummy, adorable little hard-on of your\u2019s earlier just really worked up my appetite. I\u2019ll be sure to give it another good taste once we get home~\u201d Her flirting definitely shut him up! Patrick weren\u2019t able to really make any arguments anymore, too busy curling his legs to hide his returning erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarb only giggled! \u201cHehe! C\u2019mon, Darline, you\u2019re gonna tease the poor boy to death!\u201d She laughed, patting him on the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the waitress disappeared for a while. As he looked over the menu, Patrick realized that the \u2018standard prey\u2019 options were things like mice and rats and bunnies - probably the most common and overpopulated preys in Zinnia. Meanwhile, \u2018premium prey\u2019 were things like deer, canines, and\u2026 of course, squirrels. Before he could contemplate this too much, Jessica somehow wheeled out a massive cart that boasted two huge trays! \u201cHere you are, Madames. Your first round of prey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women licked their lips as they happily lifted those massive trees onto their huge table, and Patrick gazed curiously as Darline lifted the tray from her\u2019s. She seemed completely stunned when she revealed two rather slim but voluptuous bunny women - one white, one pink! Patrick blushed when he noticed the curvaceous duo seemed to be completely naked, and bound by the ankles and wrists to prevent too much squirming\u2026 and when they saw the hippo, their eyes widened, as if they were shocked beyond belief! \u201cDarline\u2026!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Patrick\u2019s confusion, Darline looked similarly shocked, but quickly composed herself, the most devious grin he\u2019s ever seen spreading across her face as she licked her massive lips.  \u201cWell, well, well. This has to be my lucky day!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick\u2019s brain started to put the pieces together. \u201cWait\u2026 do you know these girls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup! They used to call me a fatass and bully me around all the time back in high school, before my awakening. Guess Zinnia really is a smaller city than it looks!\u201d Darline cackled, sending that huge tongue over the duo\u2019s nude, furry forms, making them wince as their short, silklike fur was coated in thick, smelly saliva. \u201cYou two signed up for Orlando\u2019s, huh? Guess you were more into fatasses than you let on~?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d The white one shivers, both of them blushing fiercely as they try to avoid eye contact with their soon-to-be predator. \u201cWe\u2019re\u2026 we\u2019re sorry about all that, Darline! We were\u2026 young, and dumb\u2026 we thought maybe if we\u2026 picked on you, you\u2019d, um\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEat you? Swallow you whole and turn you into another layer of pudge?\u201d She smiled, leaning in close, which obviously made the duo blush even further! Apparently, they really did volunteer to this place, just to get eaten up by a huge, hungry predator just like Darline! \u201cWell, you couldn\u2019t just asked politely, instead of being total bitches about it. But hey, I guess it all worked out in the end, right? Your dream\u2019s finally coming true. You\u2019re just gonna be fat on my ass~\u201d And just like that\u2026 they disappeared!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, their top halves did, anyway. Darline smiled, leaning back in her seat to reveal two backsides and pairs of legs dangling out of her mouth, side-by-side, as she licked and suckled on the girl\u2019s upper bodies. Patrick,meanwhile, blushed at the sight of the two round, curvaceous furry rumps dangling from Darline\u2019s lips\u2026 and noticing this, she gave him a nod and look of mischievous affirmation. With her permission, he couldn\u2019t help but grope and feel those rounded rumps a bit while the hippo savored the duo, before, finally, swallowing the rest of them down in one gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned back, her tongue hanging out in bliss as she started to rub her engorged belly, feeling her former bullies slide within. Meanwhile, Barb was rolling her prey around in her mouth, her cheeks bulging out until she finally sent all three of her meals down to her huge stomach. Before the two huge women had time for their \u2018meals\u2019 to settle, however, that waitress returned with another two trays! \u201cI see you enjoyed your first round. Make way for your second~!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Darline smiled to open the lid and reveal two mouse boys! \u201cAwww. Look at you, lil cuties! Wanna get curled up nice and warm in my tummy?\u201d She smiled, causing them to blush, their hard-ons evident as she gazed over them. \u201cHmm\u2026 who should go down first\u2026?\u201d She tapped on their foreheads, like she was quietly playing a game of eenie meenie miney moe\u2026 before suddenly, one of the mice let out a surprised squeak as she lifted him up off the tray!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was blushing like crazy as his feet were slowly dipped between her lips, the hippo\u2019s eyes half-lidded with satisfaction as she savored his delightful flavor, cooing a bit as she slipped him deeper and deeper between her lips. Sure enough, before long, he was in up to his hips\u2026 then his chest\u2026 and eventually, only his head and hands were peeking out from between those plump lips. With one last gulp, she just slurped him down like a noodle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick looked down, watching her stomach strain around three prey - probably more than she\u2019s ever fit in there at once before. \u201cUh\u2026 are you sure you\u2019re going to be able to do this, Darline\u2026?\u201d He asks, nervously, though he was also aroused as hell as he poked and prodded that huge, soft, bulging gut. \u201cD-don\u2019t overstuff yourself or anything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, Darline! It\u2019d be - urgh - rude of me not to work this excited cutie down my gullet! Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d She cooed, repeating the process on the second mouse. This time, though, she had a lot more trouble, having to pause and glurk with every swallow, seeming to struggle with every inch he slid between those lips. He held his breath, wondering if she might not be able to handle it after all\u2026 but sure enough, with one burst of effort, she managed to brute force the mouse down her throat, stretching out her belly seemingly to its limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shuddered at the feeling, holding her gut as she clenched her eyes shut, panting at just how overwhelmingly full she felt! \u201cOoooh\u2026 aaahhh\u2026 my poor tummy\u2026!\u201d She panted, wincing and cringing at their every movement that her gut was stuffed to its limit. Patrick already wanted to say \u2018I told you so\u2019, but figured now would not exactly be the best time. Still, despite how overstuffed she was\u2026 seeing her tummy THIS huge and bulging was driving him a little crazy. He shivered as he rubbed and massaged it for her, burning with arousal as he tried to soothe it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Barb had already swallowed six people, and seemed to be taking it with stride, proudly groping her belly as she felt her meals shift around inside. Around this time, the waitress came back with one more round. This one boasted two boys for Barb\u2026 and one nervous-looking, shy, and similarly naked petite mouse woman for Darline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 listen, sweetheart, I don\u2019t have ANY room left. You\u2019re gonna have to wait until later.\u201d The mouse woman was soon picked up, but to her surprise, instead of being eaten, she was just shoved roughly between the hippo\u2019s fat tits in a simple motion, disappearing completely beneath her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Patrick\u2019s ears were deafened by the sound of the two women letting out massive belches as their huge meals settled in their stretched stomachs. Darline shuddering at her overstuffed tum, while Barb got to work digesting eight people with seeming ease. Patrick  always loved big ladies\u2026 and Barb was bigger than Darline\u2026 but yet, he still found Darline way more attractive. Not to say Barb wasn\u2019t hot as hell, but Barb seemed almost like\u2026 his soulmate. It helped that she was only going to get bigger from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, your shift\u2019s probably over by now? We can hang out a little more\u2026 maybe check out that manga and anime merch shop that just opened up\u2026\u201d Darline offered to Barb.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Barb thought the prospect over as she let out yet another deep belch, nonchalantly rubbing her own stuffed stomach as she did so. \"Hmmm...what the hell, I can blow off work for a little longer!\" The bloated shark announced with gusto as she stood up from her seat in the booth. She stretched out her arms and gave her tummy a little shake, loving the feeling of her prey sloshing around inside. \"Hey, do you need a hand? You look like you're about to burst!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No - mmmph - I think I got it.\" Darline wheezed as she massaged her aching gut, never used to having so much to digest. It was stretched to its absolute limits...but, at the same time, she didn't regret it at all. Despite the pain that she was in, every kick and squirm from her willing prey felt like heaven, and soon they'll be nothing but pudge, pudge that will make her feel like a goddess...! \"Just give me a moment...Patrick, could you do your thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh, of course, Darline!\" Patrick stuttered as he went for the hippo's massive stomach. He applied his paws as gently as possible over the taut surface of her gut, making Darline's condition bearable enough to exit her booth with a huff. The moment she stood up, however, the front button of her jeans popped off from the newly added weight, causing a chain reaction of tears and rips across the rest of the fabric. \"Guh...Darline, are you sure you can walk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about Darline here, Pat!\" Barbara assures the squirrel with an affectionate slap of the hippo's stomach, making her wince in pain and pleasure. \"I remember the first time I stuffed my gut like that. All it takes is a couple of laps around the block, some belly rubs, and maybe a couple of Ibuprofen, and she'll be right as rain! Oh, speaking of which...\" the massive shark fished in between her massive chest to reveal an emergency stash of pain killers for this exact situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarline groaned at the thought of swallowing anything, food or otherwise, but knew that the more experienced Pred knew best. The pills quickly found themselves joining the squirming prey in her sore tummy, and soon the three were out and about on the streets once again. The Hippo was in no condition to drive, so Barb offered to take the wheel with the squirrel in her lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know...I'm really proud of you, Darline,\" Barb spoke up as she drove out from the beach parking lot towards their favorite Anime Store. \"What you did back there was something else. I talk a big game and all...but I got this big from going slow, I never went all out as you did. At the rate you're going, I'm gonna look like small fry next to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarline let out a deafening belch as Patrick did his best to quell the aching organ, rubbing his paws into her belly as her prey slowly faded into fatty soup. \"Urp...thank's Barb, But you shouldn't be jealous of me or anything. We both have our strong points...I just wish I started earlier, I could have been an ever bigger fatass for my little squirrelly, here.\" She hugged her boyfriend as hard as she could into her taut stomach, to which he offered no objections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick could feel Darline grow as she pressed his body into her giant, bulging tummy. Already, he could feel the movement in her stomach slowly grind to a halt, and in its place fat blubber began to make it's way everywhere on her body. It wasn't too noticeable, but as the two predators chatted he could see more and more of her face he obscured by her breasts. She was the most beautiful person in Patrick's world...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, seriously?!\" Barb pulled Patrick out of his trance as she gave him an incredulous look. \"Pat...the origin special? That's your favorite episode of Samurai Brawlers? And here I thought you had class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Wh-what's wrong with you girls, it's a solid episode! It's like I was telling Darline earlier-\" Patrick was about to go on an anime induced rant before being shushed by Darline's fat index finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save it for the shop. There, you will be judged by a panel of your peers, and you will understand...that the season five finale kicks ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick did not have to save it for long, as the Anime Merch Shop was just around the corner. The place was called 'The Chibi Baka', Zinnia City\u2019s premier location to purchase all things relating to Anime and Manga. Stepping into the place, the squirrel felt that he had finally found his people. From the biggest predator to the smallest prey, everyone inside the place was geeking out over the several shelves of brand new graphic novels and debating with each other over continuity discrepancies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarb and Darline quickly thrusted the squirrel into one of those many debates to prove, once and for all, which was the best episode of Samurai Brawlers. Patrick gave out a valiant effort and defended the origin special well, but he was forced to concede that he liked it purely for the nostalgia. At the very least, he took some comfort that the season five finale wasn't the best as well, much to the hippo and shark's ire. No, the best episode was decided to be the one with the most fanservice and boob jiggle animations and allusions to sex. It was a fair point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the excitement began to die down around the many discussions, Patrick saw, out of the corner of his eye, Darline grabbing the mouse girl from in between her tits. He was wrapped up with another Anime Fan at the moment, so he couldn't give the scene too much attention. The poor little thing was a bit scared, but Darline was adamant that her prey would go down happy. She gave her some nice sweet talk, gave her a kiss on the forehead to smooth things over, and just like that...no more mouse. When Patrick was able to pull himself away from the passionate fan, he returned to Darline to observe how her body had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no doubt about it now, she was definitely fatter, and perhaps even taller! She rubbed her gigantic paunch affectionately, gripping both sides of it and giving it a playful shake as the mouse women sloshed around inside. Her current clothes barley fitted her anymore, there was too much hippo to contain. Her hoodie was basically an ill-fitting top at this point, while the actual bra she had underneath was still going strong, probably made of some elastic material. No one in the store seemed to mind that her jeans were practically destroyed, or that they got to see some nice hippo ass as it inflated before there eyes. How long had they stayed for her to grow that much? Was she even done digesting her last meal yet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe...like what you see?\" Darline bit her lower lips seductively as she noticed Patrick take her all in. He blushed and nodded, not ashamed of himself at all. \"Mmm...all for you, babe~\" She smacked her blubbery belly, letting it wobble and jiggle like a disturbed waterbed. Soon, Barb had to say goodbye, saying that her boss would notice if she was gone for so long. She opted to walk back to the beach, maybe pick up a snack on the way, leaving the two lovebirds alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarline let out a deep and satisfied yawn as she stretched her arms over her head. Digesting so much food at once really drained her energy. \"Mmmm...what a perfect day...\" She purred as the two walked out of the Chibi Baka and back into her car. She noticed that the driver's seat felt a little smaller than normal, but didn't think too hard on that fact. \"Went to the beach, met up with a friend, ate some old bullies, nerded it up with my soulmate...ahhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, so, I'm guessing it's homeward bound, then?\" Patrick guessed, to which the big hippo just nodded her head. \"Your place?\" Another nod, followed by a belch caused by the digesting bunny in her gut. The squirrel blushed at the sight of the sleepy pachyderm, she looked so cute when she was tired! The drive was quiet and uneventful to her place, but they enjoyed each other's company in silence. When they finally get to her home, it was much nicer then what Patrick was expecting. She was a custodian at the local university, he had expected her to live in an apartment. But no, it was a suburban house in a quaint little housing tract, one for preds her size.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as they walk inside, before he can get a good feel for the lovely little home, a strange sound emerges from Darline\u2019s stomach. Well, even stranger than the strange sounds that normally emerged from her stomach. It was\u2026 the tune of his favorite anime OP? It was extremely muffled, but they both heard it, and seemed equally confused. Patrick struggled to figure out what the hell was up with that sound\u2026 before realizing. \u201cWait\u2026 is that my ringtone\u2026?\u201d His eyes widened. \u201cDarline, did you eat my phone\u2026!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately blushed and seemed embarrassed, rubbing the back of her head with a hand. \u201cUmmm\u2026 it\u2019s possible\u2026?\u201d You scoffed in surprise! \u201cI have big hands, Patrick! Sometimes stuff accidentally gets mixed in with all the snacks I\u2019m grabbing!\u201d She sheepishly tries to explain herself. You have to wonder what other things she\u2019s eaten by accident...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, can you spit it out?\u201d He asks, crossing his arms, a little annoyed at her clumsiness. \u201cI can\u2019t afford a new phone\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, alright, I can try\u2026\u201d She tensed up a little, squeezing in her gut and squishing it with her hands\u2026 until, with a strange groan, a small object travels back up her chubby throat. \u201cPlew!\u201d You immediately jump up and catch the phone in mid-air, before hurriedly checking to see if it still functioned. To your relief, her stomach acids struggled with metals and such, so it had just burned the outer shell and parts of the screen. It still worked, more or less, but he\u2019d have to go to a repair shop soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could consider that for long, though, Patrick noticed that the flashlight is on. Did that mouse woman use his phone while she was in there\u2026? Well, of course she would. She probably wanted some light. As he scrolls through his phone, he can\u2019t help but notice a new photo had been taken\u2026 only for his heart to drop the moment he checked it out! It was a photo of\u2026 inside of Darline\u2019s stomach? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in awe at finally knowing what it looked like in a pred\u2019s stomach\u2026 with those strange pink, folded walls, the cramped-looking environment, the gross half-digested junk food all about, and the acid that was up to about waist height sitting down. It\u2026 really didn\u2019t look very pleasant. And yet, the mouse woman was smiling for the camera, giving a devil horns hand gesture. Apparently, she figured it\u2019d be fun to take one last selfie before she became pudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick would have to\u2026 more thoroughly \u2018analyze\u2019 that picture later. In the meantime, he still had to return that call! While Darline went deeper into the house to get ready for bed, Patrick realized that his grandmother had been trying to contact him, and he quickly called them back. His grandmother had been the one to raise him out on that farm in the country, after his parents had been swallowed whole by a lioness when he was only little, so he greatly appreciated them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe called them, and his call was just about instantly received. Coming onto his screen was a live feed of his grandmother smiling at him, the old squirrel woman\u2019s face wrinkled with age and yet still smiling with the energy of youth. \u201cOh, sweetheart! You can\u2019t just miss calls like that in times like these. I was almost worried that you had been gobbled up for a second there!\u201d She said over facetime, causing him to smile to himself at her wholesomeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh! You don\u2019t have to worry about me, nana. I\u2019ve actually been having a wonderful time in Zinnia city!\u201d He nodded, trying to reassure her. \u201cHaven\u2019t even felt threatened by a predator once!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s wonderful to hear! I had been worried sick about you, I must confess. Transitioning from out here in the country to right to the big city\u2026 especially with all those predators\u2026 well, I shouldn\u2019t have doubted you, Patrick! You always make the best of every situation!\u201d His grandmother smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a voice emerged from the background. \u201cHey, Pat, babe? Who are you talkin\u2019 to?\u201d Darline seemed to be rather curious as she lazily brushed her teeth right in the middle of the room, doing little to cure her bad breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to her sheepishly, tensing up as he didn\u2019t really want his family to know yet exactly what sort of anthro he was hanging out with. \u201cUuh, I\u2019m just keeping my family updated\u2026!\u201d He stammered quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Who\u2019s that girl back there? Was that a new friend of your\u2019s?\u201d He sighed in exasperation as his grandmother asked. Ugh, why did both of them have to be so nosy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope! IIII\u2019m his girlfriend~!\u201d She smiled, apparently hearing that, and taking the opportunity to lean in and plant a bit smooch on Patrick\u2019s cheek, surprising him so she could snatch the phone right out of his hands. With that, she smiled into the camera at the cheerful old woman. \u201cHello, there, ma\u2019am! Nice to meetchya~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick could only tense up as the truth was revealed! Indeed, seeing the face of the absolutely MASSIVE hippo woman, Patrick\u2019s grandmother seemed to be stunned! Her mind was obviously racing to try to figure out what was going on here. Patrick was friendless for much of his life, and dateless for all of it, so the fact that he had already found a girlfriend would normally make her excited. However, she certainly didn\u2019t expect to see an\u2026 absolutely massive, obviously extremely dangerous predatory hippo lady\u2026! \u201cPatrick\u2026 is this true?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick sighed. \u201cYes, nana. This is Darline\u2026 my girlfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup! Patrick here is my precious little snugglebug~\u201d She smiled, shamelessly planting a few more smooches on the flustered and embarrassed squirrel\u2019s face while his grandmother watched in shock. \u201cBut don\u2019t you worry yourself, ma\u2019am! I may look big and scary, but I\u2019ll take good care to keep my snuggly boytoy here safe~!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick\u2019s grandmother blinked, trying to compose herself. \u201cW-well\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026 very happy for the two of you! You\u2019re\u2026 very c-cute together! I\u2019m\u2026 glad that things have been going so well for you already, Patrick\u2026!\u201d She nervously smiled. \u201cJ-just\u2026 keep me updated, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Issat cousin Patrick?\u201d Suddenly, Patrick\u2019s grandmother also got her phone snatched, and suddenly, an absolutely adorable little squirrel boy seemed to be fumbling with the phone. \u201cPatrick? Didja really find a girlfriend? Nana always said she thought you\u2019d never find one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarline giggled at that, and Patrick only blushed, seeming to grow increasingly embarrassed with every passing moment. Once the small squirrel boy raised the phone to his face, he seemed stunned to see the massive hippo woman looking back at him. \u201cYup, your dear ol\u2019 Patrick finally found his soulmate! In fact, you\u2019re looking right at \u2018er~!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWooow!\u201d Patrick\u2019s cousin\u2019s eyes widened, sparkling at the sight of Darline. \u201cYer so\u2026 big! Yer like\u2026 bigger than anybody I\u2019ve ever seen ever\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha! Think you! I try my best~!\u201d Darline giggles at her enthusiasm, patting her gut. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think your cousin Patrick here is really appreciating my bigness enough! It\u2019s almost like he doesn\u2019t want me to get bigger!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough!\u201d With that, Patrick had had enough of this embarrassment, and finally snatched back the phone. \u201cHey! Nana? I\u2019m going to be just fine! College is going great and everything! Thanks for checking in, but we gotta hit the hay now! Love you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could faintly hear a confused voice go \u201clove you too-\u201d before he had finally ended the call. Meanwhile, Darline was laughing herself silly after that exchange, while Patrick just sat there pouting, embarrassed as ever. \u201cYour family is cute as heck, babe,\u201d she giggled. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta introduce me to em someday~!\u201d He just sighs, exasperated and wanting to move on to doing something else...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Darline, I'm glad you're excited to meet my family, but I think you gave my nana a heart attack.\" Patrick sighed as he set down his phone on Darline's dresser. Meanwhile, the hippo in question began to undress in preparation for a good night's sleep. \"Big predators that can swallow people whole are kind of a rarity where my family comes from, hard to believe as it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, squirrely! You know your family has nothing to worry about!\" Darline suddenly came from behind in a surprise attack to wrap her arms around her little Patrick. \"I wouldn't even dream of gobbling you up, and there is no way in hell I'm letting anybody else do that either. And you never told me you had such a cute little bro~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Darline!\" Patrick blushed and squirmed as his back sunk into his lover's belly and chest. \"He's not my brother, he's my cousin. And don't say he's cute, he's only nine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't get so possessive of me, Patrick~\" Darline teased as she gave the squirrel's skull a wet slurp. \"What can I say, I think kids are cute, and your little cuz has to be the second cutest Squirrel I've ever seen...can you guess who's number one?\" The big hippo sat down on her double king-sized bed, the mattress and metal creaking loudly under her added weight. She lied down on her back as she turned Patrick around to press his face into her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess...is it my grandma? She's pretty cute I guess.\" Patrick joked as he snuggled up to Darline's heavy as bricks yet soft as cotton boobs. The blubbery pachyderm rolled her eyes and leaned in to plant a fat kiss on his lips, her huge mouth taking in half his face in the process. These sort of kisses were getting less and less frightening each time, leaving the squirrel pumped with more and more endorphins, kicking off his arousal for her in earnest. \"Mmmm...so, you were being serious about that promise...\" he breathed in between kisses and she slobbered her fat tongue across his furry face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patrick, I'm shocked. I thought at this point you would have known that I'm a glutton through and through.\" Darline purred as she finished off the last kiss in her barrage, leaving Patrick dazed and bereft of air. In his foggy state, he didn't realize that the hungry hippo had turned his body around, his face now positioned face down into her blubbery belly, with his crotch hovering over his girlfriend's mouth. Right when his cognitive functions came back in full capacity, he let out a primal cry as he felt his stiffing erection fall in between her lips. The squirrel's shaft instantly stiffened as her slimy maw squeezed and lapped at it, sucking down on her boyfriend's rod as if it was a nursing bottle. \"Oh Patrick, I missed your taste...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Ahhh...not too much, I ho-hope!\" Patrick moaned as he struggled to keep his pleasure under control in vain, his paws gripping the soft, creamy belly of the hippo as she sucked, sucked, and sucked down on him like a baby wanting its milk. The predator pulled and pushed, nibbled and gnawed on his manhood as it grew harder and longer from the assault of sensations. It felt amazing, almost too much if such a thing could ever exist. \"Squirrel m-meat shouldn't be tha-that tasty...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarline wasn't focusing so much on the meat of her meal, as delicious as it was. No, she was out tonight to have a drink, a creamy based drink that left her feeling warm inside. The big fat baby sucked harder and harder, growing more impatient for her milky until the exasperated father finally conceded and allowed the torrent of cum to come rushing down her maw and into her throat. The gluttonous girlfriend happily chugged it all down as Patrick spasmed out on the world's softest pillow. With a satisfied sigh, she let out the semi-placid dick from her mouth with a cork popping sound when she thought she had her fill. She flipped her boyfriend around to nuzzle affectionately with him one last time before she fell asleep after having one of the best days ever. \"I love you, Patrick...\" Was the last thing she said before she closed her eyes to enter a night of deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick smiled and quickly followed Darline into dreamland as he snuggled up to the hippo's comfy bosom. All of his dreams that night centered around the object of his greatest desire. They consisted of him feeding her both normal food and live prey, groping and fondling her ever-growing belly, boobs, and butt. All the while she kept whispering sweet things into his ear, making him feel like he was on cloud nine in love. The whole night would have gone like this...had it not been for the fact that Darline tossed and turned in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick woke up with a wheeze as he felt his lungs suddenly contract involuntarily. The first thing he saw when he opened his eyes was Darline's sleeping mug. To his surprise, he found that even in her sleep, she kept a happy and even cute looking smile on her lips as she gently snored, blowing warm air onto his face. He tried to look around but found that he couldn't as all of the hippo flesh that was underneath him was now on top of him. He blushed as he realized that Darline had rolled in her sleep, and contemplated waking her to get up before deciding she looked like she was having a very nice sleep. He wouldn't dare wake her up from her slumber...even if he did have enough air in his lungs to do so. Which he did not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned his head back and attempted to fall asleep again, the mattress underneath him not as comfy as his new blanket. He was almost afraid that if he fell back into his slumber, the warmth that he was feeling would vanish just like last night. Patrick did eventually close his eyes long enough for his brain to go back into sleep mode, and to his liking, the pleasant heat that Darline provided for him failed to leave his dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Patrick woke up the second time, he was still snuggled up to Darline, but he was no longer in her bed. The hippo had once again woke up earlier than him, but this time it wasn't to escape being caught with an underaged student but to answer the call of her rumbling stomach. The fat predator looked at the yawning squirrel as she carried him towards her large kitchen to get some food in her, fondling his ears affectionately to get his attention. \"Morning sleeping beauty.\" The hippo planted a soft kiss on his forehead as she set him down in a chair at the kitchen table too big for someone his size. \"Sorry that I rolled on top of ya last night, I should have said something about me being a toss and turner. But I won't lie...you make a great cushion squirlley~\" She teased the blushing boy with a wink and a hip check as she walked her way to the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, and you make a good blanket, Darline.\" Patrick blushed as he noticed that the hippo was still naked as she carried out a motherload of food for breakfast. \"Geez, I wish I didn't have to live on campus, then I could sleep with you like that every night...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarline set the heap of food supplies down on her counter and gave Patrick a wide grin. \"Squirlley...that's a great idea!\" The squirrel could only tilt his head in confusion. \"You wouldn't have to pay the costs for living in a dormitory, I could drive you to school every day, and every night can end just like it ended last night~\" She traced her blubbery belly as it gave out a hungry gurgle, making the squirrel blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I couldn't ask that of you, Darline!\" Patrick tried to protest the idea despite how much he loved it. \"People would notice a custodian dropping off a student from her house. What would I even say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say I'm a friend of the family.\" Darline shrugged casually. \"And you know...that wouldn't be too much of a lie after meeting them last night.\" She cracked around a carton full of eggs down into a jumbo-sized frying pan and began to cook the morning meal. Patrick groaned as he remembered his nana. It was hard enough for her to take her grandson now dating a predator, officially moving in with her could be too much. He made a mental note to call her later.</span></div></div>",

Most of his classes were surprisingly easy, and even on his most stressful days, he knew he had his beloved girlfriend waiting to pick him up and help work off some stress. They soon fell into a routine, sorting out some relationship difficulties until they settled into a lifestyle together that worked for both of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotably, the hippo didn\u2019t gain too much size during these weeks. Sure, she kept gulping people down, often multiple per day, but after the initial excitement of finding somebody who liked her pudge wore off, she felt less of an impetus to try and stuff herself to impress him, instead being more content to merely enjoy each other's company. She still continued to float the idea, though, often fantasizing about being the biggest gal in town\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the town, it felt like a utopia to Patrick! He came from a small town in the countryside where nothing ever happened and nothing interesting could be found. Now, he was running into all sorts of new fascinating stores and places to hang out every day. The farm life is overrated\u2026 the big city was where it\u2019s at! Plus, being friends with a hippo who protected him let him delve into the predator culture around Zinnia, who shared his own passion for big gurgling fat bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, they went to all sorts of places around town over the weekend\u2026 but now, just a few weeks after the beginning of the semester, they were going on their biggest trip yet! \u201cC\u2019moooon! Wake up, sleepyhead!\u201d Darline giggled as she gently shook the sleepy squirrel, who just sort of groaned, looking too exhausted to even want to exist. \u201cI <i>told</i> you that if you stayed up late watching <i>Kaba Mechakucha Ni Shita</i>, you\u2019d hate yourself in the morning! We have to be on the road by seven!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust five more minutes\u2026\u201d He groans, only for her to roll her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, c\u2019mon, you little baby!\u201d With that, she easily lifted him up in her arms as if he were literally a baby, causing him to squirm in surprise in her grip as she carried his limp form over to the bathroom! Before he could much understand what was going on, she plopped down on his feet in front of the sink in the bathroom. \u201cI\u2019ve let you sleep in as much as I could. Now get dressed and get ready!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Patrick went through the motions of his morning in a zombie-like stupor, brushing his teeth, taking a shower with Darline, getting dressed in light clothing, helping her pack her massive car (though she did most of the work there, as many of her suitcases were almost as big as Patrick\u2019s entire body). Finally, he settled into the oversized passenger seat as Darline plopped her butt on the driver\u2019s side. \u201cAlright, you crybaby. Now you can get some shut-eye. But I\u2019ll be waking you up soon, cause I ain\u2019t driving the whole seven hours!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the relaxing movement of the massive car around him, he almost immediately dazed off, dreaming of jiggling asses as he curled up against the door. Eventually, though, he was once again pried from his restful dreams by the feeling of a giant hand shaking him awake. He groaned as he sat up, looking around in that confused stupor that anyone who\u2019s been woken up from a car nap can relate to. He looked around to see that they were at a rest stop, and glanced over at Darline\u2026 only to gaze quizzically at her bulging stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... what? I grabbed a snack at a gas station a little while back. Sue me!\u201d She shrugged, before finally clamoring out of the car. Patrick looked around, confused, as she trotted over to the passenger side, lifting him up and plopping him in front of the steering wheel before sitting down for a break from driving. \u201cAlright, squirrely. We got two and a half hours left, and I ain\u2019t driving anymore. Hope you\u2019ve got the energy, cause you\u2019re leading the way from here~!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumiliatingly, Patrick had to sit in a sort of booster chair just to be able to drive this huge car, but once he was on the road, he sort of settled into a rhythm, listening to music with Darline as she chilled beside him. \u201cSo, yer \u2018nanas\u2019 never met a predator before, huh?\u201d The hippo asks. \u201cI hope I make a\u2026 good first impression~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s the first time\u2026\u201d Patrick shrugged. \u201cWe\u2026 did have a lioness move into town a long time ago, when I was just a little cub. She, well\u2026 she ate a lot of townsfolk. At least a couple a day\u2026 treated the town like it was her private buffet. Even ate my parents\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarline seemed amused by the story at first, but then, she frowned. \u201cYour parents\u2026? Oh dear\u2026 I\u2019m sorry to hear that\u2026\u201d She asked. \u201cWhat ended up happening?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 the town had such a small population already, there really was a risk that she could just wipe us all out, if nobody did anything about it\u2026\u201d Patrick shrugged, hardly remembering these times. \u201cSo, like, a bunch of them stormed her house with pitchforks and stuff\u2026 apparently, it was like a huge fight\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, my!\u201d Darline tilted her head, surprised by the story. She had heard a few tales of powerful and experienced predators go out into the countryside to try and depopulate entire tiny towns\u2026 but it seems like this predator ended up getting treated to karma. \u201cWell, of course, you have my promise that I won\u2019t eat anybody at all while I\u2019m there! This hippo\u2019s going on a diet for the weekend!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they crossed right passed a sign - <i>Sweet Cicely Town</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"> ** Images For Use By Upgraded+ Only ** </div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they stopped at a nice big farmhouse by the lake, to find...</span></div></div>",

There was a gentle breeze blowing across her fatty flesh as she stared out into the horizon, picking out the humble hamlet of Sweet Cicely on the sloping banks of the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...\" Darline breathed as Patrick followed her out of the open door, joining by her side. To him, the view of the little town on the water was humdrum and dull, but seeing the hippo so entranced by the sight of it made him feel a little proud of his country upbringing. \"You grew up here, Patrick? Geez, I almost feel jealous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, you'd feel different after living here for most of your life.\" Patrick shrugged as he leaned into Darline's flabby hip. \"There isn't really anything to do around here, except for the annual corn festival. I always liked getting to see the Corn Queen Pageant, the Husk-Off, the Corn-o-Rama...I sound like a country bumpkin, don't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, not at all.\" Darline drooled a little at the thought of all that food in one place. \"I like this place, it's a lot like you. Tiny, cute, a little shy, but always a blast to be around.\" She wrapped a pudgy arm around Patrick's shoulder's and pressed him up into her gut, to which he nuzzled like a pillow affectionately. Sweet Cicely was about as generic a small town one could get, but he could see why some folks from the city can find it attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweet Cicely had pastel suburban homes, a single Elementary and High School with the same name as the town, and the main street that led up to a town square. Everyone liked hot dogs, and apple pie, and old cars. The mandatory attire was flannel with blue jeans, and if you were rich you had to have a bolo tie. Patrick was afraid how Darline might be taken here, considering the last time a predator showed up, but the people in the close-knit community here were friendly, and always tried to be inclusive to everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick's childhood home was surrounded by fields of corn, broken up by overgrown hills of rocks. The wind gently pushed through the swaying, yellowish stalks as the waves of the lake crashed down below. The farmhouse itself was covered in picturesque little wallflowers, always in need of some sort of maintenance and another paint job. Everything about the place had a pleasing feel to it...but the squirrel was concerned if his girlfriend could even fit through the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick and Darline's intimate moment was interrupted as they both heard the sound of a throat being cleared behind him. The squirrel turned around first to find his nana and cousin by the hippo's car, having walked out from the farmhouse to greet them. Overcome by his emotions, he wiggled out of his girlfriend's grip to run to his grandmother, giving the elderly squirrel a hug. \"Nana!\" He smiled as she returned his embrace. \"Thanks for having us out for Labor Day Weekend. I hope it's not too much trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't talk nonsense, young man. You will always have a place here as long as I'm around.\" Nana kissed her grandson's neck, while the little youngster at her side jumped up and down, waiting for his hug from cousin Patrick. \"George, wait your turn. Nana got dibs, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick chuckled out loud as he looked down to see a hyperactive squirrel boy wrapping his arms around his legs. \"Patrick, what's it like in the big city?! Did you have your wallet picked by a robber, do you stay up all night going to parties, do you take the bus?!\" He bugged his bigger cousin with a series of questions that only made him smile. He never thought he would miss his annoying queries. The little ankle biter turned his head around and saw Darline. \"Is that your girlfriend?\" He pointed out to the hippo, who politely stood back as her boyfriend reconnected with his family. Careful not to shake the ground underneath them too much, she made her way towards the trio of Squirrels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, ma'am.\" Darline greeted as politely as possible to the elderly women as she released Patrick from her hug. The hippo bent down so she didn't look so imposing as brought forth a pudgy hand to offer a shake. \"It's very good to meet you, you've raised a very fine young man.\" While the older squirrel looked hesitant, she eventually accepted Darline's handshake, the massive appendage engulfing her own hand gently. She almost looked surprised that her arm wasn't ripped out of her socket from the action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise, Darline.\" Patrick's nana smiled softly, trying to put her prejudices against predators away and give her grandson's girlfriend a chance. Darline was making an attempt to not come off as scary, which she could respect, but she knew that she hadn't gotten that...healthy from eating regular food. However, she remembered the Lioness from so many years ago, and that hungry look in her eyes...this hippo didn't have that when he was with her. \"I hope you've been treating my grandson well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!' George awed at the sight of the great, big hippo. He quickly detached from Patrick's legs and stood underneath her large stomach. \"You're even bigger in person! Can I touch your tummy, please?\" Darline released her hand from Patrick's Nana and blushed at the sight of such a cute, innocent little kid. He looked to be entranced by how big she was, and more specifically how big her gut was. She looked back up to the little one's guardian for what to do, not wanting to overstep her boundaries, who bit her lower lip as she thought what to do herself. She forced a smile and gave a nod of affirmation, prompting Darline to gently grab the eager boy's paw to bring it to her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...whoa, it's so...soft and warm...\" George moved his paw around the underside of Darline's expansive stomach, giving her a nice massage, while Patrick and her Nana looked on in apprehension. \"It's like a big pillow...\" He brought up another paw, making Darline gasp a little as her flab folded over his tiny hands. She noticed that his typical, hyperactive behavior seemed to calm down as he rubbed her blubbery sphere, almost like he was being hypnotized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...George, didn't you have questions for Patrick, about the big City?\" Patrick's Nana tired to put an end to the sight unfolding before her eyes. It worked, however, and the little kid instantly pulled away from Darline's gut to pester his big cousin again. With that, the Labor Day Weekend was underway. What was the first thing that the family did?</span></div></div>",

How are you today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTerrible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 uh\u2026 sorry, to hear about that, ma\u2019am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 my friend just got swallowed up by some orca lady\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, jeez, that is\u2026 pretty serious\u2026 well, ahem, speaking of which, I w-would, uh, like to tell you about an exciting new home security system that\u2019s guaranteed to keep any predators out of-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy friend is gurgling away in some predator\u2019s gut, and you\u2019re trying to sell me things? You\u2019re just\u2026 heartless!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, there came that familiar click, and the call was over. The scrawny opossum man sitting in the cubicle could only sigh, not feeling particularly proud of his line of work\u2026 but hey, it was a living. There were dozens of cubicles lining the entire small building, all buzzing with calls and the clicking of keyboards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Zinnia City, even for predators, breaking and entering was illegal, but that didn\u2019t stop some predators from sneaking into houses to swallow up entire families in their sleep. That\u2019s what this company is for - selling home security systems designed to protect families against these sorts of predators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe opossum, Glen, doesn\u2019t work in the exciting parts of the company like the designing and engineering. No\u2026 he works at the call center. Going through a seemingly endless list of names of various prey families, and asking them if they\u2019re interested in a fancy new home security. It was sort of a soul-draining job\u2026 but there was one thing that made it interesting\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, speak of the devil. Glen was treated to the familiar feeling of the ground lightly shaking as a huge, looming figure approached. He didn\u2019t even have to glance over to know just who it was - Bertha. Her eyes scanned over the crowd with a deeply unimpressed look on her face, and everybody knows even the slightest thing could set her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, though, Glen wasn\u2019t nearly as scared of her as everyone else. Especially since he felt rather good about his sales this week. He pretended to keep working, but really, he was curiously listening in as the turkey stopped at the cubicle next to him. \u201cRight, Hugo. It\u2019s friday. How many customers did you reel in this week?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwenty-three, miss!\u201d The fox working next to him smiled, sounding relieved and proud that he had managed to surpass the quota.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh, that\u2019s too bad,\u201d she said, feigning disappointment. \u201cThe quota\u2019s twenty-five. You just missed it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause. \u201c... w-what\u2026?\u201d The fox asked, his voice filled with shock and confusion, and most of all, terror! \u201cNo! The... the quota\u2019s twenty! It\u2019s always been twenty\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, upper management has cut down on my lunch budget, so now, the quota\u2019s twenty-five. Got it?\u201d She rolled her eyes at his complaining, and the fox let out a little startled yelp as, with incredible strength, the massive turkey lady easily grabs him by his shirt collar and lifts him off his seat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! This isn\u2019t fair! You never said - MPH!\u201d Before he could protest another moment, his voice was suddenly muffled. Glen couldn\u2019t fight the urge to glance over\u2026 his breath catching in his throat at what he saw. The turkey was looking annoyed as she\u2019d stuffed the fox\u2019s entire upper body into her beak, only his kicking legs dangling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other employees watched in horror, but Glen was almost fascinated, trailing the contours of his body as the bulge of the fox employee moved right down his throat. Desperately wishing he could feel that bulge in her feathery neck as it slowly slid down towards her gut, with his legs disappearing right into her beak until they, too, disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a belch as he settled in her massive gut, which was so huge it was difficult to tell he was even in there, with just some barely noticeable bulges appearing in the part of her feathery belly that poked out beneath her overworked shirt.  \u201cUgh! You know, nothing\u2019s worse on the taste buds than whiny prey, Hugo,\u201d she growled, patting her gut as she felt him squirm inside. \u201cIf you couldn\u2019t be a good employee, you could at least be a half-decent lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she trotted over to the next cubicle, which happened to belong to the opossum. \u201cGlen. It\u2019s friday. What do you got for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, he only smiled lightly up at her. \u201cThey\u2019re selling like hot cakes miss\u2026!\u201d He says, trying to seem far more enthusiastic than the rest of the employees. \u201cI\u2019ve signed thirty-six customers up for installments this week!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised a brow, as if surprised. \u201cOh? Is that so? Well, good job, Glen. You\u2019re a credit to the team,\u201d she said, patting his head. \u201cKeep that up, and you might even get employee of the month\u2026 hah\u2026\u201d With that, she let out another belch as she continued onwards, patting her gut as she went to presumably gobble down some more employees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Glen just sighed and glanced down at the throbbing bulge in the front of his pants, hidden away beneath his desk. Yup\u2026 the rest of his colleagues found her terrifying, but to Glen, she was drop dead gorgeous. He\u2019d never been able to see a predator work like that in person, but working this job, he got to see it every single day. Just how easily the big, powerful, mean turkey lady could swallow people down and digest them in that churning prison of a gut\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nGlen sighed with heavy exhaustion as he poured some cups worth of water into the coffee machine. He had really given it all he could to get those sales commissions, but in his mind it was worth it. The opossum didn\u2019t care if he was seen as an asskisser for quite potentially the world\u2019s worst boss, the rare compliment to come from her fatty beak made him feel lighter than air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlen shut the latch on the top of the coffee machine down and placed the pot in the warmer. Slowly, the pot filled back up again with the lifeblood of any modern office. Not having anything else to do at the moment, the opossum was content to just observe the device go through with its motions, when the floor underneath him began to give out an all too familiar quake. He glanced back to see that the very object of his fantasies, Bertha, had come into the break room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBertha\u2019s presence made Glen stiffen his posture as anxiety began to claim him. He contemplated simply ignoring her, but that would be seen as too obvious. The blubbery turkey never used the call center break room, always opting to use her own office as a lunch area...for food that wasn't live, of course. He turned his head further and gave out a smile with a stutter. \u201cHe-Hello they're, Ms. Bertha! Did you need something? Some coffee, perhaps?\u201d He tried to be polite, knowing full well that just because he had the most sales didn\u2019t take him off the chopping block.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm...yeah, I wanted to have a word with you, Glen.\u201d Bertha made her way towards the coffee machine where Glen was standing in front of. He turned around to fully face her just in time for her big, feathery belly to smoosh up against his torso, making his skin go red underneath his fur. The opossum looked up nervously to see the fat turkey smiling down on him. And for the first time since he joined the call center...it wasn\u2019t the smile one would give to a good looking piece of meat. \u201cI wanted to ask you...did you honestly think I couldn\u2019t see that big, throbbing erection in your pants every time I walked by?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlen\u2019s world seemed to fall apart as his eyes widened in horror. She found out, Berths had known about his crush on her this whole time! His legs went soft under her gaze, and if it wasn't for her belly pressing him against the counter he would have fallen to the floor. The opossum muster up all the courage he had and gulped before giving his reply. \u201cY-yeah...yeah, I thought I kept it hidden\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, but it wasn\u2019t. It was in plain sight from day one, and evan know I can feel your little boner press up against my big, comfy paunch.\u201d She closed her eyes and sensually gripped both sides of her huge, heaving belly to lift it up before letting it fall. Glen began to shrivel evan further under her from the teasing, to which the turkey took much pleasure in. \u201cI have a proposition for you, Glen. I need you to rank in a hundred sales by next week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Glen shouted as much as he could with all that turkey flesh pressing into his lungs. Bertha\u2019s pudgy wing hand smothered his mouth while the other one was raised in front of her face, making a shushing sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, Glen. I\u2019m tired of taking charge of the call center, I\u2019ve been her too long. It\u2019s time I move up in this company, and I\u2019m gonna use you to get what I want. A spot\u2019s opened up for the regional director of sales, and whichever call center manager has the most commissions gets the job. You\u2019re gonna be my ace in the hole, and as for your reward, not only will I promote you to manager\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Bertha leaned past her vast cleavage to plant a gentle, soft kiss down on Glen\u2019s forehead. The little opossum squirmed as every fantasy he had ever had about the turkey was coming true. \u201c...I\u2019ll give you a chance with a date. You seem cute enough, and maybe you\u2019ll impress me enough to warrant another one. But, until than\u2026\u201d she finally released her vice grip on him, leaving her employee to call to the ground. \u201c...you got a hundred calls to go.\u201d With that, she left him with his pot of freshly brewed coffee and headed back to her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood afternoon!\u201d Glen spoke into the mouthpiece with the first kind of genuine enthusiasm since he started at the call center. \u201cMy name is Glen, I\u2019m a soulless telemarketer working at an unethical business calling you in hopes of selling a deceptively overpriced product. Before you hang up and wish I was dead, however, do you mind if I ask you a question?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost everyone who had Glen\u2019s voice in earshot suddenly stopped what they were doping to look around and give him an incredulous stare. The opossum ignored them, having anticipated such a response. If he was going to get a hundred commissions, his old tactics wouldn't work, he would have to go in bold. Brutal honesty, in his opinion, always caught people\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a couple of seconds, there was nothing but silence on the receiver, until Glen heard a long and drawn out sigh. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s see where this goes. Shoot.\u201d Jackpot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you recently lost a loved one to a predator?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...yeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy uh...one of my sons. One of the teachers from his school followed him home one day and\u2026\u201d Glen could tell his voice was breaking a little. Time to pivot away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s alright, sir, you don\u2019t have to go nay further. Can you spare me the time for another question?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...mhmm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you afraid it could happen again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, he heard a choked sob on the other end. \u201cOh God...yes, yes of course I\u2019m scared! I\u2019ve been trying to play it cool, but...fuck!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is where the soulless telemarketer comes in to play on your emotions.\u201d One of Glen\u2019s colleagues dropped a cup of coffee on the floor. This wasn\u2019t bold, this was insane! \u201cI work for a security system company, sir, I target potential prey customers that feel scared, vulnerable, and small. We can put cameras around your home to make sure would be predators won\u2019t get away with what they\u2019ve done. We can put alarms that notify the police when they detect a break in. We can put notifications on your phone when your sons don\u2019t come home in time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, silence. Glen began to sweat bullets as almost every eye in the call center was on him. Was his plan crazy enough to work, or just plain crazy. Finally, the voice responded back. \u201cDo you...have family packages?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the day at the office, Glen\u2019s phone line was full of calls like that, and they almost always ended with a sale. His coworkers were so suprised and so taken aback that his ridiculous strategy worked, that they began to copy him. Soon, evreyone was getting good calls, which meant the opossum had to double down in his efforts to make sure he stood out on Friday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day saw the call center break it\u2019s record for sales taken in per day. On Monday they broke the record they had set for themselves. The day after that was full of good numbers, too, and the day after that, and the day after that...and pretty soon it was Friday again. And for the first time in a very long time, aside from a lack of excuses to eat her employees, Bertha was impressed. In the end, Glen didn\u2019t make a hundred sales commissions...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made more then twice that number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know...I should probably kiss you for all this.\u201d Bertha sighed wistfully as she packed up her personal things from Glen\u2019s new office. The opossum could scarcely believe it, just last week he was some lowly, expendable phone jockey...now he was king of them! \u201cThat brutal honesty but you came up with? I thought you were batshit crazy out of your mind when I heard what you were saying...but hey, it\u2019s not my problem any more, is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe office won\u2019t be the same without you, Ms. Bertha.\u201d Glen smiled sadly, happy to see the object of his fantasies move up in the world, but depressed he would no longer be able to see her down random colleagues when\u2019re she was peckish. \u201cI can only hope I can fill the shoes you left for me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better, boy, because the big leagues have quotas too.\u201d Bertha smiled devious as she lifts the last box of her stuff into her arms. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to stop on by when I think your a little short in sales...oh, and about your reward...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlen hadn\u2019t forgotten about the promise of a date. He had everything planned out for a nice, relaxing evening at...</span></div></div>",

She's agoraphobic and spends most of the time in her apartment, only leaving when she gets hungry, stuffing her belly with the first people she comes across before retreating hurriedly back into her apartment. Online, she's highly engaged in all sorts of geek culture, including video games, comic books, everything. She's very shy about talking about her real life, though... though, perhaps with some convincing, someone truly persuasive might be able to convince her to let them visit her apartment. Secretly, she craves physical affection, something she's never received from another person before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Melanie<br>\r\nAge: 32<br>\r\nSpecies: Cow<br>\r\nBio: Always seen dressed in a big old-fashioned maid outfit, she's always working as a live-in tutor and nanny. She's a soft and motherly type who loves caring for others nearly as much as she loves getting to live in the mansions of rich folk. However, she rarely holds onto one job for more than a few months, for a simple reason; she's hungry, and really enjoys eating people! No matter what they try, nobody seems to be able to convince her to stop eating their neighbors and house guests! She's so good at all sorts of work, though, that she always gets a new job quick.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sometimes when Dennis logged on to the vast expanse of the Internet, it was because he was feeling horny and wanted to ogle some pictures of fat predators stuffing down prey. Other times, the little mouse person went onto his computer to complain about his life under an anonymous username. He chose the handle '10X10Fates' which he justified was symbolic of his favorite number one hundred and the destinations his life may take to cover up it just sounded cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, however, was not like most of Dennis's days on the world wide web. Today, he set himself out to find a stable person who could fulfill his need for basic interaction. The outside world was a place of contempt for the mouse, it was loud and crowded with people he did not like, so he turned to social media and online forums to get his fix for conversation. It was incredibly uncommon for him to ever find someone like that as he surfed the many chat rooms...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, sometimes the planets and stars above would align in just the right way, and Dennis would find himself in a conversation that was not only interesting but more importantly satisfying, one that didn't devolve into single phrases utterances and vulgar name calling. One of those days, as he was about to find out, was today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10X10Fates / 10:10 A.M: Running the chance that I come off as an asshole, I never understood why the latest release of Mortal Dynasties was met with so much controversy. I'm not as die-hard a fan a lot of others are with the series, but it doesn't strike me as offensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis the mouse had found a chat room dedicated to the discussion of Mortal Dynasties 7, and while he personally liked the game alright, he was surprised to see how merciless the community was being on it. Some claims were legitimate, but a lot of the stuff they were saying felt blown out of proportion. The biggest complaint? The ability for predator character selects to swallow the in-game enemies has been removed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10X10Fates / 10:10 A.M: I mean...I'm a mouse, I don't know how it feels to have something like 'that' taken away from me, but death threats to the developers seems just a little extreme. Am I really the only one who thinks so?<br>\r\nRoseValkryie / 10:11 A.M: You're quite the bold one, letting everyone know what species you are.<br>\r\n10X10Fates / 10:11 A.M: Valkyrie..?<br>\r\nRoseValkryie / 10:11 A.M: Oh, don't mind me. I'm just trying to tease ya.<br>\r\nRoseValkryie / 10:12 A.M: Honestly, I'm not upset that I can't eat the in-game enemies anymore, I'm upset at the message of what the devs are saying. Us predators get enough bad looks from prey, we don't need our favorite video games to start.<br>\r\nRoseValkyrie / 10: 13 A.M: Still, I'm not gonna go down to their offices to pay them a visit I'm so mad. They'll probably cave in and make the option some DLC or something along the road...<br>\r\n10X10Fates / 10:14 A.M: Oh! I didn't know you were a pred.<br>\r\nRoseValkyrie / 10: 14 A.M: Is that gonna be an obstacle?<br>\r\n10X10Fates / 10: 15 A.M: Not at all! I just assumed that you were a prey after you spent so much time railing against the 'lure' option that the old games had for preds to bring love interests in the game like me back home to get eaten.<br>\r\n10X10Fates / 10: 15 A.M: I thought you had some pent up aggression after witnessing something like that.<br>\r\nRoseValkryie / 10:16 A.M: No no, I eat prey all the time. I'm just honest with my hunger, unlike so many others who like to trick their prey into false safety. It's the equivalent of pissing on a beloved pet before stomping their brains out. <br>\r\n10X10Fates / 10:18 A.M: Hmm-mm...I've always been a little nervous around preds, but the ones that are obviously being nice for a quick meal always irked me off in a special way. It's nice to hear that there are some that are courteous with their food to an extent.<br>\r\nRoseValkryie 10:19 A.M: And it's nice to see prey on this forum not log off the moment they find out I eat their species as a snack between meals~<br>\r\n10X10Fates / 10:20 A.M: Well, it makes me feel a little weird, but being hungry shouldn't make you a monster, right? Besides, it's not like you eat mice specifically.<br>\r\nRoseValkryie / 10:20 A.M: Yep! All food is equal in my gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis remembered the username of the predator, and while the mouse surfed the web to see if their name popped up somewhere, he didn't obsess over it. At least, that's what he told himself. He had been online for a long enough time to find others who thought a conversation had meant friendship on the spot, that having the same liking of video games or what have you was enough to warrant free reign over his personal life. Eventually, the two found themselves chatting online once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one of the many miscellaneous sub-chat rooms of a sub-chat room, Dennis and 'Valkyrie', in the midriff of several larger conversations happening at once, began to get to know each other better. No real names at first or any semblance of where they lived, but Dennis got to learn that Valkyrie was a professional video game critic. The mouse also learned that 'they' were a 'she', a very obese Giraffe 'she'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis's initial interest in 'Valkyrie' had been strained by the unforgiving truth that his mental fantasy of her would most likely never be met in reality, however an offhand comment that she lived in Zinnia City put some hope into his text. He had recently moved to ZC from Taxus Fields, a sleepy little town from the countryside, in search of better jobs. Their conversations were dominated by talking about video games and anime and every other nerd culture you could name under the sun, but sometimes they would veer towards the fact that she was a pred and that he was prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt strangely gratifying to hear the giraffe go into long detail about her 'food', from the preparations she took to catch a victim by surprise, to the digestion process, to the end result on her newly plumped body. Dennis felt a little ashamed at how much he was...enjoying himself with these turns in their talks, and it certainly made quite the obstacle to romantic fulfillment. It was great that they could talk so openly, but it wasn't exactly the seeds of a long term relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, it was still great to have a friend in Zinnia City, online or otherwise. Ever since he moved to ZC, his social life has taken a drastic plummet. No friends, no acquaintances, and it certainly did not help his coworkers were shitheads. Valkyrie filled the void for relationship in his heart. They shared personal information with each other as they kept talking back and forth. In a display of trust and respect, they revealed their names to each other. The giraffe was called Anna...it sounded beautiful to Dennis. Through virtual text, they had forged a personal kinship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, when Anna griped one day about making a little bit more spending money and mused that she wouldn't mind having a roommate if she didn't freeze up around new people, Dennis's first instinct was to volunteer. He wasn't particularly fond of his new lodgings in Zinnia City, and only having to pay half rent would be less tough on his wallet. But it wasn't until; he had sent the message in question that he realized it was more than a friendly exchange. He just asked if he could room with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he remembered how Anna hated predators who lured them into obvious traps. He began to panic, thinking that she would take it as an insult. Thankfully, that did not turn out to be the case. After half an hour, she responded back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoseValkyrie / 4:46 P.M: I mean...I don't want to just ask you to come over, that would be distasteful, I think. But, if you really are offering, it would be more so if I turned you down. The fact of the matter is...I'm really tired of being a shut in, and you're probably the closest thing I have to an actual friend. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to be real friends, in real life. I don't think I would be comfortable with having anybody but you in my home, and you know I wouldn't eat you the second you came through the door, or at least I hope you know. So...if you want to know my address, you can have it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was totally unexpected, but Dennis was nevertheless happy to see the private message on his screen. What stood out to him was the part about Anna liking him. but he tried to keep his response as neutral as possible, accepting the role of her roommate and asking when she wanted him to come over. As soon as he could was the answer. The address was sent to his email, and he began packing up his things immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did Anna live?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dennis looked down at the piece of printed paper with Anna's address in his hands, and then back up again at the massive, wooden door in front of him. He never really had too much time to settle down in his old apartment, so he was only carrying a few suitcases and a couple of cardboard boxes. The mouse was a bit nervous, not just because he was about to meet and move in with a predator he met online, but because of where he was overall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna lived in a nice enough apartment building called Oleander Towers, built exclusively for Zinnia City's plus-sized population. Prey could live there, technically, but most don't since the ones that do end up getting gobbled up in the hallways or in the dead of night. Despite the strong foundations and supports, the manager of the place regulates the heavier the tenant's weight, the closer you live to the bottom. That way, when an accident happens, like a floor caving in, it shouldn't spiral out of control too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna lived pretty far down Oleander Towers, not too many flights of stairs from the ground floor. A bead of sweat running down his forehead, Dennis cautiously knocked firmly on the door to announce that he had arrived. The ground underneath him shook as the occupant inside made her way to him, and the wooden slab merely grazed the mouse as it swung open. He looked up to see his new roommate, and it took off all of his willpower to not drop his jaw at the sight of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna was dressed up in some pretty nerdy looking clothes, a sweater hoodie that had a video game logo emblazoned on the front, and a pair of yoga pants with a few stains. Yet despite that, the obese giraffe was still utterly stunning. She had long blond hair pulled back into a trendy ponytail, accented by her big, round eyes and thick, luscious lips. Her spotted stomach bulged out from her midriff like a wrecking ball, pushing up the hoodie to her breasts, which were already having trouble containing her heaving bosom. Her yoga pants hugged her massive rear end like a glove, leaving nothing to the imagination and was practically painted on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was beautiful, at least in Dennis's mind. Anna smiled shyly as she looked down past her big cleavage and belly at the adorable mouse boy in front of her door. \"Hey there, Dennis!\" She beamed with as much excitement her social anxiety would permit. \"When I said 'as soon as you can', I guess you really took that to heart, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I was just a bit...excited,\" Dennis revealed, rubbing a hand behind his neck as he gave out a nervous chuckle. \"I think I'm more starved for someone to be around with than I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well...welcome to the club~\" Anna blushed with a subtle wink, shifting her bulk to her left leg so that her new roommate could squeeze past her. \"Come on in, let's get you settled in your new home.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis returned the blush and accepted the offer to enter Anna's room. He took in the main room, certainly not the tidiest place in the world, but nothing you couldn't get used to. There were dirty clothes thrown about in random fashion, while the tables were stacked high with pizza boxes and fast food containers. Still, it wasn't too bad. It was an open space with a terrace window opposite the front door and two corridors leading off it, one to the left and one to the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than the mess that Anna's apartment was in, it was strangely cozy. Comfortable, black sofas and chairs were aligned to view a huge television on the far wall, probably where she did her video game streams. The decoration was sparse save for the piles of clothes and food wrappers, but what was present was tasteful and kind of high class. \"So, Dennis, now that you're here it might be a good time to talk about ground rules.\" The giraffe shuffled around you, accidentally bumping you with her hip as she bent down to your eye level. \"As you can tell, I'm not the cleanest person, and I sort of need some help keeping my place clean. Other than that, just make sure that half the rent gets paid by the end of the month, every month. Sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis realized that he was idly twiddling with his thumbs and put a stop to it. Just because he was nervous didn't mean he had to show it. \"S-sounds totally good, you can count on me!\" He spoke with a bit too much enthusiasm. Although Anna seemed very nice and reserved, he knew that getting on a predator's bad side is a one-way ticket to being turned into pudge. \"I'll definitely pull my weight, and if I gotta pull a bit of yours, then that's just fine too.\" The mouse smirked cheekily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThan Dennis realized that he just made a joke about Anna's weight, and the smirk instantly dissipated. Before the mouse could apologize for his crass behavior, he noticed that the fat giraffe was smirking back. \"Aw, Dennis. You're so cute!\" She opened her arms wide for a hug, engulfing her roommate in her warm, squishy mass. It felt like a little slice of heaven for the rodent and almost reached out when her body was pulled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo...what do you think of your new home?\" Anna asked, plopping down her generous bulk onto a large chair, the impact making her body bounce and ripple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pretty cool, I had no idea that playing video games could pay so well. But, uh...where do I put my stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, just about anywhere, really.\" Anna replied, nonchalantly flicking on the television before extending a pudgy arm towards one of the corridors. \"I have a spare bedroom down the hall if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis did his best to follow Anna's vague sounding instructions, taking the right-hand hallway. The apartment wasn't too big, but it didn't feel stifling either, probably because the mouse was so tiny compared to the main occupant. All of the other rooms were in a similar state of untidiness, with things discarded left and right and everything being generally disorganized. After unpacking what few items Dennis had, he set out to clear up the mess as soon as he could, figuring that making himself useful now will make it easier to slack off later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the mouse got to work. The containers of food were plentiful in his observations, yet each and every one of them had been picked clean. Everything had been going swimmingly until Dennis came across the issue with the clothing. They're was just...so much of it! The stuff on the ground wasn't even that dirty, but a thick film of dust seeped into all of the fabrics, thus began the herculean task of running back and forth to the laundry room. The process of cleaning the place took well over an hour, but soon the little prey was finished. Satisfied with his work, he returned to the main room to report back to Anna...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...to find the giraffe in nothing but her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis froze, not very sure on how to tackle the situation he found himself in. Before him sat Anna, his confidant and new roommate, practically nude save for a black, lacy bra. The mouse made the assumption that she was sporting matching panties, but with her belly hanging down so boldly he couldn't really tell. The giraffe seemed so much...fatter now, more spread out on her chair. It was almost as if her body was now free to flow outwards, no longer constrained by her tight clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, are you done already?\" Anna's voice rang out in Dennis's ears, knocking him out of his stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, eh...yep!\" Was all the mouse could string together, trying to hide his flustered expression and failing miserably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, good! I figured I might as well get myself comfy while you worked\", she paused a little bit, unsure of herself, before only then realizing what the problem was. \"I, uh...I guess I should have warned you what being comfy means to me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine!\" The mouse blustered out. \"I don't want you to feel like you have to act differently with me around. Honestly, I can just go into another room or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now, I don't want you to feel like a stranger in your own home.\" Anna assured, before shoving a handful of chocolate covered almonds into her mouth. \"But...you know what might help?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Swallowing down the last of her mouthful of almonds, Anna gestured a plump hand affably toward the entertainment center across the room, \u201cWe could fire up one of the consoles, settle in maybe? Ten bucks says I can wipe the floor with you in a versus round of Mortal Dynasties.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tossed a friendly wink at Dennis, who was still visibly grappling with his sudden exposure to her bared figure. With a quick shake of his head, the mouse boy seemed to regain his composure at the topic of competitive gaming, his ears twitching happily as he returned the wink, \u201cNot a chance - I've got over a hundred hours in already. Is the disk already in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, I've got it\u2013hmmph\u2013you take a load off, you've been tidying up for over an hour now.\u201d The giraffe girl had heaved herself up out of her deep-seated leather recliner, leaving behind an immense double indentation where her prodigious rear had settled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis stared as his seven-foot roommate stepped over to the entertainment center, popped one of the glass front panels open, and bent deeply at the waist to begin readying the gaming system. He wasn't sure if Anna might be unaccustomed to maintaining her modesty around guests, or if she was simply too laid-back to pay it much attention. Whatever the case, he was now standing barely beyond arm's length from her, gobstruck by the wall of smooth, spotted rump splayed out before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turns out, Anna was indeed wearing a matching pair of black lace panties to accompany her bra, but it was barely visible as her immense cheeks swallowed it in their embrace. While she finished up configuring things for their multiplayer bout she swayed idly from side to side like a mountain of flesh, and Dennis distractedly noted that he stood almost exactly eye-level with the upper crest of her rounded hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the young mouse boy began to feel a telltale stirring in the front of his cargo shorts however, Anna straightened up with a heavy breath and swung around to face him, her long, blonde ponytail coming to rest over her shoulder, \u201cWhew, all set - here ya go!\u201d She held out a custom-painted controller for him, \u201cIt's going to be awfully embarrassing if you can't own up to all that bragging, haha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad it not been for the thin fur on Dennis's face, Anna might have seen him blushing embarrassedly at the direction he had let his mind wander. Instead, he reached up and snatched the controller a little too quickly from her outstretched hand, eager for the distraction from her body, \u201cJ-just you wait, heh. Gonna get clobbered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hefty giraffe girl turned away to thump heavily back down into her leather recliner, and Dennis thought he may have caught the hint of a smirk at the corner of her mouth. As she settled into the chair her mass wobbled slightly, sending rippling waves across the smooth skin of her belly. She tapped a few buttons on a remote to spur the TV to life, and then began navigating through the game menus on her controller. For his part, Dennis hopped up onto an adjacent couch, leaving a few feet between them. His gaze drifted back over to Anna's lace bound bust again. He had dated a couple of girls so far in his life, but they had been mice like him, and nowhere near as... robust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2013Dennis?\u201d Anna asked politely, returning the mouse's stare. He snapped his eyes up to meet hers with a flush of shame, but hers were smiling as she gestured her controller toward the TV across the room. \u201cYou're not backing out on me, are you? Wouldn't blame you for surrendering now, haha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the electric glow of the high definition screen was displaying a character select menu with the text \u201cPlayer 2 press X to Join\u201d flashing expectantly. He swept up his controller, blurting \u201cRight! Yeah, we're definitely still on! Just, ah, taking things in, sorry...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dennis thumbed the joystick to comb through characters, he noticed that Anna had selected Farilya, a long time classic in the series. She was a heavy set, broad shouldered elephant, known for wading through waves of opposing minions to grapple, subdue, and swallow the enemy commander in the early game stages. For himself, he selected Griffin - a nimble, fleet-footed sparrowhawk. He knew he would need the speed to avoid Anna's towering character until he could gather enough buffing tokens to face her with even odds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna's face set into a look of playful concentration as she selected a random map and watched the terrain load in. Her long, cream-and-yellow coated neck extended forward as she focused on placing her initial units. The TV light played across her moon pool eyes as they darted about, commanding the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until he heard the clash of combat, that Dennis realized he hadn't moved an inch from the spawning platform. Forcing his attention to the TV, he began frantically mustering defenses, but he could see that Anna's colossal elephant champion was already moving into his territory. He had given her a huge lead, made worse by the rushing play style she had selected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, she had reduced the majority of his rallying points to rubble and was now chasing his Griffin across the final areas of the map has he desperately tried to counter her advance. \u201cOh, looks like Mr. Expert Mouse Boy is gonna take a licking after all!\u201d Anna croned teasingly as she began closing the gap between their characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis chewed his lip with frustration at his own blundering performance is he made a last ditch effort to throw a punch or two at Farilya's immense frame. Anna's character brushed off the attack as if it had been nothing, before launching her elephant trunk forward to snatch Griffin off of the ground. Dennis was forced to watch as his character's health bar was squeezed into oblivion before Farilya hoisted the defeated bird avatar over her head, mouth open wide to receive her prize. The screen faded to black before the penultimate victory and a page appeared, displaying the horrendously one-sided match statistics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did we call it, ten bucks? Looks like you owe me a pizza.\u201d Anna chuckled good-naturedly. \u201cI'm still bummed they decided to censor the victory animations. Would\u2019ve been fun too gloat for an extra moment while you got gobbled up.\u201d She was grinning at Dennis, clearly pleased that she had come out on top so easily. \u201cGotta say though, for the first couple of seconds there you were seriously off in la la land. Something on your mind?\u201d The wry smirk was back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis floundered, dually embarrassed by his underwhelming performance and the fact that his poor start had been noticed. \u201cI was just, ah, my controller you know, and I was\u2013\u201d he fumbled for an excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2013Staring?\u201d Anna had an eyebrow raised in mock reproachfulness, but her lips were curled in smile. \u201cLighten up, haha. I'll take it as a compliment. My fault anyway, should\u2019ve warned you before I stripped down earlier.\u201d She turned back to the TV remote and pressed a few buttons, switching it over to a gaming commentary program before she lowered the volume. \u201cIt's been awhile since I've had someone look at me like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis had almost stammered a reply when she turned her hips to get up out of the recliner again, and he could swear she was putting on a show. He watched in side profile as she arched her back and stretched her arms toward the ceiling, displaying every curve and dimple in the flickering electric light, \u201cYaaaaawn\u2026 Think I'm gonna have to hit the hay though. You're welcome\u2013\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Anna gave a lazy smirk and a sway of her hips as she observed her new roommate squirm and stammer in his seat in response to her offer. Dennis tried to recompose himself, but his emotions were too high strung. The mouse had just been offered a chance to sleep with a big, cuddly, fat predator, and he was understandably flustered by it. \"U-Uhm...\" He finally managed to sputter out from incomprehensible strings of gibberish. \"That's a-a very generous offer, Anna, but...why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe predator giraffe smiled contently, impassively rubbing her soft, naked gut as she walked towards Dennis on her couch. \"Because I can see the hard on you have for me through your shorts~\" she giggled cutely. The mouse's eyes widened as dread took hold of his mind, and he looked down to his crotch to see that he had developed an erection unconsciously. He grabbed a nearby pillow to cover it up, but the giraffe gently pried it away from his grasp. \"Daww, sweetie, there's no reason to be shy about it! Honestly, I'm flattered that you think I'm worthy of all that...attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Anna's turn to blush as she slowly bent down to grab Dennis by his sides and lift him up into the air. What an adorable mousey boy she had in her grasp, blushing and squirming and squeaking that cute little squeak mice were known for! \"You've been my only friend in the whole world, you know. It doesn't feel like we're two strangers that just met.\" The fat giraffe hugged him into bulging bosom, and against his will he found himself wrapping his arms around as much as the tit flesh as he could. \"It feels like...like we're meant for each other. You've been a great online buddy, Dennis...but don't you want to be more than that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis was shaking and shivering in excitement as he looked up to Anna's face from in between the valley of her spotted cleavage. This was all happening so fast!...and yet, he had to agree, it didn't feel like they were strangers. If anything, it felt like they were best friends who had only gotten to meet in person until now. Her pudgy fingers rubbed his back in a soothing manner, making him squeal softly. \"Mhmm...yeah, I think I do...\" he yawned tiredly. He wasn't so sleepy a moment ago, but the predator zapped out his energy with her warm, plush hug. \"Are you still offering that king sized bed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna cooed as her heart swelled with love. Overcome with emotion, she leaned her long neck down to Plant a big kiss onto Dennis's lips. The mouse's eyes widened but relaxed as he leaned himself into the kiss in return. She began to walk away from the living room toward her bedroom. She didn't know what would happen inside, but she had a very good feeling that whatever did, it would be beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis almost whined in protest as Anna's thick lips were removed from his. The giraffe settled her mouse down onto her king sized bed, sitting down her generous rump next to him not too long after. She leaned back onto the comfy frame and wrapped a pudgy arm around her roommate's waist. \"You don't look so comfy...let me help you with that~\" Dennis gasped as he felt the predator pull down his shorts, while another hand ripped off his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're, you look so much more free without those clothes on.\" Anna cooed as Dennis finished off the job by taking off his own boxers. His erection was in full view now, but it didn't need too much attention...for now. \"Ah...mind helping me out of mine?\" She shook her prodigious breasts in front of his face, those blubbery, golden spheres of pure softness...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis blinked and his paws were on her bra strap. He nervously looked up to Anna's face for confirmation if he should keep going, received it, and undid the giraffe's bra. The massive orbs seemed to grow even fatter as they were freed from their lacy prison, smothering the mouse's face with such heat and comfort. He let out another yawn, her body was like a temperature controlled water bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't go sleeping on me yet, sweetie~\" Anna cooed as she gently nudged Dennis awake. \"You're forgetting the last piece...\" she turned around to lay on her tummy, showing off her big bottom to Dennis's face. She tugged at one of her fat folds to reveal her black panties in need of taking off, and a wide smile formed on her roommate. He took hold of the thin fabric and began to shimmy it down her impossibly thick thighs and cheeks, feeling every inch of her fatty flesh. She kicked off the piece of clothing when it was down to her ankles, leaving the two of them totally naked on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's to do?</span></div></div>",

Anna crossed her arms in front of her, squeezing her chest forward as a makeshift pillow and let her eyes drift closed contentedly. Dennis, still seated up right after disrobing his towering roommate\u2013<i>or whatever we are now</i>\u2013simply let his eyes roam over her body, appreciating the curvature of her thighs and hips, the gentle swaying of her tufted tail, the way her sandy blonde hair splayed over her back like so many strands of silk\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna had been right. For all the years of reclusiveness and zombie-like work routines, Dennis had never felt so invigorated. He reached out a hand and ran it across the smooth arch of her calf, eliciting a quiet, happy sigh from her. \u201c...I'm glad I met you, 'Valkryie\u2019.\u201d He said simply, letting the truth of it fill his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou too, Mr. Hundred Fates...\u201d He could hear the smile in her somnolent voice, \u201c...for all the paths you might've taken, did you think you\u2019d end up here?\u201d She rolled sideways slightly, turning her had to look back at him from across the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouse boy grinned at the cheesy line, but his heart might as well've bloomed out of his chest, \u201cNo place I'd rather be.\u201d He crawled forward down to the foot of the bed where Anna lay, and draped his head across her outstretched arm. \u201cI've never just...clicked with someone like this before, you know? I'm not sure how to handle it, but this feels great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna's broad grin was reflected in the deep pools of her eyes. \u201cDon't then.\u201d Seeing the confusion on Dennis\u2019 face she added, \u201cDon\u2019t 'handle it\u2019, I mean. Just...let it happen.\u201d She leaned in, shifting her neck over top of him so that her hair fell down around her ears and face like a golden curtain. Their lips met again, and she felt a flush of heat in her cheeks as she slipped her snake-like tongue into Dennis\u2019 mouth. He shied away for just a moment, then cradled his hands on her cheeks and pulled his face up to meet hers again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the warmth of Anna's pillowy body partially laid over his side and his lips locked on hers, heaven didn't seem like an adequate description to Dennis. A couple scant hours ago, he had been standing on a Zinnian curbside with a pile of suitcases and boxes, wondering what he was getting himself into. Now, he was...he was more alive than he had ever felt before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna placed a hand on his chest, spreading her fingers through the carpet of hair before she traced her palm down to his midriff, circling his bellybutton. She giggled through their kiss as he squirmed ticklishly beneath her, before retreating her hand upward to stroke through the mousey-white ragamuffin mop on his head. Breaking from the kiss, she stared at his face for a moment, taking in every detail of his whiskers, his pinkish nose. <i>He is cute,</i> she admitted to herself, and laid her head down on his chest, curling sideways over him...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Was it wrong for everything to be going so fast between the two of them? From an outsider's perspective, it could have been seen that way, but for Anna and Dennis, it felt totally natural. Anything less than the way the mouse and the giraffe were now wouldn't be enough to describe themselves. The predator of the duo understood this and was eager to take their relationship even further. With a mischievous smirk, she began to shimmy her body down along the bed, her head sliding from her roommate's chest to his naked crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis blushed and gasped as he realized what was happening, but didn't stop Anna from doing it. He was shocked and surprised, but ultimately happy that the giraffe thought that it was impressive enough to warrant attention. She gave the pink shaft an affectionate nuzzle before opening her maw wide enough for the rod to go in. The mouse\u2019s eyes rolled back into his head in pleasure as his erection was coated in slimy, warm saliva, her fat organ squeezing and sucking down in all of the right places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna moaned as she feasted away on Dennis\u2019s member. She was a predator, and she eats random prey in Zinnia City on a daily basis, yet it has been a very long time since she\u2019s been able to have one like this. The mouse had the kind of flavor that was advantageous to his weak position in the world; totally unique and utterly delicious, the kind that you can\u2019t find from the pickings of the random crowd. Prey like Dennis don't get eaten, they get kept around as snacks to savor on from time to time like a lollipop. Anna returned from her musings when she realized that her lollipop was reaching its creamy center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Dennis was on cloud nine. He had never felt such ecstasy before, such a rush of endorphins through his veins. He couldn't remember a time when he had gotten so hot and bothered so fast, nor could he think of anything more pleasurable. Precum began to leak out from the tip of his rod, a rather large amount for someone his size, as Anna noted. She guzzled the stuff down with ease, knowing that the main course was soon to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a high pitched squeak, Dennis bucked both of his hips as he reached his climax, flooding his new rooma...girlfriend's maw as she eagerly swallowed the creamy essence with a hunger that had long been left unsatisfied. The torrent lasted for around a solid minute before finnaly dying down, leaving the rodent splayed across Anna\u2019s bed in a goofy high, devoid of any energy and stamina. He was only awake because he wanted to enjoy the last bit of joy go through his blood before sleep took hold of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna popped Dennis\u2019s member out of her mouth after making sure it was clean of any leftover sputterings, leaving it smothered in gooey slime. She let out a deep and satisfied yawn, only having enough strength in her system to shimmy back on top of the mouse so that she may plop down and smother him under her mass. The rodent squeaked as his girlfriend\u2019s pillowy body enveloped his own, her golden cleavage smooshing into his head and only leaving a little space for air to breath through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you, Dennis\u2026\u201d Anna gave out one last yawn before planting a loving smooch on Dennis\u2019s muzzle. With a smile, she rested her head down on her own breasts, pushing them even further into the mouse\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...love you too Anna\u2026\u201d Dennis closed his eyes and drifted off into dreamland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis blinked his eyes open as the last dredges of sleep exited his body. That had to have been the best sleep that he had ever had! He felt invigorated and refreshed...what happened last night? Than the memories came flooding back in and a smile crept up to his face. He stretched his arms out over his head and gave a deep yawn, noticing that Anna\u2019s soft frame was no longer acting as his blanket. He looked around to see that he had been placed on the living room couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, my sleeping beauty~\u201d Dennis heard Anna coo from behind him. She strolled into his field of view carrying a plate of eggs and waffles. She sat the plate down on the coffee table, and than her butt on the couch next to him. \u201cI thought making you breakfast was the least I could do after last night.\u201d She leaned down and gave her mousey a lick kiss on the cheek, making him blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, thank you, Anna!\u201d Dennis nodded, eagerly grabbing the plate to dig in to the food. After eating take out food and microwaveables for so long, having real, home cooked food in his system was just what the doctor ordered. But than he noticed that they're was only one plate. \u201cOh, did you already eat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna gave a light chuckle and patted her stomach, eliciting a ominous yet enticing growl. \u201cNope, you don\u2019t think I got this big from eggs and waffles, do ya?\u201d Just than, there was a series of knocks rapping on the front door of the apartment. \u201cAh, they're my breakfast!\u201d She got up from her seat on the sofa, leaving Dennis missing the soft warmth she provided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis smiled as he bit into his food, staring at Anna\u2019s beautiful backside as she went to answer the door. He no longer felt guilty about stealing glances at her pudy body, something that his slowly stiffening erection could attest to. The giraffe had taken the liberty of putting back on his boxers for him, and she was back to wearing her skimpy bra and panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna fished out a roll of dollars from her cleavage and handed some of it to the person in the doorway. He thought he felt something last night! A few words were spoken, and the giraffe stepped aside to let the person in, but Dennis wasn't prepared for what he saw. It was a mouse like him, with only a few differences between them. He had brown fur and a tuft a blond hair like Anna, dressed up in nothing but a black, spandex speedo. He seemed nervous, but at the same time happy with a soft grin on his mug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna gently laid a hand on the other mouse\u2019s shoulder and guided her into the middle of main room. She noticed the confused expression on Dennis\u2019s face and gave her boyfriend a sympathetic, but still mischievous smirk. \u201cI\u2019m guessing that this is your first time dealing with the \u2018delivery service\u2019, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis froze up, slowly understanding what was happening as he gave an audible gulp. \u201c...y-yeah\u2026\u201d He relented softly. \u201cI\u2019m s-still a bit new to ZC. I know that you\u2019re a predator and all, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t get all scared of me now.\u201d Anna comforted, massaging the other mouse;s shoulder and pressing the back of his head into her creamy, smooth wall of fatty flesh. \u201cYou\u2019re more than just a snack to me, Dennis. Besides, this little guy right here volunteered for this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis dropped his jaw at this reveal, looking incredulously at the other mouse in question. Their eyes locked with each other, the other mouse pulling away and rubbing his arm shyly as a blush rose to his cheeks. \u201cSee? You have to pay extra for willing prey, but i find that it\u2019s worth it. They always go down the easiest~\u201d The other mouse went wide eyed as his predator mashed his head deeper into the crater of her belly, her soft fat smooshing and cradling his senses. \u201cFeel all that plush, little one? You\u2019ll be adding to that soon. Just relax and let me take you away\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna closed her eyes as she lifted up the mouse from his perch on her belly, sliding his form towards her drooling, open maw. Dennis felt...confused. This wasn't the first time he had seen a predator eat a prey like him, but he wasn't scared this time. The other mouse was practically giddy that he was meeting his fate in this way! He softly squeaked as slimy drool fell down onto his fur, his head mashed up against her spotted breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Dennis thought that Anna was kissing the other mouse, feeling a pang of jealousy rush through him. It didn't last long, as soon her lips slowly ran over the rest of his face, enveloping his head into her mouth. His limbs twitched as he must have realized he had passed the point of no return, but they didn't offer any resistance. He really wanted this\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis felt his erection stiffen against his will as he saw the scene play out. He felt disgusted, terrified, safe, and aroused all at the same time. It was so jarring to see such a macabre act be treated so casually, without any violence or malice. He was watching another one of his kind get eaten...and it was kinda hot.</span></div></div>",

Perfect timing!\" She exclaimed excitedly before lurching back up out of her chair, leaving a deep double impression where her broad cheeks had settled into the cushion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis stared, entranced as the seven foot giraffe girl walked over to the front door and checked the peephole, the sea of plump flesh about her chest, belly, thighs, and rump rippling with every step. She was indeed wearing a pair of black lacy panties to accompany her bra, but her prodigious rear had swallowed them so deeply that they were only barely visible as a strip of fabric around the portions of her waist that weren't covered by rolls of smooth fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlocking the door, she greeted someone standing in the hallway that Dennis couldn't see from his side profile view. Nor was he all that interested at the moment, enraptured as he was by Anna's mountainous, burgeoning curves. He watched as she produced a small roll of cash from her cleavage, passing it to the visitor. There was a smile and a polite thanks, and then something Dennis had not expected to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Anna stepped heavily to the side, a figure no taller than Dennis himself stumbled over the threshold into the apartment. It was a bunny, and a girl by the looks of it\u2013she was dressed in little more than a pair of black cotton panties that pushed her white pom-pom tail up to sit atop a pair of perky cheeks. Her torso was bare, exposing a pair of c-cup white-furred breasts, nipples stiffened slightly against the cold air from the hallway. What concerned Dennis most however, was that her hands were bound behind her back, and a tight wrapping of cloth around her face was muffling what sounded like nervous squeaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna placed a hand on the center of the bunny girl's back and guided her to the middle of the living room. She cast a pitying smile in Dennis' direction, \"I didn't want you to worry that I might snatch you up on your first night here, so I ordered delivery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouse boy froze in place, heart thumping in his chest as he realized what Anna meant. He had never experienced the predator lifestyle firsthand, but they seemed to run Zinnia city so absolutely that there were food delivery services that would bring prey animals directly to your doorstep. The blunt reality collided with him, leaving him stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna's attention had already returned to the little bunny girl however. Stepping forward, she put a hand on the back of the girl's head and pressed her face against the immense wall of cream-colored flesh that was her belly. \"Hear that gurgling, little one? You're just the morsel I've been craving tonight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fluffy tailed rabbit went wide-eyed, casting a pleading look at Dennis as the giraffe predator closed her eyes distractedly, mashing the girl's face deeply into the crater made by her belly button. He couldn't have moved a muscle if he wanted to, however. His survival instincts had kicked in, and his legs were practically twitching with a desire to run, escape, evade... He had seen predators at work before\u2013it was hard to live a life in Zinnia without encountering it regularly\u2013and it terrified him every time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna took the bunny girl by the shoulders and pressed her back a step, craning her cheerful face down to look at her impending meal. \"You seem nervous, little one. I won't ask how you got involved with Delivery, but I hope you can accept what's about to happen.\" With no further warning, the colossal giraffe...</span></div></div>",

Dennis got a last glimpse of her terrified expression as her head disappeared into the giraffe's mouth. Her padded feet scrambled frantically on the carpet, trying to pull her away from the vise grip of Anna's embrace. An advantage to the predator's long neck was that she could squeeze the bunny firmly between her overflowing breasts and still manage to work the struggling bunny deeper into her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis' tail twitched madly as he watched, surprising himself with the unexpected erection that headsprout up in the front of his cargo shorts. He had a kink for vorarephilia, but seeing it in person like this was a world apart from watching safely from his computer desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna's neck was bulging has she claimed the bunny girl's shoulders, her plump lips stretching wider than Dennis would have thought possible to accommodate the width of her prey's body. With a deep <i>glucking</i> the gigantic giraffe began swallowing forcefully. Drool pooled around the edges of her mouth as she slipped the bunny's exposed bust past her lips, moving down to her smooth furred midriff. She released the tight, squeezing hug that had been restraining the girl and moved her hands to the petite bunny's hips. With ease, she raised the bunnies lower half into the air, allowing gravity to aid her descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to contain himself, Dennis had slipped a hand down the front of his shorts and was now gripping himself in deadly fascination, mouth slightly agape as he watched his new roommate go to work. His mind was barely processing the reality of his situation. A scant couple of hours ago he had been standing on a Zinnian curbside with a pile of suitcases in boxes, wondering what he was getting himself into. Now, he was watching as the best friend he had ever made swallowed an entire girl whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBathed in the flickering electric light of the TV, Anna looked to Dennis simultaneously like something out of a horror movie, or a vore fanatic's wet dream. She had hooked her thumbs through the waistband of the bunny's panties, dragging them down over her hips and still squirming legs until they dropped to the floor. Has she worked her mouth over the curvature of the bunny girl's now exposed rump, the lump in her throat there was the girl's head descended past collar bone and disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more moments past as Anna worked the upturned, snow white legs down into her mouth, squeezing and tugging at her breasts all the while as her eyes closed blissfully. When at last she closed her lips over the padded feet, a few strong swallowing motions were all that was needed to complete her prey's descent along her gullet and into her waiting stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing already immensely proportioned, the addition of a bunny girl's squirming body within her belly actually made little impact on her overall figure. Dennis could see the faintest outlines of an occasional hand or footprint pressing outward as the tiny girl struggled, but any fine detail was obscured by layers of smooth fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna's eyes opened as she let out a deep sigh of contentment. Rubbing her hands across her cream belly, she murred, \"...worth the money every time.\" Coming out of her reverie, she turned her head to find Dennis partially slumped against the wall, panting, with his hand down his shorts. She grinned, \"Looks like you enjoyed that as well...\"</span></div></div>",

The bunny girl recoiled slightly, fear and dismay etched on her face, but Anna's hand darted out, grabbing a handful of white hair on her head as the immense giraffe used her other hand to spread her asscheeks apart. Dennis got a last glimpse of the bunny's terrified expression before Anna tugged her sharply into her rear. Her padded feet scrambled frantically on the carpet, trying to pull her away from the vise grip of Anna's embrace, but it was no use. Anna simply released her hold on her rump, and her deep-cushioned cheeks rebounded to engulf the bunny nearly up to her elbows in her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis' tail twitched madly as he watched, surprising himself with the unexpected erection that had sprang up in the front of his cargo shorts. He had a kink for typical vorarephilia, but Anna seemed intent on\u2013<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurely enough, the massive giraffe closed her eyes and gave a contented sigh, closing her eyes, \"I've always liked going this route... So much more-<i>hnngh</i>-sensual.\" Her brow furrowed in concentration, and Dennis watched as the bunny girl's body was lifted\u2013<i>pulled</i> deeper into the crevice between Anna's enormous, spotted asscheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to contain himself, Dennis slipped a hand down the front of his shorts and was now gripping himself in deadly fascination, mouth slightly agape as he watched his new roommate go to work. His mind was barely processing the reality of his situation. A scant couple of hours ago he had been standing on a Zinnian curbside with a pile of suitcases in boxes, wondering what he was getting himself into. Now, he was watching as the best friend he had ever made swallowed an entire girl with her ass...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, steadily, clenched and unclenched her broad backside, squeezing blissfully at her dinner plate nipples the entire time. The poor bunny girl quickly disappeared in two and three inch increments, arms pinned to her sides as she was drawn deeper into the waiting maw of the giraffe's rectum. Her legs kicked frantically, now hoisted fully off the ground as her ascent continued undeterred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis was both horrified and simultaneously enraptured. Cast in the flickering glow of the TV light, Anna looked beautiful. Each curve was accentuated, each dimple and bead of sweat. The room was basically silent, save for her heavy breathing and an occasional muffled, gurgling sound from her bowels as the bunny was consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, only the bunny girl's feet remained visible, wedged tightly between Anna's hemisphere cheeks. Panting with exertion but clearly enjoying herself, Anna reached down and grabbed her lace panties. She pulled them up steadily, and Dennis noted the way her expansive belly was now wobbling slightly, occasionally displaying the faint outline of a handprint as the captive bunny struggled within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her panties rose fully to cover her backside, the bunny girl's feet pushed lightly against the fabric, squirming sporadically. \"Ooh! She kind of-<i>giggle</i>-she kind of tickles back there.\" With a light grunt, she clenched one last time, and the pair of padded footprints disappeared fully. Anna turned her face to look at Dennis, rubbing the rippling surface of her belly, \"...worth the money every time.\" Coming out of her reverie, she noticed that Dennis was partially slumped against the wall, panting, with his hand down the front his shorts where a slight stain had formed. She grinned, \"Looks like you enjoyed that as well...\"</span></div></div>",

The deer had around five dressers worth of clothes just waiting to be used. He could spend his whole life in the family mansion library, and it still wouldn't be enough time to read all of its books. The kitchen was stocked with enough food to feed well over a hundred people. He was good at school, straight A's all across the card. Everything about Michael's life was what every boy his age would dream about living.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo...why was he so depressed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer was simple: Michael was lonely. While the small deer's parents were willing to buy him anything in the entire world, they were rarely ever around, too busy at work to entertain their child. The mansion was a prison. It was certainly a nice one with opulent decorations and good food, but still, at the end of the day, a prison it was. The great house was almost always empty save for him, and at first, he didn't mind. He liked his solitude and even thrived on it for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as time went on, Michael began to come to the painful realization that he was truly alone. He began to feel like a trophy kid, awed by his distant parents and tossed away when no one was around. It began to take a toll on his grades, which is the only time when his parents are ever interested in him. They couldn't have a dumb kid, think of the gossip! They hired a psychiatrist, and another and another, and they all said that he needed more time with his parents...which they just couldn't provide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, they turned to the private sector for help and came across Melanie. She had a great reputation as both a nanny and a tutor, loved kids and was well recommended by the rest of their peers...she just had one blemish. Her hunger. Michael's parents agreed that as long as they kept a well-stocked kitchen as per the norm, the little Fawn would be fine. If not...well, it wasn't too much of a loss, was it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was on Michael's tenth birthday when Melanie came into his life. He was eating a slice of chocolate cake that his parents had sent for him with his breakfast. On the letter, they said that they would have loved to come, but they found the company at the country club to be too good, and that they hoped he would enjoy his birthday present. That last bit caught him off guard, as there was no noticeable present aside from the cake...perhaps they're losing more interest in him than he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the sound of the front door of the great manor being knocked rang out through the halls, catching him by surprise. He instantly hopped down from his seat and began running towards the main foyer of the house. Perhaps his parents were playing a prank on him! Maybe the birthday present this year was them! He was getting his hopes up, and as he opened the heavy, wooden doors...they died out to confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of the entrance to his home was not his two deer parents, but a cow, a very fat and kindly looking cow. She was dressed in a black dress with a white trim that was so tight it left nothing to the imagination, along with a ruffled half-apron, a lace headpiece, and long black and white stockings. A classic french maid. The big bovine looked down at the puzzled fawn and gave a wide smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello there, master Michael!\u201d She greeted with a curtsy before picking him up gently from the ground to bring his smaller body into a hug. The ten-year-old deer was not sure what was going on, but he felt compelled to return the embrace as it would be rude not to. His face was pressed right into her bosom, which her dress could barely contain, making him red underneath his fur. \u201cMy name is Melanie, and I\u2019m your birthday present!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael managed to wiggle his face out of Melanie\u2019s cleavage just enough to take a deep breath of air. \u201cUh...u-um, it\u2019s very nice to meet you, Ms. Melanie, but...what\u2019s going on, exactly?\u201d He tried to compose himself as the nanny cow stared back at him with wide, expressive eyes. He felt like he could have fallen into them if he wasn't careful. \u201cAnd how did you know it was my birthday?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat cow smiled and walked inside the lofty building, shutting the door behind her as she carried Michael in her arms like a baby. \u201cYour parents told me that you were feeling a little lonely, So I\u2019m here to make sure you don't ever have to be alone again! You must have felt so small, living in this big, empty house with no one to share it with.\u201d Melanie made a good effort at making him feel small, too. She leaned her face forward to give rub her snout against his nose. \u201cNo one deserves to be alone on their birthday\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael was let down back into the seat he was just in earlier, where his plate of food was still sitting. How did she know where the kitchen was? Yet, despite how chaotic and sudden his birthday morning was turning out, he was...strangely optimistic for it. The Fawn was eager to have someone to play with, to hang out with after being alone for so long! He looked up with a smile at his new nanny, who was...busy raiding his pantry. \u201cO-oh, that\u2019s alright, Miss Melanie, I\u2019ve already ate, see?\u201d He gestured to his plate of scrambled eggs, but the cow just giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSilly deer, this stuff is for me!\u201d Melanie exclaimed as she hauled out several pre-packaged sweats and foodstuffs her her to chow down on. \u201cThe first thing I always do when I move into a new mansion is taste the kind of food that you rich folk can afford~\" She winked before setting down her feast of purely dessert food on the other side of the kitchen table. Michael barley touched the rest of his food as he witnessed her eat. She was like a black hole, devouring everything down to the last crumb! It was kind of hypnotizing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, however, she was done with her little meal, little in the context that it barely filled her up, but it would do for a while. \"So, what's the first thing you want to do on your special day?\" Michael had planned to just laze about the house all day, but with Melanie, his choices of entertainment had skyrocketed. Michael...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It all began when the former mayor of Zinnia City, a rather cheerful rabbit named Cherry, suddenly disappeared without a trace. The police filed an investigation into the matter, but it turned up fruitless, and she was declared dead in less than a weak. Her second in command, an elephant called Genivive, eagerly took her place the moment it became apparent she never would come back. For years, Zinnia City was a town governed by prey, but ever since Genivive came into power the place has gone under some very drastic changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Genivive, predators were only allowed to eat one prey per day, now they can eat as much as they want and whenever they want, which has led to the current rise on predator obesity. Home invasion for a quick meal used to be a crime that would land preds in prison, now the sentence was a fine and a warning not to do it again. Over the course of the elephant's administration, the town that had once been renowned to be a place where everyone can coexist had become a nightmare for the prey and utopia for the preds. However, no one ever brings up new changes when talking about their mayor. Those that do aren't seen from after that for some reason...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the laws for predators became laxer, the predators ate and ate, and the more they ate the more they grow impossibly huge, both up and out. Their sizes became so incredible that infrastructure had to be expanded to keep up with their growing waistlines. But no one seemed to think that there was a crisis in their city as if it was all normal. And it was normal in a sense, as predators are naturally meant to be big, gluttonous eating machines, but what works in nature and what works in Zinnia City were two very different things. But City Hall was on a rampage of joining the two worlds together, with plans being drawn up and projections calculated and proposals offered, weighed and compared to one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the first floor of City Hall was the office of the mayor, and in that office sat Mayor Genivive. The massive elephant, quite possibly the most massive women in Zinnia City, was sitting back in her reinforced steel desk chair as she watched the season five finale of Samurai Brawlers. She nonchalantly told her mayoral aide, a little prey mouse called Roger, to prepare her an address to the population she would deliver after lunch had finished later in the day. A pro-prey rights activist had disappeared in a similar way that the former mayor had, and she was expected to express her sympathies to their death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zinnia City mourns the loss of...er, what's his face, and there will be a lot of healing in the coming days and weeks...God, I can't stomach this stuff...\" She paused her dictation to grab a full pie of pepperoni pizza from a greasy box, rolling it up in her trunk to shove it into her maw and swallowed it in a gulp. Standing behind to the elephant's side, her aid rigor flinched. The mayor's weight gain had been a sensitive subject in the last few months, having gone from a meager 500 pounds to multiple tons of blubber and lard. She was by far the fattest elected official since the days of the 19th century when political machines solved elections not by the ballot, but by the belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe opposition media really loved to keep bringing the political machines bit up whenever they could, but her title as the mayor countered any body shaming smear campaigns. Being an elected official was a very stressful job, or at least that's what the mayoral duckspeakers quaked out, so it was only natural for her to become more indulgent as she relaxed the same way her other predators did across the city. As well, the average weight of predators in ZC had tripled, so her girth was seen as a symbol of her people, and not some voracious monster. But her re-election was coming up, and the prey majority were getting increasingly fed up with their pred mayor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about the popularity polls.\" Roger, who also acted as Genevive's campaign manager as well to his other duties. \"It's early in the year, we have more than enough time to bring your public image to prey up. I have the draft for a new education bill here, and-\" The mouse was interrupted by the elephant's deep belching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? Oh, yeah, education is important and all, just leave that on my desk and I'll look at it later.\" She grumbled as she poked her still hungry stomach. \"Why don't you go out and get me some more groceries. And, uh, six bags this time, not three.\" Roger sighed as he set the official-looking stack of papers down in her desk before exiting the room. The small mouse was the mayoral 'adviser', a vaguely defined position of title that basically meant glorified pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, it wasn't all bad being the mayor's pet. Everyone knew not to cross him, as he was considered the most important member in Genivive's inner circle. He managed her campaign, looked over all the paperwork, and most importantly kept a steady line of food open to City Hall...both regular and live. Six people were about to go missing today, and he was an expert at luring people back to his workplace. Most of the time it was fellow prey, like himself, but her recent growth in size has opened up new avenues. As it took more and more to keep her sedated, he was relying more and more on getting predators to follow him home. Prey was easier, however, to handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would be on Mayor Genivive's lunch menu today?</span></div></div>",

Since she\u2019s trained to defend anyone, even if her client is obviously guilty, or to prosecute anyone, even if the defendant is blatantly innocent, this Orca Whale is often labeled as a prolific, greedy liar who will find the most vague loophole in the law to get a good verdict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that description couldn\u2019t be any farther from the truth. Contrary to all stereotypes about lawyers, Cecilia is truly sympathetic to the needs of her clients and will do her very best to help them, which are mainly disadvantaged prey trying to get legal action on gluttonous predators.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A young goat boy rushed up to the many stairs and hallways of Cosmos Middle School to the office of the principal, holding a hall pass tightly in his sweaty palms. It was his first day at the new school, and he had just been called to arrive at the Principal\u2019s office through the school PA system. It was probably just to sign some paperwork, but still, he wanted to get it over with as soon as possible so he won\u2019t miss his first class. Peter found the whole place to be so very exciting to his developing mind, with so many interesting people and various species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter had recently moved with his family over the summer from the countryside to Zinnia City, and he was blown away at the sight of the great metropolis. So many different anthros living together in, what he thought was, harmony! He finally arrived at the door of the office, inconveniently placed on the highest floor at the farthest end of the building. He took a deep breath and opened the door. It was a relatively normal sight with only a few windows with quite the view from its position off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two soft looking chairs standing next to each other next to the desk situated at the far end of the room, where a computer on top gently hummed. Adorning the room were several corny motivational posters, giving off the impression that the place was academically comfortable. With no one inside, Peter slid in and closed the door behind him in a timid fashion. He walked up to one of the seat and assumed that one would be his, prompting him to take it. As time passed inside the office he became more and more uncomfortable despite the cheerful atmosphere. The goat had no idea what all of this was about and his mind was starting to jump to conclusions to pass the time. Had he done something wrong and he was here to be reprimanded?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter heard the stories about predators, about anthros just like him that had the ability to swallow others whole and turn them into fat, but he had never seen one. The goat grew up in a town made up of only prey, and when he found out that his principal would be a predator, it all made him feel on edge. On the desk was a nameplate that read out 'MS. IDA'. Good, now he knew her name when she would come in...if she would come in, Minutes passed by in utter silence until finally the crushing silence was broken as the handle of the door turned. The noise was followed by the gentle swinging of it open to reveal an extremely heavy-set, bright pink pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the adolescent goat boy, the look of Ms. Ida was not just strikingly beautiful, she was breathtaking. The first thing to note about her was her height, that being an impressive and staggering 9 and a half feet tall, towering over Peter's form easily. Coupled with her massive height was her massively fat figure. Powerful and long legs supported a rear end that filled her charcoal dress pants to their absolute limit, still remaining steadfast in keeping the jiggling of each and every footfall in place. Directly underneath were her thunder thighs, each one as big if not bigger then his own chest, helping to show off her well-endowed hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pig's rotund gut hung off her waist as she had just swallowed a beach ball, stuffed tight into an ill-fitting, button-down shirt. The pig's belly was so absurdly huge and round that she couldn't fit a single portion of it into her dress pants, but based on the way she carries herself she may not want to. Resting atop that great, heaving gut were two incredibly sized breasts that finished up her matronly build quite nicely, each mass fighting equally hard against their capture against a bra too many sizes too small. Ida stepped into the room with a powerful presence, even as she casually hung her coat on the doorknob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dreadfully sorry that I'm late, deary. I just had a little business to take care of before I could get here.\" She immediately noticed the look of shock and awe on Peter's face and gave the goat a warm smile, \"Oh, yes, the new student! But even if you are new here, young man, you should know it's not polite to stare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter went red in the face as he looked away. \"I-I-I;m sorry, ma'am! It's just that...it's my first time seeing a predator up close, is all...\" It was impossible for him to cover up his nerves in the situation as he listened to Ida walk up behind him, before resting her heavy paws on his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really? Well, I suppose you're not from Zinnia City, then...\" Peter felt a puff of hot air blow across his neck, making him shiver as he felt her get far too close for comfort as she whispered to him. \"...it must be so exciting for you~.\" She stood back up staright and ruffled his fluffy hair before resting her paws on the back of his seat. Somehow, everything she said managed to have an essence of feminine charm that seeped into his head, building a comforting rapport that helped him calm down. Ida lifted herself off from his chair and circled around to his right, gently hip checking his side as she swayed her fat ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big fat pig rested said ass into her seat behind the desk and scooted forward. Her height and belly would, as one would imagine, made it very difficult for one to sit comfortably, with no way too squeeze all that fat underneath. However, she didn't appear to mind that her belly took up 80 percent of her workplace, bending over her soft tummy to type away at her computer with a content smile on her face. \"So, Peter, do you have any idea why I brought you up here for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...no, ma'am, I was kind of hoping you could tell me,\" Peter responded truthfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmhmm~\" Ida turned her gaze away from her computer monitor to give her newest student a lazy, genuine smile that warmed his soul to the very core. \"Well, young man, rest assured you aren't in any trouble if that's the idea you had. No, I called you up here to discuss with you something...important~.\" With that, the goat's heart rate began to pick up as she decisively taps a key on the keyboard before scooting back. She stood up, walking around him, giving him ample room to watch the hypnotic sway of her hips as she came up behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something very...\" The next thing Peter knew Ida's voice was right against his ear as her ever so soft chest pushed up against his back. \"...personal. You see, I have this special little program for lucky little kids coming out from the countryside to visit our fine city, in the efforts of having them...readjust to our style of living. I call it the Principal's Pet Programme.\" With this she grabbed the chair and lifted it up into the air as if it weighed a mere five pounds, delicately putting it to the left side of the room where she could trap the goat with her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter leaned back up against the wall as Ida got closer, her big, soft, fat belly and boobs squishing up against his torso and putting blush on his cheeks. \"Every three years, I pick out a little cutie like yourself to fill the role of such an honor.\" One of her pudgy paws held his face delicately, trying to sooth away any potential fears she may be giving him by gently rubbing his cheek. The other paw possessively fondled the goat's crotch, feeling up the telltale bulge through his acid washed jeans as his pubescent boyhood betrayed him. \"Naww, there's nothing to be ashamed of, sweetie. It just means you like me...and I like you, too.\" She wrapped the hand that fondled his cheek around his neck and slowly pulled him close, nuzzling his hair as she smothered him in her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmh...think about it, Peter. Straight A's in every class, a clean record for your mommy and daddy, and every day, all day, just you and me...\" Ida whispered into his ear, planting a delicate kiss on his forehead. She gave out an amused giggle as her little pet squirmed from the kiss, having no choice but to embrace his principal and nod slowly through her pillow-like cleavage. \"I'll take that as a yes, then...hmmm, welcome to the programme, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was Peter's first act as a pet?</span></div></div>",

Despite the various squirms and spasms, he put out, they weren\u2019t very strong and made no effort of trying to stop the pig\u2019s advances. The goat was not protesting his situation, he was just confused, and the principal was only adding to that as she grinned her belly into the right bulge in his jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIda opened up her grinning maw, her plump tongue sliding out to slurp at Peter\u2019s neck, making him shiver involuntarily. The warm, gooey muscle climbed up to his cheek before she planted a sloppy kiss, leaving a sticky, viscous trail of saliva on his face. All of this was happening too fast for the goat boy, he needed time to slow down and catch his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what are you g-gonna do with me? Wait, I-!\u201d Peter cried out in shock and hidden pleasure as Ida held his form tight and forced her tongue into his mouth for another loving kiss. The pig\u2019s pink muscle sloppily smothered every inch of his maw, leaving him in a state of delirium as she thrust her hips back and forth, making his erection grow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIda\u2019s chubby hands slid down to unbutton his jeans and grope his sensitive rear end, making him twitch and squirm even more. The middle school principal knew that she was overwhelming him, but it was best for her newest pet to get a good feel for what he would through in the next three years sooner rather than later. She gently stroked his throbbing, hard as stone erection and whispered softly in his ear. \u201cMmmmm...do not be scared, Petey, I\u2019m just havin\u2019 a little fun is all. And I think you\u2019re having fun, too~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIda continued to whisper comforting words into the goat\u2019s ears. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, my sweet little treat. Only good things happen to my pets\u2026\u201d She pulled down his boxer briefs next, exposing his cock in full view of the powerful pig. \u201cAnd you have to be the best snack I\u2019ve had in a long time~\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIda played with his balls for a few moments before running her index finger up his member. It was a little in the small side, even for a kid his age, but in her experience, the biggest things come from the smallest packages. The fat pig pulled the goat against her soft belly, his head vanishing in between her monumental bosom as she got to work. It was all going so fast for Peter, one moment he was having a nice conversation with his principal, and now\u2026he wasn't too sure what was happening right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the little goat kid could do was sit and wait as his body was affectionately smothered by her warn plush tummy and boobs. If it wasn't for the stimulation in his crotch, he could have fallen asleep in Ida\u2019s embrace. The pig principal began slowly, wrapping her fingers around the base in a teasing fashion, feeling her pet heat up and sweat. It only excited her more and prompted her to fully grasp his shaft, sliding it up and down tantalizingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIda soon began to speed up, pumping Peter\u2019s shaft in a relaxed rhythm. On instinct, the goat began to buck his legs as his climax was met. Thick strands of virgin cum splattered onto the principal\u2019s lap and desk, making quite the mess for such a normally reserved and tidy boy. The pig smiled and held his twitching body tight, resting her flabby chin on his head as she cooed and purred. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Peter, you did very, very well. Such a good, little boy...such a sweet, little treat~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIda planted one last kiss on Peter\u2019s head, still smothered in her soft breasts, before he began to pass out from exhaustion. There was no more energy left in his body that wasn't spent on his squirms, and his principal provided the softest bed in existence. He whined and whimpered as his twitching cock slowly returned to normal size as he was hugged and snuggled into the best sleep he ever had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter has had his fair share of good nights well slept in his past, but he was convinced that this had to have been his best sleep ever. He was awake, but his eyes refused to open, as the sheet comfort of his surroundings were too good to voluntarily push away from. The goat had no idea what his parents had done with his bed, but he certainly wasn't missing his old one. His whole body was surrounded in plush warmth, soft enough that he sunk heavily into the mattress, with just the finish but of firmness for him to stay afloat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there were the pillows he was resting his head in, the best pillows that Peter had ever felt! Usually, he only had one in his bed, but for some reason, there were two tonight. However, the soothing softness of the situation pushed out any efforts of mental recollection. The pillows were just as warn as the mattress and cradled the goat\u2019s head in just the right way to ensure maximum comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter couldn\u2019t help but get himself deeper into his bed, wrapping his arms around as much of the frame as possible. He hugged and nuzzled his head further into the canyon of pillows, letting out a sigh of pleasure. From below he heard the mattress give out a giggle in response to all his moving about...wait a minute, beds don\u2019t give out giggles. The goat opened his eyes wide as his brain began to work again, staring right into principal Ida\u2019s gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you sleep well, my Prince Charming?\u201d Ida batted her eyes at the goat, and before he could make the chance to flea she wrapped her pudgy arms around his body, anticipating his movements. \u201cSorry if I was little...forcefull, earlier, but think of it as a rundown for how your middle school experience will pan out. I hope you aren't too cross with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the memories of what had transpired earlier in the day came flooding back into Peter's head, and a deep red blush quickly rose to his cheeks. \"Uh...n-no, Principal Ida, I'm...I think I kind of liked it...\" The goat gave out a flustered smile as he relented his personal feelings to his principal. He still was not sure what exactly the pig had done with him, but...in a way, he almost wanted to go back in time so he could go through the experience again. \"Um, wh-where are we, right now?\" He asked tentatively, looking around his surroundings and not recognizing them at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're in the teacher's lounge. I thought I would bring you down here so you may get better acquainted with your teachers. Since you slept through most of the school day, there won't be enough time for you to meet them in the...traditional manner.\" She purred, giving her pet one last loving kiss before peeling Peter's body off from her. \"Now, be a good student and say hello!\" She gestured behind him, where, to his shock, all of his teachers were present! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter's teacher were...</div> </span></div></div>",

The movie actress's real name is actually Aralia, but after her hit role in the film 'Madagascar', her fans kept often referring to her as the character she played, and has since taken it to heart. She's the one to get caught up in the excitement of the moment, and like a true entertainer she wants everyone around her to feel the same way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went on and Gloria's popularity soared, her fans had noticed that her weight had too. It's an open secret that their favorite star is a predator, what with all the missing actors on set and her ever expanding body, but no one seemed to care too much. No one else in the movie industry is as generous with her time and energy as she is, but lately she's been feeling a little exhausted from the spotlight. To liven her up, the studio execs have put together a contest for her favorite fan to come and visit her, which always puts the hippo in a happy mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou won the contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Shenzi<br>\r\nAge: 40<br>\r\nSpecies: Hyena<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiography: The Queen of Zinnia City's criminal underworld that rules with an Iron Paw, always scheming to take on more territory and more affluence whilst never loosing her composure. Sassy and playful, yet slow to anger, Shenzi moved up the ranks of the criminal empire thanks to her crafty intellect and competent leadership. While she may be viscous with a cruel sense of humor, those who are loyal to her can find a soft spot underneath her hardened mask, and she limits how much damage her underlings can actually do to the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Shenzi has gained quite the reputation for her tendency to eat her criminal rivals, which has resulted in a record pummel of ZC's crime rate, while her weight skyrockets. Thanks to the unofficial truce with the police, her empire has been allowed to flourish, only ever getting trouble from the Flock. It's hard to tell if there's a good person underneath all of that fur and fat, but one thing about her can be said with the most confidence: She's here to stay, and she'll do whatever it takes to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Friedkin<br>\r\nAge: 43<br>\r\nSpecies: Polar Bear<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiography: The Police Chief of Zinnia City doesn't receive as much attention as the mayor or the criminal overlords, but she plays a major role behind the scenes ensuring the citizens feel safe and secure.

Sassy as her criminal 'partner' and having no sense of an indoor voice, she gets just as much loyalty from her cops as Shenzi does from her thugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOften, she works as a drill instructor at the Police Academy, and is a tad infamous for her unorthodox methods for grading the recruits.

He was a quiet young rabbit, never trying to earn anyone's ire or contempt, always striving to be agreeable and inclusive. Despite how courteous and polite he was, aside from his parents, he was truly alone, as there was no one else who could keep up with his relentless intellect. He was imaginative yet decisive, ambitious yet private, amazingly curious, but he does not squander his energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the special occasion, Zachery was dressed up in a white polo shirt and black trousers, suspenders going around his torso and a red bow tie above his chest. He had a mop of messy, blonde hair and a splash of freckles on each side of his creamy cheeks. Born with bad eyesight, he complimented his attire with round-rimmed glasses that helped him see his plush better. He loved the little plush toy, despite knowing that it was a mass of cotton and silk. Seeing that perpetual smug smirk on it.'s muzzle always cheered him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Zachery needed cheering up very badly, as of late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Zachery lit up a very brave front, on the inside he was incredibly afraid. He, along with his parents, had left their old home to move out into Zinnia City for a better life. And they had found a better life, making more money, living in a bigger home, eating better food...but the rabbit had to leave all his friends behind. And he was having a lot of trouble making new ones at his school. To cheer him up, his parents entered his name into a contest to see his favorite actress, Gloria, who he had a bit of a puppy love crush on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't expect him to win, however, it was supposed to be just something that he could hope for. They didn't think that their tween prey son would ever meet up with a fat, hippo predator, regardless of whether they were a famous movie star or not. Nevertheless, he won, and they had dressed him up for the big event, too focused on how happy he was at the prospect of meeting her to properly worry about him getting eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the long limousine came to a slow stop, and the door to his left was opened by the driver. Zachery began to shimmy his way to the open door, but the driver, a kind looking eagle, politely held up his hand and shook his head. \"No no, young man.\" He chuckled with a knowing look in his eyes. \"You're not getting out, She's coming in~\" Blushing and squirming with excitement, the blonde, bespectacled rabbit wiggled back to his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were parked in front of a large mansion, so big it looked like ti could hold five instances of his own home inside with ease. Zachery felt the limo shake slowly, picking up in intensity as time went on before suddenly the front door of the lofty manor was pushed open to reveal...her. His eyes widened at the sight of the icon he had grown up with. She had definitely changed since the showing of that movie all those years ago...but he didn't think he disliked it at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo women climbing down the stairs of her mansion was more than twice his height, dressed up in a flowing, white gown held together by some gilded straps, giving the impression of some sort of Greek Deity. The ground shook underneath her monumental weight, with a stomach so large and so round that it almost doubled as a wrecking ball, the straps struggling to hold the sphere of taut flab. Her cleavage bulged out from her clothes heavily, the beginnings of a few tears peppered here and there on her white silk as it wobbled and giggled. The rabbit had already had a precocious crush on the hippo and seeing her now, so much bigger and fuller put butterflies in Zachary's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria smiled warmly at the little rabbit boy as she clambered into the limousine, the frame tilting to her side despite being built to handle plus sized predators. \"My, they never told me that the contest winner was from heaven, 'cause you look like an angel!\" Zachery blushed bearded under his fur and let out a stifled squeal of joy as the object of his crush was right in front of him. The Hippo smirked and patted the seat next to her. \"What are you doing all the way over there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZachery widened his eyes and eagerly took Gloria up on her offer, wiggling over to her fatty side. He gasped as he felt a heavy weight placed on his shoulders, only to realize that the Hippo had wrapped her arm around him, giving him a little ruffle of the hair. \"So, young man, what's your name?\" She asked as the limousine started up and rolled away from her mansion. The rabbit smiled nervously, his blush never letting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-my name is Zachery, Ms. A-Aralia...\" he stuttered, making sure to properly address her by her real name. \"It's a real h-honor to meet you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria widened her eyes for a split second before regaining her composure to pinch the rabbit's cute cheeks. \"Haha, it's been a long time since anyone has ever called me by my real name. You must be a real fan if you found that out~\" she teased with a wink. \"I prefer Gloria nowadays, but I think Aralia will work just for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, t-thank you!\" He exclaimed. \"So...where are we heading to?\" He asked tentatively, to which the Hippo gave a mischievous smile before responding.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You've always been kind of a loner since you moved to Zinnia City due to a job transfer. Back at your home town you had plenty of friends but that charisma of yours took a nosedive after the move. Mostly due to your fears of predators that you haven't been putting yourself out there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo to push your boundaries you've been trying online dating, and are on your way to where he said he'd be waiting. Of course the meeting spot has set off every shade of red flags in your mind. It's an empty lot at the end of an alleyway, what part of that isn't suspicious! But you swore to yourself to at least attempt to show up, you look down at your phone rereading the text conversation you had with your date. He claimed that he didn't want to eat without you, and the lot was real close to the cafe he wanted to visit. The last text sent was filled with heart emojis, a lizard emoji and a \"See you there Mattie~\" You don't really get the lizard emoji, is that just a reference to you being a gecko? You could also do without the nickname, just Matt was fine<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell Matt'd purposely left late so hopefully his date would get there before him, so he could run if this turned out to be exactly what he thought it was. He turned a corner onto the street the alley was on, as he continued to walk he felt the pit of anxiety in his gut that had pained him since he left his apartment get worse. He kept considering just walking past the alley, and looping around back home. He didn't need to expose himself to mortal danger to get out of his shell did he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind continued on this downward spiral until he reached the alley, stopping in his tracks. Might as well check... right? Mentally screaming at himself to turn around he ducked into the alleyway. The gecko walked quietly, trying to sneak to the lot, he'd take a look and decide what to do from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, slowly and surely he made his way to the end of the alley. Reaching the end he settled behind a trashcan, and peaked over. There was someone sitting in the lot, but it wasn't his date... It was a crow, a crow with a large squirming gut! Matt nearly blew his cover in his panic! He swiftly ducked back behind the trashcan, and pulled his phone out. He, wasn't sure what he was going to do with his phone. He tapped the messaging app and opened his chat, and texted \"omw now, sorry for being a little late.\" and sent. A sound rung out into the quiet lot, and Matt heard the crow speak<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, you got a text. Guess I gotta answer for you, oh? No password needed, nice. Let's see, you were meeting up with this guy here huh? Heh, looks like that lucky lizard dodged a bullet. Nearly fell for it, like Joshy did. Good thing Joshy's quick, otherwise you'd have gotten a meal, and gotten away with it. Okay reply time, Sorry Mattie, something came up and I can't show up. Please don't be mad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBing! The notification sound on your phone rang out, Matt forgot to turn it off! He barely registered what was written on the text and scrambled to try and turn his sound off. He received another text from \"his date\", then another, and another. His stupid phone rang out 5 times before he managed to get it off! Not caring if he'd get seen Matt geared to make a run for it when,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boo!\" The crow was right next to him and spooked the gecko. Matt had shouted in surprise, and fell on his ass. The crow was standing right in front of him, snickering. \"Hehe, so you're the guy I ate's date right?\" Matt mutely nodded. \"Haha! Dude you look so terrified. Chill out, I'm not gonna eat you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt squeaked out \"You're not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, now get up and stop sniveling before you piss your pants.\" Matt did as he was told and rose to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Why did you eat my date?\" Matt asked in a shaky voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, bastard used whatever dating app you used as food delivery and almost got one of my brothers. So really you should be thanking me here, you nearly got ate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thank you... May I ask your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Randal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt swallowed the saliva that had pooled in his mouth, he felt like he should still be terrified. There's still a predator right in front of him with a live meal still fighting in his gut. But instead, Matt felt, weird. He'd never seen a pred with a full belly before. The convulsing mass of black feathers should be a terrifying sight regardless of what the gut's owner has said. Instead though, Matt didn't feel scared. He couldn't really describe the emotions running through him or why he felt that way. All he really knew was, he wanted to be around Randal for awhile longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Randal, I want to thank you, properly so...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Joel looked out of the window of his taxi cab at the houses on the outskirts of Zinnia City Bayou. The beat up homes and the old, abandoned plantations sat in the background, sorrowful remnants of a long-dead era of history. The otter looked back to the seat next to him where his leather messenger bag lied. His laptop was safely stowed away inside, and it was depressingly the most expensive thing he had seen in the last two hours, including the vehicle he was being transported in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel returned his gaze to the outside of the window, the sights only solidifying his depression further. The dark, looming trees and the remnants of a bygone age of prosperity. He had never known that such a place existed so close to ZC, and it was the perfect place to get away from the hustle and bustle of the crowds. The otter had decided to take his vacation here, the dark catacombs of the swamp. He was an up and coming cultural anthropologist, having just his degree from Zinnia City College.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing extensive research on the various societal differences found just in the City alone, Joel made it something of a goal to find out about the lifestyles of various predators. His laptop was his handbook, and his mind was his greatest recording tool of all. The otter's eyes picked up on details that most don't even notice, like how the driver in front of him wasn't used to spend time with the likes of himself. He was a rather gruff, dark-furred skunk wearing overalls and keeping his mouth occupied with a toothpick. \"We uh...don't get too much city folk 'round this far down, boy. What brings ya'?\" He asked with a southern accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm trying to find people to talk to.\" He replied both bluntly and vaguely, ironically not really in the mood for conversation, at least with the skunk. Joel looked down back to his messenger bag's seat, covered in filthy stains. The otter couldn't wait to get out of the taxi cab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Talkin' to people? That seems like a big waste of a trip to come down here from Zinnia. You can find people everywhere!\" The skunk driver replied to Joel with a hearty laugh. Just then, the more mt of the vehicle made a ding. \"Here's yer damn stop, boy,\" he remarked, bringing the taxi cab to a halt. Joel handed him the fee before getting out of the car, slamming the door shut behind him. The otter threw his leather messenger bag over his shoulders as the taxi drove away, leaving him facing a modest, decent enough looking harbor with a fairly small wooden building near an array of rowboats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boats of the harbor laid on the murky, green waters of the Zinnia Bayou, the trees laying past in horizon seeming to go on and on forever. The swamp appeared to Joel as almost neverending, like all swamps. Nevertheless, he was here for a vacation from his work at ZCC, and he intended to make the most of it. The otter walked into the hut and saw three prey gathered around in the corner, huddled around an aging cash register just chatting amongst one another. He looked around the store and didn't see anything that would help him unwind, the store consisting of unkept aisles of fishing equipment and snacks. He walked up to the group, consisting of an elderly mouse, an exhausted rabbit in front of the register, and a lively pidgeon behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, there!\" Joel greeted warmly, waving a paw as he interrupted the idle chatter the trio were having. \"I was wondering if there was anyplace to stay around here.\" The pigeon and the rabbit looked at each other, and then at the otter as if he had just escaped from a mental institute. The mouse shrugged and leaned his elbow down onto the counter, looking the newcomer dead in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Are you...you serious?\" The old looking mouse asked with caution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...yeah, why wouldn't I be?\" Joel responded with another question, starting to feel nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elderly mouse looked at the rabbit and pidgeon, who in turn looked away. \"Well, sir, I take it you ain't from around here. Otherwise, you would have never come down here from ZC. There's a hotel about ten miles north of here if you want a place to stay. I can even pay for a taxi to pick ya' up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...that's too far away, too close to the city!\" Joel exclaimed, throwing up his hands in defense. \"I came down here to get away from all that...that nonsense! Isn't there anyplace around here to stay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old mouse gave out a sigh and shook his head sadly. \"I'll be honest with ya', kid. I used to have a nice little bed and breakfast operating going on around here, but I shuttered that a couple of week ago. The only reason this little hut is still open is because we're on the way from the main road. I sell a nice amount of gasoline and touristy crap. And I'm not about to let some city slicker disappear just because he's a little pent up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...disappear?\" Joel furrowed his brow, suspicion creeping up on him. \"Like what, this place has a ghost story or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cranky looking rabbit impatiently turned his head to face the otter, coming into the conversation. \"It ain't no fucking story, asshole! A cousin of mine rented a boat from this place about two months ago to catch some fish. Two days later, he still didn't come back. Went into the swamp myself, and I only found his boat. I combed the whole bayou for the bastard, and I never saw him again...there's a damn monster in the swamp.\" Joel didn't know what to say, but he saw that the lagomorph meant every word. His knuckles were clenched and his arm twitched every so often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so...your cousin got lost, but that's all it took for everyone to leave?\" Joel asked, not believing that a monster was responsible. Maybe he just got lost, or drowned, but surely not a monster!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" The old mouse shook his head again. \"It took the other six folks to disappear for us to wisen up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six?!\" Joel exclaimed, to which the trio just nodded slowly. \"...no, you know what? There's no such thing as a monster, and I'll prove it! Gimmie a boat and some equipment, and I'll find this monster for you.\" The otter slammed a two hundred dollar bills down on the counter. After seeing the generous amount of green on his counter, coupled with the willing and able city slicker from up north, the old mouse gave out a sigh and turned to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...alright, kid. It's your funeral.\" He said, shaking Joel's paw and putting the money in the cash register. The otter turned around, still tugging on his bag as he walked towards the store exit. Before he did so, however, the shopkeeper called out to him in a lazy droll. \"Don't bother looking for the monster, boy...They'll find you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel gently rowed his boat through the murky waters of the Zinnia Bayou, passing trees and dodging protruding slabs of rock. The otter\u2019s messenger bag was sitting in front of him, clamped shut to make sure no water would destroy his laptop. He wasn\u2019t really paying attention to where he was going, just drifting through the motions of the swamp. Than, he hit something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel\u2019s rowboat made a loud thud as it collided with something, stopping it dead. The otter looked up and saw he had it a very old, wooden dock. But the moment he got on to the dock in question, it became aware to him that it was really more of a porch, a deck to a small hut in the middle of the swamp. \u201cHello?\u201d He called out, wanting to see if there was anyone present in the vicinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old wood beneath his feet began to shake soon after he had made himself known. The heavy, wooden door in front of him on the porch suddenly swung open, revealing the fabled monster of the swamp. Joel looked up to see the grinning mug of quite possibly the biggest and fattest aligator he had ever seen! He was dressed up in an unbuttoned, flannel shirt that left his big, bulging tummy in the open, and a pair of jeans that only came halfway up his big, fat ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowdy there, stranger.\u201d The fat alligator smiled, bringing a scaly hand out to shake the otter\u2019s. \u201cDon\u2019t think I I\u2019ve ever seen you \u2018round these parts. The name\u2019s Clovis, what\u2019s yer\u2019s?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s uh...J-Joel.\u201d The otter stuttered with a bit of a blush. He had always had a thing for guys, especially the ones who were more...healthy, making the interaction with this Clovis incredibly awkward. \u201cSorry, to intrude, I just didn\u2019t think there would be anybody out here, especially with all those stores about a monster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...monster?\u201d Clovis furrows his brow depressingly. \u201cGeez, is that what people are calling me? Not \u2018the man of the Marsh\u2019 or something nice? Man, you eat a few dozen rabbits or so, and people start calling others names.\u201d He patted his big belly absentmindedly, which Joel just noticed has several paw shaped bulges on the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, where are my manners?!\u201d Clovis suddenly wrapped a fat arm around the otters back and scooted his body inside his hut. \u201cAll that rowing must have you starved! Let me get you a bowl of my famous jambalaya, that always warms people up!\u201d Before Joel could protest just the smallest peep, the door behind him was locked shut.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWelcome to Orlando\u2019s!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica has said that lines so many times, it\u2019s just about burned into the front of her brain! Everytime she trotted bravely up to a table dominated by huge, powerful, dangerous predators  She was quite literally the lamb in the wolf\u2019s den, always surrounded by predators giving her slim, fit body hungry eyes and licking their lips as she passes by. All the while, she delivers preys just like her and watches them all be toyed with and gobbled up whole. It was definitely an interesting job she has\u2026 but one person made it all bearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt present, the athletic cheetah was marching another tray over to one of the tables, this time just full of regular food. She was approaching a table that seemed to be taken by a chubby orca man - obviously a predator who\u2019s just gone through their awakening, and is looking to bulk up to be like some of the massive predators he so admired. He had ordered for his waitress to feed his foodstuffs to him individually, as well as provided belly rubs. Often requested by those that came alone, without their own set of friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, hun! I\u2019ve got a scrumptious buffet right here for ya!\u201d She smiled warmly as she walked up, pulling the lid off of the tray and revealing a delicious-smelling array of scrumptious foodstuffs! He licked his lips looking over it all, rubbing his belly as he hoped to get it big enough to fit quite an array of delicious prey! \u201cJust lean back and relax, hun~! I\u2019ll take care of everything~!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he just leaned back with a smile, closing his eye and holding his massive maw open. She happily climbed up and sat on his lap, facing him with a little appetizer in her hand - a big, juicy steak! He cooed as she gently slipped it into his maw, and once it was in, he just swallowed it whole, testing the limits of his throat. She snuggled up to his front, rubbing his belly with her left hand as she grabbed more tasty chunks of meat with the other, letting them slip down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, practice seemed to make perfect\u2026 and he got better and more confident at swallowing every foodstuff she provided, even as they got bigger and bigger. At first, she just enjoyed her job, rubbing his gut as it grow big and round and stuffed with food, as she more quickly started to slide things down his gullet. Eventually, near the end of the buffet, things started to go a little\u2026 south. She had shoved an entire chunk of meat into his mouth, but when she tried to withdraw her hands, they were\u2026 stuck\u2026!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, please, you\u2019ve sort of got a grip on my hands\u2026\u201d She reminds him, feeling her hands get pressed together as they were trapped in the tight embrace of his throat, shivering as he felt just how warm, gross and meaty his slobber was over her hands. Instead of letting her go, though, he only cooed at her flavor\u2026 and his throat started to pull her deeper in\u2026! \u201cS-sir, I must remind you that it\u2019s against the restaurant\u2019s policy to devour the - MPH!\u201d She could barely squeak out a protest before she was pulled headfirst into the orca\u2019s maw!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that he couldn\u2019t help but take in this delicious prey\u2026 either that, or he was planning this from the very beginning. Either way, her voice was completely muffled as he grabbed her sides, restraining her arms as he started to swallow her more and more, her small, perky breasts soon sliding into the tight embrace of his stretchy, slobbery maw. Plus, they were in the corner of the restaurant on an off day, so it was unlikely that anybody would even notice! The cheetah girl whimpered, worried this might be it after all\u2026!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she was reduced to a pair of kicking legs dangling from the orca\u2019s maw, about to slip into his stomach where rescue would be impossible. She just about made peace with her fate\u2026 until suddenly, she felt a hand grab her by the leg! In one easy, swift moment, she was dragged from the miserably tight, warm, dark confines of the orca man\u2019s body, back out in the cool, bright fresh air. She blinked, her eyes adjusting to the light\u2026 only to see Orlando holding her up by her ankle, before gently placing her onto the other booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you read the rules, bud? It explicitly says\u2026 no eating staff members!\u201d Orlando chides the orca\u2026 and before the customer had any chance to explain himself, the coyote grabbed him by his sides, and lifted him up off the seat. Before he could so much as let out a yelp, the chubby orca was being shoved down the massive, pudgy coyote\u2019s throat while the cheetah girl watched in awe, every gulp taking in a huge portion of the orca\u2019s body until, at last, he had disappeared completely into a massive, round belly for the already fat canine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a long belch, before turning back to Jessica with a look of satisfaction on his face. \u201cSorry about that, Jess. I guess we really need to vet these customers more carefully\u2026\u201d He sighs. He always had the cutest look on his face, with those bags under his eyes contrasted with his warm, if lazy, smile, constantly giving the impression of someone who\u2019s tired but cheerful, and most of all, genuine and cuddly. \u201cC\u2019mon, you could use a break. Let\u2019s get you cleaned up, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, trying to hide her blush, as she looked down at her fur. She was soaked in that orca\u2019s disgusting slobber, and smelled terrible! She really did need to wash off. So, sure enough, she followed the massive, pudgy coyote back towards the break room, trying not to stare at that huge, round butt as it swayed behind him. Once they were there, Orlando passed her a towel, and she started to dry the slobber off her fur. Deep down, though, what she really wanted was to hang out with the big, cute coyote man who ran their little restaurant, who she\u2019d always been a bit too flustered to talk to much...</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s late and I always hear of cases of predation from larger Predators in regards to prey of my stature, I\u2019m a pretty small red fox. but despite all that, I keep finding myself here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus rolls up and I get on, it\u2019s kinda full, everyone else is rather large. Most pay me no attention, the most I get is a quick stare, and I recognize a few regulars. I go to the back and there\u2019s an empty seat so I take it. I have to kinda hop on and scoot my way over to the window seat. It\u2019s a little high up but I can see out the window. The next two stops are empty but the third has quite a bit of people. I notice one person in particular, in front of everyone is a huge lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean the other predators are pretty big compared to me but this lion is massive. He\u2019s got a large and arms chest, and a big belly. Seems like he works out, but also enjoys his food. Just looking at him has got me flustered. When the bus stops, he\u2019s the first one on, meaning he\u2019s the first to get to the last empty seat which is right next to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else floods in filling the bus to capacity with people standing anywhere they can. The lions on his phone and doesn\u2019t notice me, he plops down next to me, giving me little space to myself and he leans back a little, slouching sorta, which basically puts his belly on full display. He places a hand on his belly, still using the other for his phone, and taps his belly one finger at a time quickly in succession. I continue to stare and his belly growls which finally breaks his attention away from his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe first lifts his hand off, and then gives his belly a quick pat, then a rub. This is when he notices me staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sorry didn\u2019t leave you much space did I?\u201d <br>\r\nHe says it kinda smugly.<br>\r\n\u201cUh, it\u2019s fine\u201d<br>\r\nI say quickly and it\u2019s the truth, I kinda like it.<br>\r\n\u201cCool\u201d<br>\r\nHe puts phone away and his belly growls again. I quickly look at it. He chuckles and rubs it, keeping his eyes on me.<br>\r\n\u201cI was actually on my way to get some food\u201d<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know what comes over me but I feel compelled to touch his belly, so I do.<br>\r\n\u201cYou sound pretty hungry\u201d<br>\r\nI say as I rub the top of his belly. I look up at him and he seems taken aback. I quickly pull my paw a back<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sorry, I just-\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cLike i said, I was just on my way to eat\u201d<br>\r\nhe puts his arm around me and his massive paw scoops me up and pulls me close to his body.

Having extensive mechanical augmentations, he can gain and compute a lot of biological information by tasting people, having sex with them, and of course, \u2018processing\u2019 their tissues in his powerful stomach.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Another hunt, another coin to add to your wealth, and another head will roll afterwards. That was always the first thing you thought about when you went through the bounties on the board. While bounty hunting was dangerous, the reward made up for it, the lowest you ever seen being over a hundred grand. The bounties ranged from escaped convicts to people that tried to skip out on their debts, but the really juicy ones were the ones that had you chase after predators, your favorite being feral preds. Predators were common in society as it ignored whose species were better and treated everyone as food equally, even among other predators. But the feral ones were the most dangerous, as they weren't feral folk that looked like regular animals, but were predators that devolved to mindless beasts that would devour anything that moved. One couldn't reason with them and they had no choice but to flee, hoping they would not be on the menu.<br>\r\nIt was quite amazing that a hamster of your size would be able to take down three of them and one that around four feet tall. You've been a bounty hunter for a couple of decades and because of your greed and you moving around, you're still single. But then again, being a bounty hunter has its dangers of you dying and death is usually around the corner. Going through a bunch of bounties, you notice one and take it down.<br>\r\nYour face splits into a grin as you had a bounty for a feral pred wolf, in both senses. Unlike the other ferals you took down or saw, this one had a cybernetic eye and a few mechanical parts here and there. Reading into the description of the target, Paris the wolf held an unbelievable amount of eaten under his belt, that your eyes bulged out at the number. But the amount offered for his arrest soon brings back your confidence and a week later, you were searching for Paris's whereabouts in a desert he was last seen. However, after a few days, you were annoyed at your lack of success.<br>\r\n\"Where the hell is that bloody mutt?!\" You mutter under your breath and you continue on until night fell.<br>\r\nWith no sign of a building to stay at and uncertain of who may come your way, you made your way to some massive boulders and prepared to sleep lightly. It didn't take much for you to fall asleep, as your head hit the pillow and your body sinks into the furry gray boulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Da fuck!\" You shouted, scrambling as far as you can from the 'boulder' and eye it widely.<br>\r\nWhile it looked like a massively long rock, at the end of it, after a good look, it was an impressively massive and very well rounded rump. That said rump soon gets up and its owner was staring at you in curiosity. It was undoubtedly Paris, however, your information failed to mention he was far bigger than the usual wolf. You'll even bet with your life that he was twice as big as an elephant. Speaking of big, his gut hung a couple inches from the ground, a feat that's amazing for his size and a horror at the number of lives he has eaten. However, the information about him being cybernetically augmented seemed to be true, as his right eye was a visor, his left fore leg a limb of machine, an ear replaced by a satellite dish and patches of him having a metallic part welded into his flesh.<br>\r\n\"Didn't expect to conduct an experiment tonight. Better wait for the morning,\" he said before he tried to go back to sleep, you in disbelief at what he said, rather than that, hear him talk.<br>\r\nWasn't he a feral? But if he wasn't, then why would he devour so many lives then?<br>\r\n\"W-wait for just a minute here! I get predators have their thing, but you're just eating everything in sight like a mindless beast!\" You shouted, confusion not fully gone.<br>\r\nParis turns back to you and sighs loudly.<br>\r\n\"It's late and I would like to sleep, but to answer your question, it's for science.\" \"Science?\" You asked dumbly, but anger starts to rise up.<br>\r\n\"Yes, science! It's how we, as a society has grown. The E=mc equation was discovered by Einstego and Marie Ant, on her radiation research. Those two and many more scientists had contributed to our growth of a civilization. Without science, we would still be doing work that can be easily done with science!\" He said frantically, panting heavily.<br>\r\n\"You are sciencing what exactly?\" You ask, your anger and confusion gone, but a dread enters you.<br>\r\n\"I can't reveal all my secrets to you, especially a stranger~. Anyways, to ensure my research goes well, I have to taste, fuck, and then 'process' everyone so I can get the results I need. Of course, I need equipment and I can't lug it all around with me, since so many 'disapprove' of my methods, so I altered myself through machinery. Thanks to this, I've gained the ability to absorb the biological information of people through oral consumption and mating, 'processing' them into gut filler. I've also have a few abilties as well,\" Paris explains, switching his size, anthro and feral forms, and gender.<br>\r\n\"But, honestly, I prefer this form,\" Paris replies, coming back to the same form you found him in.<br>\r\n\"You're insane!\" You answer back and Paris chuckles at this before his fat stomach visually rumbles violently.<br>\r\n\"Um, can I ask you for a favor? My stomach has been acting up like crazy and it somewhat hurts,\" he asks sheepishly, his tail waggling behind and creating a mini gust.<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" you sigh, the bounty no longer enticing you to continue in hunting him.<br>\r\nWhat is his problem?</span></div></div>",

Of course. My experiments have the convenience to double as food to maintain my body's faculties. If I stop experimenting, I shall starve... Hmm, it is most distracting, as well.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You shake your head.

As excepted, it was pathetically easy for Paris to outrun you. However, his hunger proved to be taxing him more than he realized.

Had you not done so, I likely would not have realized it. Chance alone would have dictated my survival. Secondly, I make my home in this desert.

Though, you hadn't had to deal with the scientist's stomach for all too long. Through a combination of Paris's size (and speed) and your knowledge of the local area, the larger-than-elephantine wolf managed to find himself a test subject rather quickly. What proved difficult was getting you out. He managed it, of course, but both you and Paris learned that Paris <i>really</i> did not like having to cough stuff up.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 But that was several months ago. Since then, things have been rather pleasant, <br>\r\neven if Paris still had yet to tell you what he was researching. True to your word, you began to act as Paris's assistant and, much to your pleasure, you found that you could also continue your bounty hunting. So long as you made sure to bring something back to prove the target was dead, you could claim the bounties. As for what happened to your targets... Sometimes, you took care of it. Other times, you were able to be both a bounty hunter and research assistant by getting your target to follow you to Paris. And then there were those two targets where you got Paris to go to them. Now <b>that</b> had been a sight to see.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Paris himself was just as strange as always. He was somewhat blunt and had a tendency to sound like he was ordering a servant when he was telling you to do something. That being said, he sometimes seemed to have something resembling an interest in your current state. When you mentioned sleep at one point, he show you a little place (it was literally just somewhere to sleep when he felt like it) that he off-handedly mentioned you could use, should you require it. It was now home to a small garden (courtesy of Paris) that would eventually provide a small harvest. Small, but it would be enough for a singular herbivore like yourself.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 However, things have been a bit different these past couple days. You have been bedridden due to a rather nasty illness. It was something like the flu, but it certainly felt worse. Paris himself has been busy doing... something? He'd been in and out, working on whatever it was that peeked his fancy. At least, that's what you assumed until yesterday. Yesterday, you overheard Paris muttering to himself. Something about it not being right or something (or someone) not dying on him. Or course, you could easy figure out who Paris had been talking about. It also explains your current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Paris (currently in a relatively you-sized anthro form) presses a cup into your hand-paw, \"Drink this.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You give it a sniff. It smelled like chemicals and just a hint of mint, \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Medicine. It should cure you, given a couple days of rest. It also includes an agent that encourages sleep. You've been restless and having trouble sleeping since this started.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Will it work?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"I'm 95% certain of it,\" Paris replies, not unlike he normally does.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You shake your head and down the liquid, wincing at its flavor, \"Mmm, tasty... You know, Paris. Keep stuff like this up and you might just convince me that you care about me.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It didn't take long for Paris's medicine to take effect and for you to pass out. After assuring himself that, yes, you are asleep, Paris looks you over, thinking. He sighs, \"I care about you? To be honest, I should have just been done with you months ago. Would have advanced my research and you wouldn't be distracting me from said research. But... Your wit. Dry humor. The fact that, when I let you go, you kept your word and didn't just vanish on me. You aren't even bothered about being near me in my preferred form anymore. So, do I care about you?\" He paused, then chuckled to himself, </span></div></div>",

No need to disturb his rest.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 After a moment, you notice something. You felt better. Not by much, of course.

You're not entirely sure how to respond to Paris's admittance. On one paw, it was certainly for a good purpose. Being able to eat people, but they'd be able to come back. On the other paw... just how many people would Paris have to eat for his research to come to fruition. If it ever did. Would you be among that number, eventually? He always does seem to put his research first...</span></div></div>",

Though not at the three goddamn coyote after you. You are pissed at yourself for fall for their trap.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Shoving past a fox and her daughter,  you mutter to yourself, \"This is fucking why I only take police-offered bounties. Half the fucking civilian bounties are fucking fake. But nooo! Had to take the fucking vigilante fucking detective one.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The object of your current frustration was rather simple. When there was an outlaw that law enforcement struggled to catch, they'd offer a bounty. Said bounties were very thorough, providing just about everything about the target the police could offer. Species, size, gender, predation habits. You name it, they had it (though it wasn't perfect, as Paris proved. He was, after all, a wanted criminal). However, some bounties didn't involve the police. These were the civilian bounties. As expect, they were bounties put up by general civilians. They typically were for petty reasons, provide shit's-worth of information, and half the time were just some predator looking to get an easy meal out of a would-be bounty hunter. Yet, for some fucking reason, you decided that a rather detailed bounty from a private detective was perfectly fine to go for. Of course, the bounty said no-fucking-thing about your target (singular) being identical fucking triplets.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You take a left down an alley. With any luck, you lost them in the crowd. Even if you didn't (they are coyotes after all), you knew of somewhere where you could hopefully turn the tides. Further down the alley, you take another left, stopping at a ramshackle door. Pulling it open, you charge down the small staircase into a small basement. The place looks exactly how it looked when you moved out a year ago.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 After that quite note, you spin about and position yourself at the bottom of the stairs. They'll have to come down one at a time and you are fairly confident that you can handle them like that. Just as the thought crosses your head, the door at the top of the stairs opens.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"What are you doing, trying to die out here?\" You freeze, staring at the figure that comes striding down the stairway.

I was getting a few replacement parts and saw you fleeing with several coyotes on your tail. Given we have a working relationship that I'm not keen on dismissing, I came to offer my assistance.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You sigh, but give him a nod, \"Fine. Those coyotes are my bounty. Never said anything about fucking three of them.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Paris chuckles grimly, a sparkle catching his eye, \"In that case, perhaps it's time I do an experiment. You hide over there,\" he gestures to a small, empty bookcase, \"And I'll just do this,\" with the announcement, Paris's form changes, soon take a feral shape (though smaller than his usually size, he is still quite big). After a moment, he turns his head to the door, \"Now we wait.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 About a minute later, you hear voices, \"This it?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Smell goes here.

Hmm, A- blood, is it?\" Even as he made his analysis, Paris spat something out before busying himself with swallowing the second coyote (which, though it fought and struggle, was no match for Paris's size and strength). A glance told you that Paris had spat out an paw. Proof of your bounty.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As Paris began to taste his second victim, you look over the third. What to do with him?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Something the matter?\" Paris questioned, spitting out half a leg.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Just thinking about if I'm hungry or not.</span></div></div>",

Major themes of this interactive thus include feederism, weight gain, and the sheer power imbalance of relationships between predators and those significantly weaker than themselves. While it isn't prohibited for the main character to end up being eaten, the focus should be on more 'voyeuristic' vore; aka feeding predators other prey. Characters from movies, tv shows, and games and such can be included, so long as they largely aren't human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/greaterthan.png\" alt=\"*GreaterThan*\" title=\"GreaterThan\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <b>How the City Works:</b> Zinnia City consists of creatures of all shapes and sizes, primarily anthros, but also including talking ferals, robots, and other creatures. It's down its best to accommodate the predatory nature of many of its citizens, and eating other people isn't illegal so long as you don't go overboard. However, it's still enough to make other would-be prey afraid of you, so most predators prefer to keep it a secret to avoid social ostracization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\" style=\"padding:0px 0px 5px 0px;\"><div align=\"left\" style=\"padding:0px 0px 5px 0px;\"><a class=\"blue2roll\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/polls/item_id/2184497\" target=\"_top\">Vore Gender Poll</a>\u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/polls/item_id/2184497\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a></div>Which kind of vore do you prefer the most?</div><div class=\"\" align=\"center\"><table border=\"0\" width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\"><tr><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" align=\"left\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"><div style=\"padding:3px;\">Female Pred, Male Prey</div></td><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" width=\"200\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" align=\"left\"><div style=\"padding-left:3px;\"><img src=\"/imgs/dot-red.gif\" height=\"16\" width=\"88\"></div></td><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" align=\"center\" width=\"45\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"><div style=\"padding:3px;\"><b>410</b><br><small>Votes</small></div></td><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" align=\"center\" width=\"50\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"><div align=\"center\" style=\"padding:3px;padding-left:4px;padding-right:4px;\"><b>43.6%</b></div></td></tr><tr><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" align=\"left\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"><div style=\"padding:3px;\">Male Pred, Male Prey</div></td><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" width=\"200\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" align=\"left\"><div style=\"padding-left:3px;\"><img src=\"/imgs/dot-red.gif\" height=\"16\" width=\"54\"></div></td><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" align=\"center\" width=\"45\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"><div style=\"padding:3px;\"><b>253</b><br><small>Votes</small></div></td><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" align=\"center\" width=\"50\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"><div align=\"center\" style=\"padding:3px;padding-left:4px;padding-right:4px;\"><b>26.9%</b></div></td></tr><tr><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" align=\"left\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"><div style=\"padding:3px;\">Female Pred, Female Prey</div></td><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" width=\"200\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" align=\"left\"><div style=\"padding-left:3px;\"><img src=\"/imgs/dot-red.gif\" height=\"16\" width=\"42\"></div></td><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" align=\"center\" width=\"45\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"><div style=\"padding:3px;\"><b>193</b><br><small>Votes</small></div></td><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" align=\"center\" width=\"50\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"><div align=\"center\" style=\"padding:3px;padding-left:4px;padding-right:4px;\"><b>20.5%</b></div></td></tr><tr><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" align=\"left\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"><div style=\"padding:3px;\">Male Pred, Female Prey</div></td><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" width=\"200\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" align=\"left\"><div style=\"padding-left:3px;\"><img src=\"/imgs/dot-red.gif\" height=\"16\" width=\"18\"></div></td><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" align=\"center\" width=\"45\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"><div style=\"padding:3px;\"><b>84</b><br><small>Votes</small></div></td><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" align=\"center\" width=\"50\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"><div align=\"center\" style=\"padding:3px;padding-left:4px;padding-right:4px;\"><b>8.9%</b></div></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\" align=\"right\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" class=\"norm\"><div style=\"padding:6px;\"><b>Total Votes:</b></div></td><td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" class=\"norm\"><div style=\"padding:6px;\"><b>940</b></div></td><td width=\"50\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" class=\"norm\"><div style=\"padding:6px;\"><b>100%</b></div></td></tr></table></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>I reserve the right to edit or delete chapters in this story as I see fit.</b></td>",
