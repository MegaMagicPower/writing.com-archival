Luckily most of it was research which thanks to good old wiki and the copy and paste buttons was a snap. But when Henry couldn't find anything on the formation of plastics he had to look somewhere else for help. He typed the phrase into the search engine and immediately the screen was filled with links to websites bursting with complicated words and detailed descriptions of how plastic was made, too detailed for this time of night. Clicking on the link with the simplest words, he was directed to a website that looked more like a recipe than anything to do with chemistry. He was just about to go back when his eyes caught on something that could be interesting 'For the formation of disguise through basic bioplastic'. \"Hmm, this might be useful\" he said to himself, \" it does have the words formation and plastic in it\". So clicking on the link, another recipe-like page came up. Further reading suggested that he could make a sort of living plastic body suit using common household ingredients. \"Maybe worth a try, but not really for school...\" he said, printing out the formula which was followed out of the printer with a sheet of what seemed like instructions that weren't on the screen. Setting them to one side, he continued with his research.<br>\r\nLater on, when he was clearing up, he noticed the formula again and picked it up again. Indeed it did say that he could 'grow' a wearable suit of anything he wished. 'Takes 12 hours to grow' was in big letters on the instruction sheet. </span></div></div>",

He could wear the skin of anyone he'd ever wanted to! Well... Anyone who's DNA he could get a hold of. <br>\r\nHenry walked out of the classroom carrying the sheet of paper. He was so preoccupied with his thoughts that he bumped right into Emily Ward going the other way. \"Watch it! Dork!\" Emily spat at him as she shoved him aside.<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry!\" Henry tried. <br>\r\n\"Whatever. Get it out of my way already.\" Emily said as she walked off in a huff. Henry watched her go lustfully. He'd always thought she was super cute. She had shoulder length dirty blonde hair, small yet ample A cup breasts, and a nice round butt. She was slender and liked to walk with her hips swaying. She had on a pink T-shirt that showed a hint of cleavage, and really short khaki pants that cut off just under the butt. She also had on healed sandals that showed off her great legs. Henry almost drooled watching her walk down the hall.<br>\r\nEmily was one of the more popular party girls at school. Everyone knew her and everyone liked her. Any time she was at a party, the party was always talked about the next day. Henry never got invited to parties, so he'd always loved hearing the stories after and imaging what it would have been like. All the guys wanted to go out with her, but so far she didn't have a boy friend. Henry wanted to be her boyfriend. But seeing as how he was one of the least popular kids at school, it wasn't gonna happen.<br>\r\nAs Henry picked himself up, he noticed a long stran of hair on the ground. \"Huh? Is that Emily's hair?\" Henry picked it up with two fingers. \"Wait- DNA?! Here's some right here!\" The idea of wearing a skin suit that made him look like Emily didn't sound like such a bad idea. In fact, it made him kinda hard just thinking about wearing her skin. \"I gotta get home and try this out!\"</span></div></div>",

He grabbed all the materials he needed from the kitchen and cleaning closet downstairs. He then began putting the ingredients together in the tub. After running through all the necessary steps, Henry delicatley pulled out the stran of Emily's hair and dropped it into the tub.

There in the tub was what looked like a deflated sex toy. Better yet, it looked like someone had shed their own skin and left it lying on the floor of his tub. He walked over and picked it up. The suit felt like skin itself, yet it was very stretchy and elastically. He held the skin up before him and looked at it. It looked like Emily, except someone had let all the air out of her. The hair that grew out of the scalp hung loosely and the eye sockets hung open along with the mouth. Henry stuck his hand in the mouth and spread the head of the suit over his hand. Trying to get the head to move like a puppet. He then turned the suit over and check the back.<br>\r\n\"Huh? There's no zipper?\" Henry walked over to the recipe and read the last bit of it. \"Huh. So I have to stretch out either the mouth or anus area and step into the suit to enter.... I guess I leave the same way.\" Henry figured this was just as well. This way if he decided to wear the suit, then their wouldn't be a zipper to for someone to tell it was a disguise. Henry hugged the suit tightly as he pondered what to do next.</span></div></div>",

Today was Friday that meant that it was party night. He was going to a party, and this time he'd get in. Because this time he'd be Emily Ward, the cute, sexy, popular, party girl! He just needed a way to take Emily's place.<br>\r\nUpon arriving at school, Henry walked briskly to the chemistry lab and grabbed some chloroform and a rag. He stuffed them in his backpack and waited for school to end.<br>\r\nWhen the bell finally rang to signal the end of the school week, Henry headed to Emily's last classroom attempting to head her off. Luckily he got there just as Emily was walking out. She looked disgusted when he showed up.<br>\r\n\"God. What do you want creep?\" She asked smartly.<br>\r\n\"Carly told me that she wanted to see you in the girl's locker room for some reason.\" Before she could reply, Henry turned on his heel and walked off. He knew she would fall for it, since Carly Porter was her best friend. All he had to do was beat her to the locker room to get ready. He booked it down the halls and sure enough he got to the locker room before the real Emily had shown up.<br>\r\nHenry immediately got to work. He pulled out the suit, the bottle of chloroform, and the rag. He stripped all his clothes off and put them in his backpack. He stood there naked for a second as he picked up the suit to put it on. He put both hands in the mouth hole and opened it wide. Amazingly the hole gave easily without tearing. He stepped each leg into it one at a time. He then pulled the mouth up to his waist as he adjusted his legs into the leg holes. He then pulled the mouth up to his neck and moved his arms around inside the suit until they were lined up properly. He slid his arms and legs smoothly into their holes feeling the suit's smooth interior. He wiggled his fingers and toes into place and then looked down at his body. He was looking down at an entirely female body, the perked up breasts, the vagina, and the smooth skin. He then grabbed the deflated head and pulled it on over his own. He grabbed the eye holes and lined them up properly with his own, along with the mouth. Once he had the head mask on straight he looked around for a mirror. Upon finding one he looked into it and gasped in amazement. Staring back at him with googly eyes was an entirely naked Emily Ward. He couldn't believe it. He moved his right arm a little and the reflection did the same. He had done it! He was now Emily Ward!<br>\r\n\"MMmmmm! This skin feels so good.\" He purred as he slid his hands up and down his new curves. That was when he noticed his voice had changed as well. It probably had to do with the way the suit gripped his throat muscles. He now sounded just like Emily. \"This feel so right. I deserve to wear her skin.\" Henry posed several times with Emily's naked body taking it all in.</span></div></div>",

This allowed Henry to put his chloroform soaked rag over Emily's face, initially she struggled, but she soon faded. Henry laid her down on the wet floor and began stripping her clothes off, leading to him inspecting her body. From what he could tell, he WAS Emily Ward in every little bodily detail, from the small mole just above her hip to the birthmark on her back. Henry then, began clothing himself in Emily's clothes and stashed her prone, unconscious body in the janitor's closet for the weekend. He grabbed her backpack off the wet floor and exited looking forward to his first of possibly many days as Emily Ward. </span></div></div>",

It was after school and being seen here long after on a Friday was bound to raise suspision so reluctantly, Henry decided to take the suit off and go home. Feeling around the opening of his mouth, his finger caught on a tiny bump on the inside of his lip. \"This must be where to pull\" he thought and dug his nails into it, pulling as he went. To Henry it felt even stranger than putting the thing on, emerging from the mouth, everything seemed to relax even though it wasn't contracted before. Rolling the suit down, he stepped out and started to get dressed in his normal clothes. Catching a quick glance in the mirror, he was himself again. A sudden realization came to him, he was in the girls' locker room, the place where they got changed, there was bound to be hair lying around in here. Only problem was, whose hair would he find? Thinking for a minute, Henry decided that if it was anything like the boys' room, the more popular people got changed at the back, so he should look there first, but thinking again, he could immediately think of anyone he would say was 'ugly', not in all the five years of girls that got changed in here, so a lucky dip could be fun.<br>\r\n The cleaners must have already have been in because after searching the room top to bottom, Henry could only find two hairs. One was long and sandy coloured and in curled round on itself towards the end. The other was jet black and kind of frizzy, it hadn't been straightened that's for sure.<br>\r\n Getting home, Henry whipped up another batch of the mixture but then was faced with a problem. \"I can't use the bath again, it was hard enough stopping everybody going in there last night, I won't be able to handle another night!\". Sitting cross-legged on the floor of his room grasping the bowl, Henry looked around for a place big enough to pour the mix. His eye caught on the instructions sheet he was following again, he hadn't seen this bit before, luckily though it wasn't part of the method. It said 'For size changes, wear for half and hour', \"That's a point\" thought Henry \"I'm half a foot taller than Emily...\" he trailed off. Looking behind the door he found four thin strips of wood which he'd had for a while for a technology project which never happened. Thinking on his feet, he arranged them on the floor under his bed in a rectangle and then poured the liquid in. Pausing for a moment, there was only room enough to make one suit, which hair was he going to use?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Henry paused and looked at both hairs.  Which one to put in, he wonded.  The sandy-colored hair belonged to Carly, at least he was fairly sure it did.  This gave him pause: Carly was a little bit bigger than Emily.  Not fat or even really chubby but definitely a bit curvy.  She was pretty but Henry wasn't sure if he wanted to \"be her\" right now.  Besides, he was curious about who the black hair belonged to; he was having trouble thinking who had gym last period with hair this dark.  There was an element of mystery there that intrigued him and so Henry came to his decision, placing the black hair into the mixture.  Checking his watch, he saw that it was about 6:00 PM.  12 hours was a long wait but the suit would be done at 6:00 AM on a Saturday meaning he would be up long before everyone else.  Henry then shoved the makeshift suit-making area back under his bed, set his alarm clock and proceeded to go about the rest of his day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>* * * * * * *</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of his alarm clock going off caused Henry to shoot up like a bolt.  After taking a moment to gather himself, he got out of bed and reached under, pulling out the box.  Inside was yet another skin suit but he still wasn't sure who it was, although the smaller size made it clear the person was a little bit shorter than Emily and the head was adorned by shoulder-length jet black hair.  Still, Henry grabbed it and went into his bathroom, thankful he had one connected to his room, locking the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Henry stretched the suit's mouth open as far as he could, placing his legs inside and alligning them with the suit's legs.  He proceeded to do the same with his arms, and then the rest of his body.  As he did, he could feel himself changing, shortening and losing weight in order to fit inside the suit... or maybe to become one with it.  As he slipped his head through last and closed the mouth around it, he gave himself a minute to get adjusted before looking in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring back was a petite Asian girl.  She was thin with wavy, shoulder-length black hair and her breasts, while not big (around a B-cup) certainly seemed big on her thin, barely 5'0\" frame.  It took a minute as well but then Henry recognized the girl who's skin he now wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" he exclaimed aloud in a higher-pitched voice.  It just happened to be Sonia Yu's hair that he grabbed.  Sonia was a Korean-American girl that Henry shared his math class with; a short, nerdy girl with a somewhat mousy appearance.  She usually wore her hair in a ponytail or braid and wore glasses, as well as clothes that always seemed a tad bit too big and unflattering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her standing here, however, Henry was stunned.  She had a nice body, a nice face, nice hair... nice everything really.  If she ever put any effort into her appearance, she would be an absolute knockout.  And standing here, in her skin, Henry was starting to get turned on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before he did that, though, he'd need to come up with something to do today.  Once he did, then it would be time to get a little more intimate with Sonia Yu.</span></div></div>",

Back in his normal guise, holding the suit Henry gave himself a grin in the mirror, pleased at himself for figuring out the identity of the mystery girl. But what was he going to do? He knew that he'd get bored at home even with the two suits as 'company', but he had no clothes for them or any money, so he couldn't really go out either. A thought slowly came to him turning his grin into a smirk. The local pool had free swimming for under 18s, Sonia and his little sister were about the same height so he could borrow some of her clothes and he wouldn't have to worry about not being seen going out the house because he could put the suit on in the changing rooms.<br>\r\n Henry rolled Sonia's skin up in his towel and shoved it in his bag. He then crept quietly down the hall until he reached his sister's room. Fortunately the door was open so he could see that his sister had already gone down to breakfast. Making a beeline to his sister's wardrobe, he had a worrying thought that put his whole plan in jeopardy. His little sister was only 13 so she might not have the necessary equipment to comfortably hold Sonia. He had to check first though, so, he opened the wardrobe and pulled out a drawer at the bottom where he knew his mum would have put her bathing suits over the winter. The first thing that caught his eye was a brown and white polka-dot bikini with what looked like a white belt running round the pants (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.swimhut.com/product_info.php?cPath=2&amp;products_id=629\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.swimhut.com/product_info.php?...</a>). Luckily for Henry, his sister was one of those girls that even though she was 13 acted as though she was 18. It also looked like it was just about the right size for Sonia, so he quickly snatched it away and left the room. <br>\r\n Out of the house, Henry made his way to the bus stop but...</span></div></div>",

It was Friday and he needed to make sure he'd taken everything out of his locker, so off he went.<br>\r\n Somehow, even after going the other way, Emily had managed to get to the same part of the school before him and was sitting on a bench opposite talking on her phone. As Henry put the key into the locker door, he strained to hear what she was saying, she sounded quite upset.<br>\r\n \"...But Mum, why? No, I'm not going, I can't, you can't make me, that's totally unfair! Yes, I know we haven't seen grandma for a while but you can't take me halfway across the country for the weekend just randomly like this. There's a party on Sunday and I've already said I'm going, you don't want them to think I'm a liar do you? No, no, I'm not!...\", Henry could hear this half-argument even with his head buried in his locker, it was empty but he wanted to hear how this ended. Eventually, it drew to a close. With a sigh, Emily said \"Fine. Whisk me away to the other side of the country if you want, I don't care any more, we're leaving tonight!? Urgh, you owe me something big now woman!\", and with that, she let out another huff, hung up, and slipped the phone back in her pocket, setting immediately back off down the hall. <br>\r\n Henry backed out of the locker and turned round slowly, closing the door. An idea dawned upon him, \"She's leaving tonight for what must be at least two days, no time to tell anyone, party to go to, and I have something which might allow me to take her place...\", he looked at the piece of paper in his bag and twizzled the thread of hair in his pocket. \"I have to try it out!\".</span></div></div>",

He suddenly became aware of just how vast his options were. He could really become anyone he wanted, if this information were true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA door opened in front of him, snapping him back to reality. A short but buxom dark skinned woman walked out. It was his Spanish teacher, Ms. Burrieza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, where did I leave that...?\" she mumbled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ms.Burrieza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, h-hello...Err...It began with an 'H', right?\" said the teacher with a heavy accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am. My name's Henry,\" he replied while smirking. Ms. Burrieza was the newest addition to the staff this year and was filling the major gap in the language department. She very young and very determined, according to the principle anyway. Though it was early in the school year, she looked extremely flustered and busy already. Henry kind of felt sorry for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, that was it. Sorry, if you're here for checking on last week's paper I can't stay and chat...You hadn't happen to see a handbag lying somewhere around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said something under her breath that sounded like a curse. \"My fianc\u00e9 is going to kill me if I'm late again...Not your problem, sorry. Now if you'll excuse me I'm in a bit of a rush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she walked off down the hall looking around the floor, her high heels clicked the whole time. Henry noticed that the door she came out of read in clear black letters \"Teacher's Lounge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting...\" he said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe peeked inside. There was no one there, but there were plenty of teacher's personal belongings thrown on the tops of chairs. With a sharp eye, Henry spotted Ms. Burrieza's handbag thrown on top of the fridge, apparently she hadn't bothered to look up instead of down. There was sure to be a brush or something inside it that would have the hair he needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also a large green coat on top of one of the chairs. It belonged to Mrs. Edwards who taught English. She was considered to be a tall plump woman, especially after she came back from maternity leave. But she was only thirty or so and was fairly shapely, particularly in the rump area. It would be easy to find a hair on the collar of the coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry had a choice...</span></div></div>",

The first suit was going to be that of Ms. Burrieza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving one last look around the hallway to make sure no one saw him, he tip toed into the empty teacher's lounge. He reached up for the handbag and quickly sorted through it looking for anything he could use for a hair sample. Pay dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found a purple comb littered with long black hairs, Henry chuckled at his luck. He wouldn't have time to pick out an individual hair though, if someone saw him in here going through a handbag without reason he'd be in trouble. So he just put the bag right where he had found it and jammed the comb into his pocket, heading home to try the recipe. But not before he spied Ms. Burrieza on the way out. He subtly suggested for her to check for her missing handbag by looking at high places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting through all his homework so he'd have time enough to mix the proper chemicals before dinner was probably the hardest thing Henry had done all year in an academic sense. Not that he was a bad student or anything, but usually he had better things to do and today was no exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second he finished his last math problem he slammed his notebook shut and pulled out the printed list of materials he had been keeping in his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of the chemicals had unusual names that he had never heard of, but a quick search on the internet cleared up everything. Everything on the list could indeed be found in his house, he knew exactly where to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get started then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour of searching the house, being careful to not seem suspicious, he assembled all the materials as well as the purple comb and locked himself in his room's private water closet. As was instructed on the page, he turned on the bath water to body temperature. Once it was full he carefully measured and added the different ingredients in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A quart of yeast...three grams of salts...Finished!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry had to admit that he was a little surprised by the outcome. The entire mixture seemed unsettling like liquid human flesh, it had a thick texture that seemed to ooze rather than bubble. Even it's color was a sandy peach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess all that's left is to add the hair in...\" he mumbled to himself as he fiddled with the comb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe plucked the longest black hair he could find and dropped it into the mixture. It fizzled on contact and started bubbling madly. Henry jumped back a bit, afraid he had caused some sort of chemical reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe violent liquid settled down though, simmering like a witches' cauldron. The stink of the mess though was unbearable, he had to be sure to remember to shut the bathroom door so that no one in the house could smell this. Checking his watch, he read the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four forty eight...So that means this thing will be ready early tomorrow morning...Guess I'll have to use mom and dad's bathroom to shower tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing left to do according to the instructions except wait. So Henry left and headed down for a snack before dinner. All this mad scientist stuff had worked up an appetite in him.</span></div></div>",

When the room was quiet again and his sore bottom stopped hurting, he read the clock. \"<span class=\"cbgreen\"><b>5:01 AM</b></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned. Last night he had set his alarm to wake him in the early AM so that he could check to see if the suit recipe worked. Though he was excited, he had been dreading waking up so early especially since he didn't fall asleep last night until about one in the morning. It took another few minutes to get his bearings again before he slowly stood up and made his way to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to make sure the sand in his eyes wasn't fooling with his vision when he saw what lay submerged in the bathtub. The mixture had changed from a skin colored soup to what looked like a giant deflated human shaped balloon of his Spanish teach overnight. The water around the suit was clear, it was almost as if the chemical batch had only absorbed all that it needed to form itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is too weird...\" said Henry, reaching in to feel the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouching it made his hands feel all tingly, but the actual texture of the skin was very smooth and soft. Henry had half expected it to feel like rubber based on how it looked. It was almost as if someone had ripped off Ms. Burrieza's actual skin, creating an eyeless costume. The outfit itself was about her actual size, short but pudgy in all the right places particularly the chest and hips which sagged due to the lack of substance filling them. Fitting inside it was going to be difficult considering Henry's height, plus there was the issue of actually getting in. The only large enough opening appeared to be the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the recipe had worked as Henry had hoped, he hadn't considered what he would actually do with a suit of his Spanish teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" he said. \"What should I do with this...?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>His hands were really starting to bother him as he continued to finger the Ms. Burrieza's skin, Henry was beginning to wonder if it was safe to touch this suit or not considering the chemicals used to make it and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I should look into it more...\" he muttered to himself, it was still early morning and no one in his house was up yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his mind made up, he gathered up the skin and neatly folded it. He then placed it in a small bag that he could hide away from his parents and drained the bathtub so that there was no remaining evidence of his little experiment. The bag with the suit was hidden deep inside his closet where no one could find it but him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the task of hiding the suit was complete, Henry turned on the light at his desk and began reviewing the print out sheet he had that went over the instructions. This proved to be quite a long task as there had to be easily twenty pages of mostly useless material. The history of the suit creation, the reasoning for each material used in the process, the moralities and responsibility that each creator should have over the suit. Most of it was pretty dry and if Henry hadn't been so set on finding answers he'd have skimmed through it all like any normal school reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his patient and diligence paid off when he discovered an entire paragraph titled \"Side-Effects\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><b>As wearers of the suit may initially notice, the skin does not alter the physical form in anyway when first put on. But because the suit combines the DNA of the wearer with the DNA of the suit, over time some traits are shared and eventually the suit 'passes on' physical traits of the copied person to the wearer. This is an intended side effect of the chemicals used, as they are meant to act as an adhesive to combine the two DNA strands. In short, the longer the wearer of the suit remains in contact with the suit, the more they will physically become like the person mirrored by the suit. It is entirely possible for after a long period of time that the wearer will become an exact duplicate of the suit-person.</b></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry gulped slightly. What he understood from the packet was that if he wore the suit, he'd slowly start to become a clone of Ms. Burrieza. Would it even be possible to change back if it came to that? He continued reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><b>These side effects are not, however, intended to be a permanent alteration to the wearer. The wearer's body is constantly generating new cells with the makeup of his old form, meaning the cells affected by the suit's DNA are replaced. If the wearer spends enough time away from the suit to allow his cells to recover (usual it's a time equal to the amount of time spent in the suit) his/her will revert back to its normal form. As a side note, the changes to the body are mostly random, judging by the tests done by the creators of the recipe, but they changes tend to happen in specific areas first. For example, one subject's hair changed first after spending twelve hours in the suit while another subject's voice altered first when spending the same amount of time in the same suit.</b></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nervous sweat going down the back of Henry's neck finally dried up. Wearing the suit was safe, though he would be changed into his Spanish by wearing it. But somehow that idea combined with the fact that he could always change back made him want to try the suit on even more. It'd be interesting to experiment and see the changes that happened day to day as he slowly transformed into another person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also a question of what the limits were. Could he combine the powers of the suits? Wear a Ms. Burrieza for a few days then switch to maybe a suit of his sister the next? He could only think of the possibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut sadly, he wouldn't have time to test if what he read was true just yet. Glancing over at his clock again, it read \"<span class=\"cbgreen\">6:36 AM</span>\". His family would start getting up soon and he'd have no time to try anything. He'd have to wait till he got home and maybe wear the suit overnight as he slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry's stomach growling as he stretched and yawned. \"This is gonna be an interesting night...\"</span></div></div>",

He was more spacer than usual, blanking staring out the window and imagining just what was going to happen that night. Things were just the opposite when he was in Ms. Burrieza's class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery move she made he watched and studied. He'd soon be inhabiting her body, if the worst case scenario occurred he'd have to pose as his own Spanish teacher. Suddenly, he was regretting not paying more attention in class as Spanish was never his strongest language. Maybe he'd spend more time that night learning while wearing the suit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ms. Burrieza walked past him, her huge bottom bouncing up and down, Henry's stares caught the attention of one of his classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You certainly seem into the lesson, Henry.\" whispered Betty Bleu, a look of annoyance on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry blushed and quickly mumbled the words. \"S-Sorry, was just distracted is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty just huffed. \"I'll bet you were...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty went on angrily ignoring Henry the rest of the class despite his attempts to shoot her an apologetic look. It probably looked like he was eyeing his teacher, but there was no way Betty would ever guess why he had been doing it and what he was planning to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchool felt like it had went on for an eternity by the time Henry was safely in his room. He had made up an excuse with his parents that he hadn't been feeling well and didn't want to eat any supper, they easily believed it because a flu had been going around the school over the past week. For good measure though, he locked the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally...\" he said, making his way towards the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter digging around in the darkest pits of his clothing burial ground, he eventually found the bag with, to his relief, the deflated Burrieza skin inside. He had feared that someone might have discovered it despite his best efforts to conceal it. All of a sudden he was extremely nervous. He had talked himself into doing this over the school day, but he didn't expect to actually get to this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on...Just do it...What's the worst that can happen?\" he encouraged himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStripping down, he laid the suit over his bed as he struggled to kick his clothes off. Once that was done, he grabbed the small skin of his Spanish teacher and held it out in front of him. There was only one way to get in. He had to stretch the mouth open to fit himself inside. This was easier than he initially thought it would be as the skin seemed to almost expand like it was made of a loose spandex material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the mouth was wide enough, he took two steps inside. Instantly his legs were greeted with a soothing warmth, like they had been wrapped with a thick wool blanket. The pleasant feeling only seem to spread as Henry worked the mouth of the suit up his naked body. Any fear he had of working this suit dissolved under the pure pleasure that the skin seemed to radiate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the suit was at about chest level, he had to fit his arms inside just as he had his toes and feet. All that was left was the mask part of the suit which easily gulped his head as the hair dangled down. Henry aligned the eye sockets as a cooling rush coursed through his own skin. It was like he and the suit had merged, he could feel the cold of the room and the air blowing the the tiniest hairs on the skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked in his mirror and practically jumped back as a taller and thinner Ms. Burrieza stared back at him. He really could not tell that just moments ago this suit had merely been a flimsy costume hiding within his closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is too weird...\" he said, moving his hands over his body. \"...But nice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt sort of snug and compressed, like the suit was tightening every second. But it was in a nice sort of way. It was cozy and warm and Henry didn't want to do anything else but sleep all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe just a little nap then...\" he mumbled. Waking up early that morning had finally gotten to him and he grabbed a handful of pajamas before clambering into bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was mostly dressed and comfortable under his thick bed sheets, which he felt with even more sensitivity for some reason, he drifted off into a peaceful dream about grading Spanish tests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

He hadn't expected to have fallen asleep so quickly and so soundly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man...I feel good...\" he mumbled, stretching only to look down and realize he was still in the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when everything he had been doing the night before came rushing back to him. He looked down on his new form, his normal pajamas still comfortably fit him, so there was no apparent bodily change. But there was no way of telling that without taking off the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry casually glanced at the clock. \"<b><span class=\"cbgreen\">6:47 AM</span></b>\" It was almost time to start getting ready for school and his parents would no doubt be coming in to check on him after he had claimed to be feeling sick earlier. He'd have to grudgingly leave the nice warmth of the suit behind and meet the freezing din of the cold fall morning. But part of him was still interested as to what changes had occurred to his real body overnight if the information packet hadn't been lying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he picked at the lip around his lips until a thin layer of flesh peeled itself off of his face. Eventually that layer grew into a mask of skin and in just a few minutes he had escaped the suit, it  was just a pile of Ms Burrieza's skin once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing he noticed about his form upon leaving the suit was that he felt an immense sense of relief all over his body. It was like he had been trapped in a tight place for a long time and this was the first chance his body had to breath in awhile. But the clearest thing different was his skin color, which made it look like he had spent the entire night in a tanning bed. His skin wasn't dried out out though, it was soft and smooth like it had been well taken care of with moisturizer. There was no doubt about it, it was the same shade of coffee color that matched the skin color of Ms. Burrieza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, this is exactly what I wanted...\" he mumbled to himself, which was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been hoping that the suit would change him but not in a way that would be plainly obvious like a rapid lose of height. With just a minor change in skin color like this, he could say that he merely had been getting some sun lately and no one would question him. Henry casually rubbed his arm, not used to the hairless softness of them. Who knew what the next changes might be. Henry almost couldn't wait for tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Henry! Wake up! It's time to get ready for school! Are you feeling any better?\" asked his mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah mom, I feel great. Be right down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt school...</span></div></div>",

Though at least today he had the pleasant distraction of his new skin which for some reason he never got tired of stroking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one seemed to find his darker tone out of place and few even raised an eye at him. Only his mother had commented on the change, saying that he looked much healthier than he did yesterday meaning he must have been feeling better. The only person who seemed to react the strangest was Betty who, on top of still being angry with Henry over him eyeing Ms. Burrieza yesterday, was glaring at him with scrutiny. Betty definitely wasn't stupid. Henry needed to come up with a plan so that he could lure her off the trail, should more noticeable changes happen tomorrow there was no guarantee that she wouldn't say something to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when not daydreaming, Henry spent the majority of his classes thinking of a solution to his problem. If he was going to pose as another person, he'd need an excuse to be somewhere for that extended period of time. Not to mention there was the issue of finding proper clothing and materials appropriate for being his Spanish teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so lost in thought that during his last class, which by chance happened to be Spanish class, he was the last one besides Ms. Burrieza in the room when the final bell rang. Ms. Burrieza was in her usual rush to gather up her things and didn't even notice Henry until she looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me. Henry, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry jolted in his desk, his brain coming back from it's ten minute coffee break. \"Yes ma'am! Sorry, dozed off. I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, my dear. The bell rang. You can go home now is all.\" she smiled warmly at Henry. He blushed slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, sorry about that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to gather up his own things to go home, upset with himself because he could not come up with a solution to his plight before school had ended. It looked like things were going to have to be \"ab-lib\" so to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although...While you're here...\" muttered Ms. Burrieza before Henry could get to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am?\" asked Henry. He was somewhat nervous. What if she had noticed something about his skin?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This goes against what most facility would advise me doing but...Are you busy over the next month or so, Henry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...Not exactly. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I find myself in a bit of a pickle. I'm supposed to visit my fiance's family in his home country all next month. I've taken the time to mention it to the school, but I couldn't find the time to hire a house sitter. It's my kittens you see, I have two cats that need to be taken care of while I'm away. Would you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry smiled and spoke with a poorly filtered enthusiasm, fate had been kind to him this day. \"...Want to take care of it for you? I'd be happy to Ms. Burrieza!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Wonderful! Please, stay behind after class tomorrow. I'll go over everything that needs to be done. We can discuss any payment you'd like for the job as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no need to pay me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nonsense. This is very short notice after all. Anyway, I really need to run. Take care and see you tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry watched as the short Spanish woman gathered up a bag that almost seemed too large for her to handle and limped out the door. Talk about a lucky break. He had a place he could stay and for a whole month! All he had to do was think up some excuse to tell his parents so he could live away for that period of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just have to come up with something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The process of putting on the suit and relaxing after a long day at school was beginning to feel common place already for Henry. He had to wait until dinner was over of course, else his parents would be suspicious, but for all they knew he was studying hard all night. In reality though he was surfing the internet looking for funny videos, occasionally falling of his chair in a fit of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had recently made an interesting discovery as he sat there naked in Ms. Burrieza's skin. Everything that would normally be found on the female anatomy was in working order, even the \"plumbing\". Being a growing boy, he was only curious and decided to spend some time exploring this wonderful and exciting discovery until his mother knocked on his door to check if everything was alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were going well until his cellphone vibrated on top of his desk. He checked who was calling him, it was Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hi Henry, it's Betty.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, what are you doing calling at this hour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Just wanted to ask you something. Remember that science project that we're supposed to be working on?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry paused slightly. In the midst of all his fun, he had been putting the project off. \"...Kinda...Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe line went silent for a few seconds. \"<i>You haven't been working on it at all, have you?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe project she was talking about was the mid term assignment given to them in their Biology class. Their teacher had made the expected scope of it quite clear when he grouped them into partners. Henry and Betty had been selected to group up together, which Henry was thankful for considering Betty's known determination with grades. In fact he had been trying to do his best and research their topic when he had stumbled on the recipe for the skin suit. Needless to say, the project's due date was coming up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm sorry Betty, I've just been really distracted lately with other...things...I'll put in a lot of effort this weekend. I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh, don't worry. Actually, I was going to suggest coming over tomorrow so that we could work together on it.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Right. I'll see you in class tomorrow.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait, Betty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo late, she had hung up. Henry grunted in annoyance. Just when he had the chance to test the suit further, he had to be stuck doing this stupid science project. Still, it wasn't fair for Betty to be doing all the work herself, and he had been neglecting her lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry was more worried about what could happen if she discovered the suit. He was still going to go through with wearing the suit overnight, after all there seemed like no going back at this point, but hiding the constant changes was going to prove difficult. He desperately needed an excuse to be somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spent the rest of his night rattling his brain on more ways to hide his secret before passing out in bed. The warmness of the suit put him right to sleep and he passed out playfully twirling the long black hair of the skin. Henry could only hope that nothing noticeable would happen tomorrow that would blow his cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was good to be back on a normal sleep schedule again, awakening at five in the morning was not something Henry enjoyed as he reminisced making the Burrieza suit while waking up the next morning. Wearing the suit to sleep still meant that he had to take the time to remove it each morning, which ate up a few precious minutes of sleep he could have had. He grudgingly got to work with removing the skin once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like it was because easier to remove it though, almost as if his body had been adjusting to it while he slept. Not just on a genetic level but through form as well. Though he didn't seem much shorter this morning, he could swear that his form expanded outwards once he stepped out of the suit like sardines trapped in a tin can. That's also when he noticed the long locks of black hair down in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went to mirror to find that his short brown hair had been replaced by a thick luscious head of long dark hair. Though it looked almost matted, probably due to being crammed in the suit overnight, Henry could tell that this hair was well taken care of. Especially by the way it sort of bounced when he pulled at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like I'm wearing a wig...\" he giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was only try to fool himself with a carefree attitude. He had been hoping that something else besides a noticeable physical trait like this would change overnight instead. Someone was sure to pick up on that his hair had suddenly gone from brown to black and grown out to the middle of his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could try cutting it, but what if he needed to disguise himself later as Ms. Burrieza? He didn't have any wigs he could cover it with, and he doubted that his sister would have one of his exact hairstyle. His only option would have to be to hide the hair under a hat of some sorts and pray no one noticed anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling somewhat defeated but determined, he stowed away the Burrieza suit in the bag, tossed it into the closet and searched around for a hat that he could wear. He stumbled on an old baseball cap that seemed somewhat small for his head but he could not find anything else. He finished putting it on and his school uniform just before his mom knocked at the door to get him ready for school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be down for breakfast in a minute mom!\" he called back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he paused to look at himself in the mirror. He had done his best to hide the volume of hair underneath the cap but little black locks still poked through. If someone were to really pay attention they might notice something was off. This was the best he could do right now though, maybe he could fix it before first period at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worth a try...I guess...\"</span></div></div>",

It wasn't like yesterday where people just seemed to ignore him, today it was like every eye in the room was on him. Perhaps he was simply imagining it, but clearly going through two changes in a row and trying to get away with in public was pushing it. Every time he looked around he could have sworn people were looking at him then quickly turning away. He tried to listen in on their whispers but couldn't hear anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier in the bathroom he had tried to fix up his new hairdo so that it could stay completely hidden under the hat, nothing seemed to work though and he was seriously considering cutting off some so it'd be less apparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta think of some way I can hide until the transformation is finished...\" he mumbled to himself, head down on the desk and gripping his cap in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reality, no one was really paying much attention to him this early in the morning. It was only his wild imagination and fear of getting caught that caused him to feel under scrutiny. There was one person who hadn't stopped staring at him since he walked into class though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty had been scanning him over all morning. She sat a few chairs behind him so he didn't notice her. Secretly, she had a small notebook with several details written in them as she observed Henry through the class. Several times between class periods she considered approaching Henry, but was saving it for later that day when they were to work on their science project (which Henry had been neglecting once again).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry was exhausted from constantly looking over his shoulder by the time Spanish class rolled around. He decided the best thing to do to ease his mind was to observe Ms. Burrieza again, he carefully made a mental note as to how she walked and spoke. The little ticks in her speech and any physical habits that may have come in handy in the near future. Though many people didn't consider Henry to be all that bright, he had an exceptional talent for understanding people and their natural tendencies though he rarely used it wisely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the bell rang and his day in hell was over. He waited until all the students left the room again, with Betty giving him a bitter stare as she passed by him, before going up to Ms. Burrieza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you're still interested in helping me out Henry,\" she smiled at him with a huge look of relief. \"I honestly wouldn't know where else to turn if you didn't accept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no trouble at all miss, I don't have much to do during next month anyway and could use a job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's wonderful to hear, I'm sorry I won't have time to show you around the place. I leave tomorrow after all...I didn't even have time to tell Mr. Cardell that I needed to leave. It was all very short notice you see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Cardell was the principle of the school, if he didn't know that Ms. Burrieza was taking a month long break yet then this would work very well to Henry's advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll mail a letter back home once we've landed. Would it be trouble for you to give him that letter for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No ma'am, no trouble at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, here's a list of things that you'll need to do everyday. I really need to hurry home and pack before the flight leaves in two hours...There's an emergency number at the bottom, just call me if you have any questions or problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry gave the warmest smile he could manage. \"You can count on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" she smiled back, lifting up her heavy bag. \"Now if you'll excuse me...I'll see you in a month Mr. Folker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye,\" waved Henry as the funny short Spanish woman waddled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's done...\" he mumbled to himself. \"Now I just have to deal with Betty for today...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once he got home, Henry immediately went to check on the Burrieza skin suit just to make sure it hadn't been discovered again. When his fears were relieved, he picked a new hiding spot for it under his bed. Even when Betty came over, so long as he didn't leave the room he could keep an eye on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope she gets here soon,\" he said to himself while scratching his scalp. His head felt like it was burning with itches due to his long hair being cooped up in a hat all day and he didn't want to take it off because there was always the chance Betty would pop in unannounced. She and your family knew each other well enough that it would be a distinct possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Henry decided to kill time by doing at least a little research for their science project before Betty arrived. Not even fifteen minutes into his studying did he hear a knock on his door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, Betty's here,\" said his mother. \"She says you're both going to work on a science project.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, okay mom. Send her in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty came into his room with an odd look of sanctification on her face that Henry instantly recognized. It was the same look she gave when she had him in checkmate back when they played chess. She tossed her backpack down and crossed her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I started doing some research...\" began Henry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't printed it out yet but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the research for the stupid science project, Henry. Where's the suit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry froze, which probably gave him away. He tried to recover by lying. \"I-I don't have any idea what you're-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have time to finish as Betty jumped at him and made a grab for his hat. Instinctively, Henry clasped his own hands around the brim and fought hard to keep the cap on his head. Both of them tumbled to the floor and started wrestling back and forth until finally Betty held up the baseball hat triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, I knew it!\" she smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry sat up on his back, long strands of black hair cover his face so that he had to brush it out of the way in order to see properly. Though feeling defeated, it also felt good to finally give his long hair some air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know?\" he mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Henry. You show up to school with all those weird changes and you don't expect your best friend to notice? Besides, you do remember what we were supposed to be researching, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...The uses plastic in the modern day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. That article on human replicated suits was too interesting to pass up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...Have you tried the recipe then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please. I didn't think it would actually work, I just read through it for references. But to think it actually would work though...Can I see it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess there's no point in hiding it anymore, is there?\" sighed Henry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty grinned. \"Nope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went and dug around beneath his bed and pulled out the bag. He then tossed it to Betty who carefully opened it as if she were dealing with hazardous material. When she removed the suit she grabbed it using her clothes, preventing herself from physically touching it all times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't have the plague you know,\" Henry said, somewhat amused by her actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better safe than sorry,\" she snapped back. \"From what I read the chemicals involved in making this thing are meant to seep into the human body. It's remarkable that they come together to make something so... distinguishable. But really Henry, Ms. Burrieza?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, Henry rubbed the back of his head. \"Yeah...Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time. Plus she asked me to watch her house while she goes on vacation for the next month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And those are the only reasons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" lied Henry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole time Betty's eyes never left the suit. She was almost testing it, it's stretchiness and it's durability. A few times she even dared to touch it with her bare skin, feeling how soft and smooth it was and how it almost tingled to the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't going to tell anyone about this, are you Betty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to him and smiled.</span></div></div>",

Well, besides me keeping the secret, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started pacing around the room slightly, still fiddling with the skin suit. \"Remember my ex-boyfriend who broke up with me? Andrew?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could Henry forget? Just an hour after that fiasco had happened Betty had called him while sobbing over the other line. She took that breakup particularly hard and it took several hours for Henry to finally talk her down. She wasn't quite the same since, but that was over a month ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd like for you to make me a suit of him so I can have a little revenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Of all the things Henry thought Betty capable of, the lowest thing on the list was revenge. \"You gotta be kidding me Betty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty seemed almost offended by Henry's sudden remark. \"Why? Is there something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just...You're going to use a suit for petty revenge? And on Andrew? I'm mean...He and I aren't the best of friends, but he's a pretty cool guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not on Andrew. On that little bitch he calls a girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry could tell that Betty was getting angry, she usually kept a calm demeanor even under the most hectic circumstances. It was very rare to hear her swear and even more unheard of for her to name call someone like that. The \"bitch\" she was referring to was actually one of the girls Henry had a crush on, Emily Ward. She was a well known popular girl at school who typically made Betty's life a living hell. Henry recalled the day after Andrew and Betty broke up, Emily went up to her and flaunted her victory causing Betty to run out of the cafeteria in tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She stole Andrew. I know she did. I'm going to make her regret ever doing that to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Bet, you're kinda scaring me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry offered a pat of reassurance on her back. \"Anyway, I don't think you should use the suits for revenge like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and I suppose they're meant to be used for some sexual joyride?\" she snapped back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Henry. I'm going to offer more to you than just my silence. You remember what the prize was for the science fair last semester, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, why's that matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty sighed. \"A trip for two to Seattle for about a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry still wasn't getting it. Betty knocked him on the head and tried to explain things more clearly. \"So...Didn't Ms. Burrieza leave for a month?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" replied Henry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't you need an excuse to experiment on the suit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" he was slowly starting to get it. \"But my parents aren't going to buy me leaving school for a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't be for a month, it'll only be for three weeks. You'll need the extra week to get back to your normal self before Ms. Burrieza comes back. And secondly, I'll be the one to tell your parents. Your parents love me, after all. They'll believe anything I tell them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was true. For some reason, ever since they were kids, Henry's parents had been trying to hook him up with Betty. And if Betty were the one who told them he was invited to go on a trip alone with her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty continued explaining the plan. \"I'll tell them tonight on my way out. We'll 'leave' on Saturday, but in reality once we get dropped off at the airport we'll just call a cab and head to Ms. Burrieza's house. There we can spend the next three weeks doing whatever we want with the suits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what you're suggesting is living in another person's house for almost a month? That can't be legal...Also, if you need a suit so bad why not make one yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've seen my house. There's only one bathroom, I can't make a suit overnight when there's a chance someone will notice it. And no one's going to notice if you go around posing as Ms. Burrieza, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry went over the plan several times through his head. So far, there didn't appear to be any gaping holes in it. Betty had really thought this through, and Henry was desperately looking for a way to disappear for the next month. Perhaps this was exactly what he needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about your parents? Will they trust me to go alone with you to Seattle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my parents know your parents. And they know you. You're probably the only guy they'd let me do it with. Though they'll probably check up on me every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry frowned as Betty seemed to grow more impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Do we have a deal?\"</span></div></div>",

Now why don't you get to work on the suit while I take care of the project here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, didn't come over so we could work on the science project together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Betty was already immersed in a few packets of printed paper. \"Oh please, Henry. You and I both know that I was doing most of this work anyway. Besides, this will take me two hours to do alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll feel like I didn't do anything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just consider this part of our deal then,\" smiled Betty. \"To just back back at that little...whore...I'd have done your homework for the rest of the school year, so don't worry about it so much okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry suddenly felt like he was being cheated, but he didn't care. So long as Betty didn't reveal anything about the suit she could do whatever she wanted. He put his cap back on and crept downstairs to gather up the chemicals and supplies he needed to make another suit. His mother caught him once but he simply explained that they needed the odd materials for a visual aid in class, so she let him go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour of scavenging hunting, he filled his bathtub with warm water and placed the ingredients in again just like he had a few days ago. The concoction stunk up the bathroom with a plastic-like smell once again, but the recipe was complete. All Henry needed was a bit of Andrew's hair from Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe returned to his bedroom floor to discover Betty sitting cross legged in the middle of a mountain of books and printed sheets. There was a small pile of index cards in front of her no doubt filled with data for their speech on the topic they were to present the next day. She didn't even notice Henry approach her until he tapped her on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, Henry! You scared me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, it looks like you've been working hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have, in fact I've almost finished faster than I expected to. Can you say the same?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, don't worry. Everything is ready to go, all I need now is a bit of hair from Andrew. You can give it to me tomorrow, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to wait,\" replied Betty as she absentmindedly tossed a plastic vial at Henry. As he fumbled around to catch it, he saw that it had a single short black hair in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...How prepared are you for this?\" asked Henry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I've been preparing the whole day. I kind of figured that you wouldn't refuse my offer. Besides, the sooner the better. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry growled lowly. He didn't enjoy feeling predictable like that. \"I guess so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty slammed the book she was reading shut. \"Anyway, seeing as you don't need me here anymore I can finish up the rest at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't I study what you've written though? I mean, we're supposed to give the speech together aren't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll be stopping by here early tomorrow morning to pick up the suit. I'll give you the speech then once I safely get the skin. Call it collateral payment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd really think I'd not hand over the suit after all you're going to do for me Betty? I thought we were friends...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are...It's just...I'm normally not a spiteful person, but this means a great deal to me Henry,\" she looked at him with a pair of sad eyes. \"I want nothing to go wrong with what I have planned. You're a friend and I do trust you, but this is personal. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, but since when did that stop me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty suddenly gave Henry a big hug. \"Thanks Henry...Now, you should probably get some sleep. The teacher will be grading us on how we present ourselves, that means no yawning in the middle of our topic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it, I get it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" she said, gathering up the books and papers. \"I'm heading off then. We'll discuss the plan for Saturday in more detail tomorrow. See you in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, see you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited until she shut the door before undressing and finding the Burrieza suit again. There had been a strange carving to put it on the entire time Betty was there, something about the warmth the suit generated. Slowly, it was feeling more and more homely than making around in his own body. But he didn't dare voice his concerns to Betty, not while she offered the chance to escape for an entire month. To live for awhile as someone else, there was something wrong and foreign yet warm and inviting about that thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry spent the remainder of the night sitting naked in the suit browsing the internet.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Henry woke up the next day, the first thing different he noticed was that the sheets seemed to feel a whole lot heavier than usual. In fact, for some reason the suit feel more tighter. Like it had been constricting him the whole night. Before he went to bed last night, he had forgotten to wear any night clothing. Not that it mattered, the suit always seemed to keep him warm that it hardly felt necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up, Henry looked down at himself and didn't see anything noticeably different yet. His chest was still flat, so he wouldn't have to go to school with massive breasts. But it wasn't until he stood up did he realize something was clearly off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt shorter. A lot shorter. Everything in his room seemed a whole lot bigger, he couldn't see over his wardrobe like he normally could. Rushing over to his doorway where he had kept a constant record of his height over the years, he discovered that the markings of his last few years of measurements now towered over his head. Where he had been a little over six feet tall, he now stood a little ways under five feet. The exact height of Ms. Burrieza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realization of just what was happening to him suddenly sunk in. \"Whoa...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't been this height since he was in elementary school. Had his body really changed so rapidly that he could become this small in such short time span? It didn't seem like it was possible where as he would have believed it just last night. Henry just stood there, taking in the rare and surreal view he was now granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, shorty.\" said a voice behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty was sitting on his windowsill smirking and watching him intently. It was almost like she was studying his reaction to the sudden change. Almost instinctively, Henry blushed and covered up his chest and private areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't you have knocked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And miss watching you wander around in a daze like that? Too funny to pass up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry truly felt tiny once Betty walked up to him. Normally she was a good seven or so inches shorter than him. Now he had to look up at her, she was clearly amused by the predicament judging by how she gently patted him on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the suit ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I haven't checked yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what are we waiting for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry led her into his bathroom while he grabbed a pile of clothes to cover himself with. Like the day he discovered the Burrieza suit waiting for him, there was a flattened skin drowned in clear bath water when they looked into the tub. The face was crumpled but Henry recognized it as Andrew's for certain. He reached in and scooped it out, handing it dripping with water to Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it then?\" she asked. \"Huh, I was expecting there to be more to it. Simply amazing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe played with the stretchiness of the suit for a few moments before reaching into her backpack and handing Henry a pile of cards. Each card was covered in notes but some sections were highlighted in a blue highlighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the whole list of things we should talk about during the presentation. I highlighted your sections for you, so you'll only have to review that. But it wouldn't hurt to read through everything in case the teacher asks you a question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was explaining things to him, she took out a large plastic bag from her backpack and began folding the Andrew suit inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and you might want to find something that will make you seem taller. Someone might notice something, short stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry grunted. \"Are you going to make fun of that the whole time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty gave a big smile back. \"Yup. Anyway, we can talk later about the plans for tomorrow after school today. I already had my mom call your mom and she agreed to let you go on the trip, so things are mostly all set. For now, you should study the flashcards and make sure you don't make us look bad during our presentation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she packed up everything, she headed for the window again. \"I'll see you at school Henry, thanks again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched her climb down the side of his house and disappear into the dim morning light on the street. After he shut the window, Henry turned and faced his school uniform. It looked positively gigantic for him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This might be a problem though...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Henry felt like a child who was forced to wear their older sibling's hand-me-down clothes. His once fitting shirt covered his torso like a blanket and there was no way his pants were going to stay around his waist. Finding a creative solution, Henry tucked in his shirt and grabbed the smallest belt he could find from his closet. The idea at least kept his clothing on, though it made him look strange and awkward. For shoes he had to dig up a pair of his old pairs from middle school. Lastly, he put on the cap he had worn yesterday to cover his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't perfect, but at least it would last a day and that was all he would need. Starting tomorrow he'd be mostly alone in a house and wouldn't have to worry about what people thought. Well, at least he wouldn't be uncomfortable around Betty like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he went downstairs, he tried his best to avoid standing next to his family so that they wouldn't notice his significant drop in height. Everyone was too involved with their breakfast to notice anything different, though his mother gave him a concerned look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look somewhat sickly, honey. Are you sure you're feeling well enough to go on that trip with Betty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight, Betty had said she had gotten permission for him about the 'trip'. \"Oh yeah, mom. Just have a little cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you're sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he gobbled up a quick bite, he raced out to the car before his family could get a good look at him. He waited patiently for his mother to arrive, who was looking more and more distressed by her son's unusual behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've never been this eager to get to school, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine mom, just need to get there early so I can practice the presentation with Betty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchool didn't go much better. Henry didn't realize how tall some of the people in his class were as he traveled through the crowded hallways. Poor Ms. Burrieza probably had a tough time navigating through them during the rush between classes. Thankfully, his tall classmates provided excellent cover from wandering eyes and no one seemed to see him as he made his way to and from his locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally sat down in his seat, Henry gave a breath of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun running around, shortie?\" said Betty who was sitting directly behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, maybe you shouldn't wear the 'you know what' tonight. I doubt your mom would be unconcerned about sending her son off to Seattle when he mysteriously grew a massive rack overnight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're probably right about that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was always time to wear the suit again after all. Even though the instructions said he'd slowly lose the traits of the person he was channeling, returning back to his normal height for one day would be better than spending it dodging people's footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for the project?\" asked Betty. \"I think we should go first. You know, in case people wonder about your shorter frame. That way they'll forget about it by the end of class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bell rang, the rest of their class fumbled in followed by their eccentric science teacher Professor Farwell. Farwell was an elderly with a crown of hair that jutted out from the sides with a giant bald spot in the center. If he titled his head over he'd probably look like a flower almost because his white hair was stained yellow from smoking. In his usual jittery manner, he greeted the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning young apprentices! As you all are probably aware, our class presentations are today! I won't waste time talking then, since we have much to do. I'll leave the board open to anyone who wants to go first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty raised her hand. \"We'll go, professor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, I expected as much from the ever magnificent Ms. Bleu! Mr. Folker too. Pay attention class, let's give these two our respect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Henry got up and moved to the front of the class with Betty he could hear the whispering in the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Has Henry always been that short or is it just me?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Huh, Folker is a lot smaller than I remember him being.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry tried to ignore the stares as Betty started up the power point presentation on the computer. The projector hummed to life as it shot a blue light at the board. The screen for the projector wasn't coming down though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, looks like the screen's stuck again,\" said Professor Farwell in the back of the room. \"Mister Folker, can you reach up and pull it down? Just give it a good tug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasier said than done. Under normal circumstances Henry would have been able to reach the screen with no problem, but being as short as he was now the handle for the screen was a good foot out of reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts of jumping up at it, Betty finally stepped in and provided Henry with a small boost. The entire class snickered at the sight and Henry blushed as he pulled the screen down at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now. Give them our respect class!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Professor,\" said Betty who was trying to maintain a professional look. \"Now to begin our report on the modern uses of plastic...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the incident with the projector screen, the presentation went on without a hitch. Of course Betty did most of the talking, she had a way with making even the dull components of plastic sound interesting. All Henry had to do was add in a few comments to make it seem like he had done part of the research as well though he felt like his pants were going to fall off the whole time he stood around at the front of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, in a brief fifteen minutes they reached the last slide of the power point and the class gave them a round of applause. The both of them took their seats as Henry shot a whisper to Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I owe you for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, with what I'm getting I got off cheap.\" she smiled in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty spent the rest of the day following Henry around, possibly to give him a bit of protection. He felt so small around the rest of their classmates that he was afraid someone might mistake him for a tiny middle school class-man. It wasn't hard for Betty to keep an eye on him, they shared most of the same classes together after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually it was lunchtime and the both of them picked a quiet spot in the back of the cafeteria to eat at. Henry had a plate of his usual meal consisting of a hamburger and fries but for some reason he just couldn't finish it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's probably because your body is so much smaller, it doesn't need as much food to sustain itself,\" explained Betty between gulps of her salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. It's still very weird though. This whole experience is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have always waited until we went on the 'trip'. It's not like there's any hurry now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry grunted. She was right, but he didn't want to tell her about the strange urge he had been getting. Part of him was enjoying this too much to slow down. Still, he would have to not wear the suit before he went to sleep tonight. If he was going to say good bye to his parents tomorrow before leaving, it was too risky to have a chance that he'd change again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People keep giving me these off looks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I'm spending the rest of the day with you. Trust me, I'll defend you if anyone goes up and questions you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both shared a warm smile and returned to discussing their plans for the next month. Betty planned to use her own suit a week after it appeared they left for Seattle so she'd avoid any connection with what she had planned. Henry brought up the idea of possibly making more suits, which Betty seemed intrigued by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just think, we could make an entire closet of these things. A suit for every person in our class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd still need the hairs of those people. Besides, they take awhile to make and don't make the best instant disguises.\" Henry referred to the slow physical change into the other person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm. True. But if judging by the experiments you've done with them so far, it takes twelve hours for one change to happen. So if you were to wear a suit all day...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Henry got distracted by the crowd of girls suddenly forming around their table. He recognized a lot of them, they were the 'popular' crowd which meant that Emily Ward was probably nearby. Sure enough, the popular blonde came to the front of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, look at the little Betty having lunch with her crush,\" she said with an almost teeth grinding sweet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily.\" Betty replied, simply glaring at her. \"I didn't think they'd allow dogs to eat in the cafeteria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry sensed an impending fight. \"Laugh it up smart girl, who's going to be laughing when Andrew takes <i>me</i> to the dance next Friday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? Enjoy it while you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw. There, there little Betty. I know you're upset because I won Andrew over and just after he decided to do some charity work and go out with you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the girls laughed loudly as Betty's face turned beet red. Emily continued in her cruel mocking game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't think a guy like Andrew would be interested in you, did you? In fact when I asked him he told me that the only reason he even bothered to start dating you in the first place was because he lost a bet with a friend-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's enough!\" shouted Henry, surprised by the volume of his own voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all just laughed at him instead, Henry didn't realize it but in his burst of rage he had stood up. His shortened height didn't even come close to the length of any of the girls. They all towered over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betty's little man decides to stand up for her, how adorable.\" mocked Emily as Henry's own face blushed. \"Come on girls, let's go before the tiny thing wears itself out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with their victory, the group left laughing like a barn of hens. Henry tried to comfort Betty who had her head buried in her hands, no doubt doing her best not to burst out into sobs. He understood now why Betty was so desperate for revenge. How weak and powerless she must have felt while Emily attacked her safely surrounded by a group of friends to back her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate her Henry, I just...hate her so much.\"</span></div></div>",

Both of them just wanted to be out of there, Henry to escape the constant stares he was getting due to his height and Betty to begin preparations for her grand revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey decided to walk home together to prevent from being overheard. \"So, you know the plan Henry tonight, right? You're not to wear the suit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, okay. I get it Betty.\" He was growing tired of having to look up to her all day. His neck was sore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'll be by with my parents to drop us off at the airport at around nine o'clock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Betty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After that we'll hail a cab to take us to Ms. Burrieza's house which you have the address for and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Kay. Betty.\" Henry repeated with an annoyed tone. He regretted speaking to her like that instantly as though Betty seemed to get the message, she remained quiet for most of the walk home. The only time she said anything to him was when he got to the door of his house and whispered \"bye\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll text her an apology later.\" thought Henry as he rushed to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ignored his mother's hello and his younger sister's angry shouts as he stepped over her barbies. He made a beeline straight for his bedroom door and slammed it shut before locking it. Though Betty told him not to wear the suit, he couldn't help it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, he had stripped himself and was laying comfortably on his bed with the suit touching himself all over. It was like an addiction that was consuming him, he had to wear the suit once day or else. The worst part was once he had in on, he didn't want to leave it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't going to be stupid with it though, he checked his clock. It read \"<span class=\"cbgreen\">4:12 PM</span>\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just take it off before dinner...\" which he estimated would be before or around seven. \"That way I'll still have over twelve hours to revert day to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled contently as he continued to gloss over his stomach and into some of the more sensitive areas of his body.

At first he jumped up, thinking that he had accidentally worn the skin suit to bed and possibly ruined Betty and his plans for the day. He quickly discovered, however, that he was not wearing it and was instead standing in the middle of the room naked. The suit was lying in a crumpled pile on the floor next to his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shuddering slightly and quickly tossed the suit into his closet. If someone had walked in while he was asleep, they would have seen it and found him out. Worse, he could not even remember taking it off last night. The only thing still fresh in his mind was a sensation of indescribable pleasure as he had touched himself while wearing the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps he had been lucky and slipped out of the skin just before he passed out from ecstasy. Everything was strange now, being back to his normal size again after spending the day at Ms. Burrieza's height, though he still had her hair and skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden buzz coming from his nightstand snapped him back to reality. His cellphone was buzzing from a text message. As he reached for the phone, he noticed that his clock read \"<span class=\"cbgreen\">8:22 AM</span>\", he had really spent all that time cooped up in his room without even noticing it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe text was from Betty, written in her usual brief yet grammatically correct manner. Usually though, she had a more friendly greeting towards Henry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hey. Hope you are ready. We're coming over to pick you up.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn five full seconds, what Betty had meant finally hit Henry like a speeding train. Scrambling like a madman, Henry tore open his closet again and tossed out everything he could grab. A suitcase, some clothes, and most importantly the suit. He ran from the closet to his dresser and did the same, grabbing an outfit for him to wear instead of his birthday suit. He made sure to hide his long black hair under the same cap he had been using for the past few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all the junk he had collected was stuffed to the brim in his suitcase, he gave a sigh of relief and looked back at the clock. Two minutes until eight thirty, he had made it. He hurried downstairs and reached the kitchen just in time for the doorbell to ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that must be Betty,\" said Henry's mom who was currently cooking breakfast for the family. \"I'll get it, perhaps they'll have time for a quick bite before you guys head off, Henry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry knocked and threw down his suitcase to eat a much earned breakfast. This was probably going to be the last home cooked meal he would have for a while, there would be nothing but take out and junk food for the next month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral mouthfuls of cinnamon toast later, Henry's mother returned with Betty next to her. \"...Henry is all ready to go, is there anything you will need on the trip that we can provide?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty smiled, though Henry could tell it was forced. \"Don't worry, Mrs. Folker. My parents are taking care of everything, we'll be fine for the next month. Though we really must hurry, the flight leaves at nine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I understand. You two take care. Especially you Henry, I don't know why but it feels like I never see you much lately. Be sure to text me every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmkay, mmth.\" mumbled Henry as he shoved the remainder of his breakfast into his mouth and got up to leave with Betty. His mom stopped him to give him a hug good bye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun you two.\"</span></div></div>",

Mostly Betty's parents did all of the talking, asking the both Henry and Betty questions about what they planned to do once they landed and going over procedures. Nearly all of the talk was lost on Henry, who let Betty do most of the talking. Not once though did she mention Henry in their \"planned\" endeavors, nor did she even look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here's the airport kids.\" said Betty's mother after fifteen minutes of driving. \"We'll drop you off, after that you're on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom, I'll call you when we get there.\" Replied Betty as she stepped out of the car with her suitcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry followed suit, grabbing his own tightly packed suitcase and staying close to her.

Besides everyone needs a little away time from the folks after all, right? What's this guy's story anyway? He your boyfriend? Awfully tan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Betty and Henry blushed, but it was Betty who denied it. \"No! He's just giving me a hand with this project.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right. I won't say a word.

You guys just sit back and let me handle this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, twenty minutes later, they were in front of a small middle class white home complete with a picket fence and a beautiful garden. Betty and Henry double checked to make sure they had everything before exiting the cab and saying their good byes to Mr. Golbloom.

Has a secret crush on him and often throws suble hints at him that he completely misses; so she always agrees to help him in science projects, to spend time with him]</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Henry looked at the clock . It was getting late and he had to go to school tommorow, so he put the sheet back, making a mental note to try it out later. After all, the instructions were pretty simple and it wouldn't hurt to try. He went to bed, turning off the lights. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next day, as he was walking towards his locker, Betty, his lab partner, came up to him. She looked as usual, neat and nerdy. But, he noticed, she seemed to be wearing a little makeup. T'hat's new, he thought. Maybe she has a date today. Bummer, he thought. She won't be able to come over to help me. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'Hey Henry.' She sounded a little breathless, but that could be because she was carrying so many thick science books. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'Hiya, Bet. 'sup? <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'Oh, nothing. Just working on the research.' Her studying habits were prone to give others an inferiority complex and Henry felt bad for just copying and pasting his stuff. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0''Why do you do all your reserach like that? I mean, you can just use the net.' He shook his head.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'The net, contrary to the popular concept, is not the place for correct information. It's like walking in a room full of girls gossiping about latest news in school; everybody contradicts themselves. Besides, I learn better this way'' <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'Yeah, I guess.' This wasn't the first time they were having this conversation. He took out his book and they started walking towards the class, Betty chattering excidedly about awesome report she'd written on the making of plastic. Henry wasn't really paying attention to her but when she used the word bioplastic, he tuned in.<br>\r\n'What was that about bioplastic?'<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'Oh that. I couldn't understand if I should add that to my report or not. I mean, it counts as a <i>type</i> of plastic, does it not. We're just supposed to focus on general formation. But I added it anyway. Better safe than sorry.'<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'Yeah!' His mind went back to the 'Formation of disguise through basic bioplastic.'Hey, I found something really interesting last night about bioplastic. It was a sort of recipe for.. I don't know, disguise???'<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'Wow. A recipe.' She sounded like she was restraining herself from launching into criticism. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'Yeah. I know it sounds kinda stupid but I was gonna try it today, after school. I mean, it looked pretty basic. So, I thought we could...'' He trailed off, suddenly recalling that Betty was wearing makeup... 'Well, work on it. But that, only if you're free. I totally understand if you have to go elsewhere...'<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'No, it's okay. I'm free.' Betty sounded, Henry thought, a little disappointed. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'Betty, if you're going out with someone, it's fine by me. I'll work alone.'<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'What?Oh, no no, it's okay. I'd rather spend my time with you..' she lowered her voice. Feeling a little unnerved at the sudden change in her tone, he cleared his throat. 'Well, in that case, I'll pick you up after school. 'k?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'Okay.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After spending a tiring day at school and struggling through types of plastic, he picked Betty at the library and they walked to his house. He took her to his room and took out the recipe. Betty and Henry poured over the recipe, and he was grateful for her help because he had no idea where to find his ladies cosmetics; he was surprised to find out that Betty, too, kept her backpack full of girlish stuff. He'd always assumed that was only for the cheerleaders. The last ingredient of all was, 'Hair of the person whose plastic suit is to be made.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Betty had been extremely generous and had decided not to point out the ridiculousness of the whole project, but she couldn't contain herself any longer. She burst out laughing. 'You have got to be kidding me. I mean, really? How's it even supposed to work? '<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'Look Betty, I told you it was just an experiment...' He couldn't really blame her since he was feeling more or less the same way. 'It couldn't hurt and if it works, our science project is done, already!'<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'Yeah, I get it. Okay, so...' she cleared her throat, 'it says here that we have to boil the whole mixture and then pour it out in a bath tub...Yours?' she looked at him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'Okay. And, then we wait for 12 hours. Not to touch it before that...no water...okay. Well, we have all the stuff we need, so let's start.' They went to the kitchen and started adding the ingredients in the largest pot they could find. As the last ingredient went in, Betty, who was consulting the instructions, asked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'Oh, hey. Whose hair are we gonna use?' <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

By Henry's watch they had finished making it at 5:30 yesterday, so he had set his alarm for then the following morning, to clear up the mess if it failed and to stop anyone else discovering whatever might have been made if it had worked. Betty had gone home overnight and he'd promised to text her the results in the morning.<br>\r\nMaking sure not to wake anyone, Henry crept into the bathroom and was stunned by what he saw. There in the bath was an exact copy of his friend curly black hair and all, except that it looked as if she'd been deflated and was completely naked. Slightly taken aback and a little disturbed at this sight, Henry locked the door behind him and moved closer to the tub. There was no mistaking it, that definately looked like Betty lying in a heap at the bottom of the bath, empty eye sockets staring vacantly into space. \"It...worked\" muttered Harry to himself, he didn't quite know what he was expecting, but it wasn't this. Gathering courage, he reached out for its arm, grabbed it and held it up infront of himself. It was tough like a car tyre yet light, soft and really easy to bend and stretch. If he tried, Henry could scrunch it up to the size of a tennis ball or stretch it out to cover the whole room and it still wouldn't rip or crease.<br>\r\n\"Hang on a minute, didn't it say something about being used as a costume or disguise of some sort? So where's the zipper?\" Henry thought. Although he searched the back and front of his naked friend he couldn't find any obvious way of entry so he consulted the instructions sheet. 'For entry; use the anus. For exit; use the mouth' it said. \"Its one thing to be holding what could be the skin of my friend, quite another to start crawling up her backside!\" he thought. A quick glance at his watch showed the time was getting close to 7. \"The others are going to be getting up any minute now, I don't have the time anyway. I need to find a place to stash this.\", he thought to himself, and with that he returned to his bedroom, found an old cushion case from on top of his wardrobe a put it in there. Sounds of life were starting to come from around the house as people were getting up, \"Bet will be expecting a text about this... do I want to tell her? She'd freak out if she found out it worked and she's expecting it to fail. Also, I could have a lot of fun with this and maybe even use it to get other people's hairs...\".

Now that the thing had actually worked, his mind was suddenly full of ideas and the fun they could have. But first, he had school to go to. So he went downstairs, said hi to his mom, ate his breakfast and went to school. It was surprisingly hard to keep his mind on stuff. When Betty came over, he literally had to shake his head to empty it from the images he got; making it hard was the fact that he was planning to try that suit on; he didn't want to think about how hot he was going to look wearing that. So he busied her easily, letting her criticise and sympathise with him. She sounded patronizing and it only strengthened his desire to see the shocked look on her face. So he asked her to come over later, to which she readily agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce home, he dashed upstairs and sneaked into his sister's room, after making sure no one was around, and took out a dress that looked like it could contain him. Then he went back to his room, and started dressing up. It was rather weird, but the skin thing was really cool. It really could stretch as far as he wanted to and it felt rather like wearing spandex, only with boobs (which were rather nice but he choose to ignore that). Then he put on that dress and looked into the mirror. Betty looked back; she was a little broader around the shoulders and wider at the pelvis, but other than that, anybody could mistake him for her. Just then, his phone beeped. He checked the id: it was Betty and she was heading over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, he heard her coming upstairs, and there was a knock on the door. He stood in front of the door. <br>\r\n'Come on in!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty opened the door and came in.  </span></div></div>",

Henry just stood there, half petrified and half wanting to laugh so hard it hurt. \"What am I going to do when she comes round?\" he thought, \"I could wait as I am in this and try to explain it to her or I could quickly get changed back and blame it on my sister, I am in her clothes after all...\"</span></div></div>",

Not long after, Betty started to murmur on the floor. Henry rushed to her side and started shaking her, \"Come on Bet, wake up!\". One well aimed slap later and Betty was back in the real world.<br>\r\n \"OW!\" she exclaimed sitting bolt upright, almost headbutting Henry to the ground. \"What was that for!?\", she seemed genuinely angry.<br>\r\n Acting as if the previous incident never happened, Henry looked at her saying hautily \"Gee Bet, I don't know, perhaps it had something to do with you fainting! What was that all about hey?\"<br>\r\n Getting to her feet, Betty looked dizzily around the room, \"I could have sworn I saw...\". She stopped at that looking quite puzzled, staring deeply into Henry's eyes.<br>\r\n \"Well you saw my sister, screamed, and collapsed if that helps\", Henry innocently proffered. A look of relief swept over Betty but she kept quiet. \"Now about this term's science project, potato clocks have been done to death, how about...\". They talked and planned about their entry to the school's science fayre for half an hour. Betty looked at her watch and sighed. \"What's the matter Bet?\"<br>\r\n \"Oh, its nothing, or at least nothing can be done about it now, end of story\", she glared at Henry, daring him to question further. Getting the hint, and realizing from remembering how Betty was this morning that her being here might mean that she did have a date but cancelled, Henry asked \"Hey, how about we stop with the schoolwork now, go downstairs, I'll get us both a slice of cake, and we play that new super mario thing on the tv?\"<br>\r\n  Betty picked up her gaze from the floor and looked directly at him, her dark grey eyes glinting from the light of the setting sun, \"yeah, that'd be... nice\". This was the first time that Henry had ever asked her to do anything with him that didn''t have any link with school, and she knew it too. They both left Henry's bedroom silently and went down the stairs, Henry went to get the cake then they sat down and played the game. It was nice to be doing something different for a change, but Henry was a little afraid of what Betty might make of this new dimension to their friendship. Hearing the door slam, Henry looked round see who it was. His little sister Chloe came in, the same one he was blaming the fainting on. Chloe was 14, soon to be 15, but only a few cm shorter than Henry. She was slimly built and ran cross country several times a week with a club. Her thick chestnut hair naturally suspended itself upwards for half an inch before sweeping down to just below her shoulders, the suspension made her hair bounce slightly everytime she made a step.<br>\r\n \"Hey Henry, I'm back from Amelia's, oooooh Mario! Can I play too? Oh hi there Betty, didn't see you there, Henry make you play with him eh?\", Chloe sat down with them and reached for a spare controller. <br>\r\n \"Its alright Chloe, you can have mine, I'm just leaving.\" Betty sprang up, a little flustered, \"See you tomorrow Henry and, erm sorry about before Chloe...\" and with that she dashed off.<br>\r\n \"What's she apologizing to me for?\" inquired Chloe.<br>\r\n \"I dunno, must have mistaken you for someone else...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After playing a few games with Chloe to prevent any suspisions, Henry got back to his room. He had just closed his door when something came through the printer, even though he thought that he'd turned his computer off. It said:<br>\r\n \"To those to whom this may concern, we are pleased to inform you that as of 18:43, of this day of mailing, all created and future suits have been upgraded from being a mere item of clothing to a disguise which will alter your mass, height and all other body proportions. It is important to consider that these following times coincide with the changes which will now occur when you put the suit on, and will happen in reverse when the suit is removed. As always, we hope that this will push us one step closer to our dreams, whatever they may be. The warmest regards...<br>\r\nTimes (from putting on the suit): Height change, 1/2 day. Weight change, 1 day. Skin colour change, 2 days. Breast growth/reduction, 2 days. Eye colour, 2.5 days. Hair colour/length/style change, 3 days. Facial features, 5 days. Age, 5 days. Voice, 10 days. Replacement of sexual organs (if applicable), 10 days. Aesthetic changes (e.g. tattoos, scars), 11 days. All other genetic and non-genetic changes, 1 month. After 2 years, if suit is removed changes will have become permanant and aging will be restarted. If suit is removed before 2 years, these times will apply to the restoration of your original figure.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Henry read this message a couple of times over, it didn't make sense, all these changes had happened instantly when he tried on the Betty suit before. Was this thing seriously trying to tell him that now the suits would not only disguise him, but that they would actually change him if he kept them on long enough. But at least it said they would wear off if he took the suit off. Henry was a little confused still, \"Could I test this out at all?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Henry looked at the printout again and all the various things that would change and the times.  Almost everything took a day or more, and there was no way he could stay in a suit for that length of time unless he switched life with someone, or ... maybe, if they were gone for a while.  But who would cover for him??<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally wanting to test out these times, he noticed that the change in height would only take half a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hmmmm?  I could probably wear a suit overnight easy enough and no one would notice, especially if I stayed in my room and said I couldn't be disturbed.  But I need an excuse to be there.</i> Henry thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting near five o'clock, Henry's parents would be home soon, and by the time they all finished dinner it would be near 7 PM - the latest he could start wearing the Betty suit and get out of it in time for school in the morning.  She was only about 1.65 m and he was almost 1.8.  That's more than enough to easily measure. Now all he had to figure out was an excuse to be alone in his room, but there wasn't much time to figure this out and he still had his homework and science project to work on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>That's it !</b></i> Henry thought.  <i>I have to work the science project, and so I wouldn't really be lying.</i>  Henry's face lit up with a smile that quickly turned to a smirk, close to an evil scientist's as he thought of this secret adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something even more tempting shot into his brain.  What if he invited Betty back over saying that he had redone the experiment before school this morning but hadn't told her because he wanted to make sure it really was a flop, and doubly so when she fainted.  He wouldn't tell her that it had worked the first time.  However, he would say that this time it had worked.  Plus he had gotten new data and needed her help about testing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry's mind was running full speed on this, and every new thought about it was exciting him more and more.  He knew he couldn't use this story with Betty until after six o'clock if he had really mixed a new batch and left it for twelve hours. BUT, there was a catch.  How could he explain where he got Betty's hair for the second try?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then he heard his parents coming in the house and saw it was almost six.  He had to decide, <u>now</u>.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Racing down the stairs, his ears hadn't decieved him, his parents were just coming into the house. His mum was bustling around putting away the shopping which his dad was unloading from the car. \"Hiya sweetie\", crooned his mum on his entry into the kitchen, \"I'm not really going to have the time to make anything for dinner tonight, I can put some fish and chips from the freezer in to cook if you want, or you could just do yourself something. We're back off out in a moment for Chloe's parent-teacher thing, won't be back until around 9ish, you know how the traffic gets at school. So sort yourself out O.K?\"<br>\r\n \"Yeah that's fine mum, I'm not too hungry anyway, I'll just do myself a grilled cheese sandwich or something. I've got lots of things to sort out for tomorrow as well, a couple of essays to write and I need to figure out what to do for this science project. So, when you get back I'll just be in my room, don't need to come in there'll be papers and stuff everywhere...\"<br>\r\n \"Alright sweetie, don't stay up too late!\", and with that she planted a large kiss on Henry's cheek. Henry made himself that sandwich and took it upstairs, a brief glance out the window told him that his parents were getting back in the car, it was safe. Setting the sandwich down to oneside, he stripped down naked holding Betty's skin in front of him. Stretching and pulling the mouth, Henry made his entrance. He stepped into Betty, wiggling his toes into the right places. Rolling the suit up to his waist, he watched as his hairy white legs dissappeared to be replaced with Betty's hairless, lightly tanned ones. Sitting on his bed with Betty's open mouth tight around his waist, he started to roll it up to the top, sqeezing his arms in as he went, gone were his finger-bitten nails and in their place, Betty's manicured ones. Reaching over the back of his head he caught his fingers on the top lip and heaved it over the top like a balaclava he then readjusted the face so that his eyes could see through the holes and there was no gap between the suit's lips and his. Like before, he didn't feel any different except that there was a constant, somewhat comforting, pressure around every part of his body. A quick look at his bedside alarm clock, it was 6:52, easily enough time to see what the new effects supposedly did. <br>\r\n The house was deserted except for him so Henry decided to go and look at his new body in the main, full length hall mirror. Again, just like before, he looked exactly like Betty if someone was to just look quickly at him. If they looked a little closer and knew Betty then they would realize that he wasn't the real deal. He was too tall for a start, he was more flat chested as well, a little over an A cup. \"O.K\", thought Henry, \"this is no different from the last time, but I suppose I should give it the time it says it needs to work...\". Sitting down with his cheese sandwich, Henry started doing a bit of homework. He decided against wearing any clothes, he'd put PJs on when he went to bed but for now his own clothes didn't really appeal to him and he didn't want to go hunt down any of his sister's in case she noticed. After working for an hour or so, he decided to take a little break and take the plate his sandwich was on downstairs in case his mum came looking for it. It felt strange to be walking like this, everything felt so smooth and even though his suit hadn't exactly filled out, he was still more top heavy than before. Coming back up the stairs, he paused infront of the mirror again, still no difference, but the time hadn't gone by yet. After a little more work, Henry decided that even though it was only 8:50, he'd go to bed. He pulled on his pyjamas and clambered into his bed. For some reason, the covers felt thicker than before and he felt more snug than he'd ever been. Lying there with his now long, curly black hair fanned out around his head, he fell asleep.<br>\r\n Waking up to the sound of his radio alarm, Henry sat upright in bed. It was seven o'clock in the morning and time to see if anything had changed. The suit felt a little tighter than before but the tightness felt like it was subsiding, as if it had recently been squeezed really tightly but now was relaxing again. Swinging his legs out from under the covers, he definately had to reach further out for his feet to hit the floor. Standing up straight, it was now clear to Henry that he was at least 20cm shorter than before, he knew that he used to be 1.84 metres tall but now, after measuring himself against the wall, he was now in at 1.63. A wave of excitement ran through him,\"It works!\", he thought to himself, quite astounded. Running to the face mirror in his ensuite, he had to readjust it so that he could see himself, he had certainly changed. <br>\r\n Now it came to taking the suit off. It came off no bother but he was a little put out to have to take it off, maybe he could take the day off sick so that he could see even more of these new changes... He suddenly realized that although he had taken off the suit for now, he had not returned to his normal size. Checking the sheet, it seemed that it would take the same length of time for the effect to wear off. He would have to go to school wearing too big clothes and noticably shorter, someone was bound to see something was up. His mind wandered back to his first idea of trying to persuade his mum to take the day off...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Henry's head seemed to be swinging like a grandfather clock pendulum: stay - go - stay - go - stay - ...  He grabbed his head and shook it, but that just made him stagger around after he stopped.  He stared straight ahead and saw his school uniform.  <i>That's as good a sign as any.</i> he thought and skipped down the hall to get ready for school before Chloe took over the bath for the next half hour and he wouldn't have time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he got in the shower, he looked at himself in the mirror behind the sink.  It sure looked like he needed a hair cut although he had just gotten one last weekend.  He flung his head to one side and watched his hair swing around a bit over his ears.  Plus, his hair looked a little darker.  <i>Had the suit also affected those?</i> he thought.  <i>Of course.  The changes must be gradual and not happen instantly just after the time had gone by.</i>  Looking again in the mirror, he thought,  <i>Actually, it looks and feels good being a little longer and darker.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he turned sideways to go to the shower, he noticed that his reflection showed his working out had developed some nice pecks as well.  <i>Or were they the start of female breasts?</i> he wondered.  Henry then walked over to the scale and stepped on it.  He had lost weight, as well!  This was better than he expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick shower, he was mindlessly happy thinking of his success when he opened the door quickly where Chloe was about to knock and caused her to hit him in the forehead with her knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!  What was that for?\"  Henry asked rubbing the spot where she hit him and looking up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taking too long.\" she retorted sarcastically and quickly brushed by him closing the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hit him.  He had just looked <u>up</u> at his sister.  He used to be taller than her, at least by a few centimeters and when she's not wearing her heels.  They were both barefoot here.  <i>Good thing she was in a hurry and didn't notice.</i> and he smiled at that thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he went back in his room, he started to wonder if anyone would actually notice and how he would explain it.  He got dressed and managed to roll his sleeves and pant legs up so his uniform looked like it almost fit.  Fortunately, he just tightened his belt and his loss of weight wasn't noticeable.  Maybe he would just explain this was a slightly bigger outfit his mum had gotten him expecting another growth spurt.  <i>Oh oh.  Mum!  She always notices just about everything.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry shrugged and figured that if he had stayed home claiming to be sick, she would have been all over him and surely noticed his loss of height and weight and probably have him take off his shirt so she could put the menthol rub on his chest (which seemed to be her solution to every sickness), or worse maybe take him to a clinic.  He didn't want to think what she might have said about his new little breasts or to show them to someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting late since Henry had been fiddling so long with his clothes and trying to get his hair to look shorter.  He needed to hurry to make school on time.  Grabbing his books and pack, he ran through the kitchen and grabbed a snack bar as usual when he didn't have time for cereal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mum was cleaning up Chloe's breakfast dishes and didn't even turn to look at him as she said, \"Remember that your father and I have a dinner engagement and function after work today, and will be heading right from there for this weekend's convention and not be home until Monday.  We expect your sister and you to behave, and we've left our contact with the Bleu's and the Ward's if anything happens.\"  Raising her voice on the last as Henry was already through the door.  She finally shouted, \"Have fun.  Love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry was again mindlessly happy as he thought about a weekend with the suit or maybe making more suits and who those would be and if he should tell anyone and that there was a party Saturday and if he should ask someone or if he could go in a suit or maybe have a friend go in a suit or maybe go together in suits and ...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry had completely forgotten his current body situation when he reached school and was still trying to decide about keeping this secret or telling Betty the truth (or slight variation) and whether he should take a date to the party, when he ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No one had said anything to him about his clothes or being shorter or anything even when he stopped and talked to the guys.  He wondered if guys only  see real obvious stuff like black eyes and broken arm casts and don't notice things like a change in size, weight, or clothes like girls do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn this thought, he closed his locker and turned towards the first period class.  That's when he saw Betty down the hall, and she seemed to be staring at him.  From her stance by herself not moving in a corner, she must have been watching for a while.  She had a quizzical look about her like she was working out the solution to some hypothesis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Henry neared Betty, she darted out and greeted him.  \"Morning, Henry.\" and then walked beside him since they did the first class together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're looking quite, ah, happy today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't have anything to do with yesterday, I mean, I, ... uh ... It was nice taking some time together other than school work, and ... uh ... I ... um ...\" and she trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What?  Is she coming on to me?</i> Henry thought as he turned and looked straight at her now that they were both the same height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" she started again looking at him curiously with her eyes moving up to the top of his head than back.  She now had a very serious look, \"I did some more research on bioplastic last evening, and even though the, uh, suit thing, ... well, ... it's a good topic.  How about I come over after school, and we discuss it some more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Henry making that face that said she had some very important information that he had probably missed (as he often does trying to breeze through every project).  To Betty science and math and physics are serious business that one doesn\u2019t fool around with.  Henry was actually surprised that she wanted to do this after the way she put it down the past two days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she added hurriedly, \"I know it's Friday and all, and if you have plans ... but we have to turn it in next week.\"  Then she again got a quizzical face looking up and down at him then staring as if there was something she didn't understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry knew from past experience with his science partner that she obviously wasn't going to take no for an answer.  He really wanted to spend the weekend experimenting with the suit and was starting to feel really guilty not telling Betty and even worse for scaring her and causing her to faint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  I mean, OK. Sure. I don't have any plans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then smiled the way she does when everything goes right and says, \"Great.  I have to get something from home first.  Then I'll be over.\"  With that they had gotten to the classroom and went to their respective seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was normal, almost too normal.  Not a comment, crack, or joke was made of Henry's smaller size or mis-fitted clothes.  Only Betty's occasional stares during classes seemed out-of-place, but she always smiled when he caught her doing it which made him think maybe she had a crush on him.  Of course, by the end of school he had gained about half (ten centimeters) in height back as well as some weight, plus his hair had lightened and shortened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry couldn't believe that people were so unobservant.   More so though, Henry was disappointed and a bit sad since he had been so on edge and a bit fearful that someone would notice.  His relief from nothing happening actually became a let down, and he sulked through the end of the day and on his way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got home after school, Henry dumped his pack in his room and was about to get out the suit when there was a knock at the front door.  Henry went down and opened the door to find Betty there carrying a bag with something stuffed in it.  She had changed from her uniform and was in a nice skirt and top, although they looked a bit frumpy, and it looked like she had makeup on again.  Just a little.  Actually, Henry thought that she looked really cute which made him smile, which made her smile, which brought him out of his gloomy mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey headed up to Henry's room since all the science project material was there.  On the way up Betty asked if Chloe was around.  Henry didn't think anything about why she would be interested in Chloe and told her Chloe was spending the night at a sleep over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty followed him into his room and closed the door.  When he turned around, he could see she was in an angry mood and immediately accosted him with, \"OK.  Where is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's what?\" he said not understanding what came over her all of the sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't play stupid with me, stupid.  I know you have it.  All the pieces came together once I spent enough time on the 'net' to get the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill totally bewildered Henry responded, \"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know. The suit we made the other day that you said didn't work.  The documents I found on the web led me to the site you had found and then further to some rather interesting restricted reports.  I did a little experimenting on my own last evening.  Then when you came to school today, ...  You think I didn't notice.  All I had to do was go home and ...\" Betty paused for a couple seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you what.  I'm going to use the bathroom; and when I come back, you'll see and you can show me the suit that <u>you</u> have then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Betty turned, took the bag, and went out closing the door.  Henry heard her walk to the bathroom and close that.  Now he needed to decide how to handle this.  Betty always meant business, so it was unlikely he could fool her any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry pulled out the suit and laid it on the bed, then began to pace.  Shortly he heard the bathroom door open and Betty call from outside his door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, close your eyes before I come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close your eyes. ... Are they closed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry closed his eyes and said, \"Yes.\"  He heard his door open and close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK.  Open them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he opened his eyes, Henry is shocked to see ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She's always thorough when it comes to projects.</i> Henry thought still staring at Betty trying to really believe it is her.  Of course, he knew the suits work since he had used the Betty one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I decided to do my own experiment last evening after you shocked me wearing that suit.\" Betty continued to explain.  \"I wondered why our mixture had not worked since I had ensured we had followed proper scientific procedures, so I mixed up my own after I got home yesterday and used a hair that I ... uh well.... got when we were together yesterday.  Then when you came to school today so much shorter and thinner, I was pretty sure that our experiment had not failed and you had used the suit overnight.  When I got home today, this suit was waiting and ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry still stood there dumbfounded looking at a copy of himself with just a towel wrapped around his waist for modesty.  Although Betty's words made perfect sense, he was at a lost of what to say or do.  Fortunately, Betty had this all planned out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing his eyes begin to glaze over trying to take all this in, Betty finally says, \"Hello?? <u>HENRY!</u>  Take that suit and go to the bathroom and change into it.  Then put on my clothes that I left there.  When you're ready come back here.  I'll pick out something here for me to wear while you do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more confused, Henry can only utter, \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skin.  Bathroom.  Put on.

He did that once when working a project with her and got a lecture of enormous detail on exactly why he needed to do it the way she said or it would fail, so would they, and any spot on her record would result in a severe payback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabbing the suit, Henry ran from the room and went to the bathroom.  He quickly stripped then stretched the suit open and stepped into it.  Again, it felt very soft and smooth as he pulled it on pushing his toes easily down into the Betty-suit toes which he wiggled when he did.  Something about that seemed funny, and he began to relax.  Once his arms pushed his hands into her fingers, all he had to do was pull the head on, position the eyes, nose and mouth correctly, and his reflection in the mirror was that of Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found her clothes neatly folded in a pile on the closed toilet lid.  As typical thorough and exacting Betty, she had laid them out for him in the order that he needed to put them on, not that Henry couldn't figure that out, but that's just the way she did everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Henry first picked up her powder blue cotton panties and pulled them on.  They felt nice and soft but seemed a little snug since Henry's bigger body had stretched the suit out some.  Next he picked up her blue silky bra.  Henry was concerned he'd never get a bra on until he noticed that it had its hooks in the front.  That made him give a sigh of relief knowing Betty had brought that kind on purpose, too.  He ran his fingers over the material noticing how smooth and nice it felt.  Then he put it on, but it simply hung there flat since he had no breasts to fill it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came the knee length, navy blue skirt.  As he picked it up, there was a little sticky note on the short zipper at the waist: \"This goes on your left side hip.\"  <i>Wow.  Thanks, Betty. I never would have known and put it in front like a guy's.</i> thought Henry which is exactly why Betty left the note in her thoroughness.  He pulled that on and zipped it up.  It was a little tight but not too uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he pulled the yellow, loose top over his head (although it wasn't all that loose now on him since he was bigger than Betty) and then pulled the calf length socks onto each foot and up his, or her leg.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had just a brief moment to see himself, or actually now Betty in the mirror.  He made a stern, serious face and then rolled his eyes as if the stupidest thing had just been said.  He looked exactly like Betty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Henry.  What's going on in there?  You're taking as long as a girl to get dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry jumped when he heard that but recognized it as Betty's typical humor.  She often commented almost sarcastically as would a boy about girl's foibles.  That's what made her such a good partner for projects, that and always having everything planned out and being smart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry opened the door and stepped out to see his body or actually Betty in the Henry-suit fully dressed and waiting for him.  She had picked out a nice pair of Henry's slacks and a good blue shirt.  Both seemed a bit baggy on her but not unstylish as some guys dress that way.  The shirt was actually just loose enough to hide the bulges Betty caused in the Henry-suit chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look very nice this evening, Betty.\" she said as she tried to lower her voice to something close to Henry's and gave him a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny.\" Henry replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here.  These shoes of yours will go with that since my shoes will be too small for you until you shrink to fit.\" Betty said handing Henry a nice pair of his dark brown loafers that could be either a boy's or girl's.  Then she picked up her sneakers from the bathroom and put them on.  They worked well with the outfit she had picked out and put on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding him her purse, she continued.  \"For your joke that caused me to faint, I believe that you owe me a dinner and a movie.  Plus, this will be great material for our report on how it feels to use the suit.  You can't just say you made something if you can't explain it's effects.  I've got your ID and wallet from your dresser, and mine is in your purse.  Shall we go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  I'm not going out like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're right.  Here, we better add a little so it doesn't look too odd.\"  With that, Betty takes a pair of rolled up socks and reaches into Henry's blouse and stuffs the bra.  \"There.  You look fine now, so let's go for that evening out you owe me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why do I owe you an evening out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Betty.  I mean I'm taking you out to apologize for my little charade yesterday that caused you to faint.\" she said again in a phony deep voice.  \"Shall we go now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the look she put on her \"Henry \" face, Henry again knew it wasn't time to argue and slowly followed her down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can't act like you, and I don't sound like you.\" Henry implored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why we're going together so we can help each other out.  Now, you do need to practice with a little higher pitch to your voice, and if anyone asks, clear your throat and say you\u2019re loosing your voice.\" she explained as she opened the front door and ushered Henry out.  \"Now, what you have to say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry realized that Betty had everything planned and it would be best for him to follow the plan - exactly.  Plus, he knew if he did so everything would work out.  It always did with Betty's plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to sound like Betty's voice, Henry whined, \"Thanks, Henry.  This evening should be a real experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great.  I'm looking forward to it also.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they got to the restaurant, they ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Neither of them could drive but Henry's house was only 10 minutes away from the center of town so they decided to walk. Betty wasn't telling Henry where they were going so he just had to follow her lead. After about quater of an hour of walking, Betty stopped by an alleyway and said in a deep voice \"It's just down here, not far to go now. Once we get in, leave the talking to me alright?\". With that, they set off down the little alley between the shops towards the river, Henry had an incling of where they were headed and it was a little more expensive than what he was expecting, he could do nothing about it now though as Betty had his wallet and would be 'paying' for the whole thing. A little way down, the alley opened up into a sun-soaked plaza. Betty headed straight for the other side, straight for 'Le Bistro du Soleil', one of the most popular fine dining establishments in the whole town and from the outside it looked as if it were already very busy.<br>\r\n Getting inside, they were stopped at the door by a waitress. \"Good evening and welcome to 'Le Bistro du Soleil' bringing a litttle bit of sun into your life. Do you have reservations?\" she glanced at 'Henry'.<br>\r\n \"Yes, I rang the other day, its under the name 'Folker'\", replied Betty in her best Henry impression.<br>\r\n \"Ah yes, here it is. Right this way sir...\", Henry was a little taken aback that Betty had booked this whole thing at least one day ago and was starting to wonder about how long ago she had found out that the suits actually worked. They were led to the back of the restaurant to a little two seater table by the window overlooking the river. The sun was shining from the side so their table was basked in the warm glow of the setting sun reflecting off the water.<br>\r\n Trying to make his voice sound as much like Betty's as he could, Henry asked \"Betty, how come this is all planned out? How did you know that I had this suit and also that I would come out like this?\"<br>\r\n \"What can I say 'Betty'?\", she placed particular emphasis on this last word. \"I know you\", and with that she gave him a sly glance.<br>\r\n \"Sir? Madam? are you ready to place your orders?\", asked the waitress on returning.<br>\r\n Henry hadn't even looked at the menu yet so was surprised when Betty who had obviously previously memorized the menu said \"Yes, I'll have the lasagne and she'll have the cheese salad, thank you\".<br>\r\n \"Excellent choices, they will be with you shortly\"<br>\r\n A little angry, Henry stared at Betty, \"'Henry', why didn't you let me order? Cheese salad?\"<br>\r\n \"Shhh, quiet.\" Betty hushed, \"You can't very well have anything with as much fat in it as a burger or my lasagne, you're a girl! Think of your figure!\"<br>\r\n \"But I'm not a girl, I look like you but I'm not you!\"<br>\r\n \"It would break the illusion, also, your voice isn't very convincing. Try and speak higher in your throat, put a little more breath into it.\" Henry wasn't very pleased but he had to admit, she had a point. Now that she mentioned it, he was quite impressed at how much she sounded like him, it was almost having a conversation with himself. \"It's beautiful here, I'm glad we came.\" said Betty, snapping him out of his train of thought.<br>\r\n \"Yeah, its nice. Its a bit public though, if anyone sees us, what will they think? By the way, a boy wouldn't say things like 'beautiful'.\"<br>\r\n \"Let them think what they want to think, only we know what's really happening and no one would believe us anyway.\" Betty replied, \"Its going to get a little more public soon after you, I mean I, take you to the cinema.\" Betty looked straight at Henry, who, in this light had to admit that his body looked slightly attractive. \"Ah, here comes the food\", said Betty gesturing over to behind where Henry was sitting to the waitress making her way through the crowds with their dishes.<br>\r\n \"Here you go, lasagne for sir, salad for miss. Enjoy.\", she laid the food on the table and left back the way she came. Henry had just noticed how most of the conversations that had taken place between staff and other people were directed at Betty rather than at him, he felt powerless, probably more so because Betty was in full control as usual but he was now nothing more than a passing glance. The 'Madam's and the 'Miss's were to be expected he supposed but he couldn't help thinking \"Is this really what its like for girls?\"<br>\r\n Betty had already started tucking into her lasagne hammer and tongs, Henry looked over longingly at the real food while he was stuck with a pile of leaves and some milk that had gone off. With knife and fork in hand and back straight, Betty made sure of that, he reluctantly began to eat.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As they began eating, Betty kept up an almost constant conversation telling Henry little details about herself, her friends and family and her life, anything that Henry should be familiar with while he was pretending to be her in the Betty-suit.  She also pumped Henry for like information.  Fortunately, their table was pretty much by itself, but she kept her voice soft to make sure no one overheard.  She also always used her Henry-voice and insisted that Henry practice hers as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Henry was very reluctant at first, Betty was able to actually make this interesting and fun, almost like a game, so Henry began to start opening up and was surprised that he was enjoying himself.  Another surprise to Henry was the salad.  He liked it!  The dressing was a bit sweet and the cheese added some very nice flavor.  It wasn't mushy like the lasagna but crisp and crunched when he chewed which felt good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half way through, Betty began to point out different people in the restaurant that she knew, and Henry did the same.  It became another game of who could identify who and what the relationship was to either of them.  Henry saw his best friend's parents and stated that he rarely talked to them except to say hi or ask if his friend was home.  Betty on the other hand, always spoke to her friends' parents and knew a lot about their work and likes and things.  She would sometimes point them out again later and ask Henry if he knew anything about them.  Henry caught on quickly and had a good memory picking up Betty's knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See the waitress with the long, black ponytail.  That's Arlene Gibbons, a friend of my mum's.  Everyone calls her Arly which she insists on.  I've only spoken to her briefly, but if she comes over to you, be nice and make sure you introduce me.\"  Betty pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Henry asked and almost choked on some of the strange greens he was really beginning to like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.  You know how to introduce people.\" she answered.  \"Oh, and see the couple just being seated.  That's the Lancasters.  I baby sit for their daughter, Nikki.  She's five and adorable, but not too girlie.  You will really like her.  And over there, ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry wanted to ask her what she meant, but Betty kept right on going seeming to time her bites with Henry so his mouth was always full when there was a pause.  Besides, he was getting used to hearing his own voice sound so intelligent and sophisticated.  He relaxed and thought about the meal, the restaurant and the view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was now setting sending orange and red beams through the window.  Betty and Henry had finished their meals and turned to the window to watch.  Henry felt full just from the little salad.  Maybe it was just the suit squeezing him down to size, or maybe it was actually really good.  The restaurant had turned down its lights, and the small candles on the tables did a flickering dance as the sky grew darker, the clouds backlit by glows of crimson and gold.   It was very romantic, or so it would have seemed until Henry realized something.  He needed to use the restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry reached his Betty-hand across the table and placed it on hers while leaning over towards her not thinking what this may look like.  What it <u>did</u> look like was a young woman showing affection for the young man across the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Henry?\"  Henry whispered in his best Betty-voice now always using each others names because the place was full and they could be easily overheard.  Betty turned with a start when she felt his hand but then smiled tenderly at him.  She then moved her other hand on top of his so she held it between hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very beautiful and romantic, isn't it?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry completely forgot his need, and his eyes became the size of saucers.  He then realized the situation and quickly pulled his hand back.  After a short pause to get back to his original thought, he whispered, \"I have to use the toilet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\"  Betty said as if she had just been told she had gotten a \"C\" on a test.  Then recovered with, \"The ladies room is down the hallway over there.\" nodding to the back of the restaurant.  \"First door on your left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But ...\" Henry started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty just put a big smile on her Henry-face and stood up coming round to behind Henry's chair helping pull it out so he could get up.  Then she leaned to the side of his head and said softly, \"Get used to it or hold it.\"  Obviously, the latter wasn't an option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry anxiously pushed open the door and was relieved to find the room empty.  He hurriedly went into a stall and did his business.  The suit worked naturally even without having \"man parts\" exposed.   It must somehow reroute things until it reforms them.  He shook his head and ddin't want to think about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was washing up, he heard the main door open and saw a woman come in.  Their eyes immediately met, and she said, \"Betty.  So good to see you.  You're looking very lovely this evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough startled, \"Thank you, Mrs. Lancaster.\" just popped out of his mouth as he recognized her.  \"How have you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm well, thank you, and I'm so glad I ran into you.  Can you sit for us Sunday afternoon?   Mr. Lancaster and I have just had something come up and no one else is available.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry began to get scared.  How could he get out of this.  He had no idea if Betty was available, but if he turned Mrs. Lancaster down and she was available, it may hurt Betty's spotless record and he didn't want repercussions from Betty if he was the cause of a spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm working on a science project this weekend with a friend.  We have to turn it in next week, and we're still doing research.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is your partner that charming young man you seem to be mesmerized with at the most romantic table in the place?  I see you're wearing a little makeup tonight.\" she asked giving Henry a sly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, yes. I mean no.  I mean he's my partner, but we ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK.  You can bring him over and do the research while you watch Nikki.  She'll probably be taking her nap most of the time. I'd really appreciate it if you did.  I'll even throw in a little something extra.  Please say yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could Henry turn her down now.  She had no one else to do it, and Betty would get something extra.  \"Of course, I will do it, Mrs. Lancaster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Betty.  I see you are wearing your skirt with the zip on the side again.  I know you like it that way, but for that young man out there, you need to shift it around to the back like it should be.\"  With that, she reached over and adjusted Henry's skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you need to freshen up those lips after eating.  Need any help with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Henry realize that Betty was a real novice at makeup and he wouldn't have to fake it.  <i>What luck!</i> he thought.  <i>Mrs. Lancaster can help me so I don't end up looking like a clown if I do it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.  I'd appreciate your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Lancaster helped Henry find the lip gloss in his purse and get it on correctly.  Then she said, \"There.  That should do you for whatever comes later.\" and she winked again finishing with, \"Better get back out there.  You don't want to loose him.\" and she went into a stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry was amazed and actually very happy he had been able to handle that situation as Betty.  He was smiling and walking confidently, and looked like a very happy young lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about half way back to the table when Arly caught him and said, \"Hey, Betty.  On  a hot date?  You are going to introduce me aren't you, or do you think I might steal him away?  After all, he is good looking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry had never been so quickly trapped nor so embarrassed at having someone say he was good looking besides his mum.  There was no way to avoid this, but he immediately snapped back, \"I don't think you have a chance, so I'm willing to let you find out who he is.\"  Then he gave her his best Betty-smile and winked.  Both of them giggled as they walked to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Henry, I'd like you to meet Arlene Gibbons.  Arlene, this is Henry Folker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping to her feet, Betty greeted Arlene with a handshake and said, very nice to meet you Ms. Gibbons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please call me Arly, ... anytime.\" and she winked.  Both Henry and she laughed, but Betty acted like she didn't have a clue as Henry would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they left the restaurant for the cinema, Betty turned to Henry and said, \"I see, Betty, you're finally, really starting to enjoy yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Henry, I am.\" Henry answered.  \"And, oh by the way, you have a baby sitting date with Nikki Sunday afternoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Betty, are you inviting me over to the Lancasters when you watch Nikki?  My, are we getting serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry thought this all very funny and wasn't taking it seriously until Betty said, \"I was wondering how we would fill the rest of the weekend with the suits.  Tomorrow, we need to get supplies for more.  Betty, your parents have to run the charity auction very early in the morning and will be in bed by the time you get home tonight, so you won't have to be concerned going home to sleep in the suit or seeing them tomorrow. We'll be off to Emily's party Saturday night, hopefully collecting hairs all day long.  This will be great to spend as much time using the suits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and, Betty, my mum called,\" she said holding up Henry'd cell, \"to say she and my dad had arrived safely at the convention but may not get back until late Monday, so we have another day as well.  I told her I was doing a science project with you, and she said to say hi and that I better treat you like a lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry was getting more and more bewildered and somewhat worried by Betty's actions and how far her plan may be going even as he became more comfortable pretending to be Betty.  <i>How long were we going to test these suits, and Mom actually thought Betty's voice was me.</i> Henry wondered.  They walked to the cinema they're hands brushing each other at their sides until they held on as they walked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Henry jumped with a start, then realizing what it was began to rummage through the purse and pulled it out making him look just like a girl in font of everyone outside the cinema.  When he got it out, he noticed it said MUM and was about to hand it to Betty when she whispered, \"Answer it, and relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little apprehensively, he opened and pushed talk.  \"Hi, mum.\"  he said in a shaky Betty-voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><span class=\"cgrey\">\"Hi Bet.

No hanky-panky over at my, er your empty house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?  I wouldn't ...\" Betty defended her position as Henry in her Henry-voice, shaking her Henry-head, backing up with hands raised, and acting surprised as if that would never enter Henry's mind (which, unfortunately, it probably never would since he's never thought of Betty as anything more than a friend).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind.

In school, it is always a shirt and tie, but tonight he has on a tight polo shirt and jeans that accentuates his slender form.]</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out on a date this evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry's eyes became giant white orbs as he blushed, the skin immediately picking up his embarrassment and making his Betty-cheeks turn very red. He then looked over at Betty then stared at his Betty-feet, or would have but noticed her chest, though small, was blocking a direct view. This made him get scared as well as if Betty (that he looked like) didn't want anyone to find out they were dating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Mr. Reynolds.  No.  We're actually working on our science project. Right, Betty?\"  Betty said just like Henry would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry now had to look up and realized he must act like Betty or be discovered.  Betty is confident and knows her science.  What had she just said about the movie?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" Henry mustered up with as much confidence in Betty's voice as he could.  \"We've been discussing ... our experiment to uh ... study its effects.  It uh ... is sort of a ... bio-tech, so we thought the new sci-fi movie might have some  ... er, uh,  interesting things to consider even if it isn't real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's our Betty, alright.  A very good perspective to take, checking out all possible angles.  I'm going to see the ... um ... something else.  You two have fun.\" and Mr. Reynolds scurried off through the front lobby and headed towards the doors leading to the theater showing the chick flick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry's rapid breathing from that encounter was finally slowing, and he looked over at Betty.  She just smiled and said, \"Let's get our tickets and find some good seats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, they headed to the box office then into the theater that would be showing the film and waited for the movie to start.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As they walked out of the theater, both were discussing the bio-technology aspects.  Betty (as Henry) on how cool the movie effects and action were, and Henry, amazingly, on the scientific points of how it all worked, although Betty had whispered many of those to him during the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey barely noticed several of their friends who were there seeing various movies in the Cineplex.  A few of Henry's mates stopped them or made comments about them being a couple.  At one point Henry began to tell off one of them and lost his Betty-voice so he almost sounded natural which made them stare at him strangely.  Fortunately, Betty intervened as Henry and was able to move Henry's mates off saying Betty had gotten horse from talking so much and they should be nicer.  Something that Henry would do as himself in defending anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen some of Betty's friends went by before Betty had warned Henry.  He pretty much ignored them and then tried to make up he knew them, but everything came out wrong.  They began to get very suspicious, when again, Betty was able to smooth things over explaining, as Henry, that they were doing science research to see reactions of people if someone had no memory of them or it looked like people's memories had changed.  Knowing Betty's scientific ways and that this was probably part of their science project, it made sense to them. Also Henry, as Betty, apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they moved away from the cinema on their walk home, Henry finally relaxed, and once no one was around asked Betty some more details on wearing the suits all weekend.  Betty explained that they needed at least that long to properly evaluate the effects of the suits and that it would be best if they kept them on until their science presentation in the week following next.  She was so enthusiastic and kept telling Henry how wonderful he was imitating her, that Henry started thinking it was a real good idea to wear as long as they could to see if anyone would discover them.  He didn't even consider the effects of the suit that was changing his body while he wore the suit as described in the printout he had gotten on that.  (see \"<a title=\"Interactive Story Chapter in Item # 1662525\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/interact/item_id/1662525/action/view/chapter_map/1211122\" target=\"_top\">Change and blame</a>\"\u00a0<a title=\"Open in new window.\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/interact/item_id/1662525/action/view/chapter_map/1211122\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like no time that they reached Betty's house.  Henry had been to Betty's house several times and knew where her room was, so that would be no problem.  Betty told him that her PJ's were on her bed and clothes for tomorrow were set on her dresser.  Then she said to put all he had on in the clothes hamper when he changed for the night.  He could use her pink toothbrush and wash up in the bathroom since only she used it.  Her parents had their own bathroom, and Betty was an only child (probably one reason she was so forward and independent).  He could call in the morning if he had any questions, and they would get back together around noon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth admitted that it had been a great evening both scientifically and personally.  With that, Henry opened the purse and looked for some keys to unlock the front door.  Finding a set, he noticed only two keys with one an obvious door key, so he used that and unlocked the door.  As he opened the door, Betty stopped him and turned him around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for doing this.\" Betty said smiling still using her Henry voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really enjoyed myself, and <u>I am</u> looking forward to tomorrow.  Thank you for taking me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty then quickly leaned forward and gave Henry a kiss right on the lips before he had a chance to pucker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Betty.\" she said and headed off to Henry's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night\" Henry called softly then went in and closed the door turning the deadbolt.  He stared at the door for a few seconds feeling very happy.  Then he turned around and realized he was in Betty's house where her parents could appear and surely discover the truth at any time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly and quietly went up the stairs to Betty's room and closed the door.  A small lamp on her bedside stand made the room glow warm and friendly.  He saw the PJ's on the bed on top of Betty's blue bedspread.  He noticed the room wasn't all that girlie, at least not pink-and-frilly girlie.  But then, that wasn't Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry changed to the PJ's and went and washed up, used the toilet and brushed his teeth.  He looked in the mirror and saw Betty like he had when he wore the suit to bed the other evening.  This would be different, though.  He would keep it on through the weekend and tomorrow night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, no.  Tomorrow night was the party.</i> Henry thought.  <i>Will I be able to carry off being Betty with all those close friends?</i>  Henry felt a little less confident as he walked back to his room.  He was really tired from the whole day and experience and was slowly shuffling through the hall when he heard, \"G'night, Bet.  Sweet dreams.\" come from the master bedroom in a man's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry was so preoccupied in his thoughts that he just spoke out without thinking, \"'Night, Dad.\" in his best Betty-voice and walked into his room.  Once there he pulled the covers and slid in, reached over and turned out the light, then thought, <i>Dad? </i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry now smiled knowing he could do it, and he slept deeply and comfortably as the suit worked on his body and his dreams replayed all the tidbits Betty had told him working themselves firmly into his memory.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon arriving back at Henry's house, Betty went right up to his room and removed the Henry suit.  She was smiling broadly as she hung it on a hanger in the closet then got her bag that she'd left there earlier and removed another suit and put it on.  Next she got a pair of Henry's PJ's from his dresser, put them on and sat down at Henry's computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a minute she had logged onto a secure web site and used her personal password to access the restricted area containing various folders listing school, family, community projects, etc.  She scrolled over an icon and another logon screen appeared with pictures of scientific and mathematical formulas along with several animal and landscape pictures.  She then clicked on a half dozen in sequence and the screen displayed, \"Skin Suits Project 2010.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly opened the \"Plan and Progress Journal\" and began typing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Henry did have the suit of me, and it was easy to get him to wear it and start pretending to act and talk like me.  The evening at the restaurant and movie got him used to it and I taught him most of the points about me he would need to become me as planned.  He was actually relaxed and able to handle a couple simple situations as me by the end of dinner.  At the movies everyone was convinced he was me although we had to use a few excuses for memory lapses and some of his actions, but all accepted that.  I will work the rest of the indoctrination to correct those in him tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He reluctantly accepted wearing the suit overnight and staying at my house in my place after I said we had to have more data collection as part of the science project and he wouldn't have to deal with my parents (asleep early and out early tomorrow).  He continues to be easily manipulated and gullible just like I was able to do directing his computer remotely to the skin suit web site.  He is the perfect test subject.  He believes the suit info sheet on its effects and how long it takes that I sent him making it look like it came from the site.  I have no doubt that I can have him remain in the suit by telling him we'll demonstrate it at our science project presentation in a couple weeks.  That will be more than enough time for the toxic effects of the suit to work my DNA into his body and mind so that he will be too confused to know who he really is and I will convince him that he's me.  Only 20 days and the total transformation actually happens.  How could he believe that anyone would wear a suit for two years!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I am wearing the other suit tonight and taking the anti-absorption drugs as directed to prevent the toxins and DNA confusion in me so I will retain my personality and memories but enhance gaining from this suit's DNA and physical appearance.  By wearing it now and longer I hope to make this the dominant suit.  Fortunately, Henry is thin and just slightly taller than her, so it will look like I'm becoming him underneath just like he is shrinking to become me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phase one has been a great success and I will start phase two tomorrow.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Betty logged out of everything and turned off the computer. She went to the bathroom and washed up for bed, then turned in smiling, thoroughly happy and content in an Emily-suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">[Emily Ward: Henry has always thought she was super cute with light blue eyes, a dainty mouth and slightly turned up nose. She has shoulder length dirty blond hair, small yet ample A cup breasts, and a nice round butt. She is slender and just a few centimeters shorter than Henry. She likes to walk with her hips swaying and always wears fashionable, but conservative clothes.   Emily is one of the more popular party girls at school but also is a B+ student, though not nearly as smart and creative as Betty.  She and Betty know each other and have common friends.  She knows Henry from classes but has only spoken to him a few times.]</span>  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lifting it out of the way, he looked around the strange room and remembered instantly where he was and last night's events. He reached over to the alarm looking for a way to switch it off. \"That's Betty for you, complicated alarm, no morning radio...\" he muttered to himself. No sooner had he switched this one off, another one on the other side of the room started up, but this one had a tune. Darting out of bed towards the source of the noise, Betty's purse, Henry realized that it was actually her phone going off. He picked it up and paused for a moment to look who the incoming caller was, to his relief it was 'himself'. With a gaping yawn he tapped answer and held it up to his ear. Even though it was early morning, as long as he was in Betty's house he was at risk of being found out so in his best Betty-voice he said chirpily \"Morning Hen..erm...Bet...no, Henry! A bit early to be calling isn't it?\" He had just glanced at the clock, 5:30 *this girl's crazy getting up this time every morning* he thought.<br>\r\n \"Good morning Betty, just checking up on you, sleep well? Of course you did, I specifically chose the mattress and pillow because they promote REM sleep which improves brain capabilities, remember that.\" It was too early in the morning for Henry to be taking this in so he just murmured a response. \"Anyway, I was thinking, if you go into the top drawer of my chest, you'll find a tape measure, you wouldn't mind measuring yourself for me now would you? It would help with data collection...\"<br>\r\n \"Yeah, O.K\" Henry replied groggily. He quickly found the tape measure and reported back to Betty, \"1 metre 55\", he said. <br>\r\n \"Ahh, great, it looks like everything's going to plan, I mean for our project, to see what this thing does.\", a slightly awkward pause ensued. \"But this means that you should be able to fit into all of my clothes now no problem, tell you what, 10 o'clock in front of the fountain at the mall, be there we need to continue gathering information. Bye.\"<br>\r\n \"Errrrm, bye then\", Henry put the phone down, bemused at what had just happened. He was starting to get the feeling that something else was going on that Betty wasn't telling him, but that was just her, always with the secrets.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Henry made a big stretch to loosen up his Betty-body after Betty's bewildering phone call.  He actually felt very rested and his mind seemed to be full of things about Betty, her family and her house that he didn't think he ever knew before.  Realizing he needed to use the bathroom, he walked briskly down the hall pondering all that had happened over the past two days.  While he sat there, he continued his thinking on what lay in store for him as Betty and all this new information he seemed to have in his head about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he walked back to Betty's room after washing up, he heard Betty's parents downstairs going out the door for a day at the charity auction.  He was glad that he didn't have to face them.  They surely could tell he wasn't Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he entered her room, he happened to glance to the side and noticed there was a yoga mat on the floor by the wall with a paper containing diagrams and writing hanging over it.  He walked over and saw it was a list of certain yoga positions and times to do them starting at 5:40.  He figured that explained why Betty always had her alarm go off at 5:30 even on a weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick look back at the clock showed it was 5:39.  <i>Might as well give it a try.</i> he thought.  <i>I'm wide awake and don't have to meet Betty for four hours.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he read the first line and started with some stretches holding those for each time described.  Some were also balancing on one foot while holding out arms and looking up with your head.  He thought these were strange and somewhat funny, but fun.  Next, he sat down on the mat and sat cross-legged.  It said to pull each foot on top of the opposite knee.  He doubted he could do anything like that, but was surprised when he took his foot in his hand and lifted over his knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter going through the whole routine, Henry felt very pleased with himself and also very relaxed and energized.  He noticed that there was a note at the bottom that said, \"Shower time.\" so he figured he might as well as there was still lots of time before he had to be at the Mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he strode towards the bathroom, he wondered if it was OK to take a shower in the suit.  He vaguely remembered some notes on the web site about the suit acting ... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><i>... just like your real skin, hair, and all body parts.  All sensory feeling that the body suit could feel will be properly transmitted to your body and mind as if the suit was your body.  Hygiene works for all functions of the body both inside and out.  The suit can be worn indefinitely. ...</i></span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n... and he's sure it listed things like swimming and perspiring, so he was pretty sure bathing must be OK as well.  It has functioned perfectly when he's used the toilet, of course sitting down all the time.  He had noticed the suit completely hid what should be hanging down there.  Anyway, this would be a good experiment; a n d ... being Betty, he thought he should test it out because that's what she would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving the PJ's and starting the shower water to warm up, he looked in the mirror at himself or, rather, Betty's body.  Henry had never seen a girl naked before.  He knew all the parts and differences from boys from the mandatory Health classes he had taken.  Those books were very specific on describing the details, but the pictures they contained were not the same as seeing it in person, or anything like <u>being</u> it in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry noted that his breasts had grown quite a bit since he put on the suit.  He definitely would not be stuffing his bra today.  He raised his hand to touch them, but then became very self-conscious.  This was Betty's body or, at least, a suit of her body.  She was a friend, and he couldn't violate that.  But then, here he was almost as much of a girl as her. Besides, his body was changing underneath as noted in his reduced height and weight and having actual breasts filling out the suit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What does it really feel like to be a girl?</i> he thought as his fingers began to encircle one breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>NO !!   No, no no!</i> and he released his hold just as a new sensation shot through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReassuring himself again that he should not, and would not, fondle his female parts, he stepped into the steaming shower and pulled the curtain closed.  As he turned around and let the spray hit the front of him, he shuddered as the drops pounced on his breasts and beat against the suit's nipples.  They were so sensitive, and this shocked him immensely as it felt so good.  Looking down and seeing those nipples big and protruding from his breasts, he began to feel aroused.  It was different than being a boy when his penis would grow large, but he did feel a similar tightness in his crotch which he assumed was his penis expanding inside the Betty-suit, and he involuntarily began to slide his hand down between his legs thinking he would relieve the pressure sensation. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She would have preferred a little better bed to sleep in, but she had anticipated Henry's bed would not be like her special mattress.  So her mental exercises before falling asleep had put her into a relaxed state where she got all that REM sleep she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also knew that Henry had gotten good REM sleep and while he did, her setup for subliminal programming had played through the headboard speakers and filled his mind with lots more facts and trivia about her, her family, house and friends.  Being well read and knowledgeable in scientific techniques, Betty always knew her setup would be more useful than just helping her learn foreign languages in her sleep and become more proficient and confident in school work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding there still in the Emily suit, she went over in her mind again the exact plan for the day and all the details of each step.<br>\r\n<i>  <br>\r\nMeasure self and enter data of her and Henry into log<br>\r\nTake pill to counter the suit toxins at 6 AM<br>\r\nDo morning yoga and stretching exercises 6:05 - 6:45<br>\r\nTake shower 6:45 - 7 AM<br>\r\nMake and have breakfast  7 AM - 7:30<br>\r\nClean up dishes and brush teeth 7:30 -7:45<br>\r\n...</i><br>\r\n...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\"><span class=\"cbrown\">[Needless to say, Betty is extremely organized.

As she had planned, she was almost Henry's full height and just slightly lighter.  Once in the Henry-suit and dressed, no one could ever tell she wasn't him physically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter entering all the data in the log, Betty headed off to shower and get ready for the big day.  Her mind filled with her plans to complete the indoctrination so at Emily's party this evening Henry would be able to blend in perfectly as logical little Betty.  The afternoon would be filled with getting some more hairs as well as purchasing supplies.  Since many of them were normal women's makeup, it would be a good test for the new \"Betty.\"  Obviously, she couldn't purchase them looking like Henry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turned on the water waiting for it to warm, she glanced in the mirror to see the boy she had so desperately wanted to be her boyfriend for the past year.  She smiled wistfully and sighed.  Her thoughts turned that as if it was really Henry looking wistfully at her.  She felt happy and warm inside, but she noticed even more than that. Something different than she had felt before, at least physically.  She knew that Henry aroused her, but she had never felt it in the Henry suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast evening, Betty had been all business.  The romantic restaurant, holding hands, and even the kiss goodnight was all part of her plan rather than a sexual moment between them.  But now, she was relaxed with her logical mind taking a break.  Basic instincts and reactions had crept in, and she looked down at the Henry suit she wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA partial erection greeted her eyes, much bigger than any of the times she had stood and held it to the toilet.  She had never seen a completely naked boy's body before.  Even when she had changed into the suit, she hadn't bothered to look at herself in it closely.  Now she was glancing back and forth from the mirror to herself comparing all the knowledge she had from Health class and the Internet to what she was experiencing first hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she watched, she felt even more aroused.  After all, she was a girl seeing who she thought was the love of her life in his full glory, and that glory was now gaining in size each time she looked, then thought of it, all running in a circle in her mind.  She moved her hand over to see what it felt like.  It was fairly rigid but still had some extra skin around its length.  Her scientific curiosity began to take over and she wondered how much bigger or harder it could get, and, seriously, why can't guys control themselves?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>ENOUGH !!</i> he told himself and turned back around.  Then he leaned his head backwards to let the water run through his hair.  He reached for a bottle of shampoo he saw on a shelf and stood out of water to use some, working it into his Betty-hair.  It smelled rather nice and not very girlie, fortunately.  He was glad Betty wasn't a girlie girl and didn't think he was ready for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter rinsing and then putting some conditioner from the other bottle on his hair, he picked up a sponge-like thing and felt a bar of soap inside of it.  Running it under the water and squeezing, it started foaming, so he used it to wash his face and then the rest of the Betty-suit body he had.  It felt a little bit scratchy and left his skin soft and sensitive.  He was careful not to linger around his breast or to push, except gently, between his legs.  However, even just that caused him to want to try more with the suit, and he had to again remind himself this was normal for a girl and not to get carried away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finished rinsing off then got out taking a big, fluffy towel and dried off.  He saw there was a blow dryer and used that to get most of the dampness from his long, black hair.  When he was done, Henry wrapped a towel around himself and was going back to Betty's room when he saw in the mirror, naked from the waist up, Betty.  Quickly, he redid the towel so that it wrapped around his chest to cover the breasts and down to mid thigh, then he checked the mirror again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There's no one here but me,</i> he thought, <i>but I guess I should act proper.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen after a short pause, seemingly fixated on his reflection, <i>Betty <u>is</u> an good looking girl.  Hmm.  I guess that means I'm a good looking girl, too, right now.</i>  Then he forced a giggle at such a silly remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Henry confidently smiled, did a few poses, then swung his body down the hall, sensing the way Betty's body moved and felt that he hadn't ever thought about before.  He was starting to think of his situation as being in Betty's body and less and less as a skin suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Betty's room, Henry went to again look in the mirror.  Betty smiled back at him.  Her hair looked in disarray though, so he searched the top of the dresser until, he found her hairbrush and started running it through.  He quickly found out that you had to start near the ends and work your way back otherwise you would jerk the hair so your scalp hurt.  It took a while, but soon Betty looked very presentable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry then went to the stack of clothes Betty had left out with the note saying, \"Saturday morning\" and in order to put on from white panties and bra, jeans, and brown logo T-shirt.  Henry took a little extra time on the bra since this one latched in the back, but had everything on in what seemed like no time.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Betty's attention suddenly shifted as she noticed the bathroom filling with steam from the running hot water.  Quickly she turned and added the cold, then waited to test for the right temperature.  At home Betty knew exactly where to set the faucet controls for the perfect temperature.  Here, it was trial-and-error although Betty referred to it as proper scientific method.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she had it as close to perfect as she could get without getting a thermometer and measuring, she stepped in under the jetting drops and let it run all over her head and body (really the suit's head and body) getting her thoroughly wet and relaxed.  She grabbed a bar of soap and began to lather her head, hair and face.  There wasn't any shampoo or anything else, so she would have to wash everything with the soap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her head and arms and torso, she began to lather around the suits manly parts and buttocks.  As she rubbed the bar and her hands between her legs, she watched the penis again start to expand as her girl thoughts about fondling a man filled her head once more.  The sensation of her hands on these was being translated through the suit and causing her arousal to grow.  The lather and her hands felt very nice and she continued while closing her eyes and leaning her head back into the flowing water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>WHAT am I DOING?</i> she suddenly thought as she looked down and noticed the penis pointed straight out, very rigid and virtually no loose skin any more.  She quickly turned around and reached for the faucet.  In a couple of seconds cold water was pouring over her rinsing the soap from her and sending a different kind of shiver across her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty finished washing with the cold water, and by the time she was done, the penis had returned to hanging limp.  She dried off and wrapped the towel around her, staring in the mirror as she did and shaking her head about how she had let animal emotion infect her calculated logic and plans. This was unacceptable; but since it was unanticipated, she would add it to the lessons learned section of the journal for incorporation into future suit wearing.  However, she now knew that boys may not be fully responsible for some of their actions.  If this could take her out of her scientific approach so easily, a weak boy would stand no chance at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stepped away from the mirror, it hit her that she had the towel around her chest instead of waist.  This whole situation had thrown her for a loop, and she would have to be very careful even if she was taking the medication to counter the suit's bad effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Henry's room, she grabbed the boxers, jeans and T-shirt she had pulled earlier that were typical Henry-wear and put them on.  Betty noticed it felt different to not have clothes that were tight and clearly indicated what one's body shape was underneath.  However, these did feel very comfortable this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Boys were so lucky they didn't have to worry about fashion or wiggling their assets.</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty turned to the clock and saw that she didn't have much time to get things done and be at the Mall before Henry.  She grabbed some white socks from the dresser putting them quickly on then adding Henry's tennis shoes and tying them.  There was just a minute to spare as she put Henry's wallet in her pocket and headed for the bus stop.  That was within proper tolerances for the plan, so she felt her usual confident, and scheming, self.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By now Henry was getting hungry.  He knew where Betty's kitchen was but not sure where everything in it was kept, nor what he wanted to eat.  As he walked down, he wondered what Betty had for breakfast and whether Betty had that planned out and a note waiting for him as well.  He figured that was doubtful since Betty's parents would see it and know something was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry was enjoying his bouncing down the stairs and sashaying to the kitchen picturing himself as Betty so much that he almost missed the note in the middle of the kitchen table.  <i>She actually did leave instructions???</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">Bet,<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dad and I are off.  I bought some of your favorite yogurt and made a fruit salad to have with your cereal for breakfast.  We'll be back late.  Hope you had fun on your date.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Love, Mum</div><br>\r\n<i>OK.  That would be too weird if Betty had left the note. I wonder if she knew or planned that her mum would do this so I'd know? ... Probably.</i> he thought and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry pondered this as he found the bowls and cereal then turned to the fridge to get milk, but found none.  He took out the fruit and yogurt and wondered what cereal might taste like with it instead of milk.  He never really ate yogurt always thinking it was spoiled milk, but decided to give it a try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long before the bowl of cereal and yogurt along with a good bit of the fruit had disappeared into Henry.  When done, he was glad he discovered how good it was but didn't know if he should ever eat it when he looked like himself as he might get teased for eating \"girlie\" food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had cleaned up the dishes and put the fruit away, Henry went back upstairs and brushed his teeth.  Next, he went back to Betty's room and made the bed knowing that Betty was very precise and would never have left her bed unmade or the room out of order.  That's when he noticed the small speakers at the headboard.  There was a cable that ran into the nightstand.  Henry opened the door beneath the nightstand and found a small stereo set and a note: \"Do Not Touch !\"  He was curious, but assumed Betty liked to listen to music in bed and just closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stood up, his eyes went to the nightstand's clock that now said 8:13.  It was still too early to catch the bus to the Mall, so he went back and looked again in the mirror.  Something seemed a bit off.  That's when he remembered that Betty had been wearing a little makeup the past week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at her dresser and saw only a few items: eyeliner, eye shadow, and lipstick.  He had watched his mum put on makeup years ago. He would sit on her bed while she did it before going out with Dad and the babysitter came to watch him.  It didn't seem to be that hard when his mum did it, and Betty used so little, so he decided to try while there was plenty of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing very careful, Henry first tried the eyeliner.  With one eye closed and the other open, it wasn't as easy as his mum had made it seem.  She had years of experience, and Henry had none whatsoever.  After multiple tries, he managed to have a very thin line put on almost one dot at a time.  He then brushed as little shadow as he could and stepped back to look.  It was hardly noticeable, but Henry stopped now rather than go for the clown effect.  Remembering the lipstick in the purse and Mrs. Lancaster helping him with it last evening, he tried it himself.  Miraculously, it was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at the clock, he realized he better get going to be at the Mall by 10.  So he grabbed Betty's purse and checked himself in the full length mirror on the back of Betty's door.  He shook his head of black hair and made sure the clothes looked right.  He made the reflection smile a Betty-smile and said in his Betty-voice, \"You're going to catch that Henry Folker, yet.  He can't help notice you looking so good.\"  After a short pause, he then thought, <i>What on earth am I saying?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging it off, he opened the door and skipped happily through the house.  When he reached the front door, he looked down and saw that he didn't have anything on his feet.  Fortunately, there was a pair of sandals by the door that he remembered seeing Betty wear, so he put them on and hurried to the corner to catch the bus to the Mall.<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hopping off the bus at the mall, Henry went through the complex to the fountain in the center where he knew Betty would be waiting for him. Looking at his/Betty's watch, the time was 9:50, 10 minutes before they were set to meet. He sat down on the side of the fountain and started swaying his feet back and forth over the ground. After about a minute, Henry heard a beeping sound which he recognised as Betty's text message noise. Rummaging around inside the bag he found it and flipped it open to read the message. It said:<br>\r\n\"Hey Henry, its me, I thought it would be fun if today we acted as if we actually were each other instead of just pretending to be, so I'll be 10 minutes late like you usually are. Just forget you are Henry and be me! Betty xx\"<br>\r\nAs soon as he finished reading it another one came through:<br>\r\n\"Me again, just so you know, if you ask me anything about me I will act as if I don't know and as far as today is concerned, the suits never existed! Also, delete both of these messages straight away! Betty xx\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a little sigh, Henry deleted both messages and started to look around. He was slightly worried that Betty was taking the whole thing a little too seriously. 20 minutes after arriving, Henry noticed himself walking towards him with a little smile on his face. \"Sorry I'm late Bet, the bus was late.\" he heard his voice come from his face which sounded and looked exactly how he did.<br>\r\nRemembering what Betty said on the texts, Henry played along. In his best Betty voice he replied, \"Its O.K Henry, I wasn't exactly expecting you to be on time anyway!\"<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\" replied his double sounding hurt. \"Doesn't matter, shall we have a walk around?\"<br>\r\nHenry agreed and got up. They walked down an avenue of shops when Henry remembered something about the one coming up. \"Hey Henry, do you mind if we look in here for a bit, its my favorite shop!\", he asked the Henry-Betty. It was a shop called 'Bits &amp; Bobs', Henry had never set foot in there in his life but it looked like it sold pieces of hardware and other new technology bits, the kind of place that would be Betty's favorite shop.<br>\r\n\"Urgh, O.K Betty, if you want, but remember I don't know anything about computers and stuff. Why couldn't your favorite shop be somewhere like Topshop?\" The Henry-Betty replied.<br>\r\nWithout conciously thinking of the right words to say, Henry opened his mouth and said quite angrily \"Henry, you know how I feel about shops like that. Don't get me wrong, I like to look good, but I hate people who think that they can only look good by buying the latest styles. Technology can never be as shallow as some of the people you see round here!\". With that, Henry stormed off into the shop making Henry-Betty run in after him. He was quite pleased how he handled the whole situation \"He needs someone with common sense and can stand up for themselves, someone like me\" He thought to himself.</span></div></div>",

Need some circuit parts, micro imaging lenses, more mini-speakers or weight sensors and timers, video or sound recording equipment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Mr. Babbington who owned the store and had collected tons of miscellaneous devices and parts as well as a complete selection of the latest technical developments, some not even to be up for public sale.  He was an older gentleman with graying hair, that is that which was still left on the sides and back.  He wore a pair of big round-lens glasses and was sporting his typical sweater over a collared white shirt along with brown pants and shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even thinking about who it was or what to say, Henry replied, \"Oh, just browsing today.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Betty, in the Henry suit, came trailing him into the store, bumped into a display almost knocking it over, then backed into a trick motion sensor that projected a voice behind him that said, \"<i>I beg your pardon.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I help you young man?\" Mr. Babbington inquired once the commotion settled down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry found himself answering automatically in his best rolling-your-eyes Betty voice just as Betty tried to mumble something in her Henry voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's with me.  Science partner.\" Then some instinct made Henry shake his Betty head as he looked at Mr. Babbington who smiled and nodded with great understanding.  Henry just kept talking as he walked around towards Mr. Babbington. \"We're actually working on a biotechnology project.  You know, growing clones or some sort. Modifying living organisms for a particular human purpose.\"  These words just seemed to flow out without Henry having to try to make something up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was close, Henry felt himself lean in and whisper an aside, \"Was going to do gene therapy, but he's scared of needles.\"  Mr. Babbington holds back a laugh as Henry continues even softer, \"Maybe I can grow something he can wear like skin that will make him smarter and less clumsy.\"  They both start chuckling at this as Betty finally makes her way over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny?\" she asks cluelessly as a perfect Henry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Inside</i> joke.\"  Henry giggles and nudges Betty with his elbow not sure she heard the last but thought it was very clever of him even if she hadn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Betty says again in Henry's voice as she rubs her arm where Henry elbowed her then wanders off gaping at various shiny new things and blinking contraptions around the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did just get in a developmental remote neuro-magnetic EEG/EP interpreter/stimulator.\"  Mr. Babbington adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps after we complete the biotechnology project.\" Henry replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Biotechnology, huh?  Gotta be careful with that stuff.  You never know whether it will take over on its own once started.  Thing could really change a person.\" Mr. Babbington cautioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be as careful as we can.\" Henry says as he scurries across the store to stop Betty, acting like Henry, from inadvertently backing into another display.  As he pulls her out of harm's way, he drags Betty back towards the store door and yells back in Betty's voice, \"See you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always good to see you, Betty.\" he shouts back as a gaggle of geeks with glasses and pocket protectors rush into the store chattering excitedly amongst themselves and head for the \"Just Arrived\" and \"Sale\" bins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep those hands out of your pockets or I'll have security do a complete search if you try to shoplift anything.\" he warns the geeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty sees and hears all the geeks then turns to Henry after they exit the store and says, \"Yeah.  Nothing like Topshop.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As they walked through the mall, Henry was feeling very confident now acting like Betty in his Betty suit.  He was proud of the way he handled everything in 'Bits and Bobs', especially when speaking to Mr. Babbington. Everything just seemed to be coming naturally, even having to save himself - well, really Betty acting like him in her Henry suit - from fumbling around the shop, although maybe she was overdoing it a bit. All her actions in switching their lives seemed that, too.  \"But,\" he thought,  \"that's Betty, and since I'm Betty now I can do that, too.\" So he decided to be her super-serious self as well and forget about being Henry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this thought, Henry let out a deep breath and looked over at Betty, seeing himself walk along with him.  He thought about how he could take care of \"Henry\" and help \"him\" through this science project, and math, and physics, and all those things that you, now as Betty, understood so well and were really important in life.  Plus, hopefully, he would appreciate this and get to like you, too.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last thought didn't really register with Henry as his Betty-thoughts were beginning to be his primary thoughts, not just because he was trying to act like her, but really the little subliminal programming Betty had set for him while sleeping in her bed last night.  The science project was forefront in Henry's mind and these little things easily drifted by.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they approached the end of the mall, there was a store that specialized in personal care products but was mostly filled with all kinds of women's makeup, lipstick, hair coloring, hair pieces, etc. Across from it was the general merchandise store with home projects and even cooking supplies. Henry recalled that they had used most of Betty's makeup along with some other things to mix up the skin suits.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Henry.\" Henry said is a near perfect Betty voice, \"To prove our project in accordance with proper scientific method, we must be able to repeat any experiment that we've done.  Since we used up so much in our first attempts, we need to replenish those materials and add additional proof.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" came the response from Betty in perfect Henry style.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry stopped and turned to look directly into Betty's Henry-eyes.  \"Do you remember the items that were on the list of what we mixed together.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\"  Betty said again still gazing at the flashing colored lights coming from the Game Encounters store where you can test play and buy games.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pay attention, Henry.\"  Henry commanded which shocked Betty back to reality. Then quite a bit quieter, \"Our science project? ... The mixture we made for the experiments? ...  The names of the liquids we poured into it?\" Henry kept pausing as Betty's eyes still seemed bewildered and without a clue.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n THWOP.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Ow!\"  Betty said after Henry's palm bopped her on the forehead.  She raised her Henry-arm and rubbed where she was hit.  \"What was that for?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not here to just babysit you while your parents are away.  We have a class project that needs your attention.  Maybe you can't be as thoroughly immersed and wrapped up in it as me, but try not to loose complete focus.\"  Henry felt he needed to take charge but also a little guilty having to be so harsh wondering if it was going to be worth all the effort.  Then he thought to himself, \"I <i>am</i> acting just like Betty without even thinking.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK.  I'm sorry.\" Betty replied sounding and looking like a scolded puppy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Righto, then.  You need to pick up the liquids we used before over at GM, and I'll go get the makeup.  Can I trust you to do that?\" Henry asked still a little miffed and concerned just as Betty would be.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I can.\"  Betty said sounding a little hurt as Henry often did after one of Betty's lectures. \"I know you're a lot smarter than me, but I'm not a little kid.\"  Then after a short pause while Henry was pondering if he should apologize, Betty asked very excitedly, \" Can we then go gaming at GE and get some ice cream when done?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry got a shocked and indignant look on his Betty-face and was about to really read Betty the riot, when Betty chirped, \"Got you!\" with a big smile on her Henry-face.  This was a typical Henry action of sometimes teasing to get Betty flustered but really to relieve the tension and make himself feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry was flustered, then a laugh erupted up through his throat and partly out his Betty-nose, and Betty started laughing along.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Henry, you can drive me crazy at times but you have the greatest way to always make me laugh.  I guess that's why I really like you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Betty stopped laughing, and Henry realized what he had just said. Continuing to smile and giggle some, Henry spurted out, \"You know, as a boy, a friend.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like in <i>boyfriend</i>?\" Betty said in a silly voice teasing again.  \"Gee Betty, I never thought ... I mean ...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry cuts her off and rapidly commanded, \"That's not important, now.  Forget what I said.  You're getting distracted.  Focus on the science project.\" Then shooing Betty away with his hands, Henry added, \"Now, go. Get the liquids for the experiments.  Off with you.  Hurry.\" and she spun Betty around and gave her a push towards the store.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry felt embarrassed and confused as he began walking away towards 'Your Face'. He was acting so much like Betty now and seeing things from her perspective that he was getting concerned he was getting too serious about their skin suit project.  He wondered if Betty really felt like that to him.  She had been always so nice and helpful even when it wasn't science or math. Betty was, sort of, cute.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry looked up and found himself passing the threshold of 'Your Face'.  He began to get extremely nervous.  He was about to go in and buy women's makeup and felt very uncomfortable about it.  It wasn't that he didn't understand it.  For some reason he knew all the different types and generally how to apply them.  It's just he didn't think makeup was important and those that did seemed to be shallow, more interested in looks than the important things in life like technology and science.  They acted more like it was important to show off and just say they looked better, not that they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry was building up some anger about all this and that seemed to pump up his courage to charge in and ...  and  ... act like one of those types of girls.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her face was made up completely, perhaps too much at least from most women Henry had ever seen, but it was well done, and she looked very nice the way everything properly accented her features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to <i>My Face</i>.  My I help introduce you to some of our new products?\" she started then continued quickly without a pause for so much as a breath and guiding Henry in his Betty suit by the elbow through the counters.  \"We have a special on a full face makeup assortment including all <i>Heavenly Eyes</i> shadow and mascara as well as <i>Orchard's Ripe</i> flavored lip gloss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I just need to pick up a few items.\" Henry said in his best Betty voice and pulling the list from his purse while he continued to be dragged through the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" she acknowledged although obviously ignoring his request as she then spoke rapidly pulling Henry further through the store.  \"But let me show you some of the latest products just for the young woman like yourself. It never hurts to keep up-to-date for all those upcoming dates.\"  She smiled and winked making Henry feel that his Betty skin was as special and maybe, could be, as popular as Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, really, I don't want to take up your time, if I could just get ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cut him off and was luring him in further the more he tried to resist.  \"Our time is not as important as the time you'll have when wearing any of the <i>Purrfect Face</i> products.  These have all been scientifically designed using the latest technology to map naturally occurring living organisms combined with the uniqueness of the female body to produce a quality product that cannot be found anywhere else.  Just a few minutes and we can have you looking like the \"purrfect\" person that you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time she had maneuvered Henry onto a tall chair by a counter with a full makeup mirror, lights and more sample products than Henry believed were even possible, all labeled \"Purrfect\" with a picture of a cat sitting and smiling (if cats actually smile).  He started to again just ask to get quantities of the products on Betty's list, but began to get interested in the \"scientific\" talk about the products.  He wasn't sure if it was just the similarity to the skin suit project or if it was Betty's curiosity and interest in science and technology that was transforming his mind and had him begin to relax and listen more carefully and not resisting as she tied a smock-apron over Betty's outfit he was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What we can do is demonstrate everything here using our computer assisted face and skin analyzer to match you \"purrfectly\" with the right products.  Even if you decide not to buy, the makeover is yours free, and you can come back anytime before close on Monday and we will throw in a 10% discount on top of the sale prices running this weekend.\" she pleasantly pitched.  Her intent obvious and had Henry already hooked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry was now sitting calmly as the young woman took what looked like a bar-code scanner and ran it across the Betty suit forehead, eyes, cheeks, nose, and mouth.  Instantly, the computer screen lit up saying \"Analyzing for your unique beauty and the right <i>Purrfect</i> products.\"  Henry watched transfixed as Betty's face appeared on the screen and little codes began to pop out around it with lines drawn to a particular feature on her face.  Almost immediately, the young woman started grabbing various sample products and then applying them quickly but very smoothly and gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ ~ ~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done.\"  The words came almost before Henry could believe it possible.  He was swung around to face the mirror, and he gasped at what he saw.  He recognized it was Betty, but she was, well, ... quite different.  He had never noticed her this way before and just sat there unable to say anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I say.  You are now Purrfect!\" she actually purrrrred. \"Don't you think?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, as he handed it to the young lady, he realized that he didn't have a lot of money to pay for the high end glamour brands, and he finally turned towards her and said, \"I only have enough for maybe twenty pounds and do need everything on the list.\"  Then thinking up some excuse, Henry added, \"They're not just for me, so I better just get the usual, but maybe I can come back later as you suggested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand completely.\" she said leaning in towards Henry and speaking more in a whisper.  \"Us girls don't always have the sterling these places demand.  But don't worry.  I made sure to add the special \"Purrfect OverHold.\"  The makeup you have on is guaranteed to last for your date tonight with that cute young man you got back outside I saw you with, <i>and</i> through tomorrow as well.  I'll throw in a sample lip gloss, too.  I just know that's bound to wear off later and need replacing.\"  Then she winked and scurried off to fill a bag of what you needed for the skin suits and had your bill paid and you smiling as you walked back out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you came out, Betty in her Henry suit was also just coming out of the GM across the way.  You had never noticed before, but, you guessed, Henry, you, was cute for a guy.  When you got close, you saw a strange look on her Henry face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the problem, Henry?\"  you asked.  \"You look like you're trying to swallow a fly with your mouth open like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\"  Betty said in her Henry voice.  \"It's just that you're, well ... I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean that you don't know?  Are you saying something's wrong with me or I look bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No.  Not at all.\" the reply came back very defensively.  \"You look, er ... OK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK? Don't you like this?  It's not something I meant to do. They just did it before they would stop.  If you don't like me like  this ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly sputtering words seeing herself look so well, Betty began to spill words that she really wanted to hear from Henry without even thinking.  \"No.  I like you, ... it.  You're very pretty.  It's, er ... just I never, I mean, we're friends and stuff, but you, ... I just .. you now ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry stood there watching himself act confused, and he began to think about his relationship with Betty and what he really thought of her as well.  He wondered if she was really playing him and actually letting out his true feelings and whether he actually had those feelings?  Or maybe it was her feelings for him.  He had never thought of Betty as anything but a friend.  He always dreamed of the prettiest, popular girls as what he should be most interested in.  That's what guys do.  Then he thought about that saying that you sometimes miss what is right in front of you and don't see the real ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betty?  Betty! Are you OK?\" Henry's voice was breaking Henry loose from his thoughts.  \"Your mind seems to be off somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Henry tried to think like Betty dropping his thoughts for her.  \"I'm fine.  You're the one who's mind seems to have drifted off our project. Going on about me.  Did you get everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little confused.  Betty answered in Henry's voice, \"Yes.  Everything. Just like we need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.  I have the rest.  So now we can finish what we need to do.\"  Then slipping his Betty arm along Betty's Henry arm and clasping hands, Henry said,  \"The first thing we need to do is...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While he was thinking this, Betty had sneaked up behind him and plucked a maverick hair sticking out from the rest.\"Ow!\" Henry exclaimed, \"You could have used the scizzors!\"<br>\r\n \"It says that the hair needs to be plucked from the head or fallen out on its own, cutting it with scizzors means its definately going to fail.\"<br>\r\n \"You don't think this is going to work anyway, do you?\"<br>\r\n \"Oh come on, when was the last time you heard of anything like this, let alone anything like this that actually worked. If it did, millions of people would be doing it, and as they aren't it obviously doesn't work!\"<br>\r\n \"But maybe they all think that it wont work as well and so they don't do it!\" Henry retorted, he was certain this was going to work, how though, he wasn't so sure. \"Anyway, I think its worth a shot...\" Henry trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They added the hair and poured it into the bathtub. \"Right then\", said Betty \"My watch makes it 7:30,it says it takes 12 hours to complete so I'll meet you here at 8 to go to school, promise me you wont look until I get here, okay?\" despite herself, Henry knew that she was just as excited as he was to see the outcome.<br>\r\n \"I promise, see you then, bye!\", and with that, Betty went home. As Henry was cleaning up the bowl that they were using he noticed a long black curly hair trapped underneath the egg box. He'd already explained to his family that they couldn't use the bathroom that night because of a science project and there was an empty shower there just going to waste. \"Hmm... if we're making one of me, and it works, then the only one who can test it is Betty, but if I made another one without telling her then I could try it out too. If I do, I best keep it a secret from her though, I have a bad feeling about what she might do if she discovered...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Henry's alarm went off at 7, which he turned off and reluctantly got out of bed. That storm last night had woken him up several times and all Henry could think about was how little sleep he'd been able to get. Walking into the bathroom, Henry remembered that the suits would be almost done now. Looking into the bathtub, he could see a carbon copy of himself lying deflated across the base, it was still a little blurry around the edges though. Turning away from the unsettling sight of seeing your own skin a shrivelled pile in some bath, his eye caught on the shower where the suit of Betty was coming together. All he could see of this one was what looked like his friend's long black hair pressed up against the frosted panes of glass. A sudden realization hit him, it was 7:15 now, the suit of him would be ready at half past and Betty was coming at 8 to see the results, he hadn't told her about the one he was making of her and she was bound to notice it when she came in here to look at the other one. He would have to move it. But the instructions said not to disturb it until after 12 hours had passed... Henry had a look, it seemed solid enough, so he scooped the thing up in both hands and took it back to his bedroom. On the way back to his room, Henry noticed that from inside the 'head' which was lolling to the side, two small lights seemed to be glowing ever so slightly in the eye sockets. The glowing grew more intense, Henry was frantically looking round his room for somewhere out of the way to hide it. The wardrobe! He dashed over to it and yanked it open with a finger that wasn't holding the suit. He was about to throw it inside when the skin started to feel warm. The lights were still there in the eyes and Henry could have sworn that the thing turned its head and was looking at him. Literally frozen in fear, Henry met its gaze. Still feeling warm, the suit felt as if it was starting to melt but it wasn't dripping. Staring intently at Henry, the suit's toothless mouth opened and it made a large gasping sound, like someone inhaling after holding their breath for a while. Tearing his gaze from the horrid face, Henry looked at the rest of it which still felt like it was melting. It was. Not onto the floor though, rather into him. Henry almost wet himself with fear watching the thing seeping into his arms and bare chest. He tried to throw it into the wardrobe but it was stuck to him. It was still flowing into him, but to Henry's relief (or at least as relieved as he could feel given the circumstances) the lights in the suit's eyes had been extinguished and it was no longer looking at him. It looked as lifeless as before except it was slowly disappearing, the jawline had gone, now the nose...<br>\r\n Henry looked down in disbelief as the last long, curly black hair was sucked inside of him, leaving him standing there holding nothing but air. It had left no physical mark and other than some mental anguish, Henry was feeling fine. As he was examining himself, he noticed that like the suit had done before, his boxers were now slowly being absorbed into his waist. Not knowing what was happening and feeling more than a little bemused, Henry sat down on his bed and looked out the window. Very little was going through his mind, but he did have one thought \"I want my boxers back...\". To his amazement, he saw them starting to reappear out of his flesh, was it coincidence, had it even happened before? To test this, he pictured himself without them on. They promptly vanished. Looking at his clock, Henry realized that he'd better get ready for school, and that Betty would be round soon as well, he could figure out what was happening later. After making his boxers reappear and putting on his uniform, the same thing happened, the uniform began to disappear into his skin leaving him standing in the middle of his room in oly his boxers once more. Wondering if he could do the same thing as with his boxers, he willed his uniform to reappear, and it did.<br>\r\n He was starting to understand what was happening. It seemed like somehow after the incident with the Betty suit, every item of clothing he put on he somehow absorbed and stored inside him which he could then 'put on' again whenever he wanted. \"But I absorbed the suit too...\" Henry thought, picturing an image of the suit and the person it was made from.<br>\r\n The strangest feeling ran down every fibre of Henry's body, he could feel everything moving at once but he was going nowhere. It seemed like every bone in his body was being compressed, his jaw ached and skin burned. Looking down at his hands, he saw that what could only be the suit was re-emerging from him, changing his large, pasty white hands into the sleeker, slighter, more feminine hands of Betty. His clothes grew tighter and looser at the same time, tighter around the chest and waist, but looser around his arms, shoulders and legs. His new hands almost disappeared into the new length of his sleeves and his trousers started to scrunch up against the floor. Eventually, everything stopped and he stood there slightly breathless trying to figure out what had just occurred. Remembering how he could make anything he put on appear and disappear at will, his mind turned to the suit, that was what had caused it and, if he was following his logic correctly, that was what he was currently wearing. He looked directly down and was greeted with the sight of his shirt being stretched tightly over Betty's bust. A few strands of long, curly black hair fell down infront of his face. He was her.<br>\r\n It was getting closer to 8, the time when the real Betty would appear, so, thinking frantically he thought he came up with a solution. \"I can make the clothes I put on vanish and come back, so why should it be any different with this?\". He closed his eyes and pictured his old self looking in the mirror. To his relief, he started to return to normal. Things were expanding and shrinking in just the right place and by the end, his uniform fit perfectly again. A thought occurred to him, he could try changing into different people. He closed his eyes once more and pictured a girl who he had a bit of a crush on in school, Emily Ward. He had a perfect image of her in his mind, but the tingling didn't come. He was still Henry, \"If it is like the clothes, then maybe I have to make a suit of the person as well...\"<br>\r\n The doorbell rang, it was 8 and it was Betty coming to see how the Henry suit had turned out. Making their way up to the bathroom, Henry led Betty in to see it, at least he'd hidden her suit. Just like before, it was lying limp at the base of the tub. Betty gave a gasp of wonderment, not unlike the one the suit had recently given. \"WOW!!!\", she exclaimed \"I really didn't think anything would happen!\" She turned to look at him, grinning \"It says its some sort of disguise doesn't it?\" she inquired.<br>\r\n \"Well, erm, yes, I guess it does\" replied Henry, not quite sure he was liking where this was headed.<br>\r\n \"Can I try it on? Can I try it on now? Pleeeeease!?\" Betty squealed and reached inside the bath to grab it.<br>\r\n Henry sighed, he knew it. \"Ohh, go on then but be quick or we'll be late\", and with that he left the room for her to get changed. </span></div></div>",

She had pulled her skirt up for modesty over the male parts which made the whole sight surreal.  Henry just stood there with his mouth open seeing himself for the first time other than a reflection or a picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just too much.\" Betty giggled very enthusiastically.  \"I can't believe that it actually worked.  This fits perfectly although tight in a few spots.\" and she motioned at her chest where her breasts created a couple large male pecks obviously the suit had crushed her breasts as tight as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for finding this for our project.\"  She danced around stopping to look in the mirror a few times then came over and gave Henry a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry was still a bit stunned but gave Betty a hug back.  Rather than a quick hug, this hug seemed to go on forever.  That's when Henry noticed something happening that was more than a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Henry.  I can't let go.  What's happening?\" Betty gasped in surprise and partly panic.  \"I seem to be melting, or getting merged with you.  Henry?  <span class=\"cgrey\">Henry, help me.  <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Help me, pleee</font><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">eease.\"</font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Betty's voice faded away as did her whole body.  Henry stood there with his arms still out as if holding her, but she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>OMG!</i> thought Henry. <i> Betty's been pulled in by the suit that's in me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Henry decided that he must be able to reverse this the way he reversed his shape and clothes that were absorbed.  First he started to picture Betty, but then he realized that that would just bring the Betty suit out on him, and if he thought of himself, it would just be himself.  Henry began to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran into the bathroom and closed the door.  Betty's clothes, except the skirt, were on the floor.  He thought whether anyone had seen her come in the house.  He pondered how he would explain where she went.  He didn't think anyone would believe him about the suit that was now part of him and that it could absorb other things and people.  The last thing that entered his mind was Betty wearing the Henry suit and giving him a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Henry? Where are you?  What has happened?\"  It was Betty's voice coming from his mouth, but he was not in control.  He could sense Betty's thoughts as well and feel everything she was doing.  He wondered now where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Henry, this isn't funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Betty, can you hear me?</i> Henry thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty began to look around. \"Where are you? I can hear you but can't see you.  Are you invisible or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped and looked into the mirror.  That's when Henry could see that image and realized he had changed entirely into her as she looked in the Henry-suit, <u>but</u> he was now inside of her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Something, I guess.  I think I am inside you or we are somehow combined.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Henry, quit talking nonsense and show yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Betty, I need to tell you something.  First, I'm not talking and you don't have to talk.  I can hear your thoughts.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hear my thoughts?  Right.  He must think I'm stupid.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, I don't think you're stupid.  I think your smart.  So use those smarts and believe me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?  Really.  This is amazing!\"  Betty exclaimed out loud then thought, <i>I mean this is amazing.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It may be amazing, but we have to figure out how to get us apart.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>OK. Henry.  I think there's more that you haven\u2019t told me.  Time to spill it.</i>  Then Henry explained all that had happened about the second suit and moving it and becoming part of it and how it absorbed things.  He knew he could control some things by thinking them, but ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Henry, think now that you are separate from me and we are both standing separately in the room.</i> Betty interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Henry cleared his mind and thought of both he and Betty, two separate beings.  He started to get that strange tingly feeling and then his body felt like it was tearing itself apart first like pulling a piece of skin off then like jam was oozing out of his body.  He kept thinking and slowly Betty began to reform from the mess of ooze in front of him until she was all there and he changed to look like himself.  Unfortunately, she was all there but only wearing her skirt without the Henry-suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betty. It worked.  You're back.\" he said as his eyes immediately focused on her naked chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness.\" Betty said just before realizing what Henry was staring at.  She gave a scream and wrapped her arms around her chest.  \"Get out so I can get dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry then ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He certainly didn't want anything like that happening again, but on the other hand, every thing he absorbed hightened his new-found ability... He needed to find out all he could about what he could now do, but how? A little while later Betty emerged from the bathroom looking slightly worse for wear, she marched right of to Henry and put the palm of her hand squarely on his forehead.<br>\r\n \"Excellent\", she said, hand still in place, \"Its just as I thought...\". Henry just looked at her blankly so she went on to say \"The suit which is inside of you, I don't think its going to come out. I think it needs you to 'live', a little like a parasite. Its a fairly simple premise really, you supply it with excess nutrients and oxygen and things like that and in return it gives you a hightened ability to find these nutrients and whatnot so increacing both your and its chances of survival which in turn increaces the probability of you passing your and its genetic information onto the next generation.\" Henry was none the wiser and still looked puzzled but there was more still to come. \"I reckon that the suit thing has merged with your DNA, the coding that makes you you, and from the looks of what I've seen so far and been part of, I would say that everything you 'absorb' you can 'unabsorb' as you did with me however its structure remains hidden in its 'plastic memory' until it is acessed by your concious mind.\" She stopped, took her hand off his forehead and stared at him breathing heavily after her long monologue with a look of both amazement and fear on her face. <br>\r\n Henry was starting to get the picture, \"So you're saying that this thing is stuck inside me, its not coming out and there's nothing I can do about it?\"<br>\r\n Betty nodded, \"Precisely, it is you and you are it, you can't be separated... are you O.K?\"<br>\r\n Henry could scarcely believe what he was hearing, the whole thing just sounded preposterous, \"I'm not sure... I mean there is this thing inside of me and I'm going to keep 'picking things up' because of it for my whole life\"<br>\r\n \"Yes, but think of the possibilities.\" said Betty. Henry was sure she was formulating a plan no doubt involving him, but for now she was keeping it to herself. \"Wait here for a second.\" she said, returning to the bathroom. The door had hardly closed before it reopened, something smallish, long and black shot out on a collision course with Henry's head. \"Catch!\" came a cry from the bathroom. Henry's hand shot up and caught it, plucking it fromn the air. He looked down at it in confusion, it was Betty's bra. Before long he felt the usual sensation of the item of clothing seeping into his skin and sure enough, a few seconds later it had gone. \"Well give it back then!\" came an irate yell from the bathroom. Trying to do as he did before with Betty, Henry pictured himself holding the bra. To his relief, it re-emerged from his hands so he stuck it back through the open crack of the door into the bathroom feeling it being taken from his hand. Less than a minute later, Betty came out and, seeing Henry's dumbfounded look, gave him a sly little wink and said \"That's for later, just in case\".<br>\r\n Henry was starting to regret how smart Betty was and could only imagine at the things she was thinking up. \"Right then\", sighed Betty, \"That's enough of that, for now at least\", she shot him a dark look and then brightly added \"Off to school then, we're going to be late!\"  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Betty and Henry rushed down the street and just barely got to the bus before it pulled away from the stop.  As they got on together, the other kids looked at them.  Some chuckled, some whispered to their seatmate, and two girls just shook their heads.  They both sat together and immediately had the same thought: <i>They think we're a couple.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty just contentedly smiled while Henry grimaced.  The last thing he wanted was for others to think he and Betty were a couple.  He liked Emily, although he had never had the courage to tell her or even ask her out.  He turned and stared out the window not knowing how much worse the day could get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty knew that half the school would know by noon that the two of them had been doing something that caused them to race for the bus.  The rumors would probably place them under a tree kissing or behind a bush ... well, ... not yet.  Betty had better plans for Henry than that although she did like him a lot.  Her scientific side was more interested in experiments of another kind.  She thought about Henry's merge with the Betty-suit and what her DNA in it would do mixed with his DNA, and she wondered why she came out without the Henry-suit she had on when she merged.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the bus pulled up at school and opened its doors, Henry sat and let Betty and the others off the bus, then trailed everyone into the school.  He kept his distance from everyone, scared he might suck someone else into his body.  He even held his pack away from his body just in case.  He chanted a greeting to the usual guys, but made his way straight to his locker and swapped books for morning classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he turned around taking a quick step down the hall without looking, he ran smack into Emily.  Both their books crashed to the floor as Emily fell backwards and he stumbled on top of her.  His body began to tingle, and he began to get flushed as he reached his arms around Emily to try to push himself up and roll off her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I .. I .. I'm so sorry, Emily.\" he stammered as panic shook him thinking he would make her melt under him and disappear in front of everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're something else, Henry.\" she responded matter-of-factly. \"How many girls are you planning to take over today?  Wasn't Betty enough?\" implying she obviously already heard of their getting on the bus out of breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapidly words just streamed out of Henry's mouth as his confused mind tried to sort out what she said and his own thoughts about her.  \"I'm sorry. Er ... No .. Just you ... I mean, just had an experiment with Betty ... for science ... you know, project partner. I mean she's not ... it's you I like ... I didn't mean on purpose.  I ... I ... I ...\"  As what he had said hit him like a wet fish, he stopped and stared for two moments then went to pick up his books managing to bump heads with Emily as he bent down where she was gathering hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!  I must say you have a rather unique way to approach a girl.  Have you ever thought of doing it a little less painfully?\" she said rubbing her head and starting to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry couldn't raise his head to look at her because he was just too embarrassed.  But after he picked up her last book and handed it to her, his eyes finally found some courage and glanced at her face.  She was smiling broadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm having a party tonight, just because it's Friday.  It'd be great if you could come, and maybe we could try this dance without the books.\"  She then winked at him and strode back off with her friends quietly talking amongst themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry was so elated that he completely forgot about everything else that had happened that morning and clutched his books tight to his chest.  He felt warm and tingly and would have given off a deep sigh if Betty hadn't tapped him on the shoulder causing him to gasp in surprise and again drop his books instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent.\" she said with a sinister tone and smirk.  Helping him pick up his books, she whispered to him, \"I know now just how we should test out this merged suit capabilities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was fairly normal for both of them, although Betty began to feel itchy all over and kept having old memories pop into her head as if replaying parts of her life for some reason. Henry began to feel more and more confident as the day went on.  By noon Betty's itching had become a tingling all over her skin like something was crawling along it, or more precisely, under it.  By the end of school though, that had stopped and both were eager for the evening's adventures.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was about halfway there, when she started to get very dizzy.  She was right in front of the girls lav and quickly ducked inside.  She went into a stall shutting the door then put out one hand on the wall to steady herself and lowered her head, closing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to feel very warm and her body seemed to be rolling inside.  Then she thought she felt her skin starting to bubble and pulse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was this something because of her encounter with Henry this morning?\" she wondered thinking about the Henry suit she had made and had worn to show Henry.  Henry!  She needed to get Henry and do a few experiments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes still looking down.  That's when she noticed something strange.  Her legs had hair on them.  Hair as if she hadn't shaved them in months.  They weren't that way this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty straightened up and instinctively took her hand to brush her hair back.  There wasn't any!  At least, her long hair was gone.  She could feel really short hair.  Then she saw her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arm was not her usual thin arm with light colored hair.  It was much more muscular and had dark hair on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty listened and could hear that the restroom was empty and there was no sound coming from the hallway either.  Most everyone would be gone and on their way home, so Betty opened the stall door and ran to look in the mirror.  What she saw didn't scare or even amaze her since it was exactly what she thought she would see.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It seems the outward physical appearance of subject one, Henry, has layered itself over subject two's, myself, skeletal structure.  Noting that I feel perfectly comfortable in my visibly unaltered clothes, that they still fit me, I must be the size I was this morning.  Also I perceive I am no taller than I was before.\" Betty noted to herself.  \"Also despite having the outward appearance of Subject One, Subject Two, myself, my feet are still small and petite and my skull is feminine, it's lowered forehead betraying it's smaller internal brain case.\" Betty pondered.  \"In theory, since I am smaller and female, if Henry's and my own brain could be extracted to whose was large larger by placing them side by side, according to scientific research Henry's brain should be larger due to his gender and greater height.  Though the same research notes the female is more compact and size has no bearing on one's intelligence.\" Betty resolved in her mind as that bit of information.  \"Being that I theorize my current situation is a due to a result of Henry's parasitic suit and it's forced incorporation of Subject Two, myself.  I postulize that my own Henry suit is doing a similar incorporation into myself.  So if this is true, mentally by force of will I can control this suit like Subject One, Henry, does so.\" she conjectured.  Betty looked in the mirror and focusing on thinking of her true form's appearance, with concentration she restored herself to her recognizable form as she felt odd sensations as she felt her body mold back to her original form.</span></div></div>",

She could still feel she was a girl in the stall with breasts and female anatomy, and now the mirror confirmed that she had partially mutated into Henry.  What she must have been feeling all day was the Henry skin-suit trying to find its way back out of her body.  Her thoughts about Henry must have caused it to surface just with her will power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow this morning's merge with Henry in the lightening-changed Betty-suit had done something to her Henry-suit.  Betty's analytical thought process discerned that the Henry-suit had been absorbed into her body but wasn't as capable as the Betty-suit.  Both were biologically similar and were probably somewhat alive.  It didn't have the electric shock to jolt it to life, but the merge with the Betty-suit must have given it the same capabilities as that one.  It must be still evolving! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing she didn't want to be caught as a Betty-Henry mutant in the girls lav, she began to think of herself and her own body.  Betty's strong mental prowess had the suit obey almost immediately unlike Henry's difficulty this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty knew she could easily control the suit with her mind and thought how great a science project this was turning out to be.  It was all she could have ever dreamed of to discover a bio-technology that could merge with a human. Besides being a great disguise, she wondered what other capabilities it may have.  Was it just a skin still, or could it be used to alter internal parts as well?  It may have great benefits not just to science but to health if a person could be trained to control it and modify diseases, tumors, cancers, ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo wrapped-up in her thoughts Betty didn't realize how much time had gone by.  She still needed to work with Henry to put her plan into action for Emily's party, although maybe there was a better plan now that she had the ability to impersonate Henry, or soon would once the suit fully evolved to go completely to Henry under her will power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry would be long gone by now so there was no need to go to his locker.  She would need to go catch up with him on his way home.  She grabbed her books and headed out the side door and towards the shortcut to Henry's house.  Henry would never take this path because it went by the cemetery, and he was sure ghosts and goblins really existed even in daylight.  Using the shortcut, she should easily be able to catch him before he got home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had been thinking almost exclusively about her for the last two periods and didn't really remember what either of those teachers had said.  Henry was floating with happiness and wasn't paying attention to anything as he closed his locker and turned to rush off home to get ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hen ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOof.  Henry had whirled around again and smacked right into Emily, ...  again.  Fortunately, they were still both standing this time, but Henry turned tomato red when he saw who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. Sorry.  I, I, ... I am so  ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Henry.  That's OK.\" Emily smiled very nicely back at him while Henry tried to figure out how to act and say something cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since we seemed destined to keep meeting like this, maybe it would be safer if you walk me home now for the party so we avoid another crash?\" she giggled and continued to smile back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, sure. OK.\" came out of Henry's mouth while his brain was still trying to process the fact that Emily, THE Emily, was beside him and asking him to walk her home.  Like a puppy obeying, Henry started off down the hall and out the door with Emily beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily did think Henry was cute, but more importantly she knew Henry was not a gallivant like a lot of the other guys who were asking her out on dates.  Henry was nice and unpolished, but he wasn't stupid.  She didn't care if he was an athlete or the most handsome guy.  She wanted someone stable and interested in her.  She could tell he was infatuated with her and would be easily trained and leashed to provide a good honest boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked, she tested him first by just getting him to walk her home.  Next by holding out her pack that he readily accepted and carried.  Now it was to find out something about him that would determine whether he could really be trusted and if she should continue her pursuit.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll get you a glass of the punch that'll be at my party tonight, see what you make of it.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Dumbfounded at being asked into Emily's house, Henry nodded and followed her into the house. Emily had disappeared off into the kitchen leaving Henry standing in the hall, still holding Emily's bag. \"Just set it down by the side and find a seat on the sofa\", Emily called out from the other room, \"Oh and take your shoes off before you go in as well please, mum would go mental if she saw mud on the carpet.\" Henry obeyed and left his shoes by the door before finding the door that would take him into the living room where Emily was already waiting, two glasses in her hands. Giving one of them to Henry she said, \"do tell me what you think, it'd be horrible if nobody likes it tonight\". Taking a seat in a quite large red fabric armchair, Henry took a sip. Emily perched on one of the arms, \"So?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Henry swirled his glass around and held it up to his nose before answering causing Emily to let out a little giggle. \"The bouquet is strong yet delicate and fruity but not overly. Yes. It'll do.\" Henry looked up at her on the arm of the chair with a snooty over-the-top look like he'd seen on tv when people were wine tasting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah, yes, rather.\" Emily said in an equally over-the-top manner, returning his gaze before laughing loudly and slipping down the side of the chair to the seat causing them both to be pushed together. The seat was large but not quite large enough for both of them meaning that Emily's right leg was half covering Henry's left. Emily rested her hand on his knee in such a fashion that it looked like it had just fallen off her leg and didn't mean to be there. With a little sigh, Emily lent back in the seat, brushing back Henry's shoulder on the way, causing him to do the same. For a moment they sat there before Emily asked \"Hey, did you see what happened to Leona in the lunch room today?\". Henry had but he shook his head to get Emily to continue talking. \"Aww shame, it was hilareous!\", Henry looked at her intruiged but as he did, he felt a now familiar sensation coming from his knee. Emily continued, \"One of the first years, you know how today the lunch staff served custard on a plate yeah? Well it was an accident waiting to happen really wasn't it?\" Henry nodded in agreement casting a glance down at his knee where the whole of Emily's lower half had been absorbed into his body. *She's going to notice soon*, he thought, *need to keep her talking, once she's in I can just think her back out again*. Mind racing, Henry tuned back into Emily's conversation, \"You should have seen the look on her face, amazing! I think it was Oliver, you know, Dean's little brother that did it, but it can't have been planned 'cos he was on the verge of tears after.\" Henry let out some sympathetic noises, noticing that now it was just Emily's shoulders and head that were left. Due to how they were sitting, it had been relatively quickly and unnoticable how Emily had merged with Henry, but now came the most difficult part.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n In an effort to keep her attention distracted, Henry asked \"Did she manage to get it all out before the end of lunch?\"<br>\r\n \"Yeah she did but her hair was all over the place for the rest of the day and you could see bits of corn starch in her black hair sticking out everywhere\" Emily replied.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n By now, Emily's neck and shoulders had disappeared into Henry's body and her chin was now resting on his shoulder, ready to start being taken in. Henry was at a loss of what to do, she hadn't noticed so far but surely this was about to change. Thinking quickly Henry said \"Close your eyes, I want to try a magic trick on you.\" To Henry's amazement, Emily went along with it, closing her eyes as her chin was beginning to disappear. \"Now listen carefully, you have to keep your eyes closed and you cant say anything otherwise it'll be ruined O.K?\" Henry took her silence as a yes. \"When I tell you to open your eyes, you will be in a completely different place to before but you wont have felt like you have moved an inch.\" Pleased at his quick thinking, but unsure if it would work, Henry looked down to see Emily's chin, mouth, nose and ears had vanished into his shoulder. *How could this be happening?* he thought, *I'm wearing clothes, surely this shouldn't happen!* Remembering the morning when he had absorbed his school uniform this way, he realized that his uniform must now be a part of him and able to absorb things into him as if it were his skin. Looking down at his shoulder, all he could see was a tuft of blonde hair sticking out the side, by the time he got up, this too had gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n From inside his head he heard a voice \"Can I open my eyes yet?\", it said. Henry jumped at hearing it before realizing it was Emily coming from inside. *Not just yet*, he thought back. Now, where to put her? Henry dashed into the kitchen and saw a straw dog basket on the tiled floor with a large blue cushion in it. *There seems to be as good a place as any*, he thought to himself. \"What was that?\" came Emily's voice. *Nothing, I'm just deciding where to put you*, Henry reassured her. He couldn't sense any panic coming from her so Henry knew she still had her eyes closed. Picturing in his mind Emily curled up in a ball in the dog basket, with her uniform on as she was wearing today, Henry concentrated on removing her from his body. To his relief, a puddle started to form around his feet which spread towards the basket and onto the pillow where it started to build in volume in a crouched position where Henry imagined her to be. Henry could have died of happiness when Emily rematerialized fully alive, breathing, still with her eyes closed and more importantly, still in her clothes, in the dog basket. In a low voice Henry said, \"You can open your eyes now\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Well its about time, I was wondering what you were doing\", she opened her eyes, \"Ohhhh myyyy...\". Emily looked up at Henry with an expression of fear and amazement on her face. Getting up to her feet she looked Henry dead in the eye. \"How on earth...? I was on the chair, we both were, then I felt warm all over and now... I'm in the dog basket? How did you do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The plan seemed to have went off without a hitch, \"A magician never reveals his secrets, unless you're that masked man person of course.\" Henry smiled at Emily who returned his smile, burst out laughing and flung her arms around him. \"Oh, wait a minute, you've got dog hairs all over you now, let me help\". Henry started to pluck the small hairs one by one from around her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Emily put her hand on top of Henry's as he reached for another hair and squeezed it. Bringing his hand down to her side, she lent up to him and gave Henry a kiss on the cheek. \"I said I could sense it being exciting with you\". Henry blushed. Emily was distracted by the clock on the wall, \"Hey its almost half five! I need to get ready for tonight, you do too. I've told everyone to get here for 8 but if you want to have something to eat and dont have the time at yours I'll have extra chips at the ready at half seven.\" She gave him a little wink. \"Now let me show you to the door, remember, half seven!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Henry was standing outside the house before he knew it, the last hour seemed just a blur. *Well, time to get home and get ready I suppose* thought Henry. He was so excited that as he walked his knees were trembling slightly. *Hang on a minute*, Henry thought, *I absorbed Emily just then, exactly like how I did with Betty and my clothes this morning, maybe...* Henry looked around and saw in the distance, on the way back to his house, the unisex public toilets. *They're all cubicles, no one would know and it wont look suspicious if I go into either the mens or womens, I could even go out the back exit just in case anyone saw me go in* Henry, pleased at his new thought picked up his pace as he headed towards the toilets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Henry concealed himself inside one of the cubicles and sat on the toilet with the lid down. Without much effort, Henry was able to conjure up a picture of Emily as she had been five minutes ago and could feel himself starting to change. Still with his eyes closed, focusing hard, Henry could feel his short hair lengthen and brush against his shoulders. He could feel his trousers merge together at the bottom and start to recede up his legs leaving back a thin constricting feeling which Henry assumed were tights. On the same wave of movement, he could feel his male item travel upwards and into him and his boxers shrinking to cover the gap. When Henry was sure he had stopped shifting about, he opened his eyes. He saw the back of the toilet door, that was to be expected really. He got up, feeling a slight draft up his skirt and against his tight-clad legs and opened the door. Remembering to flush the toilet beforehand to make it believable to anyone who could be watching, Henry stepped out and made his way over to the sinks. There were mirrors over the sinks which Henry saw himself, or rather Emily, looking back at him out of. In stunned silence, Henry washed his hands and busied himself sorting out his fringe which was now obscuring some of his vision. Once finished, Henry calmly made his way out of the other exit and set off to home not believing the events of the last few hours. He was now, it seemed, going out with Emily and furthermore, at this point in time, he was Emily. Making sure not to arouse any suspisions, Henry felt his stomach do a flip as he scurried on home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n What Henry didn't know however was that Betty had been there when Henry went into Emily's house and had waited on a bench a little down the road until he came out. She then proceeded to track him through the streets to where Henry went into the toilets. Waiting in the shrubbery outside where he went in, Betty waited. And waited. She had made up her mind not to let Henry slip away but now it seemed that he had eluded her for now. She scolded herself for failing to take into account the double entrance and set off for his house, half an hour after he had left the toilets. She knew that Henry had been invited to the party, and she also knew that she hadn't. If she could find a way in and embarass Henry, she would have rites over him again. Betty however didn't know the full capabilities of Henry's suit, capabilities that hers would never have. All she knew is that she had to get Henry back, or at least away from Emily.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Walking up his street as Emily, Henry was enjoying a slight breeze and was lost in his own little world thinking about the events of the last couple of days. He was both excited and scared at what was happening, both with what was happening with the suit and his new-found friendship with Emily. He realized at this point that he still looked like Emily, catching himself with one hand on his front door handle, he checked to make sure the street was clear before changing back. He felt everything that had happen in the toilets happen in reverse but he had to force himself to focus on picturing himself which made this transformation a lot harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He opened the door into the house and stepped inside, there were sounds coming from the kitchen signifying his mom was home but other than that, the house was empty. He made his way up to his room, throwing his bag on the floor he flopped on the bed. *I hope Betty doesn't come round, I'm sorry that she wasn't invited but I have to go, this might be my only chance!* he thought to himself. Picking himself up to his feet he glanced at his bedside clock, it was six o'clock. *Better get ready then*, he decided. However, he then had a bad thought. *If I have absorbed my uniform, then didn't Betty say it was now a part of me? Can I take it off the normal way?* It was worth a try to see if it was stuck on him so Henry tried to take off the uniform normally. To his relief it worked. He had slung the uniform onto his fold-out sofa where it lay there in a heap. *Well that was easier than expected* he thought whilst looking at the clothes. *What did she mean then?* Henry had to find out so he closed his eyes and 'saw' the uniform that he had just taken off back on himself. Sure enough, he could feel the touch of the fabric covering himself once more. Opening his eyes, he was shocked to see that his uniform was not only on himself, but still on the sofa. *I must 'make' the clothes then...* he thought puzzledly. Another glance at the clock told him that he had better start getting ready properly so he thought the new uniform away again. Going to his cupboard, he pulled out a red checkered shirt and some beige-ish trousers and put them on. As soon as he had finished buttonning his shirt up and his trousers were on he felt a now familiar feeling. Looking down, he had started the process of absorbing these clothes. With a sigh, he thought *can't I hurry this up?* Trying everything he could think of, to the point of pushing the fabric into him but to no avail, Henry finally tried imagining himself standing there with the clothes on and watching them be absorbed at a super quick pace. The suit followed his commands, sucking the clothes inside before Henry thought them back up to the surface. *That might save some time...* Henry thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n At that moment, the doorbell rang. He could hear his mother going to answer it but Henry could sense the worst. Racing down the stairs, Henry caught his mother making her way to the door. \"Mum!\", he said loudly but not so loudly it could be heard through the door, \"If its Betty can you please tell her that we're all going out to dinner or something, or maybe going to see gran. Just don't let her in tonight!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Henry's mum looked at him confused but nodded her head \"Alright sweetie but you're going to have to tell me why after I deal with it\". Henry hid with his back to the wall while his mom answered the door. Sure enough, Betty was standing there still in her uniform as she had been this morning when she came to check on the suits. Henry could hear Betty ask for him and explain how it was 'very important' for them to be together tonight to finish their science project. He could see his mother start to bend under the pressure of making him finish an assignment but Henry was relieved when she said \"Sorry, not tonight Betty we're all going out for a meal together soon and wont be back until late. Anyway, you kids have the whole weekend to finish.\" Henry could imagine Betty flustered at being denied what she wanted, but he could also imagine there being no way for her to argue, which was a rarity. After another minute or so, Henry's mom closed the door and turned to face him. \"Well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Henry had no other option to explain his plans for tonight, his mother was someone that nobody could argue with or withold information from without her knowing. \"So if you could drive me over to Emily's house in half an hour it would be most appreciated, I'll walk back home if you want\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And Betty wasn't invited you say? Shame... But yes I suppose I could take you there, give me a ring when you want to come back, I dont want you wandering the streets alone after dark.\" With that, she left to go back to the kitchen. There was still half an hour left before they needed to set off so Henry threw himself onto the downstairs sofa and turned on the tv. Out of the corner of his eyes he could have sworn he saw what looked like himself enter through the front door and make his way upstairs but he didn't linger long on the idea *Must've been my sister* he thought. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Climbing into the car, Henry was sure he could hear noises coming from what seemed like his bedroom but he thought nothing of it, *Chloe's probably just messing around* he thought. The 10 minute drive to Emily's house seemed like ages to Henry, he and his mother sat there in an awkward silence which Henry didn't want to break in case his mom started making him uncomfortable with questions. \"Thanks Mum\" Henry muttered as he stepped out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No problem sweetie, now remember to phone me to get me to pick you up. Midnight at the latest!\", and with that she drove off. Henry stood there on the side of the street taking it all in. It was a little after 7:30, 7:32 to be precise. Henry's stomach growled and snapped him back to reality, the offer of chips (french fries) was in the air and he hadn't eaten anything since lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He walked up to the door and rang the bell. Almost instantaneously it opened to reveal Emily's grinning face. \"I knew you'd come early but you had me worried for a minute\", she was standing in the doorway barefoot in a greenish plaid dress ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.gojane.com/40754-dresses-spaghetti-strap-plaid-dress.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.gojane.com/40754-dresses-spag...</a> ). Henry stood there gobsmacked realizing that he hadn't acually seen Emily in any other clothes than her uniform before. \"Well don't just stand there! Come in!\", Emily swang the door wide and walked back inside towards the kitchen, \"Remember shoes!\" she said pointing at an assortment of footwear by the door. Henry slipped his shoes off and followed her inside. Emily turned to face him in the kitchen where there were two plates of chips on the table, seeing them attract Henry's attention she said \"Thought you might be hungry, now tell me, are you a ketchup man or more of a brown sauce kinda guy?\" She paused by the fridge waiting for his answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Brown sauce all the way\", replied Henry, settling himself down at the table.<br>\r\n A large smile spread across Emily's face, \"Really!? I can't believe it, everyone always wants red but I hate the stuff.\" She brought the bottle over to the table and sat down opposite. \"I think we've got a lot in common\" she said, gazing at Henry and pushing a chip into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After a while when they had both finished and moved into the living room where Emily had put some music on, not exactly Henry's taste but he didn't mind, the doorbell went. \"Oooh, they've started to get here!\", she sprang up excitedly from her seat, \"Come answer the door with me!\". Henry was unsure as to why answering the door was a two man mission but he complied. They both walked to the door, Henry hung back a little way from the door. \"Closer!\", said Emily. Henry shuffled a little closer. \"No, 'closer'!, she repeated putting emphasis on the last word. Henry sidled up alongside her. Emily pushed him so that he was standing behind but to the side of her, with his side touching the back of her left arm. With a quick turn and flick, giving Henry a face full of hair, Emily had placed his hand on her furthest shoulder, and in the same movement opened the door. Behind the door were a gaggle of about five of her friends: Laura, Joanne, Lucy, Nikki and her boyfriend Gareth. When they first saw Henry standing there with his hand on Emily's shoulder, Henry could see that they were a little confused, but that didn't last for long as Emily said \"Hey everyone, glad you could come! You all know Henry right?\", as she said this last bit, Emily snuggled down into the crook of Henry's arm, \"Come on in!\". She stepped to the side forcing Henry to do the same, \"Shoes!\", shrieked Emily and then followed them into the other room.</span></div></div>",

Apart from himself and Gareth, no other boys turned up. Henry had never really spoken to Gareth before, he hadn't spoken to anyone here before, he had no reason to. However, as Henry left Emily with the other girls and took a seat on the sofa, Gareth sat down with him. He was taller than average with brown hair cut in a short back and sides fashion but it wasn't very short, he obviously spent a large amount of time at the gym and from what Henry knew from watching the lunchtime football on the yard, he was very athletic. \"Orite mate?\", he said, sitting down next to Henry. \"Can't say I wasn't surprised to see you here, no offense. How long have the two of you been together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Henry was quite taken aback by this, he didn't really think that him and Emily could be considered as together. \"Errrm...well...about half a day...maybe?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Now it was Gareth's turn to look shocked, \"Really? But the way Emily looked around you when she answered the door, I could have sworn you must have been together much longer.\" Henry was surprised by this compliment, he didn't think Gareth would have anything to say to him. \"Well Nikki has always wanted one of her friends to be in a relationship that's lasted as long as ours, but I reckon yours looks pretty good. This isn't exactly my idea but I'm sure Nikki would love it if the two of you joined us out for a meal sometime, you know, a sort of double date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Unsure what to say, Henry looked at him. After some thinking he managed, \"Yeah, could be good. But I can't really agree on my own you know? And besides we haven't even been out just yet, I only realized that something must be going on when you said it just then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Aye well that's Emily for you\", agreed Gareth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Emily then came over and sat on Henry's lap, \"Whatya talking about?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Gareth looked at Henry, \"You know... stuff.\" Emily seemed happy enough at this answer and reclined back into Henry. Henry put his hand up and stroked the back of Emily's head. He was happy but he had to stay focused so he didn't accidentally turn into the girl he was holding, or worse, absorb the dress she was wearing.</span></div></div>",

Most of Emily's friends had gone and he had been dragged to the door with her to wave them off. A little later and the last person had left. Emily turned on her heel to face Henry, walking up to him slowly, \"So that's that then, now its just you and me\". Henry had to admit that this party was not exactly what he was expecting. From the personalities of the people at school, he was expecting there to be a lot of drink, a couple of people to be throwing up, and for it to finish well into the night. Compared to what he was expecting, this seemed much more, for want of a better word, civilized. A quick look at the clock on the sideboard told him it was only 11:30. Emily had sidled right up to him and had thrown her arms around his neck, \"Gareth was telling me that he and Nikki want us to go out with them in a week or so, like a double date sort of arrangement, what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Henry had already heard this so he pretended to think about it, \"Seems fine with me.\" He was still a little confused at what had actually happened today. \"So... does this mean... like are we... are we dating?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Emily threw her head back laughing, \"Of course it does! That's what I like about you Henry, you're not as pushy as the other boys, you actually listen to what I say\", she moved her head closer to his, \"and... you're cute as anything as well\". With that, she pecked a kiss on his cheek and buried her head in his neck where she stayed for a while. As this was happening, Henry could feel what he could only assume was her dress starting to seep into his skin. Like he had done before, he consentrated on speeding up the process and managed to make it reappear on her before she noticed. \"What's the matter H? You seem a little tense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Henry realized that this was because he was concentrating hard so conciously made himself relax, but he still had to come up with an answer. Looking Emily straight in the eye he said \"Its nothing... I just really like you, and I don't want to stop holding you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This made Emily blush, \"Aww, you're so sweet as well, I don't want to stop either.\" and she reburied her head in his neck. Henry caught a glimpse at the clock again, now it was quarter to twelve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Listen\", said Henry, \"I've got to go, its been great tonight, see you again very soon!\" Emily walked Henry to the door where she gave him another kiss and stood in the doorway watching him go up the path. Once Henry was back in the street, he made his way to a bench a little down the road, rang his mum and waited to be picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Once home, Henry made his way straight to his room. The day had been tiring and he didn't realize that all his clothes had been moved around, like someone had been searching for something. As he was drifting off to sleep, an image of Emily in the green dress filled his head. He felt himself changing but did nothing about it, he was already asleep. </span></div></div>",

Cursing himself quietly, he rolled over to switch it off but instead saw a slender tanned hand reaching for it. Realizing with a start that he must have changed in his sleep, Henry got up and went over to his mirror. Gazing back at him with quite a bad case of bed-hair was Emily as she had been the night before. Henry saw the reflection blush and raised a hand to his face to check it was actually him. He still couldn't quite believe what had happened. It was early and a Saturday so no-one else was up but Henry couldn't get back to sleep, over the last week a flock of crows had built their nests in the tree next to his window and they were making a racket. Henry didn't really want to go downstairs either, out of the corner of his eye reflected in the mirror he saw his computer and had what seemed to him like a brilliant idea. Making himself change back to who he really was, wearing boxers, he went over and switched on the computer. It didn't take long for him to load it up and access this internet, where he could test his exciting idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Henry noticed he might be getting a little too excited at this idea so decided to change into Betty because even though he was alone, he was a little bit embarrassed. As the only clothes of Betty's that he had in his 'memory' were her school uniform, that appeared on him as well. Taking off the blazer, hanging it on the side of the chair, Henry proceeded. Pushing back his now long, black, curly hair Henry paused for a moment. Searching for inspiration, Henry remembered a program that his mom had been watching the other day. He typed into the search bar, 'Tyra Banks' hit enter and was immediately confronted with lots of images of her and her modelling career. Choosing one in particular he liked, he copied it onto a word document. Now he had hit another problem, with everything else, he had had to absorb the thing beforehand, how could he make it work now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  With a strike of inspiration, Henry saw the scanner plugged in his USB port. *If things from out here can go in through it, can't things from in there come out?* he though to himself. Opening the scanner, he placed his Betty hand inside, closing it back down as far as it would go. He pushed the long black hair back out of his eyes with the other hand and focused on the picutre on the screen. Hitting the scan button, Henry could feel the suit starting to tingle. Concentrating on the picture, Henry waited. The scanner's light went out signifying that it had finished. Excitedly, Henry took his hand out and began to concentrate again, only this time the image was in his head. Opening his eyes, Henry was disappointed to find nothing had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  As he looked at his unchanged hands, Henry felt as if he had just been told something. Suddenly he had a thought but he didn't know where it came from, *I need a biosignature of a living being to work, I need only a picture of someone who has never lived to work*. Slightly frightened at this thought ringing through his head, Henry had the absurd feeling that the suit had communicated to him. Meditating on these words for a minute, Henry came to the conclusion that his original idea had failed and wouldn't work. Just as he was about to close his computer down though, the second part came back to him. *Someone who has never lived*, he thought, *What is that?* Looking round the room his eyes fell on his gaming magazine, specifically Mario who was gracing the front page with his presence. *He's never lived I suppose...* Henry thought to himself, a new plan formulating in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Reopening the internet, Henry paused again, thinking what to enter. Casting his mind back, he tried to remember something his little sister was watching the other day. With a start, he remembered that a couple of days ago his family had had to endure another showing of her perennial favourite movie, 'Cinderella'. *Why not?* he thought to himself, entering it into the search bar. After clicking on the first image that came up ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.kellyskindergarten.com/Games/GamestoMake/images/Cinderella.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.kellyskindergarten.com/Games/...</a> ), he copied and pasted the picture into Word, like he did before. Replacing his hand in the scanner, he hit 'scan'. Focusing on the image, Henry could feel his hand starting to tingle again, but unlike before, the tingling spread up his arm and around his whole body. After the light went out, Henry got up and made his way to the center of the room. Looking at his clock, he was surprised to see that it was already 8:30, his sister would be up soon and start waking up the whole neighbourhood. Closing his eyes, Henry tried to recall the picture on the screen and focused hard.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite all of Henry's positive anticipation, when he looked down, there was no change. He waited for a minute since sometimes the suit didn't appear immediately, but there was no more tingling and still no visible changes.  He wondered what he may have done wrong or why it wouldn't work.  So he started to analyze each aspect of his theory and method he used to establish the proof and arrive at failure.  First he concentrated on being himself to make sure that the skin suit still reacted to thought.  Within about fifteen seconds, he was back to male Henry.  Next he replayed the setup he was using - the computer and scanner and the picture and his concentration and the tingling.  The only difference was that when he absorbed something that affected the suit, it was real not a picture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the instructions from building the suit popped up clear in his head and the one special ingredient that was needed to determine what the skin suit would turn out to look like - a hair from the person.  The hair was part of that person.  It contained that microscopic, small, molecular level stuff he had learned about in science that was in every cell of a person and described each person like a blueprint of what a person would be.  ... The DNA.  And then just like people, the clothes must contain its own inanimate DNA or whatever that makes it unique. (although not that good in science and math like Betty, Henry was good at imagination, and when his imagination took off, just about anything could happen and seem to make sense.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry now wondered if all he needed was a hair from someone to absorb and not the whole person so the suit within him would be able to mimic that person.  He realized that that would require some more work than using a computer but would be easier than absorbing whole people.  It would mean only real people and those he could come in contact with or could find hairs perhaps at a hair salon or barber. Then he remembered something about DNA mapping of animals or humans or something.  He wondered if those might be on-line from some scientific web site and could be downloaded, perhaps even modified knowing which part of the DNA did what.  He wished Betty was here to research that and fill in the details of this complex stuff.  She was so good at that sort of thing.  This would be perfect for her.  She would be in her element adding that to the project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, oh.\" he thought. \"I wonder if Betty will be upset about last night or if she knew that I had had mum lie to her about going out so she wouldn't interfere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry considered what Betty may have done last night and if she was working on their project without him just then.  He liked that about Betty and pictured her and the way she really enjoyed these science things, explaining the skin suits to the class - her short little body swinging her arms to emphasize a point and her chirpy face all aglow with excitement. Betty would be able to figure out how to make the scanner work with that picture, the one of the princess in the gown.  He smiled at the thought of cute little Betty and how she would be  a princess in the ball gown of the picture.   Then he thought that she would surely be looking for him this morning to work on their project, and he actually wondered why she hadn't rung his mobile already.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Henry's mobile started to ring which gave him quite a start.  When he reached down to pick it up from his pants pocket where he had dropped them last night getting ready for bed when he was so tired, he noticed his hand was not his.  Nor was it Emily's slender fingers and nicely painted nails.  They were a bit pudgy and neatly trimmed very short but also feminine.  They were Betty's. Henry's thoughts about her helping research, meeting up to work on their project and regaling everyone on the skin suits had obviously brought the suit out to change into her. But what was really strange is that he noticed he was now wearing a blue ball gown and his body seemed to be warm and tingling and changing again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the mobile's ring brought Henry back to reality, he quickly concentrated hard on himself as he pulled open his mobile and answered.  It was ... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Henry drifted quickly into a deep, deep sleep.  His mind was oblivious to what was happening around him as he began  to dream, and that dream was, of course, about Emily.  Henry had \"dreamed\" of her before, not so much as a sleep dream, but as more of a wish and a hope.  He imagined that somehow he would find the courage to ask her out.  He would be the most amazing date - gentlemanly, courteous, attentive, debonair, confident, assertive, and a good listener and talker.  Most of which, he naturally was not.  Yes, he was kind, had good manners and listened usually because he didn't know what to say or talk about.  He never thought he was that good looking either and usually was worried about making some mistake and coming off foolish.  That left him unsure about making the first move on anything or with anyone let alone someone as pretty and popular as Emily.  He was scared that the worst could happen and loose all chance with her. So he had done nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now ... now, simply by accident, he had found out Emily thought he was cute, nice, and actually wanted him to be her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily.  Emily.  Emily,\" Henry sighed as he dreamed.  He saw her face, her sparkling blue eyes, shiny blond hair that seemed to float from her head to her shoulders.  Those two delicate pink lips.  Lips that had now kissed him, and not just once.  He saw her dancing and felt her against his body when they touched, holding hands, or that kiss.  What he really remembered and seemed to occupy most all of his dream was when he had absorbed her.  He felt so much a part of her.  No he felt they were together.  They were meant to be one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dreamed not just seeing her but being her, walking the way she liked swaying her hips.  He sensed what it was like to be slender and light, to move as she danced, to spin and twirl around when she was happy with her hair flowing free, to hold onto Henry's arm and feel the warm from him when they sat together, and to place a kiss on his cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe fifteen minutes after Henry fell asleep, a figure slowly crept out of the closet and silently stepped over towards the bed.  It was watching him intently in the dim light that barely lit the room coming from around the shade on his window where a sliver of the street lamp came through.  It heard him murmur Emily's name; then as it moved closer, it could see that he was not himself; that the suit had disguised him as Emily.  It seemed to sigh at this then began to whisper to itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.  You have been very close to Emily and absorbed her DNA structure with your little suit.  Maybe it isn't that you like her, but that you want to be her.\" and it seemed to chuckle then continued.  \"You can always be her especially in your REM sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the figure turned more into the light from the window, the form became very clear.  Not to Henry since he was asleep in bed as Emily, which was probably good because he would have been very surprised to see himself, Henry Folker, standing beside the bed, then gently sitting down on the bed beside him, leaning over and lightly placing a kiss on his Emily cheek.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry dreamed on that he was still being Emily alone with Henry.  They looked into each other's eyes, Henry's arms slowly reaching out gently caressing his Emily head before kissing her tenderly on the forehead, then on the lips.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sitting Henry had ever so lightly run his hand through Emily's hair as Henry slept in her form, then had bent over to softly kiss Emily on the head then tenderly on the lips.  Now standing back up, the Henry form gradually pulled back the covers and slid into the bed placing his body next to hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his dream, Henry began to get very warm as Emily while they both were now lying down with Henry next to her.  Their bodies pressing together in a hot, loving embrace.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dearest Emily,\" the Henry from the closet whispered into Emily's ear.  \"This is how we can be.\" and he began to kiss her lips passionately, eventually pulling them together tightly as both became very aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is what you want from Henry, huh?\" came more of a nasty, hot voice as Betty rolled her Henry body over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that instant, ... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She turned and reached for her bag, plunging her hand into it, she brought out another, smaller bag. Tipping the contents onto Henry's bed by his feet, Betty chose a plastic capsule which she opened and took from it a long, curly black hair that was greying slightly. Placing it on Emily's cheek, Betty watched the hair dissolve into the side of her face. Betty let out a little giggle of excitement which looked odd coming from Henry's mouth. Leaning over gently, she whispered in Henry's ear \"Betty's mother, remember Betty's mother...\", Betty stood back up straight again and laughed when she saw Henry's Emily face melting into one that looked like her mother. Next, she reached for the clothes which fell out of the bag, taking a quick check under the covers she saw that Emily's green dress had also disappeared. Placing the items of clothing over her mother's face one by one, Betty watched them disappear. \"Great, everything's falling into place\", she sneered, \"but he can't suspect, not yet...\", Betty leaned back down, pulling back the hair that had fallen over her mother's ears. Whispering slowly, \"Emily... remember Emily... rememeber her green dress... remember her face... Emily...\", she stood up once more watching her mum turn quickly back into Emily.<br>\r\n Henry stirred and rolled over, giving Betty quite a scare, he sighed, \"Ahhh, Emily...\" in her voice before his normal breathing resumed. <br>\r\nGetting back to the plan and speaking softly, Betty went through her checklist, \"Right, I need a hair from Henry when he's transformed\", she lent over and plucked one from Emily's sleeping head. \"Next, I need one from when he's not transformed\", Betty turned around and examined Henry's comb by the light of her torch. \"Got it, I already have one of Emily's from school, right, looks like I'm about ready to analyze. Betty leaned back over Henry and ran her hand through his hair, she looked at his Emily-face in a peaceful sleep and had to hold herself back from kissing him again, \"What's wrong with me?\", she asked herself. Trailing her hand down by his chin, Betty whispered softly in her Henry-voice, \"Sleep-tight, my love, until the next time...\", then she sank back into the shadows.</span></div></div>",

As he stretched his arms over his head not yet opening his eyes, he sensed something was different but was not yet alert enough to tell.  However, once he pulled his arms down and opened his eyes, he saw that he was not wearing his pajamas but a green dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry jerked himself upright and felt the weight on his chest shift and long hair fly around in front of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my. I must have changed overnight dreaming of Emily.\" Henry gasped hearing the words so softly in Emily's sweet voice.  It made him close his eyes and sigh happily. Then he heard footsteps in the hall and realized his mum was about.  His eyes popped open in fright as he thought she might find him as Emily if she came in to wake him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly he lay back down and pulled the covers over his head and began to concentrate picturing himself.  His first thought was of him at the party, but his mind kept drifting to Emily.  Then he thought of himself at school, but his encounter with Emily yesterday popped up, and he just saw her.  It was hard to picture yourself when you rarely see yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorknob to his room began to jiggle and then click as he knew his mum was entering to pull the covers back and tell him he had slept long enough. He remembered how he so liked sleeping in, to noon if he could.  He always felt so warm and safe under the covers.  For years she would always make sure he didn't waste too much of the day. It was their little game that he waited, sometimes hiding under the covers until she took hold of the covers and ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then she took hold of the covers and jerked them back completely off him.  Henry shuttered and squirmed with fear  as he grabbed for the covers to hide himself, but it was too late.  The covers were too far down for him to reach.  All he could do was open his eyes and see what reaction his mum had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You're suppose to meet Betty to work on that project due next week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't.\" Henry said as his mum left and he got out and headed for a quick shower and his morning routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry thought about his project with Betty. She had probably been up before dawn making notes and doing research. She was quite something, and he admired her for all this. He could see her now typing in details for the report then trying to explain it to him, getting upset, giving him that face she always makes, then always smiling and forgiving him.  She did have a cute smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was finishing his shower, Henry sensed something odd. He couldn't quite put a finger on it until he ran his fingers and wash cloth down his body.  He had changed into Betty! What's worse, he is standing naked as her in the shower ! !<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is something Henry felt very embarrassed about.  He closed his eyes not wishing to see Betty naked even though it was really him in a Betty suit. He had to think himself back to normal, and fast.  Otherwise, his mum would be up to find out what's taking him so long and see Betty instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry concentrated hard about himself. This time, however, he was able to focus clearly and soon sensed the strangeness of  the Betty suit disappear.  He opened his eyes slowly and looked down.  Now he saw his own body and sighed with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of the shower, he heard his mum call, \"Five minutes and I'm feeding it to the dog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry knew it was a joke he shared with his mum, but still he hurried to finish up. Henry wondered if Betty's mum ever did the same for her. He doubted it as Betty was so efficient and precise.  But maybe she did.  Henry imagined Betty's mum chasing her around and threatening to feed her breakfast to their cat (they don't have a dog) unless she stops her studying.  He had seen her mum often enough with her hands on her hips and shaking her head at Betty, or smiling when she handed them snacks. He remembered her hair how it always seemed fluffy and curly circling her round face and topping her petite body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry smiled at that thought as he looked up into the mirror to see ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, a few minutes later, he noticed the noises continuing.  He tried to listen over the TV's sound and was sure he heard his dresser drawers opening and closing.  \"What is she doing going through my dresser?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry flicked off the TV with the remote and started up the stairs.  \"Chloe?  What's going on in my room?\" he called, but not so loud as to upset mum.  She didn't like he or Chloe hollering in the house.  It was not polite or good etiquette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Henry approached his room, he noticed the door was closed.  His interest was now piqued even more as he put his hand on the knob and started to turn.  It didn't.  She had locked the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Chloe.  Open up. It's my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry then heard the latch click and watched the knob turn followed by the door opening.  He looked up but couldn't see anyone, so he marched right in thinking Chloe must be hiding behind the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door shut quickly behind him, he heard, \"Actually, it's my room.\"  Turning he saw ... himself.  Standing there before him was, well ... Henry Folker, dressed very nicely but casually with his hair brushed and a look of command on his face.  Henry's (the one that just walked in) mouth came open, but no sound came out.  He was absolutely speechless in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so surprised.  It's just 'serendipity'.\" the Henry by the door said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry's mouth then closed and his mind went blank.  He stood there expressionless, eyes unfocused but pointing straight ahead.  He had had this feeling before.  It was when he let Betty help him study for an important test that he was really having so much difficulty with and just couldn't concentrate or remember.  She had hypnotized him and given him a few commands to make the material stick in his mind.  It really worked, and he had passed the test and promised Betty she could have anything for helping him.  She had declined at the time, but he remembered she had a confident smile on her face when she declined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new Henry slowly walked around him, finally stopping in front face-to-face.  \"Now, tell me.  What happened at Emily's this afternoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry thought that was none of his business but felt himself talking as if his memory of today just flowed out uncontrolled.  In a few minutes, he had told this new Henry everything about Emily, absorbing her accidentally and pretending magic with it so she didn't know what happened, all the things she said and how she liked him, and her invitation to come early.  Then he stopped and remained in a trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short pause ensued until the new Henry commanded more than asked, \"What happened in the restroom after you left Emily's until you came in this house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry didn't want to say any more, especially that he walked home as Emily, but again his voice just detailed everything, how he had been able to concentrate to become Emily and walked home as her changing back just before he entered the house.  Henry wanted to move and tell this other Henry to stop this, but could not.  It was like control of his body had been turned off, yet he was consciously aware of everything happening, but this other Henry had control over his physical body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly the other Henry talked to himself, \"Ah, the suit continues to react on its own, but it can be controlled with the mind.  Good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you seemed surprised to find me here, but you shouldn't.\"  the new Henry continued from his previous statement of it being his room. \"You see, I am Henry Folker, and you are, really, ... Betty Bleu.  Think of her.  Concentrate on Betty.  The one who is so smart in those difficult classes.  The cute face and shiny hair, slightly shorter in height than Henry Folker, ... I mean me.  You can imagine yourself as Betty because, ... you - are - Betty.  You know you are.  You believe and act like Betty.  Your other memories are just figments stored way back.  You know all the things Betty enjoys and her mannerisms because you enjoy them and do them.  You - are - Betty Bleu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry felt his body tingling and changing as all his thoughts about Betty filled his mind overwhelming anything about him as Henry.  The suit emerged as his thoughts of being Betty grew stronger, and he transformed into Betty wearing just her skirt and black bra which is all he had absorbed this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Betty,\" the only remaining Henry said, \"put on the, ... your clothes on the bed and listen carefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry now in the Betty suit went to the bed and dressed in Betty's uniform and underwear that was there and continued listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the rest of the evening, tonight and tomorrow, you will be me, ... I mean you will be Betty Bleu.  Betty, ... you, plan to go to the library after leaving Henry's to do some reading then go home and right to sleep because you are so tired.  She, ... you, have a list of books in your pack outside by the front bushes.  You've been to Betty's house and know where her room is and how organized she is, because you are Betty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time Henry was completely dressed in Betty's clothes.  They had been absorbed into him and reappeared as usual. Betty had watched this and wished her suit could do the same, but all it did was change from her to Henry as if putting on the original suit they had made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I snap my fingers, you will forget ever being Henry and any of this conversation or being in this house.  You will wait here until you hear the car drive away.  Then you will go pick up your pack and go to the library remembering only that Henry and family are going out to dinner and you know that you will see him and work on the project tomorrow morning.  You will remind yourself constantly how you like being yourself as Betty and think only of being Betty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty, looking like Henry, opened the door and glanced down the hall.  She could hear Henry's mum in the kitchen and knew the coast was clear.  Turning, she walked up to Henry, who looked like Betty, and holding her hand up about to snap her fingers when she stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And one other thing, you do not remember anything about the skin suits.\" and she snapped her fingers in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry blinked his eyes and remained motionless as Betty, disguised as Henry, went out of the room and down the stairs with a very satisfied smirk on her face.   She was ready to show Emily that \"Henry\" wasn't really the boy for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just about a quarter past when she went into the kitchen.  \"Mom, I'm ready to go now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, dear.  Get in the car, and I'll be right there.\"  Henry's mom replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Henry's mom backed out of the driveway and drove down the street, Henry heard the car drive off without him, and he came out of the house wearing his Betty suit, went to the bush and picked up her bag, then ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Henry toddled off down the street towards the library in the form of Betty, unsure as to why he had been there in the first place. He had found the bag outside and the list of books to get inside it but couldn't help feeling as if something important was missing, or forgotten. As Henry thought he was actually Betty, this annoyed him greatly but he felt too tired to concentrate too hard on the matter.<br>\r\n After arriving at the library, and a smile and wave to the librarian, Henry whipped out the list and got searching. It didn't take him long to gather the five books on the list, easily tracking them down with Betty's impeccable logic. He checked them out and began cramming them into his bag when a slip of paper managed to escape and drifted underneath a table behind him. Going to pick it up, Henry had the feeling that he had never seen this slip before which made him feel unsettled, it had after all fallen out of 'his' bag. <br>\r\n It was a non-discriminate sheet of paper ripped out of a notebook, which he couldn't remember tearing out. He sat down at the table and turned the paper the right way around, revealing what looked to be a complex series of squiggles and the occasional word. Smoothing it out on the table, Henry pulled out Betty's purple framed square reading glasses from the bag, and examined it closer. The more he looked, the more he could feel a pressure building on the inside of his eyes, like something wanting to get out. Feeling like he was on the verge of a great discovery, and being Betty at the time, he forced himself to concentrate harder to make out some of the words. Thinking out loud he mused \"Hmmm, these characters seem to be repeated throughout the page but someone's obviously tried to hide them from other people. It looks like it says 'poly...' but the endings of the words are all different.\" The discovery of the prefix prompted a further building of pressure. \"Looks a little bit like a list... in my writing\". He sat back on the chair, \"But why did I write it and what's on it? Maybe its for the project, but surely I'd remember... and I don't know why, when we're doing a project on the effects music has on the growth of Mung Beans, this seems to be a list of plastics\".<br>\r\n At the mention of the last words the pressure burst, allowing a flood of images into his mind. He remembered being hypnotized, he remembered being Henry, he remembered Emily. Snapping back to reality, he felt a rising anger in the pit of his stomach, anger directed at Betty. How could she say she was his friend after stealing his identity and turning him into someone he wasn't? He had half a mind to track her down that instant and show her how he felt, with a little help from two friends he kept on the ends of his arms, but no. He was better than that, and Betty could easily just hypnotize him. He needed a plan, something to take his identity back, if he knew Betty, there was a reason behind this and all Henry knew at that moment was that he needed to stop her.</span></div></div>",

A better analysis of the facts and development of a theory on Betty's seemingly bizarre actions was required.  WHOA!  Henry's brain popped a cork, and he realized he was starting to think in Betty-terms and logic.  At first that seemed strange, but then he had the most brilliant revelation.  If he could use Betty's analytical neural brain functions to assimilate the evidence ascertained by sequencing the evidence he could discover her motives and then postulate various scenarios until one matched the current events.  Therefore, he could pursue the ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, even though Henry had Betty's skin and some of her other DNA mixed into his mind, his head really started to ache from the heavy thinking.  Henry's Betty eyes started to stare blankly ahead and memories of the past day started to fly along in front of them like rewinding a movie while in play mode but understanding as if forward.  Henry's breathing slowed considerably as he fell into a trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\">\"...think only of being Betty.\"  \"... because you are Betty.\"  \"Concentrate on Betty.\"  \"I am Henry Folker.\"  \"What happened at Emily's ...\"  \"Don't be so surprised.\"</span> <span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\">\"Henry, you won't get into trouble walking me home will you?

Henry could understand exactly what had happened and why Betty was doing what she was doing.  He felt so dumb for not seeing all along that she <span class=\"corange\">has a secret crush on him and often throws subtle hints at him that he completely misses; so she always agrees to help him in science projects, to spend time with him.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Henry thought.  \"She really has been a good friend, and I ignored her and went off blissfully mesmerized by Emily. ... OH.  That's IT!  And I know what I have to do now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry reached into Betty's bag and pulled out her mobile, but then remembered that he's not allowed to use it in the library, besides, maybe it wasn't a good idea to call anyway.  So, Henry grabbed Betty's bag and dashed out of the library slowing down just enough to smile and wave at the librarian as he passed before rushing through the doors and flying down the steps.  Once on the street, his little Betty-legs began to spin furiously as he raced towards Betty's house.  He should get some things there before confronting Betty, but did he have enough time.  Maybe he should head straight to Emily's.  It was just one street off from Betty's so he had a few minutes to decide as he sprinted and puffed his way through the darkening evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he neared the intersection, he slowed since he now had to decide, plus he was panting like a hound after the hunt.  Would his plan work without stopping by Betty's or would it be too late unless he went direct to Emily's.  He stood under the lamp post pulling in deep breaths.  A line of lamps made pools of light as they alternated jumping back and forth along each side of the street. He could just make out in the darkness both houses at the end of their respective blocks - Emily's a bit up the rise and Betty's a bit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry looked at Betty's scientific chronometer on the black band around her wrist.  It was eight thirty-seven.  He pondered his options as he glanced one way then the other.  Finally, he started concentrating about the suit and reviewing his plan speaking it out loud as he walked briskly towards ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She's 36 years old, 5'10 with long shapely legs, almond shaped hazel eyes, auburn hair and red thin lips.<br>\r\n</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry thought for a moment. It would certainly be weird making a suit of himself, and although making a suit of Betty would be wonderful, it would likewise be weird with her knowing about it and her being there would make possibly putting it on awkward. No, he'd have to come up with someone else besides himself and her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the perfect choice flashed in his mind. Henry excused himself from Betty and went into his parents' bathroom. Once there he snagged his mothers hair brush and returned with it ... along with a large smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that your mom's hair brush?\" asked Betty upon seeing him holding it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Lets give this a whirl.\" he said before picking a piece of her long, brown hair and dropping it into the ingredients inside the pot. He then placed the lid atop the mixture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother Carrie by all definitions would be what most men would describe as a MILF. She had had Henry quite young (20) and was only 36 years old. 5'10 tall, when she herself was younger she was highly athletic and very much into running long distances and outdoor sports. And thanks to that kind of activity her legs, works of female art, still years later looked like they were chiseled from a statue and shapely as anyone could hope for. She had almond shaped hazel eyes, lovely red thin lips and wore her auburn hair in a ponytail when she was doing errands away from work and while around the house. Henry's male friends, at that age where women suddenly took on a whole other level of importance. on more then one occasion were caught staring at her bending over when she was tending to the garden outside, or looking at her legs whenever she wore a mini skirt. And although they were scolded no one could blame them for looking given how attractive a woman she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty and Henry stared at one another for a few minutes and then back at the pot. Neither wanted to bring up the subject about her possibly seeing someone else, so whenever one spoke it was always about school work or about how silly this little experiment they were working on seemed. Henry could tell she was purposefully keeping something from him, and a part of him was really hurt that she didn't trust him enough to share what was on her mind. Sure they weren't BFF's or anything, but still it bugged him all the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed like an eternity, the pot began to bubble and boil and the whole house smelled like a weird burning plastic smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope this horrible smell isn't toxic!\" Betty stammered, pinching her nose<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry turned off the stove, put on a pot-handling pair of gloves and picked up the concoction they had slaved over for the past hour or so. \"Lets put it in the bathroom upstairs, only me and Lucinda use that one and she's away at college.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\" said Betty as she followed tentatively behind Henry as he ascended his stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reached the bathroom tub Henry placed the pot down on the side of it and slowly raised the lid. The stench of the ingredients inside slouched out as he did so and caused both himself and Betty to turn their heads in disgust. \"Ewww... that is pretty vile.\" he said as he put the plug on the tub and began to pour the mixture into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterestingly the mixture had taken on an almost skin-like pigment that didn't seem to make much sense given the ingredients they had used, and the amount that winded up getting splayed in the tub appeared to be somehow more voluminous then what he had poured, almost as if the material had gained mass through the heating and now cooling process. Even Betty was immediately perplexed and noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird it's that color, it almost looks like skin.\" she said. Before she could say anything else, though, her cell phone rang. She quickly answered it and looked back to Henry. \"Umm.... I've go to go... this has been interesting... see you at school....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok... bye...\" said Henry, disappointed that she had to leave, but more so because he understood it wasn't a parent but whoever Betty was involved with that had probably called her and whom she was leaving him to go see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, that didn't matter she was leaving... he had effectively gotten the hard part of the experiment done with her help, now all he had to do was wait the 12 and see what materialized. He closed the bathroom door, cleaned up the mess he had made before his parents came home and complained, and went into his room to go about his homework. A few hours later he checked out the percolating mixture and it had made a miraculous further transformation; now it had definitely taken on various human female traits, including noticeable nipples and breast outlines and even a vagina-looking cavity... but the whole thing was still gelatinous and undefined. Looking at it, Henry couldn't help but get sexually excited... even though it *was* his mother's \"template\" that was (apparently) being built.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSleep came fitfully, and Henry made sure to set his alarm so that at exactly the 12 hour mark he'd check in on the mixture and see what was waiting for him. When it went off at around 5 AM Henry was only barely sleeping anyways, and quickly rose and hit the button to stop it prior to quickly going into the bathroom to see what he winded up with. When he gazed down into the tub what was staring back at him was jaw dropping and defied nearly all forms of logic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw what looked like a perfectly sculptured photogenic, light plastic version of his mother. The material not only duplicated her figure and long, shapely legs, it even duplicated her vagina and chest 100% perfectly. The only eerie thing about what he was looking at, (besides the fact it *was* his naked mother), was the fact it was missing eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe this...\" Henry said to himself as he reached and poked the left breast with his hand. Somehow the material had \"puffed\" itself up to recreate the firmness of what his mother's breasts' must've been like. He then reached his middle finger down to the vaginal opening and put it inside, noticing immediately that the interior had also mysteriously molded itself to (apparently) replicate what his mother's body itself must feel like. \"This is wayyyyy too much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it dawned on Henry; what was he going to do about this?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Shockingly the phone rang no more then two times before Betty picked it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There a reason you're calling me at 5:30 in the morning?\" she quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised you're up.\" he quipped back. \"I was just going to be leaving a message...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes well I was on the phone until about an hour ago and was checking it for new messages... anyways what did you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the phone to 4AM and checking for messages...\" thought Henry to himself. \"She's definitely got some sort of boyfriend...\" Henry snapped himself out of the funk thinking about Betty almost put him in as the situation with the suit demanded some sort of action. \"I think you might want to come check out what our little suit concoction has turned into.\" he said getting back on the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, did it all just go down the drain or something?\" she answered back, not recognizing the sincerity in his voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would I be calling you if something stupid like that happened, Betty? Just come over... we need to decide what we're going to do with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecognizing Henry was serious now, Betty quickly chimed back \"Ok Henry... let me get dressed and I'll be there in 30 minutes or so and we can go to school together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n45 minutes or so later Betty arrived and Henry ushered her upstairs to the tub and the full bodysuit of his mother laying inside. Upon seeing it Betty's eyes nearly popped out of her head. \"Oh my god!\" she said to herself gazing down at the skin-suit replica of his mother they had made. \"This stuff... it really ... REALLY works?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Try touching it, it even feels like a regular person...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewww you touched your naked moms body?\" Betty said as she laughed slightly before leaning over and poking the suit to see for herself. \"Amazing! It really does feel like skin....\" Betty then removed her finger and looked at Henry, her lips slightly furrowed. \"I have to say your mom IS pretty hot... So, have you tried putting it on...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No! That is... I was so shocked at seeing how it turned out, I wasn't sure WHAT to do. I mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" smiled Betty as she gazed down at the suit, a peculiar smirk on her face. \"Well, any good experiment needs to test the hypothesis, right? One of us should put that thing on to see how and IF it works...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry was shocked at what Betty was suggesting, but then again she was right: they had gone through all of the trouble to make it, it should be tested to see if and how it worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right.\" Henry finally said after staring down at the suit himself. \"So which one of us is going to try it...?\"</span></div></div>",

Henry meanwhile, watched somewhat fascinated as Betty removed the entire suit from the bath, holding it at arm\u2019s length, and turning round with it to face him, causing him to immediately blush a little again as he found himself staring face to cheek, with his mother's naked ass, jumping quickly out of the way as she made her way past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you got somewhere I can try this thing on then?\" Betty then asked, feeling a little embarrassed, not particularly wanting to put it on there with him watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, yeah, yeah, sorry,\" Henry said, snapping out of his daze, pointing out into the hall and directing her to his bedroom, \"You can change in my bedroom I guess,\" adding almost as an afterthought, \"Just uh, just don't go downstairs, I don't want my <i>actual</i> mom to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I would think that would probably take a lot of explaining,\" Betty chuckled back, finding the image quite amusing, as she carried the suit out across the hall and into his bedroom, softly whispering to herself as she went; <i>\"I don't know, the things I do for you, Henry Folker...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft alone in the bathroom now, Henry then went about cleaning any remaining evidence of their activities, as well as keeping an ear out for any signs of his parents moving about downstairs, figuring that they'd be leaving for work soon and hoping it would be sooner rather than later. He was actually really excited now and eager to see if the suit would actually work as a disguise, the skin having looked and felt so real when it was in the tub, and he could only imagine what it would be like when Betty actually put it on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about ten minutes of waiting, patiently tapping his fingers against the now immaculate bathtub, Henry eventually began to get a little anxious, and thinking to himself that perhaps Betty was having trouble getting the skin on; her body and his mother's body being quite a different size and shape after all (his mother being a good deal taller and curvier than she was), he then got up and made his way out into the hall, deciding to check if she was okay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betty, you alright in there? Did it not fit?\" he called out, knocking gently on the door and placing his ear right up against it to see if he could make out anything that was going on inside. Rather than getting a reply however, the door suddenly opened and Henry found himself, rather embarrassingly falling face first onto his bedroom floor, landing with a loud thud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch, that wasn't supposed to happen,\" he groaned, his mouth half filled with carpet, gazing to the side to see a pair of bare feet standing next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice entrance,\" he heard Betty giggle from above, her voice sounding decidedly different and nothing at all like her own. Quickly looking up, Henry's jaw almost dropped off, as he saw his mother staring down at him, grinning away rather happily, dressed in the thick blue robe he usually kept hanging up on the back of his bedroom door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy moly!\" he shouted, jumping up off the floor, completely amazed by the apparent transformation in his best friend; her face, her hair, her body, everything, seemingly identical to his mother's in every way, leaving no trace that Betty was in there at all (the skin suit not only fitting to her body, but seemingly augmenting it perfectly to its own shape).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty impressive, huh?\" Betty smiled, her voice also a replica of his mom's, her face indicating that she was clearly just as amazed as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's incredible!\" Henry beamed, almost lost for words, as he stared at Betty, examining her from head to toe, even circling around her to see if he could spot any differences, finding that he couldn't. \"You're an exact copy of her; I wouldn't even be able to tell the two of you apart!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, it's kind of weird, isn't it?\" Betty agreed, looking down at her new, much more mature and slightly girlier hands, waggling them a little for her own enjoyment, before looking back up at Henry. \"Everything seems to have changed, and not just on the outside either,\" she told him, leaning in close and pulling at her eyelids to show off her new peepers, \"Check out my eyes, they're Hazel now, just like your mom's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell...?\" Henry began, somewhat puzzled, not even beginning to understand how a suit with no eyes could have changed Betty's, nevermind the other changes it had seemingly made; her extra height, weight, voice, teeth...it just didn't make sense!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I thought about that too,\" Betty began, sitting down on the bed and explaining her theory, \"Its bio-plastic right? So it's not like regular plastic clearly, it's alive sort of, and it can grow. Well it seems to me at least, that because it needed human DNA to take form, that when you put it on it somehow alters the wearer's form, essentially changing them genetically from inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry was slightly speechless at this, having assumed they were simply making a slightly cooler, more advanced type of Halloween costume that could be used to make disguises, not tampering with people's DNA. \"You mean...you mean you're stuck like that?\" he nervously stuttered, terrified that his stupid curiosity had gone and gotten his best friend trapped inside his mother's form.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> It was 5am, too early to call Betty or another of his friends but he had to do something with it to see what it did, the thought was just too tempting. Reaching into the tub he picked up the deflated skin of his mother which just lay there limp in his hands. The instructions that they had followed said that it was some sort of suit, a disguise. So Henry, checking the bathroom door was locked first, stripped down naked and examined the suit for an obvious way of entry. \"That's weird\", he thought, \"there doesn't seem to be any zipper or anything, but I suppose that's because if there was, people would be able to tell...\". After another minute looking for a way in to no avail, he decided he had two options, go in from the top or in from the bottom. \"If I'm going to put it on like an ordinary t-shirt then if I go up rather than down, it'll be the right way round and I won't get confused.\", he thought. So, holding the skin above his head he stuck his thumbs into his mum's vagina and pulled them wide apart creating a hole large enough for him to fit in. \"Its O.K\", he reassured himself, \"you've already come out this way once, time to go back\". With that, he stuck his head into the hole and started to wriggle in the rest of his body. The inside was pitch-black, Henry had to climb up towards the light coming in through the two open eye sockets at the top. Eventually, Henry had wriggled himself into a position where he could see out, now came the hard part, fitting the legs in. Sitting on the side of the bath, Henry pulled one of his legs inside and using his hand which was currently where the elbow of the suit was, he rearranged the skin underneath him to slot it into the right leg of the suit. The other one followed soon after that, slotting into the other leg neatly. He could feel the smoothness of the skin over every part of his body now, no part of him was outside. Moments later he could feel his fingers and toes sliding into the empty spaces of the suit's hands and feet, giving them a wiggle for good measure. He grabbed the mouth which he was looking out of and pulled it down to where his mouth was, the suit gave a sudden jolt and he realized that must be his nose aligning. Looking out of the eyes for the first time, he was in. Quite pleased at his little achievement, Henry started to sense something else starting to happen.<br>\r\n All of the empty space still left inside was sucked out all at once leaving Henry vacuum packed inside. The suit was now very tight on him and he felt as if inside he had all turned to liquid which the suit was now manipulating to fit the exact dimensions of his mum. Henry endured this uncomfortable feeling for a minute until it finally subsided leaving him standing naked in the middle of the bathroom an exact carbon-copy of his 36 year old mum. He walked over to the mirror and looked at his new face, he couldn't believe it, there infront of him was his mum. Even the colour of his eyes had changed from a dark brown to hazel. \"Oh my...\" he said out loud, except he thought he did but instead of his voice, he heard his mum's. Could this be happening or was he still dreaming?</span></div></div>",

He looked at his mothers manicured hands with their long fingers, twiddling them in the air in front of his face marveling at the differences between his own hands. Henry found himself rocking his head back and forth feeling the hair that gently cascaded down onto her shoulders. He also found himself swinging his wider hips from side to side. \"I... I CAME from there...\" he thought to himself as he looked down at the vagina he was now sporting. With delicate care he angled his fingers down towards the closed lips of the pussy, and once they reached it he slightly prodded it to one side. The sensation of even doing just that was mind numbing to Henry as it was entirely alien to anything he could ever comprehend as a male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting more comfortable with what was happening, he then put his hands on his waist and slowly began to run them up the side of his torso. He could feel the curve of his mothers body as he did so. He then slowly dragged his hands underneath the perky breasts he was now sporting and gently nudged them upwards. A warm pulsating sensation reverberated through them that was totally foreign to anything Henry had experienced due to their sensitivity. Growing used to the feeling, he then began to massage them, rubbing the nipples themselves as he did so. \"Geez, that feels good.\" he thought to himself as his mothers face became flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to feel another totally foreign physical reaction at that point emanating from between his legs. When the skin suit vacuum-sealed itself onto his body, in some how and some way it seemingly imparted a feminine physiology by him wearing it, and Henry was now experiencing what it meant to become sexually aroused as a woman. But not just any woman... but his own mother! Henry was both repulsed and simultaneously aroused further upon realizing what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left his right hand cupping and squeezing his right boob and began to use his left one to gently massage his clit. Getting a rhythm going, Henry started to lightly moan and get sweaty. He also began to desperately desire to place something within the actual pussy to stimulate it further. He could tell just how tantalizing a sexual release as a woman would really be, and he wanted to experience it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Something about experiencing what it meant to be in the throws of passion as his mother had awakened a kind of Oedipus desire within Henry and he was going to \"finish\" with an orgasm no matter what. His nipples had grown incredibly erect, and touching and rubbing them in their darted out fashion gave Henry spine tingling ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea came to him when he remembered all of the in-jokes he'd heard about women using their shower heads for stimulation. Understanding a woman's body now more intimately then any other man probably could, he fully understood just what the process must be. He quickly locked the door to the bathroom and after hosing the remaining residue of the skin suit down the drain, hopped into the shower and turned it on. Letting the water warm up some, then then removed the shower head and began to let the water jets provide force upon his female member. The warm, soothing sensations that ran up and down that were coming from his womb were unlike simple finger stimulation, and Henry could see why this was a favorite past time for many women while bathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his leg up at a slight angle to gain better access to the vagina and then continued with the massaging alongside the shower head. He also started to insert his mothers long fingers into the tight moist hole, as doing so now that he was as sexually charged as he was, was immensely pleasurable. \"Ahhh... yessss...\" he said as his left middle and pointer finger darted in and out, stimulating the inside of his pussy. Just like with his penis, he had to speed up the process if he wanted to push the orgasm along. It felt like a pressure was building up inside, an \"orgasm bubble\" that was swelling deep in the womb that wanted to explode. Henry continued his onslaught, nearly stopping several times due to how body shuddering the process was getting. Finally, with an low gutteral moan he climaxed. His whole body shook and he instinctively wanted to close his legs around the throbbing orgasm he had unleashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god...\" he exclaimed as he patted the outside of the satisfied vagina up and down, savoring the after effects. He put his fingers inside one last time, the warmth and slight physical jolt it gave him was indescribable. He removed his fingers and noticed they had become coated in an gooey material not unlike semen, although not as milky. Curiosity piqued, Henry placed his coated fingers in his mouth to try and taste what his mothers pussy produced. Even though it was pungent tasting and gross, Henry licked his fingers clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that is what it's like...\" he said to himself as he stepped out of the shower after shutting off the water. His whole body still felt warm and satisfied, a feeling not unlike masturbating as himself would leave him. \"Well I've had my fun... now maybe I'd better take this off...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Reaching around a few moments, his mothers titts jiggling as he did so, Henry finally found the slight \"hole\" in the suit. With a slight pull, Henry could feel the interior of the suit begin to grow less clingy to his body, and his own male faculties returning. He felt a weird vertigo as his eyesight changed back to his own, and found he was now looking out from inside the suit as opposed to looking as if the suit had been his own skin. With a slight ducking motion and another tug he removed his head from within it. By now whatever process had completed the suit and joined it to his body had ceased, and it was nothing more then a draped article of suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry stepped out of it and saw his familiar penis dangling between his legs. \"That was pretty awesome... if weird... and It's good to have you back!\" he laughed to himself as he snagged and hopped back into his clothing, throwing the suit over his shoulder once he was fully dressed. \"I have no idea what I'm going to do with this suit...\" he said to himself as he quietly opened the bathroom door and went back into his room. \"I really don't want to throw it away... or destroy it... but if my mother ever found out...for now I guess I will hide it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing an old suitcase at the top of his closet, Henry folded his mothers suit up and tossed it inside before putting it back into place. \"It will keep there for now.\" he said to himself. Looking at his clock he noticed that he had wasted over an hour and a half in the bathroom and if he didn't hurry he was going to be late for school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly grabbing his things he then proceeded to just barely get there on time, his mind throughout the day not focusing on anything besides what he had experienced and what possibilities had been opened up to him. Even Betty couldn't hold a candle to what he now had access to, and her relationship status, something that had been a sore sticking point only a day earlier, was now something that didn't even give Henry a seconds pause. Who cared whether she was seeing someone or not; he had the ability to be *any* woman he wanted to be as long as he could get a piece of their hair. No bullshit, no butt kissing, no mind games. The idea was so prevalent on his mind, Henry even started staring at his classmates and teachers inwardly questioning whether any of them were worthy of having a suit made of them.</span></div></div>",

Immediately, his hands began patting at his body, frantically searching for some sort of hole or zipper, anyway he could possible get the thing off as he ran over to the bathroom mirror, checking to see if their was any visible sign of anything on his back, which unfortunately there wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit! This isn't good,\" he said to himself, becoming rather panic stricken at the thought of being stuck this way, a prisoner in his mother's skin, as he stared at her now horrified reflection, <i>\"What the hell am I going to do?\"</i> This didn't last long, however, and his panic soon turned to anger, gritting his mother's teeth and grabbing at the skin, digging his fingernails into the soft flesh, and forcibly trying to pull it from his body. \"There's got to be someway out of this stupid thing!\" he yelled, pulling, tugging and throwing himself around the room, the feeling of his mother's long nails clawing at his skin causing him to wince in pain, as he thrashed around like a man possessed, until finally, defeated, he collapsed exhausted onto the white tiled floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't come off...Why won't it come off?\" he weakly mumbled, crawling his way along the tiles, not understanding what was going on, why he couldn't get the skin suit off, and why it felt like it was actually part of his own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back to the instructions he'd printed off the net, he racked his brain, trying to remember what it had said, and if there was anything about how to take the thing off. It had certainly been described as a type of disguise or costume, which he would have assumed meant that it could be taken off, but apart from that it hadn't really said much else (which was why he'd had to use his own initiative to get it on in the first place). Of course it was also pretty clear now that this wasn't like any normal type of costume, their clearly being more to the recipe than meets the eye; Henry's entire body not just being disguised as his mother, it had actually become his mother, as unbelievable as that sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, just don't panic, just stay cool,\" he told himself, picking up his new female body from the floor, trying to keep a level head while he figured this all out, needing first and foremost to get hold of the instructions and see if there was maybe anything he might have missed. \"Alright, that's fine, there in my room,\" he calmly said in his mother's soft, gentle voice, taking a few deep breaths to compose himself, before grabbing his discarded clothes and quietly tip-toeing his way back into his bedroom, remembering that his parents were still asleep downstairs and the last thing he wanted to do right now was wake them both up (especially his mom after what he'd just been doing).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing his door behind him, he threw his clothes onto the bed and sat down in front of his desk, finding that his mother's softer, cushiony ass was a little more comfortable to sit on than his own. There piled on the table, was the various notes and printouts he'd made last night for his Chemistry project, having hidden the bio-plastic suit recipe amongst them when he was cleaning up earlier, just in case anyone snooping around where to find it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are,\" he smiled, locating the sheet of paper he was after, and holding it up to light to see, quickly reading his way through it, silently praying that there was some piece of information that could help him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tracing his finger over the page, Henry discovered, much to his relief that there was indeed a small, barely visible portion of text right at the bottom, so small in fact, it was no wonder he'd missed it. \"Who the hell types stuff that small?\" he wondered, slightly annoyed, as if whoever had written this recipe didn't want anyone knowing about it. \"Oh well, at least I found it now,\" he shrugged, switching on his table lamp so that he could see it better and reading over what it said;<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nWarning: The bio-plastic disguise is unlike any normal disguise or costume, the molecules of the \"suit\" actually attach themselves and absorb into the wearer's body, creating a change in the \"host\" on a genetic level. Can only be detached by applying a thin layer of tetroflorzapine to the spinal column, drawing out the \"suit\" molecules from the body and placing it back into its dormant state. Keep out of reach of children.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be kidding me?!\" Henry exclaimed, completely bewildered by the fact that this incredibly important piece of information was hidden away, this small solitary paragraph explaining so much about how the skin suit worked, something that would have been extremely handy before he'd put the stupid thing on! Still, it was kind of amazing, seeing it described there as attaching itself to someone and merging with their body, physically transforming you into the actual disguise, just as he now seemed to be. The very idea that such technology existed was just mind-blowing! And what was even more mind-blowing was that he now possessed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone could make millions with a recipe like this,\" he said to himself, considering the possibilities for a second, before snapping out of his musings and turning his attention to the strange chemical that was supposed to help him get him out of his mother's body. \"Tetroflorzapine. Now what the hell is that when it's at home?\" Clearly it was the name of some sort of chemical, but what kind, and where could he find it? He definitely hadn't used anything like that to create the suit in the first place, and searching through his chemistry books he couldn't see any trace of the name there either, but he knew it had to be somewhere...someone had to use it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to consult the Internet for help, Henry quickly booted it up and type the name into Google, finding it slightly odd typing away at the keys with his mother's long fingernails, discovering quite fortunately millions upon millions of results. \"Wow, guess this stuff is pretty popular,\" Henry thought as he clicked on the first website, having been worried that it would be some chemical nobody had ever heard of before. The site he clicked on was some sort of article on woman's health and beauty, and scrolling down the page, he located the reference next to the image of a tub of moisturizer, reading closely what it said;<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nTetroflorzapine is a chemical compound usually found in certain moisturizers and creams to help with hydration and keeping skin healthy, smooth, and silky to the touch.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, okay...wasn't expecting that,\" he chuckled, discovering that the secret ingredient wasn't some difficult to obtain, ultra toxic chemical hidden away in some government lab somewhere, but was in fact something that he'd no doubt find in his own bathroom cabinet, his mother certain to have moisturizers and creams of all kinds tucked away in there (and if not there, presumably on her vanity table in her bedroom). \"Phew! Well, that's one problem solved at least,\" he said, turning off his computer and leaning back in his chair, all the panic and terror that had been weighing heavily on him before, now completely dissolving away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at his alarm clock to check the time, he saw that it was now almost quarter to six, and that it would soon be time for his parents to get up and get ready for work, and he wondered if he should sneak downstairs and search the cabinet now (possibly risking bumping into one his parents getting up), or wait till after they'd both been to the bathroom and were in the kitchen eating breakfast, then look for the moisturizer (having less chance of being caught that way, though more chance of them coming up to wake him for school and finding him in his current motherly state).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, decisions, decisions...\" he though to himself, his hand now absentmindedly fondling one of his hard nipples.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deciding that the sooner the better, and figuring that he could probably make it downstairs and back before anyone else was up, Henry then got up off the chair and quickly walked out of his bedroom and down the stairs, listening out carefully for any movement from his parents\u2019 bedroom as he went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like the coasts clear,\" he thought to himself, peering up the hallway once he'd reached the bottom, seeing that there bedroom door was still closed, quietly sneaking into the bathroom and going straight into the cabinet above the sink. Inside, he found the usual bottles of medication and ointments, some of his mother's tampons and stuff, as well as a few tubs of skin care products, just as he had predicted. \"Jackpot!\" he smiled, grabbing out some moisturizer, noting that it wasn't the same one as he'd seen in the article, so quickly checking the ingredients to be on the safe side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, no tetro-whatsit!\" he angrily whispered, finding that the chemical in question wasn't there, before frantically checking through the other tubs, and finding that it wasn't in any of them either. \"Damn it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appeared the chemical needed to get out of the skin suit wasn't quite as common as he had hoped, and his only hope now it seemed, was that the stuff his mom kept in her bedroom might contain what he needed. Of course getting into his parents' bedroom right now was going to be more than a little problematic, especially looking like this, and he figured he had no choice now but to wait for both of them to get up before he could sneak in and check. Just then, however, while he was returning his mother's skin care products to their rightful place, Henry suddenly heard the sound of a door opening outside, and a pair of feet trudging softly across the hallway carpet, causing him to suddenly freeze in panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-oh!\" he gasped, his gaze shooting towards the unlocked bathroom door, aware that any second now he was about to be discovered by one of his parents, still entirely nude, wearing his mother's skin, the thought of which made him turn pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could hear the footsteps getting closer, and he knew he would never be able to reach the lock in time, his only real other option being to hide behind the shower curtain and pray to God that whoever it was, wasn't wanting to take a shower...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
