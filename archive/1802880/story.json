She laid back on a nearby couch, stunned at her own gluttony. \"I should really go work this off, but that can wait until later,\" she thought to herself, also feeling strangely lazy today. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She made sure to pack as many calories as possible into them while still being able to pass them off as simple boosters for Rainbow's workout.

Rainbow accepted it and greedily chugged the entire thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Fluttershy. That was delicious, I'll have to drink another one on my next break.\" The next break came sooner than Rainbow though, as she found herself strangely lower on energy. She could barely get any actual exercise in before becoming so tired she needed to stop. By the time the afternoon ended she had spent more time snacking than she had actually working out, and had consumed more than three times the normal calories for one day. She still seemed pleased with herself though. \"Wow, that was a great workout. Thanks for your help Fluttershy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After some persuasion, he managed to take over the business side after Granny Smith pass away. After browsing through all the documents, he discovered that he can maximise profits, production and availability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hired work ponies to collect the best quality apples. He funded a factory that rapidly produce apple goods. He set up stalls in the best location with the most ponies would visit such as train station and work station. Bits were flowing in to the Apple Family and they do not have to worry about being behind on tax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack was moved to the food production. She was the official food taster as she know what the best Apple products should taste like and how to improve it if necessary. Big Mac still wanted to buck Apples but have plenty more time with his family. Applebloom does not have to worry so much about the farm so she can concentrate on her current job as the teacher in the Friendship School.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything is going great but there was one thing he didn't put into account. Applejack constant snacking and tasting, and the lack of movement as she usually stay at one spot quickly expand her waistline. Her appetite grew overtime. At first, it wasn't noticeable but after a month Caramel can obviously see gotten a bit wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since she become the official food taster, she become lazier and hungrier. She would wake up later as she doesn't have to wake up early to collect and organise the apples. Her meals become larger than the other members of the family and she was often seen snacking between meals. She claimed it as tasting for the best quality product. It was obvious that she just like eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaramel make some small and not hurtful jokes about her weight. Applejack joked back that some stallions like a more hefty mare compare to the sticks at Canterlot. Caramel also notice another change to Applejack. She become more happy and playful with him. She explained that ever since you took over the business side, she become less stressful and more carefree. The increase in food intake represents how secure she is. The bigger she is, the more safe and happy she is. She doesn't have to worry to be fit and buck apples all day just to make the ends meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing the explanation, Caramel become extremely caring to Applejack. As her husband, he would do the best to make her feel happy. He would wake her up only for meals. He prepare meals so large that Applejack would be stuffed. He placed snacks everywhere. He would even give her belly rubs, where most of the fat go to, to encourage her to relax and eat more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another month of this was going on, Applejack's appetite went rapid. She would avoid eating vegetables and other healthy food. Her diet is that each meals would feed three hard-working stallions. Her snacks are now a basket of sweets. She would only drink apple cider, heavy cream milk, milk shakes or heavily sugary drinks. She would hardly move and only walk when it is necessary. Applejack was extremely happy as she never felt this calm in her whole life. Caramel make every issue in her life go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaramel is happy as long as Applejack is happy. Applejack is currently weigh as three stallions. She gained a double chin, two big bubbly butt cheeks and the most impressive part of her body is that humongous belly. Caramel would massage her belly and his hooves would sink into it.<br>\r\nApplejack would play with her belly and see how far it ripple after she slap it. Applejack exclaimed that she love the new lifestyle. All the food she could eat, a loving husband that encourage her to live as she like, and a business that can keep the Apple family safe for generations.</span></div></div>",

Idnit cheaper jus' t' chuck 'em away?\" Applejack was sceptical with that fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. You are not in the restaurant business so you may not not heard this rule. In one of the rules, restaurants that operate in Equestria must paid a hefty fine for wasting good food. Caught throwing food away can result in temporary closure in the restaurant and additional training on why you should not waste food. It encourages restaurants not be wasteful with the produce and give away food to the needy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not sent some t' thuh orphanages? Hay done needed thuh food,\" Applejack rebuttled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course but orphanages don't accept a ton of food in a day. Restaurants and fast food chains fight for the rights on which organisation would accept their food and if the organisations would accept them. Like school camps would not like to get only junk food or food drive only accepting bread. It's a tough thing for the food business to work around with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah see what this leadin' ta.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This law create a new line of work called the 'Food Disposal'. Ponies were hired to eat the leftovers. The business would not have to worry if they have ordered too much or too little. Restaurants don't want to see displeased customers when they are out of food or paying hefty fine for overspending on produce. That is why I was hired by the Cakes. I make pastries and eat any leftover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ifin' this is thuh case, why is it so unheard awf? Why isn't there a herd awf ponies signin' uhp for free food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the contract it stated that any food that they did not consume would come out of their paycheck. Some would be more than their paychecks and would come out of their savings. It prevent ponies just wanting to get a free meal. Imagine being paid 100 bits but unable to do it, they would fine you 500 bits. You are not allowed to throw away the food to hide from them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah see,\" Applejack stared at her belly, \"Do ya thihnk ah'm uhp ta thuh task?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Pinkie poked Applejack's belly as she stared directly into Applejack's eyes, \"You have an appetite of a stallion when you were a foal. I bet you have a bigger appetite that can meet the requirements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking for a moment, Applejack came up with the answer, \"Okay. Ahm willing to take the job. What should ah do first? Ah wanna to make bits as much as Ah can and quickly as possible for maah fuh-amily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would recommend.......\"</span></div></div>",

They have bumped into each other at the market one day. Some things lead into another and now they are in an official relationship. As he was planning to move Ponyville to work and live closer to her, Zecora invited him to her home and allowed him to live there. Originally, Zecora offered a good deal on the rent but Sweet Venture counter-offer with a better deal. He would prepare her lavish meals everyday as he was trained from a prestigious chef school. He specialised in sweets and pastries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he first presented her breakfast, she was surprise how much he had made just for her. A high stack of pancakes smothered in syrup, a plate full of hay bacon, a glass of creamy milk, a whole plate of scrambled eggs, a half dozen of harsh browns and bunch of buttered toast. The meal can easily feed three ponies. Zecora initially thought he was joking but she quickly realise he was not. Not to be rude, she shoved one of the pancake into her mouth. As soon as her tongue touch the pancake, she went into bliss. She couldn't describe how wonderful it is. It was the most perfect pancake she have ever tasted. This make Pinkie Pie's cooking seem amateurish. She couldn't help herself but kept shovelling food into her gaping mouth. Sweet Venture was pleased with the result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora patted her stomach as she finish off her meal. Her belly bulge out with all the food in her stomach. Zecora smack her lips as she finish every crumbs off her plate. She moaned as she rubbed her belly. She believed that it was a one time only thing as she thought he just wanted to impress her with his cooking and it was his first day living here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, she was wrong. Each meal afterwards (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Desert, Midnight snack (more like a feast)) have become more extravagant, heartier, heavier and more delicious. She couldn't denied any food she was given from him. Initially, Zecora was worried about her sudden increase of her weight but Sweet Venture ensure her it was nothing and even encourage her to eat more. He would even leave snacks everywhere in her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Zecora kept eating and eating. At the end of the month she was....</span></div></div>",

She have the appetite of 5 stallions as well. It was really surprising for her to more than quintuple her weight in less than a month. Her golden rings have to be removed as it had become too tight for her to wear. Throughout that month, every time the Zecora mention about her sudden weight gain, Sweet Venture would shut down the conversation and persuade her to eat more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since Sweet Venture enter her home, her whole lifestyle have change. Before she would exercise often, went out to the market, search and collect herbs, make potions and have light meals with home-brew tea. Now, she having trouble getting out of bed. Her only entertainment was watching movies on a projection and reading books within arm reach. She could make a proper concoction as her appetite and belly would get in her way. Her belly became a alarm clock. Her stomach would rumbled to wake her up to get ready to eat breakfast (or any other meals). Her blubbery belly would held her down on her bed and she always need to rock her belly back and forth to roll off her bed. Sweet Venture made a custom-made bellyboard for Zecora to move around in her home. Her belly was so large that it would touch and smothered the ground while standing up on all four of her hooves. The bellyboard helped her not to drag her stomach all over the floor. It was a strenuous task to crawled all the way to her table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweet Venture greeted her like nothing was wrong and present her breakfast that would feed a small family. However, Zecora gobbled it all up like a starving monster. She demolished everything in front of her and not leaving a crumb left on her table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zecora, we need to talk,\" Sweet Venture sat next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora was surprise to hear that. He never complained with the current living condition. Must be serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we need a bigger house. I know a place that is in Ponyville that is closer to my job and closer to many services to make our lives easier. I think this is the best for us. As you are my marefriend, you don't have to worry about the payment of the house. I've been saving a lot and I want you to live with me. I will support you as much as I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora thought about it. Her current home is quite cramp especially her growing size. She haven't left her house for a long time and even if she wanted to, she couldn't even fit out of her front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if you want to stay here, I would still support your decision. It would just be harder to help you if you needed me when I am away for work. The new home is really close by and can poke my head in to see how you are doing. This is your choice. What do you pick?\"</span></div></div>",

Without you, I would stay blue,\" Zecora replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a week of preparation, all of her belongings were packed up. Sweet Venture did all the work. He placed all of her belongings in the cart, leaving nothing left in her home. Zecora would had offered some help but went against it. She was just too big and constantly hungry to help. All she did for the whole week was sleep and eat. Now she weight about 6 fully-grown stallions. Zecora felt guilty for not doing anything but Sweet Venture didn't mind. He like to help her as much as he could. He hammered down the sign in front of her house stated that she was moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora wanted to move out late at night as she doesn't want anybody to see her. He went along with her idea and prepare for the night trip. Originally, Zecora would walked herself with the aid of the belly board to the new home but she was absolutely exhausted just by moving only a few steps. Sweet Venture chuckled knowing it was an impossible task for her to get into town. He secretly brought in a second cart for Zecora to lie in. It was extremely embarrassing for her as Sweet Venture have to saw out a bigger door for Zecora to leave her home and needed to be levitated into the cart. Every simple task become quite impossible for Zecora to perform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven thought the cart was design to carry 6 ponies with room to spare, it was a tight fit for Zecora to settle in. Sweet Venture hid her under a tarp and ensure her that everything is secure. Sweet Venture pulled both carts with the aid of magic to their new home. During the trip, Zecora's stomach rumbled even if she just ate before she had left. Sweet Venture ensure her that they would have a feast when they get there. Sweet Venture would often hear Zecora moaning and grunting for trying to calm her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the new home, Sweet Venture levitated Zecora out of the cart first and go through the back door. The back door was designed for Zecora to fit through. The ground floor was cluttered with cooking tools and furniture. There were no space for Zecora to lie down. Sweet Venture told Zecora that they would be living in the basement. The ground floor space is needed for business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he took Zecora to the basement, she was surprise with the space she was given. The basement could fit the whole Ponyville's marketplace. Sweet Venture told Zecora that he wanted the best for her and space should not be one of the problem. There was a pile of cushions for Zecora to lie on as bed mattresses are useless to her, a really large projection movie screen for her to binge to and most importantly, a custom made tube feeder poking out from the ceiling for Zecora if Sweet Venture could not directly feed her. Zecora was please with the new living space and started to pig out on the feast that Sweet Venture had prepared earlier for her. Sweet Venture knew that she would be extremely hungry when they get to their new home. While Zecora munching on all the delicious food she was given, Sweet Venture placed all of Zecora's belongings around her. </span></div></div>",

He made lots of connection in the community to get the best price for his ingredients. This lead to his business booming with success. His food were praise highly which rake in the bits. He use those profits to expand his business as well as feeding his marefriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo keep up with her marefriend's appetite, he went to every store, bakery, restaurant and fast food chain for their leftovers before closing time. He is in friendly-terms with all of them. He was often seen carrying cartloads of food each night but completely empty the next day. Ponies asked what he have done with them. He replied that somepony urgently needed them and he was willing to help. Most ponies theorise that the food are going to a either a local charity, a homeless shelter or an orphanage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zecora, I'm back home. Business is getting bigger lately but not as fast as you,\" he only heard some kind of grumbled and munching sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora recently lost the ability to talk and move her limbs. Her mouth was tied to the tube feeder as she was constantly hungry 24/7. Her limbs were too heavy to lift. The only movement she can make is twisting her wrist slightly, movement of mouth, twitching of her ears, blinking of her eyes and the rumbling of her stomach when she is really hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she lost the communication of speaking, she use a make up sign language with the combination of her eyes and ears. If there any words that she needed to say, Sweet Venture would remove the tube feeder and quickly put it back after finish talking. It's a painful process for her as she fought back against her hunger as her belly roared like a mighty beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweet Venture observed how her marefriend change. Now she almost filled the whole basement. Two former Dragon Lord Torch can fit in belly with room to spare. He smiled as he belly flopped onto Zecora's belly. He described her belly as the soft and squish as a marshmallows and wobbly as a jelly. He steadily crawled up her belly toward her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi honey. How are you feeling?\" he said as he kissed her on one of her massive cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe conveyed back the message with her sign language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hungry </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are always hungry dear,\" Sweet Venture joked, \"I will try to see if I can produce more food for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thank you.

Business is doing well and I am thinking of expanding my business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's nice to hear.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweet Venture rest on her cheek as he listened to her marefriend's insatiable appetite. After a while, Sweet Venture asked her something important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darling. You know we are running out of space here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Am I growing to fast?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Sweetie,\" as he hugged her fat, \"There is more of you to love.

We could either go to the area close by the Crystal Empire or the area near the Appleloosa. Both offer large spaces and easy to expand later. They both extremely cheap to purchase land.

The very few I could find didn't have Weight Gain as a main motif, and none of them allowed any kind of shipping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I decided to make one Here Shipping is allowed, and Weight Gain is the main motif. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's the only rules be glad there are so few;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1: Only Mares (that's the female ponies) get fatter.<br>\r\n2: Stay in the confines of the +13 rating.<br>\r\n3: I don't care who is shipped together, you can even add OC's if you want to. Nor do I care if magic is involved or not.<br>\r\n4: At least try to put some effort into the chapters, \"she suddenly gained 400,000 pounds in 12 seconds for no reason\" only comes across as lazy and boring. Since nobody on the internet likes to read anything the last thing I want is boring chapters, aside from the groundwork introductory ones that list characters and motivations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is all, I hope you at least try to enjoy reading this and thank you for putting up with my lame 4th wall humor, so please post chapters here, you won't regret it.</td>",
