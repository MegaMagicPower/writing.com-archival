He works for the local university, researching the sliding phenomenon and cataloging the various alternate dimensions. He excitable and short-sighted, both literally and in regards to planning ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Marilyn Gray (39)</b><br>\r\nA handsome, muscular woman with dark hair and eyes. Standing at 6'1', Marilyn is an imposing matriarch who likes to keep the male members of her family firmly under thumb. Has a rather high sex drive, evidenced by her large number of children.<br>\r\nMarilyn met her husband, Brian, while studying under him as a undergraduate student at the university, and has worked as his research assistant ever since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Tiffany and Tanya Gray (14)</b><br>\r\nTwins. Intersts include clothes, boys, shopping, jewelry, boys, hair, music, boys, spending time with their friends, makeup, and boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Timothy Gray (15)</b><br>\r\nA shy outcast, Tim is the middle child of the family. He is short for his age and slim, with mousy brown hair, big green eyes, and delicate features that might have looked good on a girl. He is often picked on by his older brother, Chris.<br>\r\nHis world is a dense woodland that stretches further as he has been brave enough to explore, which isn't very far. It appears to be uninhabited, but strange noises in the undergrowth would suggest otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Chris Gray (17)</b><br>\r\nTim's older brother. Strong and handsome, but also arrogant and selfish.<br>\r\nAt first glance, Chris' world is like ours, except the population is almost exclusively women.<br>\r\nOn closer inspection, it becomes apparent that not all these women were born as such. This world diverged from Earth Prime twenty five years ago, when an alliance of Asian nations successfully invaded Europe and America. Struggling to govern the conquered yet unruly nations, the alliance resorted to extreme measures to quell the unrest by surgically converting most of the male population of the Western World into women, turning them into comfort women for their soldiers that are easier to control. All male children are converted at birth and tutored from a young age on how to be a subservient and feminine. Only males complicit with the Asian alliance are able to avoid being converted.<br>\r\nAn underground movement of rebels exist. Though some of these are unaltered males, most have undergone some degree of sexual reassignment in order to pass beneath the noses of their Asian overlords undetected, changing themselves into shemales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jennifer Gray (18)</b><br>\r\nJennifer is the oldest child, soon to be leaving for University. She is self-absorbed. Her world is one which never made it out of the dark ages - it has a feudal society and a medieval level of technology.<br>\r\nUsing the modern technology of Earth Prime, Jennifer has gained the awe and admiration of the local populace, and has even become betrothed and pregnant to the local ruler, though this she keeps secret from her family.</span></div></div>",

You're the star player of the school's football team, a position you've used to boost your popularity. Until recently, you were at the top of your game, dating Jessica, one of the most popular girls in school, while screwing half of the cheerleading squad behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelf-assured and self-serving, you're not the nicest of sorts. Some might even call you a bully, mostly the people that you kick around and beat up for lunch money. Unfortunately, following Open Day, this has become harder. Now every time you go to punch a scrawny nerd, they slip away into their own realities, and you're not fool enough to chase after them. You've heard tales of people entering other people's portals and becoming trapped on the other side when the person returned to Earth prime, closing it behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven worse, your sliding powers have yet to emerge, possibly don't even exist. No matter how often you try to summon a portal, it has always ended in failure. Though you've managed to keep it a secret, your sliding impotence is a constant source of shame, worsening your temper. Your friends are growing distant, attending killer parties that are quite literally out of this world, parties that you bitterly refuse to attend.

It looks like a fucking tortilla. A thick white fog of sickly sweet smoke pours out of his nostrils and out of his mouth as he lolls his head to the side and kisses the girl sitting beside him... Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFists clenched in rage, you go for them. Jessica spots you, her eyes widening in shock, immediately sliding away with a pop of displaced air. The kid staggers to his feet, too stoned to slide, and you grab him by the shirt, lifting his body off the ground and pinning him against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little ginger puke. The hell are you doing with my girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fixes you with a lopsided grin and mumbles, \"<i>Your</i> girl? Mate, she hasn't been <i>your</i> girl for weeks. She was all over me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scoff, glaring into his bloodshot eyes. \"Why the hell would she cheat on me for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because this, man,\" he says, holding up the massive joint. \"In my world, there's fields of this stuff. Your girlfriend is a total stoner. I mean... <i>my</i> girlfriend.\" The air bursts out of his lungs as you swing your knee up into his stomach. He collapses onto the ground, chuckling even as he sucks down pained sips of air. \"Face it, man, you're finished. Nobody cares about how good you are at football anymore. The only thing that matters is how good your planet is. And mine's the best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you swing your fist into his face, his sliding ability finally kicks in on instinct. His body falls away under your knuckles, dropping through the portal that forms around his skin. You snarl in frustration, staring through the portal as the bastard lands on the earth of his world, scrambling to his feet and darting away into the dense, swaying fronds of cannabis plants beneath a tropical sky. \"I'll get you next time, prick! You gotta come out some time!\" you shout after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit and wait by the two portals for hours, until it gets dark. Eventually you're forced to leave for football practice, though half of the guys don't even show up, and you walk home troubled. The guy was right. If you didn't learn to slide soon, you were going to get left behind.<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n\"Punch me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim stares in confusion. \"Wh-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your brother's bedroom door behind you. \"I need you to punch me. If you punch me, I'll slide automatically, right? On instinct.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think mum wants us sliding...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to punch me or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is surprising strength in his scrawny arms and limps wrists as he clocks you across the jaw.

It would be dark soon, and then the AA soldiers would spill out of their barracks, looking for comfort women to satisfy them. Christina didn't want that. Refusing the advances of a soldier was punishable by flogging or worse, yet her body was still sore from the last series of treatments they had forced on her. Her breasts and ass were particularly sensitive today, swollen with the silicone gel they had pumped into them, and the hormone supplements were making her nipples puffy and tender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ass squeaked inside the short, faux-leather skirt as she minced down the pavement, and the high heels strapped to her feet made a shameful clack on the concrete with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been six months since the occupation had caught her working for the resistance. She had been a man then and a hell of a fighter, if she did say so herself, but the Asian Alliance had soon taken care of that. Dragging her from her bed, they'd taken her to one of their 'rehabilitation camps', cut off the penis that she'd so proudly kept for 17 years, cut apart her body and sewn in back together in the shape of a woman. They'd pumped her full of drugs that had clouded her thoughts and weakened her body, all the while torturing her until her mind broke. Eventually she'd spilled the names and location of every one of her comrades, and been forced to watch as they too were made to undergo the same treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was in the past. She was a good girl now. A good, good girl. But that didn't mean she had to throw herself at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilitary trucks were arriving in the main street, but by that time she was already at the train station. She hurried onto the train that would take her home, curling up in the corner of an abandoned carriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLulled by the sway of the train, she was just beginning to drift asleep when a shadow passed over her. She shrank back in her seat, away from the man in the military uniform who stood in the aisles, staring down at her with a look of hunger on his sweaty face. She counted the pips on his shoulder, he was a General,  refusing him would be a death sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found herself shaking as he bent over the seat, pulling her skirt up and her panties aside. This would be the first time she'd been taken as a woman since they broke her. She felt tears prick her eyes and... static crawling over her skin. That was odd.<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\nYou clutch your jaw. \"Jesus, you little prick, you didn't have to hit me that hard.\" As you say that, static begins to crackle over your skin. There is a rush of air in your ears and the room lurches around you. \"Hey, I think it's workiiiiiiiiii-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u80ae\u810f\u7684\u6b27\u6d32\u5993\u5973!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, you're suddenly no longer standing. You're bent over the seat of some sort of filthy train carriage, your muscular body straining out of a pale pink vest top and faux-leather skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u4f60\u7684\u809b\u95e8\u611f\u89c9\u5982\u6b64\u7d27 ;\u5f20!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA very fat, sweaty Chinese man has his dick plunged deep up your ass, and is panting heavily and bellowing as he rides you for all he's worth.</span></div></div>",

Your features become delicate and feminine, and painted thickly with make-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This reality sucks,\" you moan in a high girlish voice. A horrible warmth blossoms inside you as the General shudders and twitched in orgasm. You search around desperately for the return portal, but the carriage in empty. \"There's no place like home, there's no place like home, there's no place like home.\" The General gives a satisfied grunt and slides out of you. He pulls up his trousers, straightens his suit, and leaves, not even giving you a backwards glance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe train shoots out of the tunnel, zooming through a illuminated cityscape of neon signs adorning crumbling buildings. It looks more like a vision of Hong Kong than the city you grew up in. Red lights glow from many of the windows, and naked women gyrate and fondle each other teasingly in the displays that look out onto the streets, beckoning to the dark haired men in military uniform that wander the streets. Signs advertising the 'cutest ladyboys in the west', 'sexy shemale bar' and 'hot caucasian sluts' adorn every surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems as though every woman in this reality is a whore. You whimper as you look down at the fake, globular mounds of soft titty flesh swelling from your chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe train shudders to a stop at a station, and the doors slide open. You've no idea where you are or where the portal back home is. Should you get off now, or ride the train to its final destination?</span></div></div>",

To your partial relief, you recognise the old train buildings as those that exist in your world. At least some things are the same. Yet these are crumbling and decayed, and chunks of them are missing, as though bombed. There are posters covering the crumbling brickwork with pictures of a chubby, dour looking Asian politician. 'Obedience is Happiness,' they read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This reality sucks,\" you moan, limping gingerly out of the station. There is a painful ache between your ass cheeks. \"Carrot top gets reefer paradise, and I get the planet of the arse rapers.\" Your tits jiggle obscenely with every step, and a chilling wind bites through the gauzy material of the top and whistles up the short skirt, tickling across the lips of your new vagina. You've never felt more exposed, but you soldier on towards the bright lights of the neon drenched main street, desperate to find the portal and escape this hellish place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the plus side, you think, as you totter on your heels between the rows of gaudy brothels and bars, this place sure has a good supply of whores. In fact, you're not even sure if whore is the proper term - the bars seem to be giving away the sexual services of the women that throng the doorways for free, solely as I means of drawing in punters. You wonder what the women get out of it, although looking at the looks of abject terror on some of their faces, you're guessing it is another day of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt never occurred to you that this place might be unsafe, so used were you to the confidence that 6'2 of well-honed physique. But as the reality as your new form starts to set in, you start to notice the eyes of the soldiers turning to watch your boobs and buttocks as you pass, start to hear the cat calls and obscene remarks in broken English. You quicken your pace, trying to push your way through the crowds. The soldiers are closing in around you, hemming you in. Growing desperate, you try to run. The cheap stiletto heel breaks away beneath your foot and you stumble awkwardly, skirt tearing, breasts spilling, a stab of pain shooting through your brutalized anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, my ass!\" you gasp, clutching your throbbing buttocks. Your eyes go wide as three soldiers seize and fondle you roughly. \"Wh-wait! Wait! Stop, no! I said 'fuck, my ass' not 'fuck my ass'! There was a comma!

She was wearing his brother's clothes, almost as if she'd materialized inside them. She was trembling like a leaf and staring around her in confusion with big, doe eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina Gray didn't know whether to feel relieved or afraid. The last thing she remembered, the General had been on the verge of penetrating her, when all of a sudden the world had lurched and she was standing here... in a strangely familiar room... with a strangely familiar boy sat in front of her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down and shrieked. She was wearing <i>trousers</i>. <i>Male</i> clothes! It was forbidden for women, especially ex-men, to wear male clothes. If the authorities found out, she could be flogged, taken back for reconditioning, or killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry!

Bits of polystyrene packaging clung to the glossy furniture, the wiring was still being installed for the computers that had yet to be delivered, and the air was thick with the smell of fresh paint and newly laid carpet. People rushed to and fro, occasionally tripping over the boxes of unpacked paperwork scattered about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was chaos. Nobody knew who was who, what was where. Even though it had been two months since Open Day and creation of MI7, the new counter-intelligence and security agency intended to cope with the emerging extra-dimensional threats, it still felt as though they were racing to keep up with the situation that was spiraling out of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid Traynor sat at his desk, trying to massage away the dull pain in his right leg, which was unrelenting today. After a short while, he slid open his desk drawer, pulled out the bottle of gin that sat besides his badge and gun, and took a long series of shallow gulps. Two weeks on this job had already pushed him to alcohol. None of the others in the office batted an eyelid - it had been a long day, and it wasn't even 1pm yet. They had been fighting Nazis again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid would be the first to admit he wasn't cut out for this job. He was unfit, couldn't shoot for shit, and had been promoted by his superiors because the media had taken his actions on Open Day and made him a hero. He wasn't a hero, he was simply one of the few officers who had kept their head together while everybody else was losing theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been the night shift when it happened. The phone lines had suddenly been swamped with thousands of calls all at the same time - countless reports of people going missing in their beds, wild animals in city centers, traffic accidents, mass panic. David had quickly pieced together a functional comprehension of what was happening - people were falling through holes in the air and becoming lost in the worlds that lay on the other side, meanwhile the open portals were allowing creatures to venture back here. It was like <i>the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</i>, except the lions were much less friendly and mauling people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmed with this rudimentary understanding, he had ventured into the nearest portal to find himself in a silent, dark forest. A old woman lay not far away on a twisted ankle, and he had returned with her thrown over his shoulder. Over the course of the night, he had rescued eleven others, most of them with injuries sustained during their first Slide, stopping only on the thirteenth planet, when a man-shaped bear (later discovered to be a Viking) speared him through the leg with a weapon straight out of the iron age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had seen him laid up in hospital for seven weeks. Emerging from physiotherapy, he'd discovered that his actions had become heroics, and that his superiors were transferring him to the new agency on triple his previous salary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it a little early to be drinking?\" an obnoxiously cheerful voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked up to see Gemma beaming at him. \"It's past dinner time,\" he grumbled defensively. She was wearing her lab coat, and in her hands she held a blood-soaked, bullet-riddled uniform in a vacuum-sealed plastic bag. It looked like a museum piece of World War II, like something the German SS might wear, except it was made out of a material that stopped bullets better than five inches of kevlar. \"How are you always so cheerful anyway? Doesn't it bother you that the Nazis won on so many of these worlds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be such a cynic, this is only the third one so far!\" she grinned. \"How could anybody not be excited at a time like this? We're discovering new worlds, meeting new civilizations. Every day we're finding new technologies.\" She waggled the bloody garment in his face. \"If I can reverse engineer whatever this 'super-kevlar' is, in a few weeks time it could very well be saving your arse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid scowled. \"Hah! Don't bother. In a few weeks time, none of this will even be here. Mark my words, sooner or later, somebody is going to Slide into somewhere really bad. Something will come through that none of us are prepared to deal with and then us, this country, the whole planet, all of it, fucked.\" He laughed bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly a cheerful drunk, are you,\" Gemma smiled, unfazed. \"The ban goes into effect tonight. Anybody caught Sliding without a license gets an instant jail sentence. Tomorrow won't seem so hectic. We can start getting this under control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn't work, he knew it. They might as well try to ban breathing. The world was getting worse as more and more oddities and weirdos flooded in - there were already tales of vampires and werewolves spreading up North, though it was hard to know how much of anything was true anymore.

Gemma was 20 years his junior and a card carrying lesbian, though that didn't stop her flirting mercilessly with half of the guys in the office. \"Wouldn't touch your planet with a barge pole. Probably full of dykes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think I'd still be here if I had a planet of lesbians? Well... if you ever change your mind about touching my planet with your barge pole, my hole's always open,\" she purred. Cackling gleefully at the look of lust that had passed momentarily over the older officer's face, she turned and sauntered away back to her lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid watched her go, enjoying the curves of her youthful figure beneath the lab coat, before returning reluctantly to the cases laid out on the desk. He shifted around the folders in front of him, selecting three, all cases of abduction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was unpleasant - a report of a masked individual abducting young, drunken men on nights out and Stepping with them into his own reality. It was said that some realities out there changed and warped the bodies of those who stepped foot within them, the reality of the masked abductor appeared to be one of them. All of the victims stated that, upon arriving in the other realm, they had been transformed into women, whereupon the abductor had raped them, before returning them to Earth Prime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second case concerned the disappearance of five researchers from the local University. It was perhaps more pressing than the first, since they had all been studying the phenomenon of the alternate Earths at the time.</span></div></div>",

It was the sort they used for arctic expeditions. He looked like the Michelin man as he followed at Merley's heels out of the office, into the lift, and down into the walled compound that surrounded the MI7 buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Step Day, there had been the obvious problem of prison containment. Prisoners had escaped their cells en masse, jumping away into their alternate realities, leaving behind empty prisons filled with open portals. The government had mandated that each prisoners had to be tracked down and returned to Earth Prime to serve out their sentence. It was a hell of a manhunt, still very much ongoing, and even when they were brought back there was still the question of what to do with them when they could simply Step away again at any time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral solutions had been trialed. The first had been building a prison on the top floor of a skyscraper yet, even after instilling at great lengths into the criminals the consequences of jumping to a different world at that height, many had still done it, and had subsequently plummeted to their deaths on realities that had never heard of a skyscraper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second had been to build it underwater - it had flooded within hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third was to place the prisoners in deep mine shafts, where they couldn't Step because the corresponding location on the alternate earths was blocked by stone, which had worked perfectly right up until the point that it flooded with lava.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only recourse was to transfer the prison population off Earth Prime, into somebody else's world where it was impossible to Step. David's had been that world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here it comes,\" Merley said as the prison bus entered through the compound gates. The prisoners were escorted off one by one by thick set guards with shotguns. Their hands were tied in front of them by bulky handcuffs linked to a transmitter. If they moved out of range of the transmitter, such as by sliding, the handcuffs would stun them with 10,000 volts. Harsh but effective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stood watching the prisoners as they lined up on the  cold, overcast yard. Most of them were men. One was not. She had to bow her head to fit under the door of the bus. She was seven feet tall with long, muscular arms and legs, dark bronze skin, and a pair of slender, furred ears, like those of a hare, that sat on top of her head. She moved with a gangly, animal lope, and attractive in a feral sort of way. Her fingers came to sharp claws with which she kept slashing at her own prison clothes. She didn't seem to appreciate being clothed, and the orange jumpsuit hung from her body in torn strips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An immigrant,\" Merley replied. \"She killed the unlucky sod who slid through to her reality, and by the time we managed to track her the portal had sealed. Until we can find a way to send her back to where she came from, we're containing her on your Earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure I feel comfortable placing her with the other inmates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerley chuckled darkly. \"If you'd seen the fight she put up, you'd be more worried about the rapists,\" he said. \"Right. Looks like we're all ready. Slide across.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid closed his eyes, picturing his world. In no time, he felt the crackle of electricity over his skin, then a freezing cold wind bite into his skin, flakes of snow landing wet on his face. He opened his eyes. White snow stretced to the horizon the horizon, broken only by the black, cuboid boulders that lay scattered. The drifts rose up to his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid turned. There was the portal, hanging like a window in the air. On the other side, Merley still stood on the damp concrete of the yard, buttoning his overcoat against the frigid wind that blew through the hole in reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot far away, situated almost exactly where the MI7 building should be, stood the fortress. It was vast, built to the scale of a mountain out of the carved, black monolithic stones. David had found it deserted and empty on his first step. With no signs of the original occupants, MI7 had appropriated its vast underground dungeons for the storage of prisoners while they searched for a more permanent solutions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Start sending them through,\" Merley barked. The prisoners were led through at gunpoint and marched towards the fortress. The tall rabbit girl had to hunch right over to fit through the portal, her bare paws sinking into the snow. The wind buffeted her long ears, but she seemed not to notice the cold. Flakes of snow steamed on her bare skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid followed after the miserable procession. The front gate of the fort loomed like a cave mouth, blocked by a portcullis but one of such a vast scale that it was possible for the humans to squeeze between the bars. Whoever had built this place must have been two or even three times human size. They had found food stores in the fort that held long strips of tough meat from animals the size of mammoths, salted and frozen solid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Whoever they are, I just hope they don't come back,' David thought to himself, as they proceeded down the echoing, cavernous hallways.</span></div></div>",

It was a minor difference, insignificant, an ant trodden on at the wrong moment, but enough to snowball a chain of events that ultimately lead to not one species emerging to take its place as planetary apex predator, but many. While humanity stayed in the trees, canines, cats, reptiles, and many others raced ahead in evolution, raced each other, developing bigger brains and bipedalism, becoming intelligent masters of tools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the races expanded and encountered each other, it was inevitable that conflict would arise. And arise it did. The races fought each other to a bloody stalemate for many thousands of years, wars that accelerated advancements in technology and industry as the races sought out a competitive edge, yet at the same time stripping the planet of its resources at an exponential rate. At its zenith, the art of war was perfected, the races fielding technologies of spectacularly efficient brutality unseen on Earth Prime.  Even still, the stalemate endured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as the eons passed, the resources began to run out. The oil that powered the war machines ran dry, as did the coal used to smelt metal, and the uranium for the nuclear bombs that had decimated the planet. Slowly, the endless war wound down, returning to the age of infantry of old, where combatants fought each other with tooth and claw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough they may appear so at first, the beast men are not savages or barbarians. Their culture and technological understanding is great, they simply lack the resources to implement it for anything non-essential, such that their societies are a curious mix of the old and the new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe war still wages. The stalemate is absolute, the battle lines dug deep and unchanging in generations. But perhaps the arrival of a new breed of humans and the opening of a portal to a world still (relatively) rich in mineral wealth can tip the balance in favour of your race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Races</b><br>\r\nThe indigenous humans of Earth primal are stunted and docile, with the intellect of animals. They live in the wild and are kept in captivity by the felinids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fully grown felinid stands anywhere from 7 to 11 feet tall, and resembles an upright walking big cat, like a tiger or leapard. Their females are ferocious warriors and hunters, while their males tend to be more subdued, living lives of leisure and partnered with multiple females.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe canids are evolved canines of roughly human height. Though not as physically imposing as the cats, they fight as highly effective packs following an alpha leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReptilia are the most technologically advanced race, but are currently suffering a population crisis having been pushed from their historical breeding grounds.

The thumper line marks the extent of your tribe's territory - the large, rudimentary pylons constantly thumping the ground with a rock weight. The thumpers disturb the ground and make a tremendous noise, collapsing the tunnels and deafening the long ears of any rabbit that tries to burrow under. If they get inside, they'll run rampant, gorging themselves on the harvests and breeding like wildfire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thumpers form a roughly circular perimeter two hundred miles in length - there is some overlap, so that if one goes down, the neighbouring thumpers will hold the line until the broken one is up-and-running again. Even still, it should be fixed swiftly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leather strap of the rifle slung over you shoulder sits uncomfortably between your six breasts as you set out cross country, your long legs swiftly eating up the miles as you stride to your destination, a blot of bright orange and black fur moving across the green wilderness, a part of the world that in other realities would rest inside a place called India. It is nearing the end of the dry season, is hot and and humid, and you're naked apart from the satchel around your hips that contains your tools (and your fur of course).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the top of the thumper comes into view over the forest canopy. It is a wide column of stone sticking twenty metres into the sky. The inside is hollow, containing a lead weight on a rope that is constantly winched up to the top of the column, whereupon the mechanism releases and sends the weight slamming into the earth, to repeat over again. It isn't a complicated machine, it was constructed to last. If they go down, it's usually sabotage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thumper stands silent and unmoving. As you near it, you unsling the rifle and proceed cautiously, your limbs moving with a silent, smooth grace despite their size. The rifle is a reassuring weight, it has been in your family for generations and is your most prized possession. Sliding through the foliage, the clearing that surrounds the thumper opens out before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn amused, relieved trill escapes your throat. It's no precursor to a canid attack, like you had feared. A number of human animals are clustered around the base of the thumper. They gape up at the structure in pure, dumb awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou like humans, though you've neither the time nor the patience to house and train one yourself, not with work as it is. You like their slow, docile natures, and the silly way they waddle about on their stumpy little legs. Your sister breeds them. She's constantly trying to fob you off with the runts of the litters, but you're happy enough just to play with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneaking forward so as not to alarm the creatures, you see that these are not wild nor feral animals, they've evidently escaped from their owner's home. For starters, they're far too clean to be wild. Plus they're wrapped up in fabric. You hate people who dress up their pets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears swivel forward, picking up their low, hooting cries. They almost sound like they're talking to one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me again how this is a natural rock formation,\" the large male says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female hoots back angrily, \"If you're looking for an apology,-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the things that looked like roads, those were just dried up river beds, yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've made your point. By all means, shut up now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And those weird radio noises that sounded like transmissions, those were just electromagnetic distortions in the atmosphere caused by solar flares. I mean, clearly you know best with your fancy degrees an' all. I'm just the dumb-as-bricks security guy.\" The male hoists a stick onto its shoulder, casting a furtive glance around the clearing. You duck down into the undergrowth. \"That's it, we're done here. Get your equipment together and stop fucking poking it. We're leaving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are not leaving!\" the female mews shrilly. \"Look at this thing! Mark, tell him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA much scrawnier, paler human creature crouched down by the winching mechanism gives a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>am</i> looking at it, Professor. Clear evidence of habitation, meaning that under the quarantine act of 2014 we are required by law to evacuate immediately back to the portal and await a proper, armed investigative team from the government.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, fuck the government,\" the female in the long white garment screeches back heatedly. \"This could be the find of my career.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This planet could be <i>dangerous</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be such an idiot. This thing is made of stone and lashed together with vines. Whoever built this was probably even stupider than you, and clearly hasn't even made it out of the stone age. We're perfectly safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting the rifle sights to your eye, you gasp as the x10 magnification zooms in on the animals, as they continue to yabber incomprehensibly. Pedigrees! The female has a short mane of red hair and the two males, while less enticing, still display the pale skin seen only on the expensive, imported animals from the far West. A thought runs through your head - if you can capture one of these pedigree humans, your sister will love you for it.</span></div></div>",

The sun glints of the surface of the stick, revealing what you had thought to be wood to be polished gunmetal. \"Night night, kitty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a pneumatic *phut*, a feathered dart shoots from the end. You sidestep the projectile lazily, confused. Where had a <i>monkey</i> gotten its hands on a gun? Guns are so rare that you could probably list the name and owner of every one for a hundred miles. More importantly, how had such a stupid animal learned to fire one and, more pressingly, reload it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monkey is chambering a second dart with a purposeful, practiced motion of its stubby fingers. It raises its rifle and you do the same, squeezing the trigger. The human spasms as twin beams of coherent microwave and infra-red radiation wash over him, the baleful light cooking his insides and outsides in an instant, his boiling juices leaking out, his eyes melting, his skin charring and peeling away with a delicious meaty aroma. The underslung flachete launcher goes off with a kick. The spinning, razor-sharp strips of metal cut through him, slicing him cleanly into juicy, bite-sized chunks, which tumble onto the ground and roll across the grass, steaming wetly. You love this gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female begins to shriek at the top of her lungs.</span></div></div>",

It is a fine specimen, young and healthy with fertile hips guaranteed to pop out a litter or two. Her creamy white flesh already has you salivating a little. Their faces are a little flat and their heads rather bulbous, but you suppose that's the result of the inbreeding required to produce such purebreds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising out of the thick foliage to your full 9-foot height, you step into the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is <i>that</i>,\" the meatless one chitters, as you move slowly towards the female, claws sheathed. The humans are alert and wary, but don't yet move, frozen to the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the risk of saying that I told you so, I'd say one of the creatures that built the roads and sent the radio transmissions,\" the fatter male says gleefully, its lips peeling back to show its teeth. \"But hey, that's only a stone age rifle it's holding. I'm sure we're perfectly safe, right, Professor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like a... tiger. It's massive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female takes a step back. \"Why is it looking at me like that? Dave, don't just stand there, shoot it. Dave? Dave?! DAVE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns her head. The fat human has bolted and is running for the far edge of the clearing. \"You're on your own, Prof!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female turns on her heels, sprinting after him. You bound after her excitedly, ripping up clods of earth beneath your paws. The female trips and lands hard in the dirt, and you leap for her with a victorious roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooooooo!\" The scrawny male throws himself between you and the fallen female, and tackles you, wrapping his thin arms around your torso. Aww, he's hugging you! \"Run, Sam! Run! I'll hold it off as long as I can!\"  His tiny fists rain gentle punches against your hard, muscular abdomen. The female is still cowering on the floor. You realise the male must be attempting to protect her, unsual behaviour for humans. Normally when faced with a predator, it was every man for himself, the group of humans cattering in all directions. They would only ever stand and fight when in a defense of.... a pregnant female!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA delighted purr starts in your belly at the thought of all those adorable human babies, and you squeeze the male in your arms gleefully.  His hairless skin is wonderfully smooth against your fur and you grab his head and smoosh it against your chest, the purr becoming a deep satisfied growl as his silky cheeks run over your nipples. His head buried in your six breasts, his muffled cries grow weaker \"... run, Sam... get... get out of here... can't breath....can't... breath....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe goes limp, unconscious. Your sister is always chastising you for playing too rough with her pets, but frequently you forget that they're not as resilient as cubs. You lay his sleeping form carefully on the floor, and move over to the other. Her ankle is twisted, which is why she hasn't run. She clutches it and makes weak cries of fear and pain as you crouch beside her. Gingerly lifting her and cradling her into your arms like you would a newborn cub, you begin to lick her clean, hoping to sooth her panic.</span></div></div>",

You stroke her vibrant red hair and pull away some of the clothing on the injured animal to nuzzle and lick at the skin of its chest and neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[Please don't eat me... please don't eat me...]\" it mews in your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're no human expert, but you get the impression that your gentle cleaning is having the reverse of its intended effect and scaring the poor thing. Most cubs (and one or two males) love it when you give them a once over with your tongue, evidently humans not so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay her aside carefully and return to the task at hand. It doesn't take long to discover the damage caused by the curious creatures - one of the gears connecting the turbine to the winch system has been disengaged. Slotting the machinery back together sets the thumper going again, as it begins to slowly winch the heavy weight up its column. Quickly you return to the humans - you intend to be long gone before the thumper has time to slam back down into the Earth, you'd rather not spend the rest of the day with ringing ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female limping towards the edge of the clearing, hopping slowly on one leg while keeping the weight off her twisted one. It's so pathetically adorable. You sweep her into your arms, cradling her tiny form close to your chest, then sling the male over one shoulder. You set out, retracing the route you forged through the thick vegetation getting here, but soon detouring in the directions of your sister's residence. From behind, you hear the distant thud of the thumper with satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister lives in a villa of white stone, distinct for the high wall that surrounds it. The wall isn't for her protection (after all, your race has no natural predators), but to keep the pet humans locked away inside. It's the only way to keep them from wandering off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let yourself inside the compound. You find your sister in the garden, sprawled out on a slab of rock, sunning herself in the midday sun. In her day, she had been a terrific hunter, though these days she cares only for breeding, both of herself and her pets. Three of her cubs chase a group of humans around the garden, shouting mock hunting calls over the panicked mooing of the animals. She keeps one wary eye on their rough play, her tail twitching. She cares deeply about her pets, and has a strict no-eating rule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eldest cub manages to corner tackles one of the humans in the corner of the walled garden, tackling it and pinning it to the ground. It opens its salivating mouth, ready to chomp down on the tiny pink ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister rises from the slab, fur bristling. \"Hey! What did I tell you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But muuuuum! It doesn't need both ears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No eating the humans, unless I say so. Otherwise it comes out of your pocket money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer daughter sulks, but lets the human go, giving it a head start before bounding after it. Your sister's ears perk up as she hears you stepping behind her. She turns, her face splitting into a broad, toothy grin. The female in your arms moans a little. \"[Ah God... there's more of them...]\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well. If it isn't the Great Hunter,\" your sister mocks. That's been her nickname for you ever since she handed the family rifle to you. Her eyes fall on the thing in your arms and she gasps in disbelief. She doesn't ask for permission, just plucks it right out of your grip. \"<i>What</i> do we have here? Where on Earth did you find this? This breed cost a fortune.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you'd like it. A group of them were interfering with the thumpers. Any idea who they might belong to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. <i>Me</i>,\" she laughs. The human yelps as she crushes it possessively to her chest. \"Don't tell me you're thinking of reporting them. You know they'll only put them down if you hand them in. Let me have them. You owe me this, I gave you the rifle!\"</span></div></div>",

Most born in the generations since didn't bother learning why everything was like it was, they knew nothing else and were taught how to survive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, however, were different. Sure, you were good with a gun and could probably fend off a rabid dog barehanded, but what you were interested in was the past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChekrova and Pyortovik. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were the names of the two Empires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou live in the shattered husk of a city once held by Pyortovik. It no longer had a name; it was just The City. Most of the citizen, you included, live in an underground bunker network that stretches across The City. Going outside at all was dangerous; go for a walk without any protection and you'd be cancer'd to death - if that was a real phrase - in seconds if your throat wasn't torn apart by dust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made a pretty good living for yourself, occasionally venturing out into the wastes in search of books that weren't completely ruined. They sold for a high price, allowing you not just your own room, but a large one at that! And with sound dampening walls, you could actually have a sleep cycle, as opposed to plugging your ears and shutting your eyes whenever you were exhausted. There was always too much noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of your own room, it was pretty nice. Good ventilation, a bed that didn't have shit and piss soaked into the matress, a desk and lamp so you could write using holopaper - books were easy to replicate, but getting them in the first place? A lot harder. And given how the Network's stock of literature was rather pathetic?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, there was a reason you were payed so well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's like this, you know? You got your 'pad and holopaper, you can just copy the holopaper onto the 'pad and have a permanent copy, but you needed the book in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was your job. Getting books. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few of the children around the Bunker called you the Librarian. It was easy to see why, although librarians tended to check books out rather than copy and sell them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour possessions, like your room, were expensive. A Mortovich battery rifle - rudimentary laser rifle, unlimited battery life but needs to recharge when it runs out of juice - and a full suit of body armour, a radio and mini telescreen, some rather nice drinks, and so on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour respirator was also high quality. Better safe than sorry. You'd heard some poor bastard's had failed just before getting into the Bunker. Apparently he could never talk again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start off most days with a routine of sorts, and today is no different. Get out of bed, walk over to toilet, piss so the water recyclers let you use the taps without paying for the water, get dressed and have breakfast, then check mail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had mail. Probably another job. Might as well take it. You could never get too rich, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So, do you want to continue this storyline, or start your own?</i></span></div></div>",

Intercepting the man as he tries to run, tripping over his chair, out of the corner of your eyes you can see the woman running down a set of stairs into a basement. Good, she wouldn't be able to run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing the man over onto his back with a steel-shod boot, you lean down and grab his clothes at the chest, roughly lifting him up to eye legs so he could gaze through the otherwise blank faceplate into your burning azure eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is the demon?\" You ask, your voice deadly calm. Your only answer is the stench of urine, the man too afraid to string together a sentence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>I SAID</b>, where is the demon?\" The man still does not answer, his eyes resembling those of a rabbit being chased by a particularly large hound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be judged for this, later.\" Rearing your head back, you slam your forehead into his, your metal faceplate ensuring that the man was out cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpreading your red robes to reveal the heavy steel armour underneath, you draw your sword and advance down the stairs into the basement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder your helmet, your face contorts with disgust. A summoning circle was engraved into the floor with chalk, a candle set at each of the star's points. Candles that had been hurriedly and sloppily lit by the frantic woman cowering in the corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEldritch fire begins to spill forth from the circle, and you turn your attention to whatever threat was about to emerge. <br>\r\nA humanoid figure, its skin entirely red, materialises in the midst of the circle, the flame dissipating. Upon seeing you, the demon's face displays shock and fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood. All evil should fear the Inquisition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obviously a lesser demon, his appearance indicating as much. No horns, pathetic muscles, average human height, and small claws instead of fingernails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmour clanking, you stride towards the disgusting thing, turning as you do so, your sword in your hand. Turning on the spot, you let your sword arm travel in a horizontal arc, ripping through the demon's throat in an instant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegaining your balance, you watch as the now headless body thumps to the floor. You were lucky it was a lesser demon that was summoned, as even the rawest of Inquisition recruits could defeat them with the right moves. Spinning decalitations seemed to be popular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon's body dissolves into a pink-red fire, returning it back to the Hell it came from. Noting the candlesticks on the summoning circle's star points, you quickly rend each of them in half, your sword easily cutting through them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the sobbing woman in the corner of the room, you grab her by the hair, dragging her kicking and wailing form behind you as you exit the building, pausing to sheath your sword and take hold of the male heretic's clothes. Dragging both the unconscious man and the screaming woman through the streets, you whisper to her, just loudly enough so that only she can hear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>God may forgive all, but I'm not God.

What greets you is a makeshift platform, as well as a small pit dug into an area not covered by stones. Standing on the platform are fellow members of the Inquisition; the executioner, the judge, and a first acolyte. A large cros has gathered, cheering you on as you approach with the two heretics in your grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting the two up by their hair, you force their gazes upwards to the judge and executioner; the man having regained consciousness as you were walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are gathered here today to witness the trial of these two heretics. The first is accused of willingly summoning a demon; and the second is accused of helping her in this endeavour. Do you have anything to say in your defense?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman is silent, her voice having faded after so much wailing. The man is too terrified to speak. They know they are about to die. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, then. The demon-summoner shall be burnt at the stake, and her accomplice shall be beheaded. Do you wish to repent before you die?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is no response from either of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So be it. Executioner, if you would assist the second acolyte and bind the hands of these heretics?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe executioner makes his way down from the platform, carrying two lengths of rope him. Forcing both of the heretics to lie flat on the ground, the executioner binds their hands. Forcing the woman to crawl forward on her knees, you shove her into the pit, wherein lay a large volume of wood. The executioner takes a burning chunk of wood from a nearby brazier and drops it into the pit, his mask rigid and unemotional. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring both the screams of the burning woman's and the roars of the crowd, you drag the man up to the platform, the executioner following just behind. There is a shaped block of wood at the edge of the platform used in occasions such as this, it is just the right shape for a human head to fit into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing his head into the wooden block, you put your weight down on the back of his head as he begins to struggle. The crowd, having grown bored with the dead woman, turns their attention to you and the executioner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Executioner, if you would take the second acolyte's blade...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe executioner does so, the sword making a sharp <i>shing!</i> as it is removed from its scabbard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe executioner raises the blade high before swinging downwards in an overhead arc. He cleanly slices the the heretic's neck, and you hold the head in the air for the crowd to gaze upon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BEHOLD! The rate of all evildoers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd erupts into a frenzy of cheers, screams, and howls. There is a slight buzzing sensation in the back of your skull, but you ignore the feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes almost an hour for the crowd to disperse. Both bodies were incinerated, their ashes cast into the wind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk back to the Monastery, the headquarters of the Inquisition. Passers by cheer you as you walk. That annoying buzzing sensation returns for a brief time, but it vanishes soon enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, an excellent day for the forces of Good, and a terrible one for the forces of Evil. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"<i>During my time on Earth, I witnessed what I can only adequately describe as a battle, of sorts. Two different sides - one wearing white clothes with a red cross emblazoned on both the front and back, the other wearing blue clothes with a diagonal white cross - repeatedly charged at each other, trying to gain territory with a set area. At first, I thought that these humans were training the participants to be warriors, but as I watched, I noticed an elliptical ball of sorts being carried, thrown about, and kicked - it was a sport! Eventually, one of the humans wearing white and red penetrated the other side's lines while carrying the ball, slamming into the ground when reaching a white line that had been hastily marked before the beginning of the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking with some of the participants afterwards, I learned that such games were a common occurrence, and a way of staying fit. Several of the participants seemed to be highly critical of a different variant of the sport - this one being named 'Rugby', the variant being 'American Football' - for reasons I did not initially understand. The reasons turned out to be both social and cultural, to a degree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nation where I was staying at the time was named, as you should recall, England - an island nation several thousand years old that at one point dominated most of Earth before slowly declining as time went on, but still remaining a major power due to its wealth and military. The other nation, America - or to be more accurate, the United States of America - England being part of the United Kingdom - was once an English colony that successfully rebelled against English rule, fighting several wars against them before the two slowly became the steadfast allies that they are today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reasons for the criticality seemed to be both a combination of, and I quote, \"Americans not knowing the definition of the word foot\", suggesting some mild jingoism, and bizzarely, the use of padded armour in American Football. The several broken bones I witnessed during the game of Rugby would seem to suggest that the use of armour was a very good idea indeed, but I was assured that broken bones were common in both sports. Given how my species possesses no bones, I would be rather keen to make sure mine would stay undamaged, if I was a vertebrate.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling slightly, you bookmark the page you were reading on your holopad, before setting it down, standing up, and stretching, hearing several bones crack and pop. You had been to Earth before, and it seemed like a nice place to live. Maybe when you worked up enough credits you could have another holiday there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lived on Viaso, a multispecies hub planet - a combination of a planet spanning city and a massive spaceport. At least you had an apartment to yourself. It was a rather nice one, as well - cool blue lighting suiting the steel grey walls, and high quality fittings, furniture and mod-cons meant that it was brilliantly easy to unwind and relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps you could go out for a bit. You had agreed to meet Terax later. Terax was a Vulthoor, an insectoid race sharing humanity's reputation for violence. There were differences, however, differences between the two races. Humanity was almost naturally suited for modern combat - bipedal, with two hands; fast and able to take punishment; and adrenaline and endorphins essentially made humans the perfect shock troops. However, most humans were not suited for combat, despite what many aliens claimed, as they were mentally or physically unfit, the first being the most common reason - it was one thing to have the ability to kill someone, but it was another thing to be able to do so without suffering major psychological trauma. Many human soldiers were only able to be in such a career because of adrenaline, that wonderful drug turning meek and quiet men and women into rabid killing machines on the battlefield. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulthoor, on the other hand, were quadrupedal insectoid with a single pair of arms. While not as strong or fast as humans in general, Vulthoor were steady on their feet; possessed natural spikes running along the outer sides of their arms, and above all else, were able to be disciplined and trained to degrees that would make many human soldiers weep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, Humans were the primal warriors of the galaxy, and the Vulthoor were the soldiers of the galaxy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Terax often chatted over drinks in the local pub, or whatever the word for it was in the various alien languages. One topic he was particularly interested in was human weaponry, the Vulthoor having recently found footage of different tanks throughout human history on the extranet. You and him were thinking of ways to come up with the perfect tank as a pastime, the Vulthoor once having spent several Earth-Standard hours looking up ablative armour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking the holopad back up and collapsing it, you prepare to go out and meet Terax, ready for another discussion on Human and Vulthoor weaponry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So, do you continue with this scenario, or do you want a different one?</i></span></div></div>",

A myriad of vehicles, be they ground based or sky bound, could be seen flitting here and there in the distance. Opposite the massive window, on the cool blue wall, were adverts of various natures. Scanning them as you walk by, your brain picks out a few that seem more interesting than the rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of them were pretty standard stuff. Cab services, local restaurants, the usual fare. But one advert in particular stood out against all others. In the forefront of this particular ad, several human soldiers stood, their rifles raised and firing at some terror offscreen, their faces hidden by their helms. A hulking soldier in full power armour grappled with some alien terror, the human overpowering the beast. A mushroom cloud dominated the background of the image, a pair of screeching and burning xenos being put down by two helmeted human soldiers. They never show their faces in the ads for some reason. And right in the center of the advert, the words <i><b>ENLIST NOW!</b></i> in a silvery stylised font. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that was impressive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistracted by the patriotic glory of the advert, you accidentally bump into an alien, the envirosuit wearing triped stumbling. \"HEY! Watch it, you-\" the alien begins, freezing for a second before hurriedly running off. Being a human had its perks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the pub, you step inside, immediately sighting Terax. Taking your seat next to the vulthoor, who acknowledges you presence with a nod even as he finishes off a drink, you bring out your holopad, ready if he needs to research something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What topic does Terax want to talk about?</i></span></div></div>",

Grab their cargo and wipe their computers' records!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were many words to describe you in the myriad languages of the cosmos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPirate; privateer; corsair; rogue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd judging by the contents of literature you'd pilfered from the last ship raid, romantic archetype. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it comes with the job, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOfficially, you don't exist. Officially, your kind doesn't exist. But when Humanity is at war, as it is now, you and people like you are called in to serve. <br>\r\nBrave patriots, risking all to sabotage vital enemy supply lines, preventing the enemy's weapons, ammunition, armour and more, from ever reaching him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, war had been declared once again. Tensions between humanity and the vorox - a race of bipedal reptilians with a strong caste society - had finally erupted into war. Guns blazed, feet marched in time, engines roared and belched smoke into the skies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the rest of the galaxy averted their gazes, quietly forming pacts, enforcing sanctions, attempting to unite against humanity and generally being rather slow about it - such was the nature of politics, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowling happily and quietly, you lean back in your chair, enjoying your surroundings. Your ship, <i>The Theremin</i> as it was currently known, was essentially a civilian cruise ship converted into a warship. That meant lots of space. Space that could be used to store 'liberated' cargo. Space that could be used to give each crewmember their own cabin. Space that could be used to hide guns and missile launchers until the right moment, when they would emerge from their hiding places on your ship and unleash a broadside, or a salvo, or whatever firing pattern you wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cabin - the captain's cabin - looked like the inside of a twenty first century hotel room; the economic use of space, the pleasing colours, the simple and subtle elegance that many seem to miss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiddling with your datapad, you check the estimated time it would take to travel back to Terra; you were still several hours out. Still, you'd had an excellent catch with the last raid. Intercepting enemy gun-runners was always profitable, especially when they were supporting the vorox, and especially when the Solar League was at war. You'd crippled the ship while in the gravity well of a large garden planet, managing to destroy the engines. Quickly ordering the crew to their bidding pods, you'd made quick estimates on the ship's remaining time in orbit before joining them, travelling across in your own pod as the pods already attached were slowly winched back, pulling the enemy ship closer and closer to your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been pretty easy to subdue to vorox gun-runners. Only one had attempted to resist, aiming a pistol at one of your crewmen before you'd shot him dead, right between the eye-ridges. After that, the Theremin's crew had grabbed any valuable cargo and re-entered the Theremin through the boarding pods, which had been secured back into the Theremin by the winch system. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd allowed the gun-runners to make a distress call before forcing them to evacuate to the planning below in an escape pod. You had allowed them to take some of the food that your men hadn't raided. After all, the vorox would be there shortly to pick them back up, and they'd most likely be able to eat anything on the planet once their supplies ran out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, you'd sent the distress call - making sure that their computers were completely wiped except for the distress called - and then re-entered the Theremin before jettisoning the gun-runners' ship. It would probably disintegrate in the atmosphere by the time you got back to Terra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, well. That's what happens when you declare war on humanity and the Solar League, after all!</span></div></div>",

All those present - you included - shuffled and fidgeted nervously, unsure if the human was going to do anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumans. Such a unique species. The only species to have ever evolved sapience on a class 10 planet; a death world. Earth, as their homeworld was named, was, compared to the vast majority of habitable planets, hellish. Utterly hellish. The Landmasses constantly shifted, allowing tectonic activity such as earthquakes and volcanoes to run rampant. Vicious beasts lay in the untamed jungles and dusty savannahs. Crushing gravity, a dense atmosphere, and soakingly humid air debilitated all but the planets' natives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human fidgets in his reinforced chair, glancing about at the various aliens in the room. \"Uh, I guess I'll go next...\" Cracking the gravity densened bones of his manipulator digits, he stands and begins to read aloud from the slip of 'paper' he was holding. Of course, you're barely paying attention, the words simply manifesting as a background noise as you look the human over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho in their right mind thought it would be a good idea to invite a human - a brutal species capable of ripping off limbs and crushing spines with such ease that the average in their species had little trouble doing it - to the interspecies poetry club?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Round the decay<br>\r\nOf that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,<br>\r\nThe lone and level sands stretch far away...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human smiles nervously, showing a set of teeth that could shear through bone evolved on countless worlds less harsh than his. \"So, what do you guys think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese 'multiculturalists' were strange, even for humans. Always wanting to experience what other cultures have to offer, despite the tenuous peace between humanity and the rest of the galaxy, inevitably and unintentionally scaring all those they met wherever they went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human turns to you. <i>Oh please no, no, no, no...</i><br>\r\n\"Pretty good, huh?\"</span></div></div>",

But there were those who did not join them in the embrace of Humanity; the Undomesticated; the Wild; the Prodigal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning away from Humanity's offer of love and companionship, the Undomesticated surrendered to their instincts, becoming little more than beasts. Dismayed, Humanity tried to draw the Undomesticated into the fold, even as the Undomesticated began to dwindle in number, but it was no use. Eventually, only the Domesticated, this who had been faithful all along, remained. Both furious and depressed, the Creators turned their feelings on each other, accusing themselves of failing in their mission to preserve the lives of those that could one day have joined them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Creators, blinded by their anger and pain, allowed the resources sustaining their cities of steel and glass to run dry, and prepared their mighty armies to secure what they could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in the midst of the confusion, a small group of Creators, each a master of their discipline, began to construct the Airship, in the hope that some would survive the coming Armageddon. The forms of the Domesticated were fragile and weak, so they were improved, gifted with the sacred form of the Creators themselves. But even with their new bodies, the Domesticated lacked true intelligence. This too, was gifted to them by the Creators so that they could survive and prosper, and maintain the holy Airship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, joy of joys, some few Undomesticated had been saved! Their numbers partially restored, they too were gifted with the forms and intelligence of the Creators. But the Creators were sad, their companions both old and new would soon be leaving them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>We do not want to go, Masters.</i>\", said the Enlightened, boundaries between the Domesticated and Undomesticated having been forgotten. \"<i>Please do not make us go. We love you.</i>\" The Creators grew solemn. \"<b>We are sorry, our children, but you must go. There are those among us who would seek to destroy one another, and we must save you before they accomplish this goal. To guide you, we have prepared a set of rules for all Enlightened to follow:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shall not kill. <br>\r\nYou shall not steal. <br>\r\nYou shall not lie. <br>\r\nYou shall not damage the Airship. <br>\r\nYou shall not return to the ground until one of us appears on the Airship, in person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut we want you to be happy, children. There is enough food on the Airship to last forever, you shall not go hungry. There is enough water on the Airship to last forever, you shall not go thirsty. We have placed our books and our games and our plays and our movies and our music on the Airship, you shall not grow bored. We have changed your bodies in ways you cannot conceive, you shall not grow old and illnesses shall not touch you. We have placed machines that can replicate any of you from just a single drop of blood, you shall not become extinct. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe also have a request.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>We would do anything for you, masters!</i>\" the Enlightened replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Remember us.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, it was time for the Enlightened to ascend. They entered the Airship, which was as large as one of the cities of the Creators, and found dwellings therein for every species. Every species had been turned into an Enlightened, an Anthro, every insect, every mammal, every reptile, every bird, every animal. And there was more than enough space for them all, from the horses who towered at heights of over ten feet, to the insects who were merely a few inches taller than the Creators, such was their ingenuity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the Airship climbed above the clouds, never to touch to ground until the Creators return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome quick notes about this reality:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthros range from roughly seven feet tall to twenty feet tall, depending on the size of the animal they are an anthro of. For example, an anthro insect would be the minimum height of seven feet tall, an anthro horse would be anywhere from eleven to seventeen feet tall, and the vast majority of anthro orcas would be the full twenty feet tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthros worship humans as gods. Expect any humans entering this reality to be bowed down to, even by the anthros so large that they are almost house-sized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Airship is completely self-sustainable, and has enough food and water to last for thousand of years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFemale anthros in this reality possess two breasts, regardless of how many teats the animal they come from had if they were a mammal, and regardless of the fact that non-mammalian animals do not have breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthros can get rather huggy around humans. Expect physical displays of affection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthros do not age once they become adults, and they can of become ill, no matter the circumstances, as their immune systems are just that strong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, do you want to go with this reality, or find another?</span></div></div>",

Sighing, you were about to tell the owner of the voice to shut up when someone does it for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DARIUS, WILL YOU SHUT UP?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to Lecia, your awakened roommate tiredly staggering through the doorway of her own bedroom. \"Kinda trying to sleep here, you know.\" You manage to say before the door to your apartment is unlocked, allowing a very happy Darius - who was lugging a large grey crate behind him - entrance. The heavily augmented hulk of a man drags the crate behind him, softly kicking the door shut as he goes, depositing it in the centre of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarius was around six foot three, and spent most of his time either at the gym or with the other militiamen, although having both of his arms replaced with augs meant that a lot of the working out he did had no effect on his muscle mass. His augs were a deep crimson, which according to Darius was patriotic because Cesatar's flag was red. You couldn't give less of a toss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLecia had a minimal amount of augs, having had an aversion to surgery since an accident several years ago, the details of which she kept to herself and her family. All you knew was that both of her eyes had been replaced with cybernetic versions, the irises of which glowed a soft green in the darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyeing the grey crate before you and the grinning Darius, you decide to bite the bullet. \"Alright, Darius, show us whatever new toys you've got so I can go the fuck to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarius flips several catches on the meter or so tall crate and pushes the lid open, revealing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it cool?\" Darius says, lifting one of the battlesuits out of the crate. \"They're covered with a layer of ceramic, have a single layer of Kevlar, <i>then</i> a layer of anti-kinetic gel, then another layer of Kevlar! This thing's equal to almost seven inches of Kevlar!\" <br>\r\nYou scrutinise the suspiciously thin battlesuit, slowly examining it as Darius rattles off its specifications and model and so forth. It couldn't have been thicker than your wrist. Then again, the A-K gel sounded pretty good for stopping bullets, coupled with two layers of Kevlar and one of ceramic...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarius proudly lifts two more suits out of the crate, both of which were much more bulky when compared to the first. \"Don't worry, though, you guys! I managed to get two extra, so you can both join me when we test them against modern equipment on Sunday! First we're gonna put them on dummies and fire at them to see if they hold up, then we're gonna...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarius' voice fades out as you think on what he just said. Darius' militia group usually got old hand-me-downs from the military and apparently this was no exception. Looking at the suit Darius was holding up you can see a date from fifteen years ago stitched in tiny letters into a fabric area not covered by ceramic. Interesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear a crash from outside, and the lights to out. What the hell?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck it. Might as well see what's going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darius, hand me one of those bloody things. That didn't sound good, whatever it was. Lecia, put one of those things on and guard the apartment. You're with me, Darius. Bring your flashlight and put some rubber bullets into your pistol, we might have a burglar on our hands...\"</span></div></div>",

It wasn't what we built for war that brought about the end, it was what, and <i>who</i>, we created; for simple recreation. The worlds of fiction and reality collided, and both were changed forever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's truly a fucked-up world when the phrase \"Use your imagination\" is considered a curse. No, not \"curse\" as in profanity; \"Curse\" as in an invocation of misfortune, calling for fate to bring its wrath upon them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhem...I'll start at the beginning, as it were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur world was once a lot like yours, this \"Earth Prime\" I've heard about. Not an <i>exact</i> copy, of course--just look through a few books and you can pick out differences of all sizes. Where we break off the most, though? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll just come out and say it: <b>\"OUR reality wasn't that separate from OUR fiction.</b> Yeah, so the fourth wall broke, and its rubble buried us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started small--sightings of a <i>certain blue phone booth</i> in Egypt one day; rumors of \"strange animals\" in Japan the next. The usual \"man-bites-dog\" stories on the news, or conspiracy-theorist drivel; nothing to concern yourself with. God in Heaven, were we wrong....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it got bigger, stranger: \"Vigilantes with unknown weapons\" showing up and stopping a shooting or bank robbery; ships vanishing without a trace in perfectly safe waters...usually right after some sighting of a \"giant squid\" or some-such thing. And behind the scenes the \"Contacts\" started--artists, authors, fucking <i>cartoonists</i>--anyone who'd created, or helped create, a famous fictional character or world would start getting messages from their characters. A phone call, a letter slipped under the door...or a goddamn <i>green ring</i>, in one poor sap's case. I still don't know if it worked for him or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings kept building up--those weird stories and sightings kept happening more, and getting worse...until the Emergence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarch 18, 2025. That was the day 'imagination' became a curse. Every character, every hero and villain, ever single monster and madman we ever cooked up to entertain ourselves was let loose on the world. Marines fought Stormtroopers in Los Angeles. Sauron and his Uru'Kai overran Berlin and set up shop there, with the rest of Germany torn between the Enclave and HYDRA. I once saw two twentysomething punks with <i>R</i>'s on their shirts take down a whole mob with their pet snake and a rocket launcher back in Vegas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChina...is just <i>gone</i>. God, you can still hear the <i>\"Exterminate!\"</i> echoes in what's left of Bejing...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that's the long-and-short of it. Somehow, the barrier between reality and fiction crumbled, leaving both worlds wide open. We--the \"Reals\", as you'll hear some of us call ourselves--<i>weren't</i> wiped out when the \"Fictions\" poured in. Some of us fought, others hid,some even worked together with the Fictions to fight off their enemies. Strange bedfellows and whatnot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHardly anything left of the old, \"Real\" world now--cities that haven't been wiped off the map have been rebuilt, nothing like what they were before. Places that we called paradise are now warzones, or just to dead to even fight over. Hell, even some of our <i>old</i> wastelands are now packed to the gills! Just look at the Atacama--if you can get in, of course. I hear these \"Foundation\" guys will do ANYTHING to keep a secret. When they say \"Secure\" or \"Contain\", they mean it. I haven't seen them \"Protect\" anyone but themselves, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's hoping you can make some sense of this clusterfuck of a world. We sure couldn't, and still can't.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Message given to all who Slide into Meta-Earth's reality. Even Blind-Sliders will recieve it eventually in some form, though this is not immediate upon their arrival.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though you had to admit some of them could be a bit arseholeish at times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLondon as you knew it was pretty much gone. The simultaneous downside and upside to the Fictions' appearance was that they came from every piece of fiction, be it film, book, game, or fanfiction. This was a downside because The Party had attempted to exert their stranglehold on Britain in this reality, or Airstrip One as it had been called in <i>1984</i>. Thankfully, they were easily beaten back by a detachment of Imperial Guard. Christ, life was starting to sound like a particularly shit fanfiction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that pretty much all fictional characters had broken through the fourth wall, with more coming each passing day, meant that eventually duplicates of characters had started to arrive. Thanks to the nature of fanfiction, this resulted in several different versions of Artyom sitting down and talking together, before entering the London Underground for some unknown purpose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the OOC's, Christ they were weird. It was one thing to have, say, Adam Jensen existing. It was another thing to have him argue with a disturbingly OOC version of himself. And it was a completely different thing to witness a three-way argument between Canon!Jensen, OOC!Jensen, and a rule 63'd Jensen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least no Daleks had shown up yet. Well, they had, but only in China for some reason. China... China was lost. That was pretty much whatever anyone was willing to say about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLondon was being rebuilt, following the numerous skirmishes between different Fictions. It was advised for Reals to team up with as many Fictions as they could - you never know when the shit's about to hit the fan, after all. One advantage of being an amateur writer was that you had plenty of Fictions ready and willing to defend you. Chief among 'your' Fictions was Jessica, a seven foot tall anthropomorphic golden retriever with a surprising aptitude for combat whenever her creator was being threatened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't to say you were entirely helpless yourself, however. XCOM London had already been founded and was giving out supplies to those who needed them, and armour and weapons to those that would help them. There wasn't much in the world that was so satisfying as the <b>VOOSH</b> of an Alloy Cannon firing. Given how this particular XCOM's directive was to preserve all human life, they got along nicely with most people, be they Reals or Fictions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, everything was working out okay, although the situation everyone was in was still very, very strange. Not to mention the situations that arose whenever duplicates or Mary Sues were spotted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully everything would work out alright. </span></div></div>",

Helping new Fictions adapt to the 'Real' world was always hard, especially if the Fictions in question happened to be created by you. Take Azalvaunt, for instance - the man you were talking with right now. The Dragonborn Breton, while intelligent, was having trouble adapting to technologies and concepts so wildly different and more advanced than what he knew in Skyrim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not a mercenary. I just do odd jobs for XCOM. If those jobs involve, say, taking down a target, then that's what the Alloy Cannon and Titan armour are for. Especially if the target is a Fiction or a Sue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzalvaunt nods, going over your words in his head. \"I think I understand now. Sometimes, you are mercenary. Other times, you are simply a helper, yes?\" \"Essentially.\" Azalvaunt smiles, his rather wolffish grin and orange tinged eyes eternally reminding you that he was a werewolf. \"Thank you for explaining this to me. I will be off now, I have heard there are other Dragonborn here, and I wish to meet them. I will be back at your house in time to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the Breton strolls off, a small smile on his face. He was adapting to London, bit by bit. Watching a STAG Condor swoop overhead, you tick off Azalvaunt off on your mental checklist of Fictions to talk to. Last on the list were Modnight and Jessica. Midnight was an anthro raven, standing at a solid six foot six. She was the product of a short story you'd written a month or two before the Fictions had been summoned en masse to Earth, detailing her and a couple other anthros investigating what seemed to be a massive cave on the outside, only to discover it was a vast facility of human origin on the inside, having been abandoned and hidden millenia ago. Needless to say, she had been rather shocked to discover that humans still existed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica, on the other hand...<br>\r\nJessica was the result of what happens when a horny teenager finds the furry community and the tits contained within it, and writes a short story that was quarter shameless macrophillia, quarter master/pet fetish, and half forgotten until she had literally been teleported into your bedroom. Thankfully, the seven foot Labrador seemed to bear you no ill will over the circumstances of her creation, even being rather protective of you. You weren't sure if that was because you had written her that way or because of actual gratitude over you creating her in the first place. This was good, seeing as though if she wanted Jessica could easily rip you apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you have two options. You can either talk with the curious raven Midnight, or spend some time with the affectionate Jessica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, you decide to talk to...</span></div></div>",

Not the original, though; it'd been named that after a group of Templars had proposed the area be converted into a space that could be used for both Reals and Fictions to relax. More relaxed people meant less stressed people, and that was good for everyone, especially given how tempers could flare both suddenly and dramatically at a moment's notice if the circumstances were right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight was sitting on a bench to the side of a dirt path. Noticing you, she shifts to one side, inviting you to sit next to her with a gesture of her plumage covered arm. Taking a seat next to the raven, you take in a breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Midnight, got any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raven seems to be debating internally for a couple of seconds, most likely settling on the question she wanted to know the answer to the most. \"Yes,\" she begins, \"I want to know... I want to know what you think about all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise an eyebrow. \"All this? You mean the whole Fourth Wall breakage thing, right? Or are you talking about the park?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Fourth Wall breakage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning backwards, you sigh. \"I... To be perfectly honest with you, Midnight, I feel completely and utterly fucked. By a chainsaw, going at ten thousand revolutions per second. Wanna know why I feel everything's gonna go to shit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight nods, her expression showing a slight distaste for your rather vulgar way of communicating your feelings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, it's like this: sure, we're hanging on. We've got enough Fictions on our side, with enough abilities and powers, to let us stay in the game. But sooner or later, something is going to emerge that we have no way of dealing with. I don't know what literature you had back in your world, Misnight, but we've had some real grim shit here. Cthulhu being just one example. Seriously, you haven't been on the Internet for as log as I have. Just going on Furaffinity once or twice will probably make you shit yourself when you realise that sooner or later, all those characters are going to be coming over to our side, no matter what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour shoulders slump and you lean forwards, holding your head in your hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, how did everything get so fucked up? China's <i>gone</i>, Germany's getting torn apart, I haven't heard anything from the States since this began, and on a more personal level, I probably have a couple dozen more Fictions left for me alone. I wonder how the rest of Europe is doing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel midnight place a hand on your shoulder, trying her best to support you but knowing that you'd probably be stuck in this mood for a few hours to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christ. You know what's especially wierd? All religions are now technically both true and false simultaneously. I can't wait for the debates to start once people realise that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting uncomfortably, Midnight tries to think of a way to get your mood back to normal. Or, rather, as normal as it could be with the amount of stress wearing at your mind over the past few weeks alone. You'd probably get stomach ulcers at this rate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... It'll be okay?\" Midnight offers weakly, not sure what else she can do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it might be. I can certainly hope everything'll be-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause, an idea suddenly popping into your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't I think of that before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight cocks her head to the side, indicating to you to go on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm an amateur writer. I can write anything, or rather, anyone, into reality. I could make an entire fucking legion to help out those poor bastards in Berlin; I can help fix all of this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in almost a week, you find yourself smiling an actual smile. Perhaps things really weren't as bad as they looked?</span></div></div>",

After unintentionally managing to refresh your mood somewhat, you had started to tell Midnight about the various characters that you had once considered fiction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, this one's a bit complicated, you won't really understand it unless you listen to the music. I think I still have a couple of their albums lying around somewhere. Th music itself isn't all that original, but what it does, it does well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I really need to show you some of the books I have lying around. And the movies, as well. And maybe the fanfiction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight shuffles slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think for now I'd be content to simply learn about your society. In my own world, the humans had vanished so long ago that the star maps we found in the ruins were outdated. And despite that, the technology still worked...\" Midnight clears her throat, before continuing. \"I know that you technically caused both of those things, but it doesn't lessen the feeling of awe I get from remembering those ruins... Even as advanced as your kind are now, I doubt you'd be able to produce something so long-lasting within the next hundred years...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. \"I always did like precursor stories. Remind me to show you Mass Effect sometime, I think you might enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight nods, obviously having no clue what you were talking about but making a mental note of the name regardless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Oh man, I just thought of that. Midnight, did you get a chance to go through that history book I gave you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight nods silently, shivering despite her warm plumage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling with a sense of grim satisfaction, you continue. \"I just realised! I finally get to punch Hitler in the face!\" Midnight seems to think the idea over in her head before nodding once more, finding it satisfactory. \"If you do, would you mind... Would you mind if I join in?\" Midnight wasn't a violent... Furry... By any stretch of the imagination, but you expected her reaction to be along those lines, given her earlier reaction to the history book you had given her: poorly concealed horror. It had taken almost a minute of reassurance and comforting from both you and Jessica to get her to peel her eyes away from that book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft beeping from your wristwatch alerts you to the time, and you check it just to be sure. 16:45. In other words, most of the Fictions you had inadvertently created would be arriving back at your house in about fifteen minutes. Standing up from the bench, you crack the vertebrae in your back, Midnight following suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we should be heading back, then. Don't want to keep the others waiting.\"</span></div></div>",

All the workers freighting up the cars ignore you as you stand before the open door of the train, scrutinizing every face staring at you for any hint of emotion at the step you were about to make past the threshold of our small, ever dwindling sense of reality. They're all invested, sure, but you can't weed out a soul who remotely veers towards any extreme of the empathic line, whether it be supportive or fearful of your dilemma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the roofs of the empty box cars, all of the town's top muscle'd been scrounged up to sit around and keep watch, ready with everything; guns, knives, molotov cocktails, hairspray cans and lighters, rocks, bricks, and even pressurized hoses and toy squirt guns, their tanks filled with horrific-smelling mixtures of turpentine, acetone, and benzine. Anything that, as far as during the good old days before the great merge'd split the world of sanity in half, had a knack for hurting any kind of species that you'd throw it at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose days were long gone, however, a thought that makes you let loose a long, unstable sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to gaze down the train's nose, observing the curves in the track ahead. The boundary to toon territory lay just a few hundred feet away, only obscured by the fall-stripped forest, but unlike some bouncy neighborhood filled with sapient buildings, trees, and woodland creatures all singing some jaunty musical number about how wonderful life was, the cartoon realm just looked...dead. <i>Felt</i> dead, too, somehow even more dead than the rules and cynicism of reality, with all the foliage clearly stripped of its life and color as the dawn of winter started rearing its head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere a few tanks of gas really <i>that</i> worth it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hank?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap back to Jim, who's seated in his spot at the engine's cab, his hand already on the throttle. \"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S'time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was ever any sound from the crowd observing the train's assembly, it was all gone, now. Everybody, Hank, the train's gunmen, and all the villagers are dead quiet as they all turn their head at you, the last obstacle keeping the train from leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the rail along the door's opening, but only to keep yourself upright as you raise a foot, staring intently down at the very first step into the train's cab. Your legs' muscles grow tired from the motionless workout, jittering around in the air, but you don't give it relief. You just stand still, cherishing the absolute last seconds of reality you have left before the moment the lottery, all the briefings, and all the assemblies'd been amounting too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the weight of your leg is too much to bear, just as Jim's mouth opens to say something, you step onto the train's floor. You take the next step. And the next. And the next, increasingly filled with regret by each you pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, without even remembering sitting down, you're in the seat next to Jim's, and the door's been slid shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't answer. Even if his hand's already on the lever, you grab the throttle, gently easing it forward. Beneath the floors, the engine's wheels grind forward, and slowly, but with a very subtle increase in speed, the train and its cars lurch away from the end of the station, submerging itself into the leaf-covered hills of the forest...</span></div></div>",

Would that mean they're running around somewhere out there, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if he's trying to speak in a light tone, you're not listening. The entire trip, for all of eight hours and into the full birth of nighttime, you'd kept your eyes set on the track, steeling yourself to call the cannons on any blip of a bright color that'd dart in your way, and all of Jim's attempts to muster up a conversation fall on deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only part of you that isn't ready to pull a trigger is <i>very</i> <i><b>thinly</b></i> curious at the scenery that lay beyond the town's circle, which was all left to grow for many decades without being grazed by man. The train passes by many empty canyons, rivers and mountains, all of them too far away to be seen by anything but a telescope from where you'd lived, and it's a miracle the track still even exists enough to allow such a smooth journey after all the years of rain and sleet it must've lived through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's rather unnerving, really, but nowhere near as unnerving as the utter lack of animation to be seen whisking around through the trees. Worst of all was when the sun began setting, and all the shadows, branches, and other little details of the world were slowly melded into silhouettes. Jim's tone became a little more jittered as the light of day was noticeably leaving the sky, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the sun was gone, all the world was black, save for two stripes of rail ahead that were reflected by the headlights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, I proved I wasn't catatonic and cricked my head an inch to the left, looking Jim's way. He looked down at the readout of the train's tanks with a look of rapidly waning hope, particularly at a dial that was quickly decreasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>asked </i>them!\" He growled, punching the dashboard. \"I <i>fucking</i> asked them if they said the fuel hoses were all hooked on properly! <i>They said yes!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what're we supposed to do?\" I replied, whatever resolve I had left fading away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've gotta stop, is what we've got to do!\" He answered, his hand going for the brake, but I grabbed his wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You expect us to go outside? At...\" I pointed at the blackout beyond the window. \"Into <i>that?!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked like he was taking my question into heart, truly asking it to himself, over and over, but he still pulled the brake down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he let the whir of the engine die out, I turned back ahead, hitting a button on the intercom. \"Engine to freight line, we're making a stop. I repeat, we're making a stop due to fuel maintenance. Stay on guard as we exit the train.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the, for the most tortuous five minutes I'd ever felt pass by, we sat and waited, unable to do anything as we were forced to watch the train let itself stop, the cars' momentum keeping us in motion. Out the windows, I could see a glimmer of light from the mirrors as some of the gunmen manned their posts, but I could feel a twinge of terror in the pit of my heart tell me that anything they could've done would just be one big reassurance. Even worse was when the train, with the last errant of speed from its trip, still hung around at a person's walking pace for the damnedest length of time I would've thought possible. Jim had his eyes on the fuel tank the whole time, silently begging for there to be a half of our tank left when we'd stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd lost all interest in the readout, though, when his head snapped up to the window. \"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head darted another way. This time, I saw it. A little murmur of movement somewhere in all the darkness, even if it was all in pitch black. We kept our heads up as our hands went to the glove compartments of our seats, the both of us in perfect harmony as we pull ourselves each a gun, pulling back the hammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPointing the barrels at the bulletproof windshield, we tried to weed out as much of the forest as there was to be seen, ignoring the sweat dripping along our heads as we saw the shape of the movement become more pronounced under the headlights' glare...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As it stands most life on Rogue Earth resembles hadopelagic life, with the few surviving plant species not requiring light or being bioluminescent. Your species having evolved in total darkness, your eyes are so finely attuned to the inky blackness that any light levels above what bioluminescence can produce are extremely painful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour species' society is in the tribal stages, things such as wood being exceptionally rare, and unrecognisable compared to how we would know it. This lack of resources means that your species will remain tribal for a very log time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, one day, strange beings comes through a portal of pure light that almost blinds you to look at it, and they carry sticks that illuminate huge areas. These things, these demons, soon switch to using bizarre apparatuses and lenses that fit over their eyes, allowing them to see as you do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll they have to do if attacked is take out a small cylinder, press a button, and direct the torrent of bright, disgustingly painful light at the aggressor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, for some reason, they want to speak with your race...</span></div></div>",

You got a name? Or shall I just call you your ID number?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, if you prefer that name I'll call you that. I'm a Hades Line myself. Made for assassination and stealth, that sort of stuff. But you? You're made to take on entire squads, entire platoons. And win. On your own. There's a reason you're called an Apex, you know. With those telekinetic abilities they somehow managed to program into you, you could probably just destroy a squad's weapons then just walk away. Of course, given how all Lines are meant to be able to shrug off bullets, it's not like being hit by those weapons will do much to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey're gonna be mad that you've escaped. Real mad. They're gonna start producing the bio-mechs again. They're gonna start sweeping the countryside. They're gonna start torturing anyone you've come in contact with to get to you. That last reason is why, in a few minutes from now, we will never have had this meeting. Get me?  Good. Now, you're gonna need to run. Keep out of sight, try and stow away on a ship or something, you need to get away from these Corporation assholes. If you don't they're gonna melt you down into your raw materials, process you, and make a new you out of your genes. Just, try and get somewhere remote. Those mountains may be a good place, considering how little us Lines need to eat and drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, I know you've got telepathy - and I'm not quite sure i want to know how the Corporation managed that and the telekinesis - but if you see someone working for the Corp, get inside their head. Manipulate them. Do whatever it takes to get them on your side without them even realising it. You can mess with minds, right? Not just talk to people through their heads? Good. Maybe you should see if you can talk to animals with that skill of yours. If you can, it'd probably come in handy. Nothing like seeing an APC have to park for half an hour because of a particularly stubborn group of cows, am I right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay. Guess I'll be off then. Good luck, Apex. We probably won't see each other again, but if I hear you've been wasted then I'm gonna murder one of their CEO's as revenge. I think you'd like that. Heh, I knew you would.

He checks his syringes and his machines, tryig not to look nervous. \"Now, T-Two-Six-Nine, if you could place the blood pressure cuff on your arm...\" You do so, and he starts the test, repeating it to form a baseline for your blood pressure. \"Just m-making s-sure that everything's working p-properly...\" God, this one was annoying. All the scientists were insufferable in their own ways, but this nervous wreck was beginning to seriously get on your nerves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist holds a syringe between his trembling fingers, which slips from his grasp and shatters on the floor. Laughing nervously, the scientists mops the sweat at his brow away with a hand. \"Heh, I guess I'd better get another one of those...\" And with that, the man all but runs to the door of your cell, stumbling on the way there. Slamming his ID card down on the panel needed to open the door, he sprints through the heavy metal door as the thick metal slab retracts into the wall, slamming shut behind him. Several more layers of metal come down after it, filling the deep doorframe with various sheets of metal and preventing escape. A growling sigh escapes your throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis... Corporation... was utterly disgusting. They created humans, bred and raised them for combat, and then sold them to different militarise around the world. Hades, Mars, Sol, Falcon. These names had been stolen, and given to different Lines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What is a Line?</i> you think to yourself, remembering the day when you asked the question. <i>A product line.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHades; the assassination and stealth Line. Made to sneak into areas and past fortifications, silently killing key person el as they went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMars; the demolition Line. Armed with RPGs and grenade launchers, they could bust any bunker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSol; the infantry killing Line. Armed with white hot flamethrowers and napalm grenades, any biological matter near a Sol would be scorched and burnt to ashes by the time she was done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalcon; the pilot and reconnaissance Line. Either flying a plane or scouting enemy territory, Falcons seemingly never stopped moving for more than a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of these Lines and more; little more than fleshy puppets, mindless drones to be controlled by rich officers and generals who did not care for the lives of their men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, there was the odd sapient Line. They were bent and broken, indoctrinated into serving the Corporation, serving as sergeants and leaders for their entire lives. Issuing orders to unthinking killing machines for their entire lives, and loving every second of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApex. The Ultimate Line. The Zenith. The true meaning of the word killing machine. The product of decades of genetic experimentation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Subject Two-Six-Nine; Property of The Corporation; Apex Line Prototype Alpha; Approximate Value: Incalculable.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, that was what the ID tattoo on your back said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLines weren't just for combat, though. There were servant Lines, surgeon Lines, accountant Lines... And they all had that same blank stare, as if their brains were trying to grant them the tiniest fragment of free will, but utterly failing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, the combat Lines were definitely the moneymakers. You could extrapolate that from the list of combat Lines alone. Each combat Line had a specific role on the battlefield, from taking out enemy infantry to scouting - those roles belonging to Sol and Falcon, although there were other, less popular Lines that fulfilled these roles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour role was to destroy everything in sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore or less. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain tolerance that would shame even a bio-mech? Check. <br>\r\nExtreme muscle mass in certain areas, such as the legs and arms, allowing you to jump several times your own height and shatter bones with a single punch? Check. <br>\r\nBones dense enough to serve as armour underneath your skin, such as your nigh-impenetrable ribs, which had been fused together into a single, sternum-like mass? Check. <br>\r\nMuscles strong enough to offset the extreme weight all of this caused? Check. <br>\r\nAn almost in red familiarity and expertise with all standard issue Corporation weapons and weapons systems? Check. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to top it off, fucking psychic powers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were made to take down entire squads. Entire platoons. By yourself. Entire armies, with other Lines in support and protecting you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were literally made for war. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut war was not something you desired, despite the hyper aggressive urges your over reactive adrenal system sent you. An eternity of war, with no end until you were killed by something, most likely a nuke? No. Please, no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you could, you'd hide away someplace remote. Normal people wouldn't want to know the limits that their genome could be twisted to; they'd call you an abomination. Living on your own with nothing to disturb you would be... Ideal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, here you were, trapped in a tiny cell with a seven inch thick metal door, your patience being tested a little more with each passing day. You had to get out, somehow. Even if you had to kill to accomplish it, you had to get out. You weren't gonna be a slave. You weren't gonna be a little toy, paraded about and tossed around along with your unthinking brothers and sisters into different battles until you finally expired and your genetic material was used to remake you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't gonna be some military's trump card unless you wanted to be. Not unless inaction would be worse than action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as the Corporation was concerned, you weren't a person. You never would be. You were a weapon; a Weapon of Mass Destruction on par with an atomic bomb, and infinitely more expensive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't going to be that. Kill a few hundred to escape and live in solitude for as long as possible, or stay and kill thousands upon thousands as you were forced into different war zones by your neglectful and abusive creators?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how would you escape?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps, you could <b>kill that scientist. Rip his ID card from his fingers. Tear through your birthplace, destroying it from within. Escape into the world. Feel the Sun on your skin. The grass under your feet. The calm peace of solitude as you live your life. Away. From the Corporation. Kill any of them that come close. Rip their arms out. Tear them in two. GRAB THEIR SPINE AND RIP THEIR SKULL OUT THROUGH THEIR CHEST! BREAK EVERY BONE IN THEIR FUCKING BODIES! STOMP THEM INTO DUST! REND THEM APART AND SMASH THEM INTO PIECES!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely register the clamps holding you in place, the voice saying \"The new synthetic adrenaline was more effective than we could have imagined. How did he not notice the doctor returning to his room, though?\", the cocktail of general anaesthetic drugs pulling you into peaceful sleep, and you barely even register the human shaped portal appearing out of nowhere, a small squad of heavily armed soldiers securing the room, lining the Corporation scum up against the wall as they eye your raging form, demanding an answer that the cowardly doctors cannot bring themselves to give, vanishing back through the portal, which closes just before you finally drop off into peaceful, drug-fuelled sleep. </span></div></div>",

Leaning it to the sides gives the same results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been placed in a small holding cell, from the way things seemed. You had been held in these cells many times before, often in an attempt to get you to stop asking questions. While you had physically aged quite quickly, your mind had taken time to catch up, and the Corporation tried to capitalise on that fact by attempting to indoctrinate you to their whims. One memory from your childhood - if it could be called that - was having the book <i>1984</i> read to you by one of the researchers. Of course, it was heavily edited, and the morality flipped; total obedience, privacy destroying surveillance, and unending conflict had been portrayed as good things in the bastardised version some Corporation monkey had shat out of a typewriter that would have had Orwell simultaneously rolling and spontaneously combusting in his grave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't exactly sure how old you were - never leaving the same set of rooms for your entire existence, coupled with having to manually count sleep cycles tended to destroy one's sense of time - but if you had to hazard a guess, you'd say you were about nine or ten years old. The Corporation wanted a super-soldier, and they wanted one ASAP. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It appears that some of our... rivals, have developed a teleportation system...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraining your hearing, you manage to eavesdrop on the conversation being held outside your tiny cell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do?

The board of directors has already authorised Two-Six-Nine's usage.\"<br>\r\n\"YOU WANT TO USE A WMD!\"<br>\r\n\"Be that as it may, he can destroy the competition and then return. I think it'll be a good test of his combat capabilities in the field; as I have already said, the board agrees with me.\"<br>\r\n\"... Fine. You talk with the brute, I'm leaving. If you need me, I'll be drinking something strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door in front of you quickly slides into the wall and your clamps release your arms and legs. Falling to your hand and knees, you then stand and roll your shoulders. \"So you need me for something, boss?\" you say, putting on a fake smile. \"Yes, Two-Six-Nine.\" We need you to be ready in case of another incursion into this Corporation facility. If there is, enter the portal, gauge enemy strength, and eliminate if possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis could be your way out. You could play these scientists, letting them think they had you under their control until you entered the portal and destroyed your communications equipment, never returning.

Gimme a shout if you need me.\"<br>\r\nPassing the two scientists, you leave the room through the metal bulkhead, a pair of guard tailing you until you arrive back in your room. A simple bed lay in one corner of the bland room, a small table of faux-wood beside it. A miniature computer/tablet device lay on the table, allowing you access to the Internet. The Corporation had tried to limit what you saw on it, but you had hacked your way past the filters long ago, and the Corporation, in their arrogance, had never bothered to see if their filters had actually worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, the Corporation had done a pretty pisspoor job at indoctrinating you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying on your bed, you stare up at the blank, sterile, white ceiling. Snorting, you find yourself bored, and with a lack of things to do, you close your eyes and allow yourself to fall asleep until your body decides that it is time to wake up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps something interesting would happen when you awoke. </span></div></div>",

Eyeing a small clock mounted on the wall opposite where your bed lay, you noted the time: 00:23. Good, pretty much all personnel would be asleep andrying on automated security, with the exception of a few guards at important checkpoints. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInhaling, then exhaling, you look down at your body. Your skin was extremely pale, on account of never having been outside before. Feeling your sides, instead of being able to feel individual ribs and the slight gaps between them like a normal prrson would, you feel one thick mass of bone protecting your vital organs, dense enough to serve as subdermal armour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCracking your neck, you stand up and walk over to the other side of your rather spartan room. Touching a small panel on the wall results in a small section seperating to allow you access to a wardrobe behind it. You exchange your clothes for fresh ones, pulling on a vest, pants and trousers. Touching the panel to conceal the wardrobe again, you open a different section of the wall to reveal a smaller wardrobe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Corporation could be truly idiotic at times, in addition to the usual arrogance. One example of this idiocy was leaving your armour in your bedroom. It takes nearly ten minutes to put all of your armour on, minus your helmet. Eyeing the CCTV camera mounted directly above your bed, you begin to stretch your leg muscles, Moving on to your arms before doing several sets of jumping jacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been planning this for a long time. One thing you had thought up was to irregularly wake up at extremely late/early times, put on new sets of clothes and your armour, and then do several sets of stretches. This way, anyone viewing you through the security camera would not immediately go into panic mode upon seeing you pull on your armour, which would have resulted in a facility-wide lockdown. Granted, you'd still be able to bust your way out, but it would be much more inconvenient. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing your telekinetic powers to force the security camera to sweep left and right, back and forth - mimicking a security camera glitch that forces it to adhere to a basic area scanning protocol, often causing the person manning the camera to briefly leave the monitoring station to find a troubleshooting guide - you stare at the control panel mounted on the wall next to the seven inch thick series of metal slabs that served as the door to your room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were under curfew, as always. No leaving your room from 22:45 to 08:00. You weren't going to let that stop you though. And since hacking was out of the question, because the panel had been locked down as part of the curfew...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Well, subtlety was boring anyway!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamming the security camera in place while it looks away from you, you gather your powers. Seven inches would be an inconvenience, but not enough to stop you. Clenching your fist, you drag it towards you, slowly ripping the series of metal slabs out of the doorframe. Jerking it towards you violently, you smirk as an automated alarm sounds and the slabs loudly crash onto the floor, most warped heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping through the doorframe and pulling your helmet on, you enter the corridor connecting your room to the rest of the facility, walking at a brisk pace. Thankfully, only your door was locked. While it would have been fun to rip every bulkhead and door out of their frames, it would have allowed the Corporation to assemble their squads of Lines, which would have been inconvenient. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a left, then a right, and another right, you quickly make your way through the facility, ripping through any locked doors you encounter. Coming to an atrium, you see a small line of Corporation guards shifting nervously and aiming their weapons at you, eight or so in total. At some order over their radios, they open fire, most bullets missing you as you close in towards them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping two in your telekinesis, you smash them into the walls, denting the surfaces slightly and leaving a crimson smear across the steel surface. Using your telekinesis to grab one by the head, you lift him into the air slightly before slamming him face first into the floor, breaking his skull. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree down, five to go. Yanking one guard's rifle out of his grasps even as the other fire again, you manipulate it in midair, ramming the butt of the weapon into his chin. Four more to go. Crushing their weapons into small balls of metal as you run, mere metres away, you can't help but sneer under your helmet as they panic, yelling obscenities. Seeing that one has a combat knife tucked into digging around his hips, you lift it into midair as you halt, then send it right at his throat. Three more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them charges at you, flailing with his fists in a case of suicidal overconfidence. Thrusting your open palm forward, the guard is propelled into a wall, his back snapped and cracked in several places. The two remaining are trying to run but have seized up, so you simply elect to manipulate their forms, holding them in midair and ramming their helmets together, knocking them both out cold with possible concussions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking into a sprint, you run past the gory display and into another network of corridors. You move on instinct, turning his way and that, ripping bulkheads apart with ease. Nothing will stop you. Nothing <i>can</i> stop you. <i>Nothing can stop you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou come to another atrium, this one much, much larger than the last. A huge set of blast doors are opposite you, as well as a veritable wall of guards with a variety of weapons. There must be at least thirty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are standing between you and those doors. Between you and your freedom. These Corporation whores will either step aside or be thrown aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA roar escaping from your throat, you charge again, closing the gap as the guards open fire. This time, they manage to hit you, bullets bouncing off your armour as you sprint across the almost entirely nondescript room. Corporate didn't care about aesthetics, after all. Exit here, space here, corridor there; no need to spend money making it look nice and pretty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClenching your left fist and sweeping. It to the side, ten of the guards and tossed like rag dolls through the air, many impacting the steel walls; others are simply flung through the air, painfully meetin the ground seconds later. You can't be more than thirty feet from the great blast doors, now. You know what to do, somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuelled by your rage, a telekinetic blast sweeps out in front of you, floor panels being ripped and flung into the air as it goes. It meets the blast doors, metal squealing as it gives way, shuddering and rending into a you-sized hole. You widen it as you run, sparing a glimpse at the remaining guards to you right; there were twenty or so remaining. A sweeping gesture is all it takes to send them all up to the ceiling, most dying instantly as their skulls are crushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, you run through the tear in the blast doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see light. Actual light. Natural light. For the first time. Resealing the gap you had ripped in the blast door, you allow yourself a few second to gaze up at the moon. Gods, god, whatever, it was beautiful. Turning your attention to your surroundings, you look around. A large Tarmac road cut through what seemed to be a small jungle or forest of sorts. You can almost smell the freedom. It was a good thing that Lines barely have to eat or drink, and can eat or drink almost anything, because you didn't bring any supplies with you. Taking in one of your first breaths of natural air, savouring the warmth and humidity, you prepare to run, and never look back...</span></div></div>",

Damnit, that'd take ages to get out! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing a soft snort from behind you, you turn around to see your pet horse, Blaze, giving you a deadpan stare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shuddup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black mare smiles slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I never said anything.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze's voice was odd, like someone had taken the snorts, whinnies, and neighs she used to converse with other horses, and them warped that into a voice. Due to the strange link that humanity shared with a wide range of animals, however, you could understand her instinctively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were giving me that look again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze flicks her ears, giggling softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Was not.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze's smile widens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Was not.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, you poke your tongue out at Blaze, before looking back down at your clothes. Yep, those would take a while to clean. Falling off of Blaze was never a good thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze allows you to re-mount her back, settling into a slow trot. \"<i>Are you okay? Besides the muddy clothes and everything? I don't think you've fallen like that in quite a while.</i>\" Leaning forward slightly, you gently scratch the top of the black mare's head. \"I'll be fine, I've probably only got a bruise from it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze continues to slowly trot back towards the farmhouse, hooves smothering grass underfoot. Suddenly, something in the corner of your eye catches your attention. Telling Blaze to stop, you dismount and turn to get a better look at whatever it was that you had seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat seemed to be a silhouette of a person hung in midair, an actual person standing a few feet away. Before you can process this bizarre scene, several more people emerge from the silhouette, most of them carrying guns. They are close enough to you that you can see that their attention is on you, and they begin to walk towards you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, you turn to Blaze. Just what the hell was going on? Was it a top-secret military project? And invasion? Something else entirely?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blaze?\"<br>\r\n\"<i>Y-yes?</i>\"<br>\r\n\"Run. I'm... I'm going to see what they want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze swallows a lump in her throat and nods, nuzzling you before turning and galloping back to the farmhouse and stables. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at the mysterious figures, you can see that they are no more than thirty feet from you now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking in a deep breath, you begin to walk towards them. </span></div></div>",

The six figures continue their slow, cautious advance, two of them sweeping their rifles this way and that, looking for possible threats. Swallowing, you begin to walk towards them as the thundering of Blaze's hooves fades in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you and the group converge, the one who you assume to be a leader lowers his rifle, pointing it at the ground. The armour they were wearing was like nothing you'd ever seen before; what seemed to be a Kevlar jacket of some sorts was overlaid with interlocking plates of some kind that covered the chest, groin, elbows, and knees. The helmet the leader wore seemed to have a respirator of some kind built in, judging by the noise of the person's breathing. The glass-like faceplate of the grey helmet was too dark to allow you to see through, however, sort of like a motorbiker's helmet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other five members of the group come to a halt, lowering their weapons but staying alert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Civilian, can you tell us where we are?</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou visibly wince as the leader's distorted, tinny voice booms out of his helmet. Evidently, they were using some kind of vocoder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, England... If you need specifics then I guess I can j-just get you my m-map...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow again, barely managing to keep ahold of yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, could I enquire as to why you are here? Uh, I'll understand if it's classified, b-but I'd appreciate it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>We can tell you, but I think we'd prefer to go inside first. That way, we can have some privacy. Also, you will probably want to contact some level of government.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay, then. If you'd f-f-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scowl in frustration, your nerves momentarily getting the better of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem; if you'd follow me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you begin to walk back to your house, the group of soldiers in tow. They seemed to be rather paranoid, constantly scanning their surroundings for any hostiles. Frankly, you couldn't really think of any potential hostiles on a small farm besides pests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take long for the farmhouse to come into view again. A semi-awkward silence had settled over the group the moment you had begun to escort the group to your house, allowing you to do some thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe portal was an absolute mystery, but what with science today being what it was, who knew what was possible? The group didn't seem to have any insignia on their armour, and the fact that the leader requested that you attempt to inform someone in some level of government suggested something rather hush-hush goin on. Perhaps a trial of some new teleportation technology had thrown them off mark somewhat? Perhaps it had worked, but they did not have the means to communicate with the army themselves?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears pick up a rapid, muted thumping off in the distance, the sound rapidly growing louder. Smiling, you see Blaze galloping towards you at full pelt, two other horses following her; you couldn't tell who they were from such a distance, but you could see that they were a deep brown and a bright white, at least. You'd have to identify them when they got close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio of horses slow into a trot as they draw closer, the tensing of their muscles showing their desire to ensure your well being being overridden somewhat by their apprehension at the imposing figures behind you, most of whom were a good few inches taller than your height of five foot ten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blaze and the other equines close the gap between you and them, you are able to identify the two other horses. The white one was a mare named Breeze; she was rather gentle, and usually very kind to the other animals. However, if she knew someone was in danger, wouldn't hesitate to take action. The brown horse was a stallion named Jack; he was usually rather laid back, although that didn't stop him from working hard. Unease was evident in both the eyes and body language of the trio. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze's trio reaches you, the black mare sighing gratefully as she sees you are not harmed in any way. You can hear the soldiers muttering to each other, most likely sizing the three up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you three, I'm alright. These guys don't mean any harm, as far as I can tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can just about hear two of the soldiers whisper to each other - suggesting the vocoder a could be turned on and off - \"<sub>Is he trying to talk to those horses? Maybe in this reality they can-</sub>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were so worried about you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can respond, you're almost bowled over by the combined nuzzles of the three horses, having to steady yourself as Blaze practically launches herself at you. Hugging the tall black mare around her thick neck, you stifle a giggle as her neck and head droop over your shoulder, the adrenaline working its way out of her system. Almost instantly, the other two are adding their own nuzzles to the hug-of-sorts, relieved beyond measure that you're safe. \"Like I said, I'm safe. I - I appreciate the concern, mares - and stallion - I really do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA scant few metres away, as the soldiers watch the scene before them unfold, two specific ones are quietly whispering to each other, their vocoders off. \"<sub>Looks like we found the reality with the talking animals. About time, too. Now, how much do you owe me, again?</sub>\"</span></div></div>",

No, this isn't about what you think it's going to be about; just let me explain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this scenario, humanity has expanded far beyond the Sol system, slowly extending its reach across the galaxy, planet by planet. The only problem is that when you have several dozen solar systems worth of citizens, your colonies probably aren't going to be able to supply all the raw materials needed for manufacturing goods. This is where the unfortunately named Crackers and Strippers come in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, why spend time and effort establishing mines when you can just use a swarm of robots to strip mine the planet almost down to the core? Or, if you're in a hurry, simply crack it apart and take whatever can fit in your cargo hold?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlanet strippers and crackers are built so as to be almost entirely self sustaining, and are typically operated on a crew of five or less personnel - robots do pretty much everything, the humans are there to drive the ship and to start the mining operations. Unfortunately, since hyper-FTL technology is only just being realised, it can still takes a few weeks or months to get to your destination, rather than seconds like so many people desire. Thus, the cabin of each mining ship is designed with maximum comfort in mind, and is essentially an apartment, which contains pretty much anything you could think of to pass the time. Multi petabye hard drives on the computers on these ships is standard - gotta keep the crewmen relaxed and occupied, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, do you want to be an extrasolar miner, or do you want a different reality?</span></div></div>",

Your target was a rich, middle aged man, currently in his office, which was located in a skyscraper, and was one of those particular rooms where the entire wall is just one massive, nigh-indestructible pane of glass, allowing you a pants-shittingly-terrifying view of the street far, far below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a good distance away, on a completely different skyscraper. Well, a skyscraper in construction, located on the opposite side of the river that flowed through the city you were in. Fooling and bribing different guards as you went, you had easily made it to the floor you were currently at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man you were viewing through the scope of your rifle was one Robert Birching; an entreupaneur who invested heavily in the auto industry in public, and had an unhealthy obsession with dangerous artifacts in private. And, as it turned out, the fat git had come to be in possession of an artifacts that should rightfully belong to your Society. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Society was primarily known as the Order of the Serpent, although it had also been referred to as the Serpent's Lodge on occasion. You were a field agent for the Order, identified by the snake eye tattoo on your left palm. It would mean nothing to anyone outside of the Order, but to those inside, it indicated your membership and rank. Upon being promoted to a higher station, the tattoo would be added to, signifying your new rank. The Grandmasters of the order had tattoos that covered their entire hand, allowing their status to be easily seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe artifact in question that had somehow fallen into Birching's greasy grasp was the Liber Serpentium; a powerful artifact that allowed those familiar with magic to summon a massive variety of slithering, scaled, reptiles. You yourself were familiar with magic, all field agents had to be. Birching, however, was not. This was why the Liber Serpentium was resting on a glass table like some kind of ordinary book, a steaming mug of seething or other resting nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that disrespectful twat so much as spills a drop on the bloody thing I'm going to shoot him in the bollocks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBirching moves away from the Liber, thankfully, and moves to the glass window that stood as a wall, gazing out over the cityscape. Good, you had a clear shot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding your breath, you aim at Birching's head, slowly squeezing the trigger of your sniper rifle. The particular model you used was used exclusively by a well-known terrorist group - themselves most likely a front for some other Society - ensuring that they would get the blame once the shot was taken and the rifle abandoned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Pew!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert Birching lies dead, his life ended instantly by a headshot. Picking up your radio, you send a short burst over a specific frequency, letting a team know that Birching was dead. Posing as cleaners, they move into the room, grabbing anything that looked valuable or may have been an artifact of some kind, paying special attention to the Liber Serpentium. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the rifle on the concrete floor, you allow yourself to take in a deep breath. Working your way down some thirty odd storeys would be extremely tiring, to say the least. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I've been playing a hell of a lot of XCOM lately, and once I plaed through the Temple Ship mission a few times, I started to think about what would happen to humanity if XCOM hadn't beaten the Ethereals. It looked like humanity would most likely become another race of clones used by the Ethereals, but for what purpose? Many fanfictions posit the idea that the aliens attacking Earth are fleeing from a much darker and greater threat, one that the Ethereals could not beat on their own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, since humanity was supposedly the perfect balance of physical strength and psychic power, this would mean that humanity would be used in an attempt to thwart this threat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this scenario is the basis of this new storyline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is it. The end of mankind. These aliens have beaten us, crushed us. Subjugated us. It all started with an increase of supposed UFO sightings. As usual, it was disregarded by most people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the disappearances started happening. People started vanishing, seemingly at random, at the dead of night, without a trace. The media went nuts over that, reckoned it was some kind of super criminal organisation doing it. Course, nobody found anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then came the day a UFO went down. Nobody's really sure why it went down. Knowing what we know now, perhaps the invaders wanted to create a conflict in order to test our abilities? Anyway, a UFO went down somewhere in Europe. Can't remember where, but I think it was France. There was the usual disbelief until the scientists started analysing the wreckage, finding materials that weren't native to Earth and technology that far outstripped our own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost nations formed covert organisations to combat these alien invaders. They stockpiled weapons and ammo, collaborated with other countries and shared information and possible tactics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the Harvest started, and we realised just how fucked we were. UFOs descended on major cities, and they started launching these things into them. They were these pod things, kind of like a cube with small spikes on each vertical edge, about a meter high, wide, and long. These pods, they started to release this gas that rendered you catatonic, allowing you to be easily collected by the aliens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose covert organisations I noticed? Most of them got slaughtered while attempting to save civilians. The regular armies disn't do much either. Tanks were useless, guns were useless, planes were useless. You get the picture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a couple of months for humanity to be completely harvested. Well, not completely. I'm still here, safe underground where they won't bother to look for me. Turns out that the aliens usually just snatches whoever was in plain sight and ignored most buildings unless they were particularly large. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, yeah. I'm still here. Haven't spoken to anyone in a few weeks. There's no one left to talk to, after all. I've got about a month's worth of supplies left, but after that... Well, I'm going to have to scavenge, and I think that's what the invaders are waiting for. For people like me, the people who his, to come looking for supplies, so they can get us nice and easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know what they're doing with us, and I'm not sure I want to know. Food? Our bodies? Our very genes? Or perhaps something even more sinister? I'm not sure I want to know. And I'm running low on batteries. Pretty soon I won't be able to record any more audio diaries like this one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wonder if, some day, some animal will evolve to the point where they have their own civilisation. Any trace of us will probably be long gone by then. Depressing, isn't it? No matter what happens, we're gonna be forgotten by anyone who isn't one of these invaders. And I wouldn't count on them feeling some obligation to remember us. </i></span></div></div>",

You're not quite sure <i>what</i> you can remember, and you can only <i>almost</i> remember it, as if something is stopping you from recalling the events. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are those events? You can only glimpse quick flashes; a moment of terror spent hiding behind something; some huge shape in a sky you can't quite recall; being dragged along by two appendages, you can't quite remember the number of manipulator digits. Two? Four? Six? It's all blurry, hazy, hidden behind a fog of sorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get the same feeling when looking upon some of your allies, the other species joined to the Hivemind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShort, stunted, grey skin, large heads, weak limbs, baleful gaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Abductors?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy does your mind associate that particular word with that particular species? Perhaps they were skilled in capturing enemy combatants?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome species, you feel close to. You don't know why, but you feel as though you once had a connection of sorts to them. You can remember vague feelings of... companionship, perhaps? You just can't quite place it. What were the names of those species, again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dog. Friend. Hound. Fast, pack animal.

Friend? Hive animal. Swarms. Overwhelm enemies. Clouds of thousands. Stingers pierce flesh and armour. Enemy of enemy. Enemy of enemy is friend. Friend. New allies. <br>\r\nSnake. Friend? Reptile. Venom corrodes metal, fangs pierce metal. New allies.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown at the information you know about those companion-species that worked alongside you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy were they companions? Why were some old allies, and some new? Why did their physical power seem wrong, as if they had not always been so strong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew the companion-species themselves felt this way towards the other companion-species. The Hivemind allowed communication, but understanding was not always attained when attempting to pierce the fog that seemed to cloud the minds of all those you knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome objects have feelings attached to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis armour, alien, this weapon, alien. This weapon, familiar. This one, kinetic, that one, plasma. This material, familiar. This environment, familiar, that one alien, another, unknown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grit your teeth, halting the flow of questions from your mind. Questions could be asked when the enemies were defeated. The enemies of the Hivemind. An ancient species, dark and mysterious, enemy to all other life. Enemy to Hivemind is enemy to all life. All life must... should... Must fight against enemy of Hivemind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnemy of Hivemind is dark. Is black. Is Shadow. Hivemind is Light, burns away Darkness. All Shadow must burn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow is evil. Shadow comes from absence of light, far from stars, far from galaxies. Shadows... Shadows raid galaxies, slake thirst for violence. Shadows live in the dark space between galaxy, in massive stations and ships capable of supporting them for millions of years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy were you repeating this to yourself? You knew the Shadow was evil. It was the enemy to the Hivemind, the enemy to all species that were not the Shadow. Perhaps it was good to be reminded of your purpose.  That way you would not fail when you next took the fight to the Shadow, alongside the Hivemind and the many species contained within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Shadow shall burn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Shadow will burn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Shadow must burn.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Underneath the black carapace of your helmet, you lick your dried lips. In your hands is a rifle, vat-grown to your exact specifications. It was ugly, but beautiful at the same time. Ugly to an outside observer, but beautiful to those who could appreciate the work and progress it represented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rifle in question was alive, as was your armour, and a fair portion of the building. Some things were simply easier or more reliable with technology rather than bio-engineering, such as computers or radios. The rifle clutched in your chitinous hands was a deep red colour, and in shape was similar to most of the 'assault rifles' of the twentieth and twenty first centuries. However, instead of a barrel, there was a small maw, three small mandibles jutting out of the crimson flesh to meet in front of the maw. When the 'trigger' - in actuality an exposed muscle - was pulled, the mandibles spread apart as a payload of solid bone was launched from the maw. Stroking a certain area on the rifle caused a membrane to cover the trigger muscles, preventing the rifle from firing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nProtruding from the bottom of the rifle's grip was a thin nerve strand, deep purple in colour. This nerve plugged into a port on the palms of your armour, linking the rifle into your HUD. The HUD was a strange thing. Your armour, jacking directly into your optic nerves, and being supplied with information about your weapons, your health, and your squad mates, superimposed a HUD over your vision. When you removed the armour, the HUD disappeared, although it took a couple of minutes for your vision to get back to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlicking your eyes up to the practice targets in front of you, you line your rifle up with the one that was in your immediate vision. Such was your concentration, that the rest of the world seemed to blur out of focus slightly as you fired into the classic 'bullseye' style target, hitting just off center. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were currently at a firing range. The firing range of your current base, to be exact. As was the case with most military bases, the walls were a boring white bone, as were the ceilings and floors. Small bio-heaters provided warmth at set intervals, the fleshy lumps radiating heat outwards. Several targets were arrayed at the end of each of a series of long corridors, allowing maximum focus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting, you roll your shoulders and place your rifle on your back, where a small layer of muscle rapidly grows over it, so as to keep it in place. Reaching up to your head, you grip your helmet and gradually seperate it from the rest of your armour, layers of sinew used to lock it in place easily ripping under force. Feeling a jolt of an impulse as you disconnect the nerves from their plugs in your neck and head, you rub the back side of your helmet, which was composed of several thick slabs of muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, don't worry, girl,\" you coo as you pet the helmet, feeling the muscle squirm slightly under your touch. \"We'll play again later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the helmet on your back for safekeeping, you exit the room, making your way towards the barracks. It was pretty late, and a tired soldier was a useless soldier. Better catch up on some sleep, then!</span></div></div>",

I think I can speak for anyone who has seen the movie with the following:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jesus fucking Christ!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor those of you who'd rather not look it up, Threads is a docu-drama set in Britain during the height of the Cold War, showcasing a scenario wherein the general situation surrounding NATO and the Warsaw Pact rapidly deteriorates until they start chucking nukes at one another. The film contains such lovely imagery as mangled corpses just poking out of rubble, entire villages burning in nuclear fire, and a stillborn and deformed foetus at the very end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that isn't what makes it terrifying, no. What makes it terrifying is how it shows just how ineffective plans to deal with nuclear war would be. That command and control bunker? Everyone inside either suffocated or starved to death. Your house that's protected enough to ensure you can survive the initial nuclear attacks? You're fucked when looters break in. Those PSA's telling you how to make a safe room in your house that's protected from fallout? You're in Britain and the Russians are launching nukes at you. <br>\r\nYou have four. <b>Fucking</b>. Minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after that beautiful little piece of nightmare fuel, I started wondering about other ways to prepare for a nuclear war. Eventually, I remembered the videogame RAGE, in which a group of people is placed into stasis before a massive meteor impact. Granted, the scenarios are a little different, but the outcome would largely be the same: massive loss of life, wide scale scavenging, looters, etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in this scenario, you'll be someone who was put into stasis before a nuclear war broke out in an attempt to repopulate afterwards. And yes, it's going to be set in Britain - I've had a couple of people asking me about this - because I live in Britain, and if I tried to write about somewhere else I'd most likely get everything wrong and possibly wind up offending some people.

There are two important differences: we walk on two legs while they walk on four, and we're intelligent while they're animals. No, I don't know while they're like that. Go ask the local scribe if you want an answer. The thing is, humans are... more in tune with nature than us, somehow. They're more at home in the forests than in the cities. This attunement to nature allows them to command various beasts and animals. I heard a tale about a hydra that were commanded by a human many years ago. Yes, humans are frail, that's why they usually get supporting roles in the king's armies. But those beasts they bring with them, those half-cousins of ours? They're not frail.

The room was plain, as a use had yet to be ascribed to it; it was bare, making the stone that made it up all the more apparent. Isaac is leaning out of a window cut into the wall, his back facing you. Standing next to him, you place a black-furred hand on his back, gently rubbing his smaller frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac sighs, brushing his brown hair away from his eyes. \"I can't stop thinking about Her. No matter how hard I try, my thoughts... my thoughts return to Her...\" Out of the window, you can see the normally verdant and fertile land turn to mud beneath a torrential rainfall. Thunder booms several seconds after a bolt of lightning falls from the heavens, striking a target over the horizon. Off in the distance, you can see a mountain range rising grandly into the sky, a titanic cluster of treetops spreading outwards from its base. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is she?\" you ask gently, beginning to move your equine form closer to Isaac's pale, skinny body. Isaac sighs once more, his emerald green eyes focusing on the foot of the mountains so many miles away. \"The forest. I- I miss Her so much; I haven't been with Her in such a long time.\" Isaac lets out a whimper, resting his forehead against the cool stone of the window. Wrapping an arm around him, you begin to guide him away from the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used to have a cabin in that forest. I hated having to cut down the trees but She understood. I could sense Her when inside and could feel Her through the vines creeping up the walls...\" Isaac trails off as he attempts to resist your superior strength and return to the window, the look on his face resembling that of a lost child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed another trip to the gardens was in order. Much like an addict attempting to wean themselves off of their particular substance, occasional small doses of nature helped Isaac deal with his 'withdrawal'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Isaac. Let's to the gardens. I know it's not much but it's better than nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac nods and begins to walk with you, a glum look on his pale face. \"Okay, Ruby... Do you think it would be possible to make a d-detour in our journey? I don't know what the others would think but I <i>need</i> to be with Her again, even if it is only for a few minutes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBless him, he was so adorable when he was sad...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see what I can do, Isaac. But aren't most of your familiars located in the forest? The one that we have to pass by to reach the tomb we're being paid to clear out?\" Isaac nods again, guided along by your grip on him, as he is clearly not focused on the cold grey corridors.  \"Well, I think it should be rather easy. I explain your... uh... condition, then mention team cohesiveness and how dangerous the undead can be. See? Easy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac nods again, still unfocused. Hopefully the rain would clear before you got to the gardens. The last thing you wanted to deal with was a homesick human that was also sopping wet and without any of his animal compansions. </span></div></div>",

So the government created the sliders exploratory committee or Sec. Each explorer gets a evo suit for protection but can break, a stun baton, and nanomachines to help keep you healthy. They can help you resist disease, slow them down, heal you a little, and despite its abilities it cannot protect you from everything. Some diseases and parasites can get through them or with enough exposure unless you find a cure (assuming there is one). If anything were to happen to you while you are in another world for instance dying another explorer is sent to find out what happened to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack stood in front of the portals excited. This was his first time and the infinite possibilities filled him with wanderlust. He knows not where any of them would take him but it didn't matter to him as long as he was free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPortal one: Aphrodisthesia <br>\r\nA primordial land filled with Cryptids aka monsters including insects, parasites, animals plus infected ones, mythical creatures, corrupted plants, anthros, and a tribe of humans. The planet itself is a very dense forest with human civilization being a mix between tribal and mayan. They worship Amouroboros among other with that large structure in city being its temple followed by the massive maze of waterways that run underground. Be careful not to let you suit get destroyed and try not to get captured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPortal two: Latextheya<br>\r\nThis is a earth where the world is being taken over by a living rubber anthropomorphic creatures and plush. They can assimilate people or turn them into latex creatures as well. They come in all shapes and sizes like dragons,wolves you name it.Some may help you but most wanted to eat you. The humans that are left have formed a resistance but maybe hard to find them or they will find you.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The specifics of exactly how and why are still unclear, but mankind has been granted the ability to step between realities, The ability is known as 'Sliding', is innate and instinctive, and was conferred simultaneously upon two-thirds of the human race by a mysterious wave of cosmic radiation, an event that became known as Open Day. With a single thought, a person can now cross through into one of billions (possible infinite) alternate Earths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other realities vary wildly - many of the Earths are desolate arid rocks, others are merely uninhabited, worlds where homo sapiens failed to evolved, while some are almost identical to our own, differing only in a few details. Some are utterly alien, hosting lifeforms, civilizations and sentient races never seen on Earth Prime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rare few, known as 'Joker' worlds, operate on physical principles that make a mockery of conventional Earth Prime physics. Examples include Chocolate World, Balloon Animal Planet, and Backwards Land, where time flows in reverse. There are even worlds that run on cartoon logic, where people can be squashed, dismembered and exploded without harm, and realms where magic is real and Gods walk upon the Earth. The existence of these worlds and their warped, whimsical logic have driven many of the scientists struggling to comprehend the sliding phenomenon into apoplexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach human is granted one reality that is keyed to them and them alone. Only that one person can slide directly into \"their\" reality. though sliding leaves behind a portal through which others can follow. Interestingly, most alternate Earths seem to relate to the person matched with it, often fashioned after their personalities and desires in some fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition, sliders may make a \"blind slide\" whereby they jump to any one of the infinite Earths of the multiverse completely at random. Blind slides are dangerous, both for their debilitating effects on sliders, and because they do not leave behind a portal. The person is stranded, and the only way to return home is to continue blind sliding in the hope of landing back on Earth Prime, though the chances of this are astronomically slim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen people slide into their personal realities, they leave behind a silhouette, a person-shaped portal in the air shaped which connects the two worlds and remains open for as long as a person is inside their reality. It is through this portal that a slider must return in order to get back to Earth Prime, and others may travel freely through an open portal while it remains open. Care must be taken in exploring another person's world, however. Sliding into your own reality is not possible while in somebody elses, only from Earth Prime, and should the person whose reality you are in return to Earth Prime, the portal closes behind them, trapping you inside. Should they die, the portal will begin to destabilize, and will vanish completely after 24 hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf a traveler enters a dimension significantly different to their own, there is a strong chance that their physical forms will be altered to match the rules of the new reality. The person may attempt to fight off these changes, however the reality will start to reject the incongruous \"fly-in-its-ointment\" if they do so. A series of improbable, life threatening events will begin to occur in the vicinity of the dimensional traveler, escalating until the traveler either leaves or accepts the changes. If a slider is unconscious, they are unable to resist the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese changes are almost always reverted upon returning to Earth Prime. When blind sliding, these changes are only ever compounded. For example, if a traveler enters a world where only women exists and becomes a woman, then blind-slides to one where zombies are the dominant lifeform, he will become a female zombie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are other risks, not just to sliders but to the wider world of Earth Prime. The other worlds are frequently dangerous, containing hostile creatures; strange, infectious diseases unknown to medical science; and sentient races that will cross back into Earth Prime through open portals if given the chance. Earth Prime is swiftly losing grip on normality as the oddities of the alternate dimensions migrate in. An international task force has been established to police this new phenomenon, deporting inter-world immigrants, sealing off dangerous worlds, even chasing criminal fugitives into their own warped realities in order to bring them to justice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Rules of Sliding (tl;dr)</u></b><br>\r\n1. Each human may slide to their personal dimension, but only from Earth Prime. This leave behind a stable, two-way portal.<br>\r\n2. Portals vanish when a person returns home, and swiftly destabilise if a person dies.<br>\r\n3. Each person may \"blind slide\" from any dimension, jumping at random to one of the infinite Earths. The portal destabilizes almost instantly.<br>\r\n4. Duplicates of people may exist in other dimensions. When attempting to enter a world where a version of themselves already exists, a slider will replace the original.<br>\r\n5. A slider's physical form may be changed if it conflicts with the rules of the new dimension. A slider can fight the changes, but the dimension will not like it. A slider who is unconscious cannot fight the changes.<br>\r\n6. Sliding while in contact with something or someone carries the risk of fusing the two into a single individual.<br>\r\n7. All changes are reverted upon returning to Earth Prime, but compounded when \"blind sliding\". Any changes inflicted while in another reality (by surgery, magic or other means) do <b>not</b> revert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rules of writing</b><br>\r\n1. The multiverse is truly infinite. Don't see a reality you like? Make one!<br>\r\n2. Kill characters is fine. However, if the protagonist dies, the story continues, from the POV or one of the other characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(<i><i>With thanks to Sliders, and Terry Pratchett and Steven Baxter's The Long Earth.</i></i>)</td>",
