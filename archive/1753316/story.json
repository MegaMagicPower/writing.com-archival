The eager students packed their bags and left as the teachers yelled after them about remembering the homework. One of the last students left in the room was Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was a 13 year old anthro tiger, still in middle school. He was of average height and intelligence, and he was somewhat scrawny, though he wished he was bigger. He was nice, but he was somewhat depressed about one major thing: his stepfather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis parents had died in a mysterious accident when he was younger (according to his stepfather at least), so Hunter was adopted by his stepfather. However, it turned out that Hunter's stepfather was a cruel man who had only adopted Hunter to use him for things he was too lazy to do himself. He yelled at Hunter whenever he did anything slightly wrong, never let him have sweets, never let him have friends over, made him clean and mow the yard, paint their rundown house, and just plain treated Hunter badly. It was a good thing that Hunter was kind and optimistic, or he would be seriously anti-social.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat considered, Hunter still led a relatively nice life. His stepfather did give him a few luxuries and he did have a few friends. However, those friends were nowhere to be found as Hunter left school, so he began to walk down the street towards home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hunter walked passed a dark alleyway, he thought he heard a voice coming from the alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunter... Hunter...\" the voice called out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, now curious at to who could be calling him, stepped into the dark alley. He thought at the other end he saw something glowing, but he figured that was impossible. However, as he got closer, he realized that he was right. There was a tall tiger standing there, and he gave off a bright, radiant light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunter... I need to tell you something...\" the tiger said in a soft yet manly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you? How do you know my name?\" Hunter asked, curious but frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, I'm an angel from above, here to bring you a message.\" the tiger said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter paused. He wasn't sure whether to believe the tiger or not, but something compelled him to believe the strange tiger. \"Who's the message from?\" Hunter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a message from your parents,\" the angel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was in shock. \"My parents? What do you mean?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunter, your parents were no ordinary tigers,\" the angel said. \"They never died like you have been told. Your parents are the great tiger gods, and you are their son!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter nearly fainted from shock and disbelief. His parents, gods? Normally he wouldn't believe anyone if they said that, but this tiger WAS an angel, so it was hard not to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what does that mean for me?\" Hunter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a demigod! As the son of the tiger gods, you have the power to do whatever you wish! Simply think of what you want and it will happen. You could alter the universe with a simple thought!\" the angel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's head was spinning with this new, amazing information. He couldn't believe he could do whatever he wanted! It was unbelievable. He barely managed to talk to the angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm.... thank you for telling me,\" Hunter said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your welcome. I must go now, Hunter. Use your power wisely!\" the angel called out before he suddenly disappeared in a puff of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter staggered out of the alley, a new outlook on life. He could do anything he wanted now! The possibilities were endless. And whatever Hunter did, he could simply make it so that no one would think anything unusual of it! Many ideas popped into Hunter's head on what to do first...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could do anything he wanted! Hunter didn't know where to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing came to Hunter's mind: his muscles. He had always been a weak kid, never even having a little bit of muscle on his body. But now he could change that. He had all the power in the world now. So Hunter focused on his first change: his muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter felt the intense power build up in his muscles as he prepared for what was going to happen. It felt like an explosion inside his body as his muscles began to swell up. His pecs grew and shifted, widening his body and pushing out with great power. His abs also bulged out, forming a solid 6-pack to make his stomach rock hard. His legs thickened, pushing against each other like large trees. His biceps blew up like basketballs, being help up by Hunter's thick forearms. Finally, as Hunter was beginning to feel cramped, his bones shifted and he grew to over seven feet tall to allow his godly muscles room to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was sweating and panting once the growth ended, energy being sapped out of him. However, he quickly got over it, his new muscles giving him energy like he had never felt before. He truly felt like a god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hunter looked over his muscles, he realized that people would notice him suddenly becoming a bodybuilder. So, with just another thought, the world instantly changed, and Hunter had always been a muscular bodybuilder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter noticed the new clothes one him, properly fitted for his new muscles. No one was staring at him, so he knew that reality had been changed. Hunter now wondered what else he could do to make his life better...</span></div></div>",

For a thirteen year old tiger, Hunter looked like twenty one year old! Hunter playfully squeezed his bicep and was thrilled to see it swell to great veiny peaks. He placed a paw over the bundle of power and could feel the strong warmth of his muscle struggling to get out of his arm. Hunter could literally feel his pulse streaming through his mighty arm.<br>\r\nHunter then thought to himself, \u201cIf I look like a twenty one year old, why not be one?\u201d He was a god after all. Why not have a body that matched his muscles? Hunter closed his eyes and pictured himself as twenty one years old. With little effort, Hunter could feel his whole body shifting. The power in his muscles ruptured but his muscles grew bigger to capture it again. His bones stretched making him taller and bigger. The process didn\u2019t feel like anything to Hunter. It felt like a cool breeze creeping up his feet to his already rippled chest. <br>\r\nThe tiger god opened his eyes again and saw his paws were bigger than ever before! His shirt somehow still maintained his new shape but he took it off to run his paws over his new solid 8 pack abs and his tree trunk legs. Hunter\u2019s muscles were harder than diamonds! Excitedly, Hunter flexed his arms down while tensing his chest and legs. He could raw energy jumping across each cell on his new body. He felt like a boulder that no one could stop.<br>\r\nHunter liked the body he had but he was curious about what face he had. With a snap of his meaty fingers, a hand held mirror flashed into his paw. Hunter held it up against his face gritted his teeth euphoniously. His face had clean cut cheekbones and slight facial hair covering a dimple in his chin. He gave a sexy smile to himself in approval.<br>\r\nHunter began to love being a god more and more. If his powers could give him an amazing body, what else could they do? Hunter walked down the public streets confidently smiling at other people passing. People couldn\u2019t stop staring at Hunter even when he altered reality to seem he was always a twenty one year old bodybuilder. But he didn\u2019t care. He just wanted everyone to see and know the new Hunter.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hunter just tried to focus on where he was going...wait, he wasn't even planning to go anywhere in the first place! Hunter puts on a sly grin, \"Heh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger knees down on one knee, raising up his arms to show off his bulging arms. His biceps and forearms rippled with great definition. It wasn't much, but he could tell people from around him were taking notice. \"Is he some sort of flash mob?\" \"What are ya, an idiot? A flash mob would need at least two people.\" \"Oh yeah, right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, Hunter stands back up, spreading his well-defined chest and lats for the small crowd. He then raises his hands to the back of his head, flexing his hardened biceps and even bouncing his thick pecs once or twice. \"This guy ain't half bad.\", remarks one guy. \"He's a hunk!\", cries out one gal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was really enjoying himself with the crowd, he just didn't want to stop. He lowers his arms against his sides, pumping them with his abs and chest while he put on a proud grin. It's funny, Hunter never really thought he'd be this confindent with people before. Guess it helps to have a strong and muscular body. The next thing the muscled tiger does is raise his left arm up against his head, flexing his bicep all on its own. \"Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter takes notice a watch that he still wore. Looks like it's time for dinner. \"Well, see ya guys. You were all great.\" A few of them were saddened, but Hunter had someplace he needed to be. As Hunter strutted his way a bit towards his home, he realizes something. He can't just show up at his house like this! No way would his stepdad not feel suspicious. What was the tiger to do? Should he just turn back to normal, or, maybe he can turn his dad, into a nice one...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hunter then remembered that he was a god. He could do whatever he wanted with a single thought, even his stepfather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter stopped at the front porch of his house. He thought that if he were to do anything with his dad, now would be the time to do it. The tiger god closed his eyes to concentrate on his stepdad being nice to him and knowing Hunter was a twenty one year old stud. Hunter opened his eyes again not knowing if his powers worked or not. There was only one way to find out. Hunter walked up to the front door and opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe living room Hunter entered was deserted. There was no sign of his father anywhere. \"Uh, Dad?\" Hunter asked. \"You home?\" He then heard a booming voice coming from the kitchen but this voice had a tone of encouragement rather than threat. \"Hey, Champ! I'm in here making dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter walked to the kitchen making the floor of the house shake under his new weight of his muscles. He tilted his head to find a scruffy average joe tiger over the stove. \"Dad?\" asked Hunter trying to hide his fear. \"Hey, Champ!\" said his dad again. \"Good to see you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's power worked! He made his dad nicer and made sure he never noticed his sudden growth. To his dad, he was always like that. \"So, what's going on here?\" asked Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm making a healthy dinner for the both of us and I thought you and I could workout in the basement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Hunter had no idea what his dad was talking about. Then memories started flowing in his head. His dad had exercise equipment in the basement and the two of them exercise regularly to keep in shape. \"Sure,\" replied Hunter. \"That sounds great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, Hunter and his dad got changed into their gym clothes and made their way downstairs to the basement. The room had everything a bodybuilder could need: a stack of weights, weight benches, treadmills, and bars hanging from the ceiling. Hunter was very impressed with the equipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's get to work!\" said Hunter's stepdad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's dad first made his way to the treadmill to warm himself up for more vigorous exercise. Hunter, on the other hand, wanted to find out what his muscles could really do besides attract an audience. He walked over the shelves of dumbbells looking for a decent sized ones to start with. He first spotted the fifty pound weights. He was skeptic but figured his muscles could handle the pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter wrapped the dumbbells with his paws ready to heave them up from the shelf. To Hunter's surprise, they were very light. They felt like pillows. He put them back to look for heavier ones. Hunter tested different sized weights to find the most challenging. After a few minutes, Hunter found the rights set of dumbbells at a hundred and fifty pounds! Hunter could feel the weights straining his arms making them thicker with veins popping out of his fur. Hunter loved that sight. He was looking at great power flowing through his godlike body. Hunter began pumping. It was challenging but he loved how dumbbells kept pushing more power into his muscles. He could get use to this new life.</span></div></div>",

It was a good thing too, because Hunter was able to actually talk and get to know more about his father. As for the big tiger himself, he was feeling nothing but great adrenaline for his pumped body. After finishing another set of reps with a pair of 75-pound dumbbells, he sets them down and then turns his attention to a full-length mirror set against the wall in front of him. The first thing Hunter takes notice of were his thick peaks. He never ever thought he'd accquire such massive biceps or triceps in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's father was sitting on a benching equipment, wiping his forehead with a towel from his most recent benching session. He then looks up at his son, who was starting to feel one arm while he flexes it as hard as he could against his head. His dad puts on a proud smile. Hunter was about ready to REALLY get into a pose-off with himself, but a sudden knock on the door eminates from upstairs. \"Oh, Hunter, you mind gettin' that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter turns to his dad, giving him a thumbs up, \"Sure Dad, no problem.\" He was so excited about his new dad, he didn't even realize he was still shirtless once he runs upstairs and to the door. Oh well. Hunter turns the doorknob. Hunter was surprised to see a muscular dragon standing at his door. The dragon was at least a foot taller than him and looked a bit bigger than Hunter's. The dragon looked down at Hunter with a big smile. \"Hey, little bro!\" Hunter at first didn't know who this dragon was but his godly powers gave him new memories. The dragon's name was Adrian and he and Hunter have been best friends ever since they both started bodybuilding. They competed against each other in competitions, hung out together, and showed off sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shared the same smile to Adrian. \"Hey, bro!\" said Hunter. \"Come on in!\" Adrian watched his head and squeezed his giant arms as he went through the door. \"What's up?\" asked Hunter. Adrian chuckled. \"Just thought I'd come over and hang out with my favorite little bro!\" Hunter really liked the sound of that. He never had a friend that called him a brother before. \"But seriously,\" continued Adrian, \"It's such a beautiful day that I thought you and I could show off at the beach! Wouldn't that be cool?\" Hunter couldn't help but smile at the thought of his muscular body in the water and sand, especially surrounded by girls. \"That sounds awesome!\" Adrian pumped his arms with enthusiasm. \"Cool! I'm already wearing my suit underneath my clothes. Hurry up and change so we can go! The girls won't be there forever!\" Hunter chuckled. \"Okay, I'm going!\" Hunter ran up stairs, two stepping them with great ease and he was in his room within seconds. He stopped in front of his drawers and began opening them, instead of the child's clothing he remembered when he woke up that morning, there were clothes made for a large adult and he begin rifling through them looking for a pair of beach shorts. In the bottom most drawer he found multiple pairs, a couple red with black stripes down the sides, a pair with grey and blue shorts and a pair of straight black shorts. he decided quickly on the pair of black shorts and quickly changed into them before bounding down the stairs again. \"I'm ready to go!\" Adrian grinned clamping a hand down on Hunter's shoulder. \"Great, lets go little bro!\" Hunter followed Adrian out the door and down the steps of his porch and they made a left turn, heading down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian walked ahead of Hunter, proudly showing off his body as he walked, getting plenty of stares of admiration. Hunter blushed a little and moved closer to Adrian and began copying the way he walked, trying to show off his well defined figure, getting quite a few stares himself. Hunter ate up the attention, grinning broadly and putting on a small show as they walked, flexing his massive biceps so they bulged and the veins popped out. Adrian turned around smiling at Hunter. \"Hey bro, what do you say we put on a little show?\"</span></div></div>",

A couple people noticed Hunter, and started to crowd around to see what was going on. The pumped tiger then gets back up, turning his upper body around to show off his bulging back. Hunter's twitching ears were starting to overhear a couple people awe and 'ooh' around him. Suddenly, Adrian pulls his shirt right off, standing beside his flexing friend.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAdrian's immense and rippling body seemed to really reel in the crowd. \"Eh. Wouldn't have minded taking my shirt off sooner anyway.\", the big dragon shrugs. Adrian tosses his shirt off to the side, and then raises his arms up to flex them with his fists facing away from each other, showing off his mountainous peaks while putting on a big grin.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFirst thing Hunter notices, is that the people around them was starting to eye Adrian more than him. \"Heh. Do I detect some competition here?\" The rigorous tiger smirks as he prepares himself for his next pose against his etchy friend. With a simple thought, Hunter shrank his shirt with his powers. He could feel the fabric tightening to his fur. Just the way he wanted. After his shirt shrank, Hunter noticed how defined his chest looked under his shirt. His muscles literally looked like they were going to burst out of it. Hunter then raised his arms to the level of his shoulders. The crowd and Adrian could see Hunter's biceps tense to great peaks. The sleeves of his shirt seemed to melt on Hunter's fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter then pushed his biceps harder. He gritted his teeth as everyone heard the slight tears coming from Hunter's sleeves. With a gentle growl, Hunter bursted his biceps out of the sleeves! The crowd and Adrian applauded him for his incredible feat. Adrian clapped his hand down on Hunter's shoulder. \"Nice job little bro, glad to see you making full use of your strength, but now it's my turn\" Adrian stepped back, curling my hands into  fists as he flexed hard, his arms placed over his chest and abs as they bulged out into great peaks of muscle, his chest rippling with the very strength barely contained in his flesh, people watched in awe of his strength and began applauding again this time with Hunter int he crowd of onlookers. \"That was amazing!\" Hunter moved forward as Adrian relaxed a little, watching him in anticipation of what he did next. \"You know I think I should get rid of this shirt, it's already ruined...\" Hunter tensed his muscles and flex hard, making his chest bulge out, several veins popping up as there was a large tearing sound as Hunter's shirt was ripped apart, falling off his massive shoulders, inciting a large cheer from the crowd as Adrian looked on with pride clear on his face as he clapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and Adrian turned and faced one another with a smile. \"You did a good job!\" said Adrian. \"You too!\" replied Hunter. They both raised a claw and paw and smack them to together for a high five. But they didn't let go of each other's grip. They held their high five pose to ripple and flex their arms with incredible power. The crowd applauded and sensed that they were done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you all!\" said Adrian. \"You all have been a lovely audience but right now my friend and I need to go.\" There were slight sounds of disappointment but the crowd understood. The people then dispersed leaving Hunter and Adrian by themselves. Adrian grabbed Hunter's shoulder tightly. \"Ready to go to the beach?\" he asked. Hunter nodded enthusiastically. \"Let's go!\"</span></div></div>",

I love this place.\", Adrian remarks with a wink. \"Great place to show off what ya really got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter had his arms crossed over his burly chest, \"More than that intersection we were just at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much more than that.\", the big dragon replies. Hunter just chuckles again at his marvelous friend. Adrian flexes an arm in front of his chest to his friend, emphasizing the peak being flexed before him, \"Now, why don't we change into something a little more...slimming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter points at his hilarious friend, \"Slimming? You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is that the wrong word?\", Adrian remarks. \"I meant to say...\", the powerful dragon turns his upper body around in order to perform a back double-bicep for his friend, showing off his rippling back, \"...something a little more, sportsman like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big tiger laughs to himself. \"How did you mix THAT up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time for chit-chat, gotta get going.\" The muscular dragon runs off. Hunter follwed the dragon footprints in the sand and it led to a flexing Adrian in front of a group of girls. Hunter couldn't help but chuckle. That was very typical of Adrian. Hunter then smiled to himself thinking about how to get back at Adrian for getting at the girls first. He looked for a changing room across the beach and found one near a concession stand. The tiger god went to the first room closest to him. After closing the door, Hunter slipped out of his street clothes to reveal his swim suit that wrapped around his thighs tightly. They revealed tendons and strips of muscle so everyone could see the godly power Hunter possessed. Time to show what he was truly made of!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Hunter stepped out to the blazing day, people instantly started staring at his amazing body. Hunter didn't mind. He just smiled as he made his way to Adrian's position. Hunter even toyed with the attention by pretending he had an itch on his chest and rub his paws against it. His confidence stayed at a high level until he saw Adrian and his audience. Hunter grinned, seeing it as a challenge to see how big a crowd he could pull in himself and he took a stance, reaching his arms up above his hand and clamping his hands together, pushing powerfully against one another so his muscles bulged and the veins popped. the crowd gasped excitedly and Hunter heard more than a few giggles from some girls watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian turned, following the eyes of the crowd until he spotted Hunter and grinned, seeing what he was doing and immediately picked up on the challenge and prepared to give his own showase to the eager crowd. Adrian tensed his muscles, letting them ripple under his skin as Hunter finished up, a round of applause sounded from the crowd which quickly grew quiet in anticipation as they turned to Adrian who bulged out his biceps, squeezing his chest together letting it ripple and coil under his skin as he grabbed his left wrist,pushing down so his arms were almost completely straightened out, stretching out the biceps so they looked like two large footballs, with writhing veins in each one.  The crowd gasped, their attention held by Adrian's big performance and Hunter gave a big grin, this was definitely going to be a big challenge for him, but he knew he could handle it.</span></div></div>",

After the big dragon's last feat, Hunter's gonna have to do something pretty eye-catching to out-do the big guy. The ripped tiger just strokes his chin hair, plotting out what he can do to show Adrian up. After a moment's thought, Hunter comes up with with something. It's not much, but it's worth a try. The large feline suddenly stomps a foot out on the sand, making a loud enough sound to get everyone to look back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter bends down on one knee, his enormous thighs peaking outward quite well with thick definition. He then stretches his arms out and raises them up against his head, flexing out his bulging biceps while letting out a toothy grin that was enough to make a few ladies out there squeel with joy for the posing tiger. Adrian is bigger than Hunter, but way Hunter was flexing and the amount of muscle and tendons being flexed ot the brink, Hunter is practically as big as the dragon is now! The crowd behind Adrian cheers on for Hunter, who then gets up to perform his next pose. \"Show-off.\" Adrian grinned, not wanting to let the crowd get disappointed as he stood up straight and tall, slowly  spreading his legs a bit as he slid into his stance, arms raised up and  moved behind his head, fingers interlocking as he tugged on each arm, his muscles bulged out massively, looking like rugged mountainous peaks of raw power, the more he tugged, the bigger the biceps seemed to get. the crowd gasped softly, small cheers here and there, growing steadily louder with each passing moment. Adrian gave a small laugh and flexed harder, the biceps pushing out to their peaks, large veins pushing out from the skin, inciting a loud applause from the crowd. Hunter smirked. \"and you call ME a show-off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's words just added fuel to Adrian's passionate fire. While keeping his pose, the tough dragon centered his strength to his rippled chest. Adrian's pecs swelled like balloons while his abs grew more defined and revealed even the smallest muscles on his chest. The chest grew to envious proportions and made the crowd go wilder for Adrian than Hunter. The audience and Hunter were amazed as Adrian flexed his abs so hard that another row abs lightly defined his chest. Hunter thought to himself, \"I stand corrected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian finally relaxed his pose even though it looked like his muscles still kept their tensed shape. The dragon raised his voice to the crowd. \"Who do you think won this posedown?! Give a cheer for my little tiger bro if you think he won!\" A solid audience clapped, cheered, and whistled for Hunter. Hunter responded by waving and flexing a single bicep. \"Now,\" continued Adrian, \"cheer if you guys think I won!\" A humongous noise came from the crowd that Hunter covered his ears. It was clearly stated who won this posedown. Hunter was never a sore loser though. He was happy people liked his big dragon bro and knew that they liked him too.</span></div></div>",

As Adrian raises his muscular arms up for the crowd, Hunter walks up in front of him. \"Hunter!? What the...!?\" The muscley tiger raises his arms up just like his friend, only trying harder to flex and pump up his arms. Still, they were nowhere near Adrian's, even while his arms weren't even being flexed. \"Hey man, I think the crowd already have their sights set on me.\", the big dragon remarks, setting his hands on his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter glances back, and then does just what his dragon friend was doing, only with A LOT more tensing and flexing, making his lats stick out like wings. Adrian raises an eyebrow, realizing what his pal is up to. \"Oh. I see...\", he utters in his head. Without noticing, Hunter just kept his pose, trying to attract as much attention as he could. After a moment, he takes a look back, his eyes growing wide. Holy cow! He never exactly got a glimpse of his pal's enlarged back muscles before. It didn't look like he was even flexing that hard, but he was still capable of earning such an impressive and rippled back! Then again, he does acquire such large wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Hunter loved his best friend, he grew envious of Adrian's body. It was bigger, stronger, and more muscular than his own. Hunter wished that he had a body like Adrian's, maybe even bigger. Then it occurred to him, Hunter was a god. He could do whatever he wanted, even changing his own body some more. \"Adrian,\" said Hunter, \"I'm going to the bathroom.\" Adrian just kept on posing. \"Okay, don't take too long though!\" Hunter then walked towards the dressing rooms rather than the bathroom. The dressing rooms were more spacious.  He got into one and covered the entrance. Hunter closed his eyes, thinking about growing taller, stronger, more muscular, there was the familiar sensation as his body began changing. His body growing taller, his biceps and triceps swelling to his old peak and growing even bigger, becoming great peaks of strength, his chest and abs growing bigger, more defined, his legs growing stronger, more defined. When Hunter opened his eyes, he was amazed at how much bigger he'd gotten, he felt extremely powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter rubbed his chest with his paw to see if his stronger muscles were real. Indeed they. Hunter flexed in every pose he could think of. He figured he was about the size of Adrian now. Hunter smirked to himself and thought, \"Why be as big when I can be bigger?\" Hunter closed his eyes again and pictured himself even bigger. The euphoric sensation came back again. Hunter could feel his muscles pushing against his skin and fur even more. Veins started popping out of his muscular peaks as his muscles grew even more stronger, bigger, and defined. Hunter stopped growing and opened his eyes to truly feel like a god. Hunter felt like he was the strongest and biggest around. Hunter smiled ready to show off the new him. Before leaving the changing room, Hunter quickly made everyone think he was always his new size and changed his bathing suit into a larger size (they were really tight against his thick thighs and waist).</span></div></div>",

Hunter was getting more stares than he did previously. He played with the stares by stretching his arms out making them tense and vascular. Hunter still felt incredible power running through his body and was enjoying every second if it. He truly felt like the happiest and strongest tiger in the world. Hunter stopped when he saw Adrian in sight. He figured it was time to say hello to his \"little\" bro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian was posing in front of a couple young lionesses. The muscle dragon got their attention more and more after each pose he performed. \"Hey, Adrian!\" said Hunter in a new deeper voice. Adrian and the lionesses turned to a giant tiger coming their way. The lionesses couldn't help but stare in awe of Hunter's gigantic muscles. Adrian smiled to Hunter. \"Hey big bro!\" said Adrian. Hunter chuckled to himself. He liked being called \"Big Bro\" Hunter clamped his hand down on Adriand's shoulder \"Hey little bro, keeping the ladies entertained?\" Adrian grinned \"Not just them, eveyone loves the show we've been putting on.\" Hunter laughed \"I bet so, how about I really give them something to watch.\" Adrian looked a little puzzled at first before Hunter  intertwined his fingers. \"Climb on up bro\" Adrian grinned wickedly knowing what Hunter had planned, placing his foot onto Hunter's interlocked fingers.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHunter took a deep breath, lifting up and the crowd took a very audible breath as Adrian was lifted into the air, pulling a classic pose of raising his arms up on both sides, bulging out his biceps and the crowd cheered. The lionesses couldn't keep their eyes off of Hunter. After seeing lift a giant dragon as if he was nothing, they gave the tiger god his full attention. Hunter put Adrian down back on the sand and Adrian stood proudly by his new big bro. \"That was amazing!\" said one of the girls. \"I never seen such a strong tiger before!\" Hunter looked down at the two of them and chuckles slightly. \"Want to see how strong I really am?\" he asked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter kneeled on one knee to the lionesses level and raised an arm for them to behold. He then pushed against his arm to form a big strong mountain of a bicep. The girls were amazed how big Hunter's muscles were up close. \"You two want to feel?\" Without hesitation and without overeagerness, the girls places their paws on Hunter's bulking arm. It felt incredible to them. It was soft from his fur but at the same time hard from the power it possessed. The girls stroked his bicep up and down and they failed to wrap their paws around it completely. The girls grew shy as Hunter's muscles felt like they were going to explode with power. Their shyness grew more as Hunter winked at them. Adrian placed his hand on Hunter's shoulder. \"hey big bro, why don't we ask these girl if they'd like to hang out for a while?\" they practically started jumping up and down in excitement at the idea. Hunter laughed. \"How about it? you feel like hanging out with us?\" the girls almost fainted, Hunter could see them swooning unsteadily. \"I'll take that as a yes?\" The girls  couldn't even talk, only able to nod their heads. Adrian grinned \"Alright then, What do you think we should do Hunter?\"</span></div></div>",

Hunter wrapped his rippled arm around his girl's waist and the lioness rested her head on his pec like a pillow. Hunter smiled to himself thinking being a god was the best thing that has ever happened to him. He dazed off to the sight of the ocean was mesmerized by the crystal blue water crasing against sand. \"That ocean looks great today!\" said the lioness under Hunter's arm. Hunter looked down at her and winked. \"Not as great as you!\" The lioness blushed so much that redness could be seen underneath the fur of her cheeks.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThen an idea struck Hunter and he looked at her again. \"Want to go for a swim?\" The lioness nodded enthusiastically. Hunter got Adrian invovled and they all made their way towards the wading tides. As the tide reached Adrian's ankle, the muscle dragon jumped back. \"Hunter, this water's way too cold!\" Hunter dipped a toe in the damp sand and Adrian was right. The water was nowhere comfortable for a swim...not for long though. With a quick thought, Hunter imagined the ocean water around them at a warmer tempterature. He tested the water again it felt great against his fur. Hunter looked up. \"Feels great to me!\" Adrian took another dip in the water \"This feels great! let's get going!\" Hunter nodded taking the lioness' hand and walking out into the water, the warm waves washing over his legs, slowly rising up as they moved further and further out. Hunter grinned, pulling the lioness far enough out that they were treading water and he leaned back in the water, letting it's warmth soak  into his body. Adrian wasn't as gentle, rushing into water, barely even slowning as the water rose and diving into the water with a large splash. Hunter grinned at his now Little bro's antics as the lioness giggled, deciding to take a bold move and  climbed up onto Hunter, laying against his massive muscular chest and he blushed deeply. \"enjoying yourself?\" the lioness had a massive blush on his face as she nodded and Hunter grinned a bit mischeviously. \"Well let's see if i can't make you more comfortable..\" Hunter began  flexing, his chest rippling under his efforts and the lioness gasped, squirming in pleasure as she felt his massive muscles moving under her. Hunter reached up, grasping his hand gently and placed it against his chest, inciting a loud purr from her. \"would you mind giving my chest a bit of a massage?\" she shook her head excitedly, pressing her hands firmly against his chest, squeezing softly, moving in slow circles with her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter began purring himself, enjoying this amazing massage from the lioness. Hunter literally felt like he was floating in heaven. He was floating aimlessly feeling nothing but pleasure. His grin grew wider after each rubbing stroke from the lioness. It was about time he did something for her. Hunter sat up meeting her face to face still floating in the water. The lioness didn't know what he was doing until he wrapped her body into his mountains of muscle. Somehow, the lioness thought his body felt hotter than the actual blazing day. Hunter's muscles felt hard but at the same time soft and gentle. The lioness looked Hunter blushing more than ever. \"Thank you,\" said Hunter. \"You made this day very special for me!\" Hunter then winked at her and the lioness felt like she was going to pass out. Hunter sensed her body weakening so he swept her up from her feet and walked her back to shore. The lioness clung on to his meaty neck. As Hunter put her down, she stood on her toes to peck him on the cheek. Hunter then became the one blushing.</span></div></div>",

She felt comfortable and safe with him as Hunter carried back to shore. Adrian and the other lioness were not that far behind from them. Hunter sensed weariness in his lioness and in him. \"How about we take a rest?\" Hunter asked her. She happily said sure. Hunter and Adrian lied in the sand with their ladies. Hunter kept his giant arm around his lioness as she hugged his rippling torso. Adrian was playing with his lioness by flexing his bicep and letting her feel.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHunter chuckled making his torso ripple even more and making his lioness blush. \"You know,\" he said to her. \"We've had so much fun that I completely forgot to ask what your name is!\"<br>\r\n\"It's alright,\" she said shyly. \"My name's Alexis. My friend over there is Janice.\" Hunter smiled at Alexis. \"It's a pleasure to meet you,\" he said softly. \"I'm Hunter and that's my little bro, Adrian.\"<br>\r\n\"Do you call him your little brother because he's younger than you?\" asked Alexis.<br>\r\n\"Naw,\" Hunter smiled and flexed a mountainous bicep for her. \"I'm just bigger than he is!\" Alexis laughed agreeing with him.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAdrian grumbled sarcastically at his friend. \"Yeah, yeah. Maybe someday I'll be able to get bigger than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckles at his once-bigger-than-him friend. It's amazing how much his powers can change perspectives in his and other people's lives. Hunter then lies back with his arms folded behind his head, \"Yeah. That'll be the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian looks at his relaxing friend. \"Hey, don't be falling asleep too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter snarls a wee bit, \"And why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian gets up on his feet, along with Janice holding his hardened shoulder. \"Because, you said we were gonna come back to your place to weight train and all that good stuff.\", he says proudly with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter raises an eyebrow, \"Huh? When did I...?\" Suddenly, a few memories came back to him due to his powers. \"Oh. That's right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Do you really have to leave?\", Alexis asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter sits up, even though he barely lied down for a short moment, \"Don't worry, I'm sure we'll run into each other again soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness sighed softly, a bit disappointed their meeting had been so short, but she nodded. \"Hey I need to give you my number so we can meet up again.\" Hunter grinned and nodded, giving himself a mental kick for almost forgetting to ask. \"yea that would be bad if we parted without having a way to meet up again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe Lioness giggled and told Hunter her number, and he nodded, giving her a big hug cuasing another furious blush from her before she and her friend left, leaving Adrian and Hunter alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well big bro you ready to head home?\" Hunter nodded, smiling excitedly. Adrian drapped his arm over Hunter's shoulder. \"Then let's go home bro.\" Together they began walking down the beach towards the way they came. As Hunter and Adrian headed for home, new memories of his home began pouring into Hunter's head. Apparently, Hunter and Adrian shared a medium sized house with a basement that holds all their exercise equipment. Hunter found it a bit sudden to find out that he lives with Adrian but he knew he could trust his little dragon bro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a casual walk with more stares, Hunter and Adrian arrived at their home. As they walked in, Hunter stretched out his arms as a sign of tireness. \"That was a pretty fun trip!\" said Hunter to Adrian. \"I hope we get to hang out with Alexis and Janice again soon.\" Adrian nodded. \"Yeah, those lionesses were something all right!\" he said. \"I know we just got back and all but do you want to get started on our workout downstairs or do you want to relax a bit first? I'm fine either way.\" Hunter thought about it for a few seconds and made a decision.</span></div></div>",

Sounds good to me!\" The muscle dragon then turned his head to the stairs. \"Hey big bro, you mind if I go upstairs to change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, little bro,\" answered Hunter. \"Go on ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian stomped up the stairs to his room leaving Hunter in the living room. Hunter was thinking about changing his clothes too, but after rubbing his abs and flexing a bicep to himself, he decided to stay in his trunks for a little while longer. Hunter sat on the couch with a slight creak on impact. He grabbed the remote, turned on the tv, and placed his bare feet on the table in front of him. Hunter then took a deep breath of relaxation and locked his fingers on top of his rocky chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter rolled his neck a little, hearing a few satisfying pops as his joints released the pressure and he let out a soft contented sigh of relief. A short while later, he heard the heavy footfalls of Adrian as he came bounding down the stairs. The large dragon plopped down on the couch, which squealed with the added weight, and then there was the splintering of wood as the legs of the couch shattered and both Hunter and Adrian hit the ground with a light thump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man!\" Adrian sprung up and offered Hunter a hand, which he took as he stood up to look at their now squashed couched. \"I guess it really wasn't made for such big guys, but i didn't think he wasn't going to give out like that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Joke, it makes me wonder if our other furniture is any safer.\" Hunter took a look around at the wooden tables and chairs they had, they all looked a little older, but none of them seemed particularly dangerous, but then neither had the couch and it had just given out under them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but we are definitely going to have to look into getting a new couch, this one is completely ruined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter agreed but not just on the couch but on their other furniture. The place looked unsuited big guys like him and Adrian. Come to think of it, the house looked a tad bit small for them. Even if they got the proper furniture, they would have no place to put it because their place isn't big enough. Hunter instantly knew what to do. With a snap of his fingers, Hunter found himself in a slightly bigger house with much more decent furniture. Their old broken couch was replaced with a new sturdier and bigger one and the rest of their furniture was more size appropriate. Hunter thought to himself that this was much better. He even made sure the workout room in the basement was more modern for use. Of course, Hunter made sure his dragon bro didn't notice a sudden change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smiled for himself. He was really happy how his life was going after finding out he was a god. He could literally do whatever he wanted. But he was curious as to what else he could do. The possibilities were literally endless. The tiger god quickly thought on what he wanted to do next and then it hit him...</span></div></div>",

Adrian looked at Hunter and noticed he was smiling. \"You having a good time with your girl, big bro?\" asked Adrian. Hunter blushed again. Adrian continued, \"It's alright. No need to be shy. I'm glad you're having fun with her. I know I'm having fun with Tina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tina?\" said Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The girl I was with,\" explained Adrian. \"What's your girl's name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian smiled in approval. Shortly after, Hunter was carrying a couple of ice cream cones for the girls while Adrian was holding hot dogs for him and Hunter. Hunter still looked happy from being with Laura. He said to Adrian, \"Say bro, just out of curiosity, have you ever thought about getting serious with a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian shook his head. \"Not really. Maybe someday but I just want to get as much attention my muscles can get! What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter sighed puffing his rippling and defined chest. \"I don't know. I like Laura a lot but I don't know if she would want to get serious with me. What if she just wants to hang out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian grabbed Hunter's boulder-like shoulder and laughed. \"Come on, bro. Don't be hard on yourself! Laura like you a lot! I can tell. If you want to hang out with her more then ask her! I'm sure she'd be happy to be with a big guy like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt got Hunter thinking, what if Laura became his girlfriend? He never had one before but he never met a great girl like Laura. What harm could it done? If it didn't work out Hunter could always use his powers to fix it. With a lovesick heart, Hunter closed his eyes and used his powers to alter reality again. This time, he was going to make Laura his girlfriend. After a second, Hunter opened his eyes and saw his surroundings didn't change. Adrian didn't seem to notice anything. Before too long Hunter and Adrian returned to the girls with their refreshments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura and Tina rushed to Hunter to get their cones. Tina grabbed hers and went back to sit with Adrian, who started to eat his hot dog. Hunter turned his face to Laura. It was strange. Laura was looking at him like he was looking at her a while ago. He knew it was a look of love. He did it. Laura was his. \"I got your snack, Laura,\" said Hunter giving the ice cream cone to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura took it from his paw and said, \"Thanks, tiger!\" She rose up to Hunter's face with her toes and smooched his cheek. Hunter felt like he was going to melt faster than the ice cream. He was nervous but he was also excited.</span></div></div>",

He then shivered as he grew scale and wings. Adrian also shivered as his wings receded into his back while he grew mounds of fur. Adrian then grew until he was the same height as Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the transformation was over, Hunter opened his eyes. He then scanned his new dragon from which was still wearing his black shorts. He then turned to see Adrian who was now a sexy tiger wearing a red speedo.

Comming with it was interest in his physical looks, which he already quite improved, and of course GIRLS. He thought that now that he's now so psysicly fit, he should also look more attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he noticed he had long flowing hair, his muscles and striped look more slender and equaly set. His fur became more shiny and slightly deeper shade of red and his eyes became even deeper shade of blue. His facial features slightly sharpened, his teeth grew slightly larger and whiter and his chin became a bit more manly. Lastly he gained about 3 inches of hight (to the total of 5' 2\"). He became a much sexier version of himself. Most people wouldn't notice any changes other than the ones already implemented by the previous transformation, except from the impression of attractiveness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter liked what he saw in the mirror. He watched himself in the mirror for a while. He was the hottest 13 year old in the world (but he looked more like a 16 year old). Now he needs to test it. He packed his bag and grabbed his clothes. He put on a shirt over his bulging muscles and next he pulled on his pants when he noticed something. <br>\r\n\"Wow..  I guess I'll just have to learn to walk with THAT there.\" He said as he adjusted his new \"package\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swiftly run out of the house, alredy causing some gasps and stares from the females he passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere is he heading?</span></div></div>",

His transformation not only gave him the appearance of Adonis, but also made his pheromones so strong, they drove the attention of ladies from the age of 15 to 50. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he got to the beach he changed into his pair of dark blue speedos, which he had problems to fit his new sized maleness into. \"I should have taken the boxers instead. Hopefully theyll hold.\" But that wasn't the only feature that quite literally \"stood out\" on him. His body was bulging with beautiful muscles, shapely butt, flowing shoulder lenght hair and shiny fur. He truely had the looks of a greek god. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weather was warm and sunny and the beach was very live. There were people all over, but most of them were luckily young ladies. There were few girls lying on their blankets, tanning their backs, some of them even had their bikinies undone. They surely could use some sun-lotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit furthere Hunter saw some girls that looked like high school seniors, college years playing volleyball. There's 7 of them there with their stuff. Among them there are 2 curvy tigresses, a sexy ( very) black panther, a very buxom blond-haired white rabbit, a tall red-headed curvy vixen, a perky giggly poodle and a tall slender racoon. All of them are as hot as Hunter fantasised. They seem to be arguing about something. Maybe they could use a co-player, or a coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he sees some late teen cat girls playing in the water with a beach ball and splashing around. Nearby them you see a tall, buxom and athletic looking grey wolfess with black hair. She's the lifeguard.

It couldn't have been more perfect if he had set it up himself. He strutted his way over to the volleyball court, his well-muscled butt cheeks squeezing up against each other as he walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made it onto the court before any of the girls noticed him. They were all huddled together, discussing something amongst themselves. The first one to notice him was the poodle, who caught sight of someone approaching on an idle glance. She turned immediately, gasping loudly as she was enraptured by the immense beauty of the tiger moving towards them. The others turned as well, having similar jaw-dropping reactions to Hunter. A couple of them even crossed their legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter just grinned further as he got close to them, sand being kicked up from his heavy footfalls. \"Hello there ladies. What seems to be the problem?\" His voice was incredibly deep, yet silky smooth, almost hypnotizing to listen to. It took the girls a second to snap out of their stupor and even respond to the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... well... we were going to play volleyball... but we don't have even teams... so we were trying to figure out what to do,\" the vixen spoke up. She appeared to be having a hard time keeping her eyes on Hunter's face as opposed to his protruding package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter lightly chuckled, causing his bare chest to ripple. \"Is that it? In that case, I'd be happy to join you and make it even.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls couldn't seem to believe their ears. The hottest guy they had ever seen... and he wanted to hang out with them?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... won't the team you're on have an unfair advantage?\" the raccoon nervously chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled under his breath again, making a point of rubbing his hulking biceps a bit. Even he couldn't fully believe this was really happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it... I'll go easy, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the teams were set and the game was on. On one side was the panther, the rabbit, the vixen, and the raccoon. One the other side were the two tigresses, the poodle, and Hunter. Hunter figured that they had put all of the worse players on his team... not like it really mattered to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the match started, even Hunter was a bit amazed at the skill he was showing off. He was going easy on them, like he had promised, but he still felt like a pro player out there on the court. He had barely even picked up a volleyball before that day, and yet the whole thing felt instinctual to him... like there was a computer in his brain telling him when to jump, where to hit the ball, how hard... and the girls were more than happy to feed him the ball to see his glorious muscles in action, his beautifully long hair blowing in the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point, one of the tigresses hit the ball up in the air, but messed up, sending it way off to the side. Acting incredibly quickly, Hunter sprinted off after it, moving with record-breaking speed. He jumped up nearly ten feet in the air, did a double flip, and hit the ball in a bicycle kick to send it at the perfect angle to spike into the sand on the other side of the net. Hunter landed on his feet, his muscles bulging only a little from his nearly supernatural accomplishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the girls on his side basically dogpiled him, though with his amazing strength, Hunter didn't even budge an inch. Still, he grinned, showing off his pristinely white and sharp teeth as the three lovely ladies basically groped him all over. The other team basically had their jaws on the ground, in disbelief over what they had just seen. Hunter was simply unreal.</span></div></div>",

He spotted his stepfather in his usual spot, sitting on his worn out recliner watching TV, a bag of chips on his large gut and a beer in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dad,\" Hunter said, noting his slightly lower voice as he closed the door behind him. He then readied himself for his stepfather to yell at him to wash the dishes or mow the lawn or some other hard chore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's stepfather turned towards him. \"Hello Hunter,\" he said, actually smiling a bit, which he never did before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was a little confused, but he quickly caught on. \"Well, I have a lot of homework to do, so.... uh, bye,\" Hunter said awkwardly, still not used to his stepfather treating him this nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. You can go out with your friends once you're finished if you like,\" Hunter's stepfather said before turning back to the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was beaming with happiness. His stepdad rarely ever let him go out with his friends, especially on a school night. Hunter thought that it might be because he was too intimidated by Hunter's muscles, but Hunter didn't really care, as long as he was treated well now. \"Thanks!\" Hunter said before walking to his room to start his homework.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as Hunter opened the door to his room, he received a big shock.

Bench presses, dumbells, and almost every type of workout machine was in Hunter's room, and it all looked brand new. Looking closer, Hunter was surprised at how heavy the weights were, even with his new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were also pictures of Hunter with other muscular teenagers. There were pictures of him at competitions, gyms, beaches, and other places, always surrounded by other bodybuilders. Even though some looked 5 years older than Hunter, Hunter's body outclassed all of them by far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there were the awards. There were more medals, trophies, and plaques than Hunter could count. But there was one especially big one in a large glass case. It was a gold trophy about as tall as a regular person with a flexing muscular figure on the top. Hunter got closer and read the inscription on the base of the trophy - \"JUNIOR BODYBUILDING WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS - 1st PLACE - FELINE DIVISION\". Even though Hunter couldn't remember the event, he still felt honored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter suddenly jumped up as his stepfather's gruff voice called him from the living room. \"Hunter!

Eagerness and curiosity overcoming him, Hunter tore open the envelope to read the letter inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe letter turned out to be an invitation to a bodybuilding competition. It was taking place in a couple of days in a nearby convention center. But what really caught Hunter's eye was the prize. The prizes included a sponsorship from a major company, becoming a professional bodybuilder, and a boatload of cash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was excited. He had a chance to go pro! He could just imagine himself hanging out with all of the large competitors, laughing and talking about their exercises. Hunter thought that would be one of the best things ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Hunter quickly ran over to his exercise equipment and began ferociously pumping heavy dumbbells, determined to get himself in the best shape possible for the competition...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day had finally arrived and Hunter was energetic and confident as he walked to the competitors' area.

He was wearing an extremely tight posing Speedo, ready to show off his muscles to the fullest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter signed in at a desk before going to the competitor's lounge, where the other bodybuilders were waiting for the competition to begin. Scanning to crowd, Hunter was slightly shocked to see that he wasn't the biggest person there. There were a fair amount of competitors who seemed to have more muscle mass than him, leaving Hunter somewhere in the middle on the scale of musculature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was a bit dismayed at this revelation when suddenly he remembered his godly powers. He could just make himself the biggest one there! Hunter quickly ran into the nearest restroom to carry out his plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hunter checked to make sure that no one else was there, he had to think about how big to make himself. Should he go all out, or would just a little growth do? Finally, Hunter stood in the middle of the bathroom, having made up his mind. Hunter made it so that he was...</span></div></div>",

So, he decided to grow a little bigger than the 6 foot 5 dragon he saw earlier. Hunter concentrated really hard and before he knew it, he was feeling the familiar warmth in his muscles from before. He grinned as he saw his arms and legs doubling in size. He also noticed he was getting another 2 pack on his chest. Along with his muscle mass, his height increased to 6 foot 7. Hunter finally relaxed after a tense full 2 minutes of growth.<br>\r\nHunter was catching his breath from the stress he put on himself. After such, he admired his new body. He flexed his right bicep and saw it swell to the size of a basketball with thick veins streaming across it. Hunter then press against his arm to feel it was as hard as iron! He was flabbergasted with the overall results. He was so shocked that he almost overlooked the fact that his speedo was very close to being ripped on the sides. Hunter needed to find a new one fast.<br>\r\nHunter went from amazed to nervous. The competition was going to start in 15 minutes and he was currently wearing a defective speedo. He then remembered seeing a lion competitor put one in his locker shortly after he came in for his growth. Hunter walked over to the lion's locker to take a look. When he stood in front of the locker, Hunter wondered how he was going to get it without the combination. <br>\r\nHunter had an idea. He put his massive hand on the handle and, with little effort, ripped the locker door off the hinges. He was amazed on how strong he became from the growth. Hunter found a navy blue pair of speedos inside the locker. He grabbed them and replaced the damaged one. He was going to put the speedos he found back after the competition. Hopefully, the owner won't notice beforehand. With his newly improved muscles and speedo, Hunter felt like he was ready for what the competition had in store for him. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The hulking bodybuilders didn't seem as intimidating as before, now that he was taller, bigger, and stronger than any of them. In fact, some of the competitors were staring at him, trying to think about their odds of beating him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman sitting at a table called Hunter over and placed a number on his posing speedo. The numbers represented the order that the competitors would go in. Each one would go up on stage and pose for the crowd and judges for one minute. After everyone had finished, the judges would tally up their scores and declare a winner. Hunter would be one of the last bodybuilders to go up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter waited around while the other competitors posed. A few minutes before he went on, Hunter froze up as he made a realization... he had no idea what to do! He had never been in a competition before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Except then he remembered he had. Thanks to his powers, Hunter had competed in dozens of competitions before. He concentrated as images flowed into his mind. All of the different poses, Hunter's favorite poses, his routine order... it was all clearly laid out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was snapped out of his thoughts as his number was called to the stage. He walked with a brisk, confident stride, showing that he knew what he was doing and wasn't scared of losing. He strode onstage and turned towards the audience, the sheer number not fazing him one bit. He began his routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only a minute, Hunter had to move quickly. He flexed each muscle in different ways, grinning as the powerful veins popped up and the crowd gasped at the sheer size of the feline beast. As time began to run out, Hunter knew he had to pull out his best pose to ensure his victory. He took a deep breath, then, with a mighty grunt, began to flex all of his muscles at once. He seemed to hulk out even more as the audience members looked on in awe. His biceps seemed to be even larger than before, and his calves were even straining up against his new speedo. He felt incredibly powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, time ran out, and Hunter stopped flexing and stood on the stage, panting with exhaustion but still beaming. The crowd cheered wildly and even gave him a standing ovation. For the first time, Hunter scanned the faces in the crowd. As he looked at the front row, he saw something that amazed him. It was his stepfather, clapping wildly and cheering for his stepson, beaming with pride. Hunter's old stepfather never supported him in anything, but now he was here during one of the greatest moment's in Hunter's life. The changes really were making his life better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter exited the stage and went back to the waiting area, where other competitors were waiting to congratulate him. After shaking a lot of hands and accepting a lot of congratulations, Hunter sat down and watched the last couple of competitors. They were good, but they weren't anything close to him, and they were obviously having trouble following up on his stellar performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the last of the competitors finished their routines and the competitors all gathered in a special section in front of the stage while the judges tallied up their scores. The waiting time was agonizing, as everyone knew that a chance at a pro career was on the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short wait that seemed like forever to Hunter, the head judge walked up to the stage to announce the winners. Third place went to the lion whose speedo you borrowed before the competition. He seemed disappointed that he only placed third and missed out on the opportunity of a life time, but he still looked pleased as he accepted his prize. Second place went to the dragon who was the biggest there before Hunter grew bigger. He kept a cool, confident look as he walked up onto stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was the moment everyone had been waiting for: the announcement of the winner. The head judge opened a sealed envelope and unfolded the paper inside to read the name on it. The judge cleared his throat in the microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the winner is... Hunter!\" he exclaimed as the audience burst into applause. Hunter was so happy he nearly sprinter up onto the stage. He shook the head judge's hand as he claimed his prizes: the ability to participate in professional bodybuilding competitions, thousands of dollars in cash, brand new gym equipment, and a lot more. At 13 years old, Hunter was the youngest professional bodybuilder in history, and yet he was still being counted as a favorite for upcoming major events, even Mr. Furlympia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the crowd departed, Hunter stayed on the stage to pose for pictures by himself and with the other top finishers, as well as be interviewed by several reporters. After all of that was over, Hunter stepped off of the stage and went back to the now empty waiting area. That's when he remembered he needed to return his speedo to the lion's locker. Not wanting the lion to know about it, he sprinted into the room and locked the door. He stripped off the speedo and threw it back into the locker. He then put back on his street clothes, a white tank top and shorts, making them grow a little bit to accommodate his new bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Hunter walked out of the room, satisfied from the long day. He walked down the hallways, making his way back into the waiting area, once there, he saw standing there waiting for him: </span></div></div>",

Hunter wasn't used to seeing his father like this but he enjoyed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's my champion!\" Hunter's stepdad yelled out as he patted his stepson on the back. Hunter began grinning too, remembering his recent win and feeling good about being recognized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and his stepfather walked out into the parking lot together. The competition was long over and most of the reporters had left, but Hunter still saw an occasional flash of a camera trying to get a glimpse. Almost subconciously, Hunter began to flex a little as he walked while he listened to his stepdad praise him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing! It was probably your best performance yet! Those pros better watch out,\" his stepfather said, adding in a little laugh at the end. Hunter chuckled a little too. He couldn't remember having a better conversation with his stepdad in his entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two climbed into their pickup truck, though Hunter had a bit of a hard time squeezing through the small door frame. Eventually, they were both seated in the car and were driving back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and his stepdad chatted more in the truck. They discussed Hunter's performance, joked a little and talked about what they would do with the prize money. There was a small silence after the end of a conversation topic, and Hunter's stepfather's voice became more stern and solemn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Hunter, your parents would be really proud of you if they could... be here,\" he said, even tearing up a bit if Hunter was seeing correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was pretty amazed. This was the first time his stepdad had brought up his parents, and it was really touching. It was the final straw that made Hunter really love the new version of his stepfather. He was kind, supportive, and really loved Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter looked over his stepdad. He had a sort of grimy look to him and a large gut hanging out of his shirt. He didn't have a lot of money or friends, even with a bodybuilder for a stepson. It saddened Hunter that such a nice guy could be so lonely and miserable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter decided to use his powers for someone other than himself. He wanted to do something for his stepfather that would make him really happy. After some thought, Hunter decided to use his powers to:</span></div></div>",

Hunter focuses on his guardian and he started grow. The stepdad's gut was shrinking in nothingness and a 6-pack took it's place. His arms grew to the size a giant steel pipe and his legs were growing outside of his pants. Hunter was pleased with the result. Before his stepfather became suspicious, Hunter placed memories in him training and coaching him. He then puts him to sleep on the chair he was on for the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter goes up to his room to get ready for bed. He thinks about what will it be like to have his stepfather as a training coach. Will he be nice or will he be like he was before? Hunter worries about it for a minute but stops due to conclusion he could always \"fix\" him. He strips to his boxers to get ready to sleep in his huge bed. Before he could, he saw the mirror and had to have another posing session. Hunter makes several poses and saw how power ran all over his body. He loved his muscles and his new life. Hunter couldn't believe what happened today. He went from a scrawny 13-year-old to a huge bodybuilding hulk! With many thoughts running in his head, Hunter jumped into his bed and slept like a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Hunter went downstairs to find his new physically and emotionally improved stepdad making a huge breakfast for the both of them. \"Morning Dad.\" said Hunter. \"Good morning Champ!\" says his stepdad still excited about yesterday. \"I made a hearty breakfast to start our celebration day!\" \"What?\" says Hunter.<br>\r\n\"Your pro career doesn't start till a little while so I thought we would have fun and start training tomorrow.\" Says his dad,\" But this is your day.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hunter thought about his dad's offer. Sure, showing off at the beach would be a lot of fun, but there would be other days where he'd get to do that, and he had never gotten to really feel the exhilaration working out would give him. He couldn't wait one more day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't mind, I'd like to start training now,\" Hunter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's dad stood up from the table, still grinning. \"Nice choice! Mr. Furlympia is only a few months away, so we should get started early,\" he said. Apparently, Hunter's wish had given his dad a great passion for training Hunter to be the best. \"We'll go with your regular routine for today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe routine was only regular for Hunter. Just the warm up was daunting, with a 20 mile run set for him! Even Hunter was a bit nervous, but his fears were soon diminished. Though most bodybuilders' muscles were heavy and slow, the fact that Hunter's muscles were divine actually increased his speed, allowing him to go an insane 30 MPH! The run was also helped by his dad riding alongside him in the car yelling out inspirational yet firm cheers. By the end, Hunter was beaming with accomplishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's dad then took him to their backyard, which Hunter immediately noticed had a stack of wood in the middle along with some other objects scattered around. The two muscle tigers walked to the wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's dad pulled out a match, lit it, and dropped it onto the wood. It immediately burned and caused a flame, which quickly spread into a raging blaze. Hunter's dad turned to Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A thousand push-ups over the flame, now,\" he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to question his trainer, Hunter quickly dropped down and started performing the push-ups. He could feel the heat build up and warm his bare chest, making him sweat. However, he was a blur, moving up and down as fast as his arms could pump him (which was very fast). Like the run, Hunter was done in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter had barely stood up before he saw his stepdad dragging over a pull-up bar and placing it over the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we doing pull-ups next?\" Hunter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stepdad shook his head. \"Nope. This isn't for your hands; it's for your feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Hunter knew, he was upside down, blood pumping to his head as he did 1000 vertical sit-ups, once again over the fire. The strain of such a task might severely injure any regular person, but Hunter wasn't a regular person. He finished with ease before doing a back flip and landing perfectly on the grass, something he'd have to look into later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe workout only became more vigorous as time went on. Hunter was instructed to start hitting a punching bag as hard as he could. Within a minute, the punching bag was on the ground with a huge gaping hole in it. Hunter then ran a mile with the family car on his back, along with his dad sitting on top of the car shouting more encouragement. Finally, Hunter ended with an even more superhuman feat: pulling a tree out of the ground and curling it. Even that seemed a little too light!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter finally walked into the house and plopped himself down on the couch, doing his best not to crush it. The thing that surprised him the most was that he wasn't even very tired! Even after all of that, he only felt like he had taken a light jog. He felt more powerful than any creature on the planet, and he probably was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter glanced at the clock. It was still the afternoon, so there was a lot of time left in the day. That also meant that there was a lot of fun left in the day. He could always go to the beach, meet friends, play some video games, and just hang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Hunter really felt like changing reality a bit...</span></div></div>",

He had the body everyone could dream of, finally won approval of his stepdad, and were winning competitions everywhere. As he was thinking, a thought came across his mind: If this was his life now, what would his life be in the future? Hunter went to a mirror to look at his body. He loved it but thought it was pretty big for a 13-year-old. He thought having a good age would match his body greatly. It was decided: Hunter wanted to be older.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter closed his eyes and began to concentrate on altering reality. He thought about becoming 21 years old. That seemed like a good age for him. As he was concentrating, Hunter felt a sense sleepiness coming into his eyes. He had no idea why he was becoming so tired. He was still pumped from the workout! He was eventually consumed with fatigue that he collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he opened his eyes, Hunter thought he was still asleep. He found himself in an incredibly fancy bedroom! The bed was twice his size, the closet to the far left was at least 10 feet wide, and there was a mirror opposite of that. Hunter first thought that he jumped into the life a millionaire even though that was not his wish. Hunter got out of bed with a big thump. He was then compelled to look into the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery step he took to the mirror shook the room slightly. Hunter was flabergasted when he finally came face to face with the mirror. The mirror showed the image of HUGE tiger with boxers that were being pushed by his leg muscles. The stripes on his fur were rippling with muscle from head to toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter first thought this godlike being was somebody but realized that it was him 21 years old! He couldn't believe how big he looked. He was at leat 7'2\" in height and very heavy based on the creakiness of the floor. He also got closer to the mirror to observe his face more. It looked rougher than before and had a handsome goutee on his chin. Hunter couldn't take his eyes off his muscles. he was compelled to make some poses. As he flexed a bicep, it swelled to the size of a tire! He also looked at his chest to find a 10-pack followed by two gigantic pecs. Hunter conintued with more poses and amazed with each result. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Hunter was pleased with his body, he was still confused as to what was with his surroundings. His head was automatically filled with memories starting at the age of 13. He remembered winning the Furlympics bodybuilding competiton 8 times and last night he was the 8th! As for the fancy bedroom, he had enough money to live in a penthouse in the fanciest hotel in the city while his dad still lived in his old house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter conintued posing until he heard a rip. As he looked down he noticed that there were tears on the outer side of his boxers! His leg muscles must have been really strong he thought. Before he could ponder on it further, the doorbell rang.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Upon swinging the door open, Hunter came face-to-face with a large rhino smiling at him. Not just large, but LARGE. The rhino was almost as heavily muscled as Hunter, and almost as tall too at 6' 10\". The ground shook with every step he took, and just looking at him was enough to make anyone except Hunter cower in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Hunter, how's it going?\" the rhino asked, grinning from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter panicked and quickly searched his mind to find out who he was. Apparently, his name was Lance. He and Hunter had met at one of their first junior bodybuilding competitions and their friendship had took off. Lance was an easy-going guy, loving to joke around and have a good time. But that didn't mean he didn't take some things seriously, as he worked out more passionately than anyone else Hunter had met. This led to Lance getting close to Hunter in musculature without divine help. Therefore, while Hunter had gotten 1st at Mr. Furlympia for the past 8 years, Lance had worked his way up and managed to get 2nd this year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lance! Been having fun since yesterday?\" Hunter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance looked down to Hunter's straining, slightly ripped boxers and smirked. \"Well, I certainly see you have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter followed Lance's gaze and blushed. \"Ummm.... I'll be right back,\" Hunter said before dashing into his closet. After a few minutes, he emerged in a camo tank top and black running shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why are you here?\" Hunter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, I can't just come over to hang out with my bro?\" Lance responded. \"But seriously, we just got a gig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Hunter questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were both asked to perform feats of strength in front of a crowd for charity! It'll be awesome!\" Lance said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter couldn't believe it. \"Awesome! High five!\" The two smacked palms with enough force to break bones, though neither of them felt that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance checked his watch. \"Well, we have a little time before the event to hang out, but we could always go early.

Just to make things even better, he has an opportunity to show off his new strength. Hunter was filled with excitement. Although it would've been fun to show off, he really wanted how strong he was now. Hunter was full of excitement and adrenaline. He said to Lance, \"Man, bro, let's do it!\" Both give another bone-shaking high five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, Hunter and Lance made their way to where the event was going to take place and spent the day getting prepared for it. The next thing he knew, Hunter found himself in sport shorts behind a brick wall. He could hear the murmuring of the crowd waiting for him and Lance. But then a booming voice overpowered the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" Said the announcer, \"Thank you very much for your kind donations for this event. It is very heartwarming to know that it is going to support a good cause. So, without further ado, let's start the show! First, our runner-up in the Mr. Furlympia competition, let's give it up for....Lance!\" Hunter heard a loud crash of brick falling out of place and yelling following. \"Now,\" Said the announcer, \"Give it up for Mr. Furlympia: Hunter!\" Hunter closed his hand into a fist and rammed into the brick wall. It automatically shattered and he was greeted by an entire wall full of people with Lance by his side. They both give off poses to get the crowd wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo start off, Hunter and Lance walk towards an I-beam knowing what they have to do. \"Ready?\" Asked Lance. \"Yeah!\" Replies Hunter. Hunter grabs one end while Lance gets the other. On the count of three to each other they both started to pull their end of the beam. It was evenly matched. They pulled with great strength with no trace of fatigue. As they pulled, the center of the I-beam grew thinner and eventually it snapped with each holding one half. Hunter and Lance raise their pieces to the crowd so they could cheer loudly. The loudness doubled when Hunter and Lance bended their halfs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Hunter and Lance walk towards an old building that was begging to be demolished. They both crack their knuckles simultaneously and ran to the foundation of it. They both start punching solid concrete until there was nothing left but dust. Hardly any time at all, the building sank into a cloud of dust. The crowd wondered and began to be concerned for Hunter and Lance's condition. But it was short lived after they both walk out of the cloud and posed for them. The crowd went crazier than the first stunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and Lance then made their way to the most dangerous stunt in the event. They positioned themselves near a giant contruction machine that was hanging a wrecking ball right above them. Hunter and Lance share smirks and raise their hands to the sky. There was a sense of doubt running through the crowd thinking to themselves that there was no way they could do it. Before the crowd could share thoughts, the wrecking ball dropped from its hanging positon and was going to fall right on top of Hunter and Lance! Hunter and Lance still stood their pose despite their confront with death. The crowd couldn't bear to watch the site of Hunter and Lance getting squished but the impact was dull. No disgusting sound followed the impact. As the crowd looked, Hunter and Lance were holding the giant wrecking ball! The crowd went totally insane at this sight! Hunter was a little surprised himself when he saw his and Lance's feet indentations in the ground along with ripples from the impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance turned to Hunter grinning. \"I never get bored of this!\" He exclaimed. Hunter smirks back and says, \"Neither do I.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He truly felt like a god from the audience's attention. The way they looked at him made him feel empowered. Hunter really felt something when a 8-year-old otter came up to him and told him he wanted to be like him. Hunter was touched. He made the little otter feel a bulged bicep and took a picture of the both of them with the otter sitting on Hunter's bicep. Hunter felt really good thinking he was a good example for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter finally sat down in a giant chair behind stage after the audience left. He stretched out his arms and legs to relax. His relaxation came up short when he felt shaking of Lance's feet coming towards him. Lance was already in his street clothes of nothing but sneakers and spandex shorts. \"If I didn't know any better, I'd say they liked you more than me!\" said Lance. Hunter sat up straight. \"Come on, man,\" he says. \"You were great too!\" Lance smiled and slapped Hunter's shoulder. \"I know bro! How can they not!\" Lance pointed to his bare chest showing a firmly shaped 8-pack. \"I thought that otter kid was really cute towards you. He wants to be like you.\" Hunter got embarrassed and told Lance to shut up. Lance's chuckle followed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was really cool.\" said Hunter in a mellow tone. \"Yep,\" said Lance. \"And it's going to get better.\" Hunter turned to him. \"What do you mean?\" he asked. \"There's going to be a party for us with the donors of the event!\" Lance explained. \"It's going to be at the top floor of that fancy hotel! Dude, we gotta be there!\" Hunter was regenerated with energy at the thought. \"Ok, let's go!\" he says. Hunter ran to get his tank top and shorts and met Lance in front of the car they took to get to the event. \"Ready.\" Hunter says to Lance. \"Almost.\" Lance said. Lance grabbed the top of Hunter's shirt and ripped it right in the middle. He then threw the remains to the side. Hunter jaw dropped expressing his confusion. \"You look better without it.\" Lance said laughing at Hunter's face. Hunter looks at his chest and after looking at his abs and pecs he agreed with him. As they drove to the hotel, Hunter told Lance that he owes him a new shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrive at the party and it was packed with people, music, and lights. Hunter didn't know where to start at the party. \"What now?\" Hunter asked Lance. Lance gave him a smile and said, \"Have fun! Look around! Eat! Drink! Meet the ladies!\" A slender dragon girl caught Lance's attention. He turned to Hunter and said, \"You're on your own.\" Lance followed the dragon girl into the crowd. Hunter laughed a bit how Lance went from a rhino to a hound dog. He too went into the crowd to see what he could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter walked a bit with a small sandwich he picked up the food stand. He thought about finding Lance and getting out of there until he saw a beautiful vixen dancing the night away. Hunter was compelled to go to her and before he realized he was right in front of her. \"Hi.\" He said shyly. The vixen stopped dancing to notice the giant that has taken interest in her. She could tell at that moment. She loved muscle guys and she loved how the lights reflected Hunter's muscles. \"Hi,\" she said. \"I'm Trixie.\" \"Nice to meet you.\" Hunter said quickly. \"I'm..\" \"I know who you are Hunter. You were amazing tonight!\" Trixie grabbed Hunter's hand and invited him to dance. With his powers, Hunter could in no time. Hunter was dancing smoothly with Trixie and they both loved it. They finally decided to take a seat together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat next to each other on a long couch. Trixie couldn't stop staring at Hunter's arms but she wanted to know him more. \"So, how long have you been bodybuilding?\" Hunter just smiled and flexed the arm she was staring. \"All my life.\" He said. He sounded confident, but Hunter's heart was pounding out of nervousness. \"May I?\" Asked Hunter pointing at his arm. He nodded. Trixie put both arms on Hunter's bicep and could feel the power sleeping in it. She squeezed it to see it was hard and sculpted nicely. \"Very nice.\" Trixie commented getting shy. They talked friendly towards each other and Hunter made small flexes for her. They both grew to like each other because one couldn't stop smiling at the other.   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After you and finished talking and flexing for Trixie, you told her you had to go find a friend. Before you take off, she holds your meaty right hand, leaving behind a folded piece of paper with her number on it. \"Give me a call sometime handsome.\", she says. She walks off and into the crowd of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Sure thing!\", you yell out. You look at the paper, and then stuff it into your pocket as you walk off as well. You looked around a bit to try and find Lance. It was pretty surprising to see you were taller than almost everyone at the party. Suddenly, the horn of a rhino catches your eye. By the looks of it, it had to be Lance. You immediately walk on, squeezing your way through a couple people just to get by. He looks as if he was talking with someone. Just as you walked up to Lance, the guy Lance was speaking to waved goodbye as he walked away from Lance. \"Hey Lance. How have you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance jumps up a bit once he heard your voice, and then turns around. \"This part is off the hook! Can't believe how successful this party is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Even though it was you who secretly got a couple people to show up. \"So, who was that guy you were just speaking to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance points back with his thumb, \"Oh, that guy? His name's Derek. He told me he's a sponsor and he also owns his own gym.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stroke the fur underneath your chin, \"Interesting. What else were you guys talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said he wanted us to come by for a visit! He's gonna be sponsoring an event too!\", Lance yells with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of event?\", you ask curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's actually gonna be the grand opening of his gym.\" Lance starts doing a few bodybuilding poses, catching a few people's attention as well as he continued to explain, \"He wants us to stop by and help promote his gym. You know! Get people to stop by and start weight training. Just like that kid you impressed earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? That sounds interesting!\" You look around to notice the group of people still applauding even though Lance was finished with his routine. \"I'll do it, but it looks like we've got another group to impress too.\" The crowd starts to cheer louder with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" Lance slyly grins as he turns his head to you, \"You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head in response, \"Heh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, it's almost time for the party to end.\" The crowd started to awe with sadness. \"But, how 'bout me and my good friend Hunter here give you all a quick show before you go!\" The party-goers started to cheer. Lance inches his head in to whisper to you, \"You wanna do this pantsless or are you good the way your are now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look away to think to yourself, then you look back at Lance with a grin as you shrug your shoulders, \"Eh. I've already been pantsless at the competition. So why not?\" Hunter starts slipping off his spandex until he was in nothing but his posing trunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance smirks, \"Heh.\" He does the same thing as well. He's tosses his pants to the side and then tenses his arms downward in front of his chest, \"Alright people, step back. We may need some space here.\" The crowd backs away as they cheer for the both of them. Lance starts by doing the first pose, doing a double-bicep flex with his fists pointing away from him. You then do your first pose, bending your knees a bit as you stood sideways in front of the crowd and flexed up your left arm and tensed up your left leg. Lance then folds his large arms behind his head to flex out as much of his chest and abdomen as he could. Hunter then does his next pose, facing away from the crowd to spread out his massive back and lats. Hunter can hear the crowd cheering on for him, which makes him smile. He looks over to Lance, then realizing he was in the same pose as him. Only Lance was spreading out his back more than you were, as well as flexing his legs. This got your attention as you started to think to yourself. You make yourself bigger without anyone noticing, but then, you just decide to shrug it off. Just let Lance have his moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around to flex out both your arms in front of your chest. Lance turns around to do the same thing, only you were just bending and tensing your arms, while he was flexing and pumping them with all his might. This made his arms a tad larger than yours in comparison as well. For your last pose, you went ahead and knelt down on your left knee while holding out your right leg and raised up both your arms. Lance syncs his pose with yours as well, only he positioned yourself in front of you. You were already a little bigger when compared to him, but were still just tensing the muscles in your body while he actually flexed them all. The crowd cheered on some more, more of the cheering being sent on to Lance. After your last pose, you both stood up. You were a bit sweaty, but Lance was sweating all over. You place a hand on Lance's shoulder and gave him a thumbs up, \"Way ta go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance smiles at you, and then turns to the crowd. \"Alright everyone, it's time for you to go. If you want to see us again, just stop by tomorrow at the grand opening of Pegasus Gym.\" The crowd gave one more cheer for the both of you as they were disbanding and leaving at the front entrance. Lance sets his hands on his hips, \"Well, looks like we've got a lot of cleaning to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lance walked off, you realized there was still one person there from the party. It turned out to be Trixie. She walked up in front of you, checking out your naked body and then looking back up to you. \"Wow... Just wow! You were amazing out there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Oh, thanks\", you say as you began scratching the back of your head. You were also looking away while trying not to blush. \"So, I guess you're gonna be there tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie chuckles a bit, \"Heheh. If I'm not busy tomorrow.\" She looks down to your legs, chuckling again, \"Heh. I knew your pants weren't big at all! It was just the muscles in your legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin at her, and then you hold out your right leg and gave both legs a good flex. They both rippled with great power. \"Thanks. You're lucky to get an up close view.\", you say with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie feels your right flexed leg in return. \"My... Heh. Well, I, better get going.\" Trixie starts to walk off, she then turns back to you before head out the door. \"Oh and, thanks for the show.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was hard for Hunter to sleep that night. With the party and gym opening in his head, Hunter barely slept because he was too excited. The next morning, he and Lance followed the address to the gym Lance was given by the owner. When they arrived, they found the \"The Pegasus Gym\" ginormous! It was three story building with balloon arches over the path towards the entrance and twin statues of winged horses by each side of the doors. Hunter and Lance stood in awe of the place. They had no idea the gym was going to be this big. It was the biggest one they have ever seen! Hunter turned to Lance. \"You didn't tell me it was THIS big!' He told him. Lance just stood there as if he was facing the gates of Heaven. \"I didn't know.\" He simply said. Lance pumped his arms failing to hold on to his enthusiasm and grabbed Hunter's shoulder. \"Let's go!\" Lance yelled. He practically ran while dragging Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance and Hunter went through the door and found the front desk center. The room had a series of doors that led to different areas of the gym. One led to a weightlifting room while another led downstairs to an underground pool. The sign in desk was at the dead center. Hunter was impressed. \"This looks really cool!\" He said. \"Glad you think so!\" a mysterious voice said coming from an \"Employees only\" room. The voice came from a lean yet muscular bear. \"Mike!\" Lance yelled to him. The bear responded, \"Hey Lance! Glad you all could make it!\" He pointed to Hunter. \"You Hunter?\" He asked. \"Yes,\" Hunter replied, \"Nice to meet you.\" \"You too! I'm Mike, the owner of the new 'Pegasus Gym'! Thank you so much for helping me out with the grand opening. With you guys around, I'll bound to get customers!\" Lance just flexed a bicep and said, \"Happy to help people get in shape!\" Hunter really wanted to roll his eyes for how Lance was acting but he couldn't blame him. The guy was excited, more than usual. Lance was ready to get started. He clapped his hands and asked Mike when do they start. Mike had a great idea for Lance and Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening time was getting closer and new customers were coming to wait for the doors to open. People of all shapes and sizes appeared, even some people from the party. The customers were ready and so were Mike, Lance, and Hunter. Mike opened the door to welcome the customers outside. \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" Mike began, \"thank you all for coming. I hope you all find this place both useful and fun. I know these guys do!\" Mike got out of the way while Hunter and Lance came out of the building. The customers were stunned by their size and muscles and cheered as Lance and Hunter began posing. Each pose was bolder and more powerful than the last. Lance's bicep grew rippled and veined as Hunter's chest puffed up showing every definition. They were having a blast and the customers enjoyed watching them. Lance suddenly stopped and stepped forward to the crowd. \"If you want to have guns like these,\" Lance yelled to them while flexing his arms downward and emphasizing his arms and chest, \"then come on in and we'll show ya!\" The crowd gave an ultimate cheer of agreement. Mike and Hunter came up next to Lance. \"Without further ado,\" said Mike, \"Let's open!\" Mike then opened the gym door to the public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe customers came in admiring the set up of the first room and starting exploring the room hoping for a good workout. Mike was thrilled with Hunter and Lance. \"You guys were awesome! Thanks again!\" Hunter's liking for the gym grew to the size of Lance's after their performance. \"No problem!\" Hunter told Mike. \"How about you guys get a workout yourself?\" Mike asked them. \"It's on the house! Show our customers how really work out muscles!\" Hunter and Lance smiled at each other like they couldn't agree more.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first floor of the building is basically the weightlifting room. Hunter and Lance were still in their posing shorts as they scoured the room around them. Watching people work out on different kinds of weightlifting equipment. Many of them in different shapes and sizes. There were a few who were nearly as big as Hunter and Lance. Lance sets his hands on his hips, \"Well, where should we start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about you, but I'm gonna start pumpin' my arms.\", you say as you walked past Lance and towards a rack with various sizes of dumbbells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance throws his arm at you, \"Ah you go ahead. I'll be warmin' up my chest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance walks off on his own, and then you chuckle to yourself as you grabbed a pair of 200-pound dumbbells. \"Alright. Try not to get too carried away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should be tellin' you the same thing!\", Lance yells out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin pumping one arm at a time. It wasn't too much to handle, but it was a workout. Your arms started to ripple out pretty well, becoming more pumped. You liked how your arms were feeling as you started to increase the pace of your reps. After pumping your arms a little more, you raise up your left arm in a flexing pose to watch your bicep swell out with a good vein on it. \"Wow!\" You turn your head to your left to notice a slim white-furred and black striped leopard standing beside you in a tank-top and shorts. He was really impressed with how much you've been repping. \"That was awesome! I'm really impressed with how much you can rep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at the leopard, and then grinned after what he said. \"Hey, thanks. Trust me though, you haven't even seen what I'm capable of.\" You continued on with your reps. You noticed the leopard grabbing a pair of dumbbells as well. \"? 40 pounds? Is that it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Oh, yeah.\" The leopard starts repping the same way as you, \"I've been working out for the past two months now actually. But I haven't really gotten anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You planning to get into bodybuilding or weightlifting?\", you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. Nothin' like that. I just want to get big to try to impress this one girl I like.\", he explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter starts doing reps by raising both arms up and down, \"I see. So has your routine been for reaching your goal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leopard continued with his reps, \"Well I've been working out 3 hours a day, 3 days a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask with an eyebrow cocked, \"Is that it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leopard looked at you, but then looked away, \"Well, yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop with your reps as you lower your arms, \"Sounds to me like you're not serious about impressing this girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am!\" The leopard looks away again, \"It's just, working to reach my goal is so hard...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yell in his face, \"Well yeah! No one said it'd be easy! If you wanna get big, you have to REALLY commit to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leopard stares at you for a moment. He then asks, \"Well...then, what would you recommend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter puts the dumbbells back on the rack, and then he sets a hand on his chin as he thinks to himself, \"Hmm... Try going to the gym 5 days a week instead of just 3. Or 4 days, but you must work out more than 3 hours a day if you want to get big as soon as possible. Oh, and feel free to try out a few supplemental drinks too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leopard takes in what you said, \"Wow... I guess it worked out well for you, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flex up both of your arms to show him. And then you flex both your arms downwards with your chest, \"Hnngh! Ya think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leopard blinks his eyes, \"Uh... Heh. Asked a silly question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou part the leopard on his shoulder, \"Remember what I told you.\", you start to walk off, \"And then you'll reach your goal.\"</span></div></div>",

He search the room looking for a challenging workout until he found a hanging bar at the corner of the room. Hunter decided to do some pulls ups. What better workout than to lift his own weight? He got under the bar, reached for it, and began to pull himself up. The pull ups were harder than the dumbbells. Hunter thought about using his powers to make himself stronger to make it easier but he decided not to because he wanted to see how well he can do. Every time Hunter reached his head over the bar, he saw how pumped his arms looked. More veins showed than dumbbells could. Each rep he did burned his arms and it felt really good to him. After several reps, Hunter dropped down sweating with his muscles feeling tingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with his workout, Hunter thought he would check on Lance. He looked around the room until he noticed a small crowd surrounding in a particular spot. He couldn't see what was happening but Hunter knew it had to have been Lance. He slipped through a crowd only to have his jaw drop. Lance was also doing pull ups on a hanging bar but doing so with one hand while holding a 200 lbs dumbbell in the other hand and having heavy weights strapped to both legs. The workout was challenging for Lance, but he showed as much effort as Hunter did with his previous pull ups. \"How is he doing this?\" Hunter thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance dropped down and was congratulated with cheers and handshakes. He loved the attention but Hunter couldn't understand how Lance could perform such a feat. Hunter thought it was his imagination, but Lance looked more muscular and bigger. Hunter came up to him. \"That was awesome!\" He said. Lance slapped Hunter's shoulder and stood next to him. \"Thanks!\" Lance replied. \"That really got me going. I'm going to change clothes and do something else.\" Hunter knew something was up. When they stood side by side, Lance was an inch or two taller than him. Hunter knew he was taller than Lance when they came into the gym. \"I think I'll come too.\" Hunter told Lance. Lance agreed and both headed to the locker rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was empty as Hunter and Lance came in. They showered and changed. As Lance was going out, Hunter stopped him. \"Lance,\" he said, \"Can I ask you something?\" \"Anything bro!\" Lance answered. \"What's up?\" \"I noticed how much bigger you are than me. I could have sworn that I was taller than you.\" Lance grinned and chuckled. \"Come on,\" Lance said, \"Nobody can grow big that fast.\" Hunter felt a sense of doubt crushing his suspicion. All of a sudden, he started to think and believe that Lance was always bigger than him. Hunter knew it wasn't true so he shook it off. The way that thought came into his head was strange. It felt as if Hunter was being brainwashed. Hunter finally understood what was going on with Lance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it now.\" said Hunter. \"You're a god.\" \"What?\" said Lance nervously. \"What are you talking about?\" \"It's okay.\" Hunter used his powers to reach the same size and strength as Lance. Lance was amazed seeing Hunter grow right in front of him. He then knew they had something in common. \"I'm one too.\" Hunter said after he finished growing. After his shock, Lance replaced his nervousness with euphemism. \"This is so cool!\" said Lance. \"I thought I was the only one! I can't believe it! My own bro a god too!\" Hunter was happy too. It was really nice that there was someone who something in common with him. They gave each other high fives and laughed.</span></div></div>",

And I was actually thinking about you a bit myself.\" Lance sets a hand under his chin as he concocted an idea, \"Hmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were only more than willing to ask, \"Hey, I know that look! What's on your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just thinking... Why don't we try out our powers?\", Lance thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mimicked Lance, \"I see.

You wanna lift weights again? I mean, we just showered you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance throws a hand down, \"Nah, not in here.\" Lance whispers to you as he closes in, \"This place is practically child's play for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you whispering?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance backs away, \"Well isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" You take a look around the entire floor you and Lance were in. Taking a closer look at all the gym equipment being used by the gym members and the ones not being used at all. You were actually thinking the same thing since you started with your arm-ups. You sigh, \"Okay, yeah. I guess so. But seriously though, I just showered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance elbows you in the stomach a few times, \"Come on man, you can always shower again. Heck, you can just make yourself clean if you wanted to. Besides, I know a better place that may be worthy of trying out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cock an eyebrow, \"Oh? And what place would that be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance points at one direction with his thumb, \"At the rocky desert just out of town. There are plenty of giant boulders that we can test out and everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?\" You shift a hand at him, \"I'm not really interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance closens up to you, \"Oh. Are you, scared? Afraid I'm gonna whoop you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou back your upper body away a bit, \"Aw come on man. Don't be like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance only inches closer, pumping and flexing both of his arms downward in front of you, \"Afraid these mighty pipes aren't as good as those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on man, I said knock it off.\", you say sounding a little more annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance relaxes his arms and shrugs his shoulders, \"Alright. You know for a god, you sure like to weed out of things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh heavily as you give in, \"Alright, alright! When do we start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can start right now!\" Lance positions himself ready to run, \"Betcha can't beat me there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance quickly runs right out of the gym, getting a head start. \"Hey!\" You quickly dart out of the gym to run after him. It amazes you how fast Lance was running, even though it shouldn't. You and Lance were currently running twice the speed as the cars you were running beside. Lance looks back at you, and the starts gaining more speed, and then darts off like a lightning bolt. \"Oh no you don't!\" You immediately do the same thing. Within a minute you two made it to your destination. You both stood beside each other panting heavily for a bit. \"Just so you know, you only won because I wouldn't have known where you were headed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance catches his breath, \"Heh. Right.\" Lance walks up to a large boulder and places a hand on it. \"Alright, so we'll each start out with a small boulder, and then move on to a bigger one each time to see how much we can take.\" Lance grabs the bottom of the current boulder, and then flexes the muscles all over his upper body, lifting the boulder up and carrying it over his shoulder. Lance turns around to look at you, \"Heh. Piece of cake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis doesn't intimidate you. You just look towards the next bigger boulder and walk up to it. You reach under the boulder with just one hand, \"Grrr...!\" You growled as your bicep flexes up and out to twice its original size, ripping the fabric that once surrounded it into shreds. With one more growl, you manage to lift the boulder up and above your head. You turn towards Lance, \"Top that. !!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile still carrying the boulder from earlier with one arm, Lance goes right ahead and lifts another boulder larger than the one you were currently lifting with his other arm. He now had two large boulders being lifted above his head. With a simple but harder flex of his upper body, Lance manages to tear off his entire shirt into pieces. \"Alright!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph!\" You turn your attention behind you, towards a small cliff made completely of solid rock. You set the boulder down, and then walk over to the cliff. Once you were standing right in front of it, you bend down and jab your fingers underneath. You flex hard, causing the shirt you were wearing to be stretched to its limit as you slowly start to pick the cliff up. You flex even harder, this time making the shirt you were wearing rip apart and pop right off your body. Once you lifted the cliff up to your hips, you quickly speed underneath to get to the center of the mountain. You were basically carrying the cliff on your back now. You growl loudly, using your massive legs to help lift up the cliff with your large back. Suddenly, the lower part of your pants were starting to strain, until your calves were blasted out and rip right out, \"Yeauuugh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance stares at you impressed. \"Wow. This guy ain't kiddin' around.\" He looks to his left to spot another rock cliff that was just as big as yours. He sets the boulders down and runs right towards it. He jabs his fingers in the bottom as well. he flexes hard and manages to carry the cliff up to his abdomen. With a quick jolt, he speeds right under the center also and carries it on his back. He flexes both his legs and his back to aid him in lifting the cliff. Lance's pants were on the verge of ripping apart as well. 'Riiip!' Lance's leg muscles push right out of his pants and rips his pants into shreds. You manage to lift the cliff over his head. \"Haaaugh!\" You and Lance look over to each other. You two then smile, \"Let's just call his a draw.\"</span></div></div>",

Although Lance felt like he could keep going, Hunter suggested it would be best to call it a day while they still had their posing suit on. Lance agreed and he and Hunter decided to chill at Hunter's place. They both collapsed on the couch reflecting on each other's revelation. \"I still can't believe you're a god.\" said Hunter. \"I can't believe you're one too!\" Lance replied. \"How did you find out you were a god?\" Hunter explained how a celestial being came to him when he was thirteen and how he used his powers to make himself muscular. \"What about you?\" Hunter asked Lance. Lance sat up. \"Kinda the same as you.\" He told him. \"I was fifteen when some random rhino guy told me my parents were gods and I had powers. I didn't believe it at first. Before, I was trying to get into shape without making a lot of progress. I wished to myself that I was bigger and I grew immediately! I ran to the bathroom to test it out again and it worked! Ever since then, I got into bodybuilding, competitions, girls, you name it. A few years later, I decided to go into major league bodybuilding and that's when I met you.\" Hunter was intrigued by Lance's story and how similar it was to his. He wondered, \"Do you think there's a reason they told us now?\" Lance shrugged. \"I don't know.\" Lance replied. \"If there is, I'm sure we'll know.\" Lance made a good point so Hunter stopped pondering on the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter sighed. \"What now?\" Lance chuckled. \"I don't know. All this power and nothing to do with it. I guess I'll head over to my place.\" Hunter head perked up with an idea. He came to Lance before he got off the couch. \"Hey man, since we have a lot in common, how about you move in with me? I got more than enough space.\" Lance eyes widened with hope. \"Really?! That's awesome! Thanks!\" <br>\r\n\"But my place only has one bedroom and..\"<br>\r\n\"Say no more!\"<br>\r\nLance snapped his fingers and a door appeared right beside Hunter's bedroom door. \"Let's take a look!\" Lance told Hunter. As Lance opened the door, Hunter was amazed to find a luxurious bedroom with a massive bed, a walk-in closet, some gym equipment, and a personal hot tub! \"I guess you don't need help settling in.\" said Hunter still bewildered. Lance laughed and said he was going to bed. Hunter left Lance's room and headed to his own. Compared to Lance's room, Hunter's room was nothing. However, Hunter liked the room as it was and decided not to redecorate. He simply lied on the bed and relaxed himself to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was awakened by loud laughter behind his wall. It was about time to get up but Hunter preferred to get up without an alarm. Knowing the noise was coming from Lance's room, Hunter went to Lance's door and knocked. Lance yelled behind the door telling Hunter to come in. Hunter came in and found Lance in his hot tub with a wolf girl and a cheetah girl lying their heads against Lance's bare pecs. \"Hunter!\" Lance yelled to him, \"Come on in! Enjoy the ladies' company!\" Hunter was once again bewildered. \"Where did they come from?\" Hunter asked Lance. \"Something I just whipped up on my own. Come on in!\" Hunter thought Lance was crazy but he thought the ladies looked fine. Since he was already in his boxers, Hunter joined the party. When he did, the cheetah girl swam from Lance to Hunter's protective arms. Regardless, Hunter needed to talk to Lance about room rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Lance grew bored and got out. Everyone followed after him. The girls said their thanks and goodbyes and Lance used his powers to disappear. With them gone, Hunter could talk to Lance. \"As much fun as it was Lance, I would appreciate it if you could keep down a bit. I was asleep till you all started. If you are to use your powers, could you be more subtle with them while I'm sleeping?\" Lance at first didn't understand what Hunter was talking about but then he realized he got carried away. The place was Hunter's place too and he need to respect his brother's space. \"You're right dude,\" Lance said. \"I'm sorry. I just got excited with all that happened yesterday.\" Hunter accepted his forgiveness. \"By the way,\" Lance continued, \"I just got a call from Mike. He said he wanted to meet us.\" \"Why?\" Asked Hunter. \"He didn't say.\" \"Better not keep him waiting then.\"</span></div></div>",

It was also before opening hours, so the only people there were Mike and the gym employees. Hunter taps on the glass and Mike was the one to check who it was. Once he spotted you guys, Lance was waving at him and Mike waved back. He immediately opens the door and lets you two in. \"Hey fellas! Glad you could make it! I'd really like to thank you two again for stopping by yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance holds up a hand, \"Hey, no problem. It was a lot of fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what was it you needed us for?\", Hunter asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I just wanted to know if you two wanted to go on a trip?\", Mike asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance jumped at the idea, \"What kind of trip are we talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike holds up two plane tickets, \"Well, a friend of mine said he won two plane tickets to a sunny beach just off of California, but he said he wasn't able to go because he was too busy with work to leave. So he offered to give them to me and I accepted them. But now, being that I currently own one of the hottest gyms in town, I've become too busy to go too. So, I was wondering if you two wanted to go instead? It's for 3 days at a resort and everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shifts a hand at Mike, \"You're too kind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance steps up interrupting him, \"We would love to!\" Lance whispers to Hunter, \"Come on man! It's to a sunny beach resort. Besides, we wouldn't want them to go to waste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, but you knew that once Lance had his mind set on something, there would me a less likely chance of him forgetting about it. \"Alright, we'll take 'em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Mike hands you the tickets, \"It's good to know these tickets won't go waste after all.\" You glance at Lance, thinking he had something to do with what Mike just said. Lance glances at you, but he telekinetically told you he honestly had nothing to do with it. \"The plane leaves tomorrow. So you best be getting ready.\" You and Lance stare at Mike with a pretty surprised look on your faces. Mike scratches the back of his head, \"Guess I, should've told you guys that first, huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, don't worry about it. We can manage.\", Lance assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two thanked Mike for the tickets and decided to stay a bit for a workout. Afterwards, you two went to prepare for tomorrow. It didn't take very long for you two to get ready. Infact all you really did was stuff a couple things into a small backpack. While Lance said he would just teleport his stuff there. Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. You were the one to get up and answer it.</span></div></div>",

Hunter's heart skipped a beat at the surprise. \"Trixie.\" Hunter said with nothing better to say. \"Hi Hunter!\" said Trixie. Hunter let her in. \"What brings you here?\" \"Lance invited me.\" said Trixie. \"He said you wanted to talk to me about something.\" Hunter turned to Lance who was peeking at the edge of the hallway. \"Excuse me.\" said Hunter to Trixie and he walked to Lance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance was still chuckling when Hunter approached him. \"What's the big idea?\" Hunter asked. Lance's laughing subsided and told him, \"Don't get mad but I was thinking maybe Trixie could come with us on our trip.\" What?!\" said Hunter.<br>\r\n\"Look, I can make a third ticket no problem. It's California bro! What girl wouldn't want to go?\"<br>\r\n\"Why her of all people?\"<br>\r\n\"Don't give me that man. I saw how you looked at her at the party. It doesn't have to take a god to see that you two really like each other.\"<br>\r\nHunter blushed. \"Well, yeah I do.\"<br>\r\n\"Then let her come! You two will have a great time! Who knows? Maybe she'll be your goddess.\"<br>\r\nHunter's red cheeks darkened at Lance's slight laughter. \"Shut up!\" Hunter told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter couldn't really think of a comeback for Lance's cupid act. He really liked Trixie and would love it if she could come. So, he walked back to Trixie who was still standing where Hunter left her. \"Sorry about that.\" said Hunter. \"Is everything alright?\" asked Trixie. \"Yeah, yeah everything's fine.\" \"So what's up?\" Hunter was really nervous. What if she said no? He wanted her to go because she wanted to, not because of his powers. Hunter took a deep breath and went for it. \"I hope this isn't too sudden,\" He started. \"But Lance and I are headed to a fun California trip. Would you be interested in coming with us? I'll understand if you can't.\" Trixie gave a smile of excitement and joy. A trip with a nice, big, and strong guy like Hunter, how could she refuse. \"I love to come!\" She exclaimed. \"I'll go and start packing!\" \"Ok, great!\" said Hunter. \"Thank you!\" Trixie came up to Hunter on her toes and pecked him on the cheek. Trixie ran out yelling, \"I'll see you tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter sat on the couch relaxed and happy. She said yes! \"That wasn't so bad now was it?\" said Lance coming towards the couch. Hunter, still embarrassed about what Lance did, said \"Thanks, but next time, let me know when you're going to play cupid. I'm going to pack more.\" As Hunter was walking to his room, Lance yelled to him, \"Just call me the god of love!\" Hunter slammed to door.</span></div></div>",

Hunter and Lance each had one luggage bag that they carried with them, while Trixie was carrying a backpack around her back. Trixie wraps her arms around your large left arm, \"Ooh, I'm so excited! I never got to travel before. Though, I'm also a little afraid of planes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry. I'm sure it's nothing to worry about.\", Hunter assured. \"But not to worry. If something does happen, this strong and muscular tiger'll be there to protect you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tense up the muscles in your left arm as Trixie still had her arms wrapped around it, \"Oh you.\", she said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter overhears a chuckle coming from Lance. Hunter just squints his eyes at Lance, \"Mm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you three made it to the gate, you each handed your tickets to the female hyena flight attendant. \"Thank you. You three have a great trip.\", she said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plane takes off a couple minutes later. You were sitting in the middle of three seats. Trixie sat to your left against the window while Lance sat to your right. Trixie was astounded by how high up the plane was traveling as she stared out the window a couple times. As for Hunter and Lance, they were just on and off having conversations about random stuff. Later on into the trip, Hunter was now busy reading a magazine. Suddenly, Trixie leans her head against Hunter's shoulder. It turns out she was just asleep, using Hunter's large shoulder muscle as a pillow. Seeing her asleep like this puts a smile on Hunter's face. Suddenly, Lance's head leans against Hunter's other shoulder. Hunter turned his head towards Lance, who was also using his other shoulder muscle as a pillow. Only he was drooling. Hunter sighs heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bell rings, and the pilot says, \"Attention everyone, we will be reaching our destination in about 15 minutes. Please remain seated and have your seatbelts kept on until we land. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter starts to wake Trixie up by shifting his shoulder a bit. \"Hey, Trixie.\" Trixie starts to open her eyes. \"We're almost there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie sits up straight, and then stretches a bit. \"Mmm... Already?\" Trixie looks out the window, \"Wow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance suddenly speaks up in his sleep, \"No mama. I don't that dress makes you look fat...zzz...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter starts shaking Lance's head, \"Get off!\"</span></div></div>",

They all heard the traffic, people talking, and ocean waves crashing. Hunter could smell the exhaust from the passing cars but there was a hint of freshness coming from the nearby beaches. Trixie was beside herself. She gasped in excitement and let herself go. \"This place is amazing!\" she said. \"I know!\" yelled Lance. \"I can't wait to see the town!\" Hunter shared their enthusiasm but wanted to take the trip one step at a time. He said to his friends, \"First, we need to find a place to stay.\" Lance smiled at Hunter. \"Don't worry,\" Lance said. \"I got that covered!\" Hunter talked to him telepathically, \"What do you mean you got it covered?\" Lance responded, \"I mean I got it covered! Come on, man. Why not live it well while we're here?\" Hunter knew he couldn't control Lance and he thought it would be nice to have some luxury while they were here. While Hunter and Lance were talking, Trixie called a cab and told them to get in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to Lance's powers, the cab stopped at the nicest hotel in the city. Trixie was amazed that she was going to stay here and gave Lance and hug around his muscular arm. They checked in and made their way to the luxury floor of the hotel. Their room had three bedrooms, a massive couch and tv in the center, and a fine kitchen in the corner. Lance leaped onto the couch with a loud thump. \"Couch's good!\" he exclaimed. Trixie looked into the bedrooms and said, \"the bedrooms look amazing!\" Hunter really liked the room too. It was almost as good as his place. Lance got up and stretched. \"Well,\" he said, \"I'm going to their gym for a workout.\" Lance took off his shirt and Trixie help but admire the rippling abs and pecs on Lance. \"You two have fun!\" Lance went out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter sat on the couch and Trixie followed him. Trixie gave Hunter a hug around his abs. \"Thank you so much for taking me. This is going to be fun.\" \"No problem.\" said Hunter shyly as Trixie ran her hand on his abs. \"I'm just glad you could come. I think we should take it easy today and start looking around tomorrow.\" Trixie agreed. \"I'm going to take a nap.\" said Trixie. \"How about you join Lance in the gym.\" Hunter nodded and waved goodbye to Trixie. Trixie closed her door while Hunter went out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he made his way to the gym, Hunter found Lance doing ridiculous feats with weights and went up to him. Lance noticed him. \"So did you kiss her?\" asked Lance. Hunter blushed. \"No! I told her we should take it easy today and start exploring tomorrow.\" Lance stopped working out and looked towards Hunter. \"Come on, man! Talk to her! You're a big strong tiger god! Surely you can talk to a girl!\" Hunter fell deeper into embarrassment. \"I can't, ok? I get all nervous and don't what to do! She's not like the girls I flex for; she's different!\" Lance just smiled. \"When the time comes, tell her what you just told me. Anyway, I'm calling it a day. You go ahead and workout if you want.\" Lance left the room with an embarrassed and confused Hunter. Hunter just sighed and started working out, hoping it will distract him for a while. Hunter was thinking that Lance was right. If he really liked Trixie, he needed to talk to her. Maybe he can try tomorrow, he thought.</span></div></div>",

He's currently doing arm raises with a 250-pound dumbbell with his right arm while he rested his left hand and leg on a benching equipment. Upon doing his tenth rep, his head turned towards a window in the gym. Out on the other side was the beach. His workout didn't tire him much, so relaxing on the beach should be just fine. Outside, the sun was glaring from above over the many beach-goers. Hunter was one of them, as he sat on the sand with an arm resting on his knees. The cool air was blowing against his fur as he stared straight towards the ocean. He still couldn't stop thinking about what he said earlier to Lance. And about him and Trixie. \"Why is it so hard for me to just tell her how I feel?\", he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Hunter sees a rather large wave forming just ahead. He blinks in response, \"!\" The wave was pretty big, but what really caught his attention was what was surfing on the top. He raises his hand over his eyes as he takes a closer look. The person surfing turned out to be a white-horned dragon with blue scales all over and only wearing a pair of dark-blue shorts. As the wave was descending he performed a few interesting moves, which started to attract a small group of people's attention. As the dragon headed towards the sand, he jumped off his surfboard to land on the sand on his own two feet. He was soon greeted by a small group of people. They were telling him how great he was back there and applauded him for his moves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thanked everyone for their kind words, and then told them he had to get going. He walked off from the group as they disbanded with his surfboard in his left arm. As he was walking off, he just happen to be walking in Hunter's direction. As he walked up closer and closer, Hunter got a good view of how big and muscular the dragon really was. \"!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon stops to look down at Hunter, \"Hm?\" Hunter couldn't believe it. He was almost as big as him. The dragon greets you with a smile, \"Hi there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter blinks, \"Uh, hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon plants his surfboard on the sand. \"The name's Troy.\" He scratches the side of his head a bit, \"Heh. Sorry if I'm bothering you. I'm always happy to meet a guy with a well-built body like yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" Hunter grins, \"Heh. No. It's quite alright.\"</span></div></div>",

The girls must really like you!\" Hunter chuckled shyly and said, \"Yeah, you'd think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy gave a puzzling look to Hunter. \"What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n\"Never mind, I don't want to put it out on you.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it! Come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter let out a big sigh, thinking Troy wouldn't leave him alone unless he told him. Hunter began, \"Well, there's this one girl that I really like, but I think she only likes me for my muscles. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I kinda want to know her more but I just can't talk to her!\" Troy chuckled out the side of his mouth. \"Who would've thought that big tiger like you would be afraid of talking to a girl.\" Hunter began to get up and leave until Troy grabbed him by the arm. \"Come on, man. I was just kidding.\" Hunter sat back down. Troy thought for a minute to come up with advice. \"Listen, if Trixie really likes muscle guys, why don't you try charming her by doing something cool? When you do, there won't too much pressure and she'll already think you're cool!\" Hunter thought that made sense. If he used his powers, may he could get her attention and try talking to her. \"I guess that makes sense.\" said Hunter. He then paused. \"Wait a minute, I never told you the girl's name. How did you know her name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy said \"oops\" in his head and put his hands on Hunter's shoulder. \"Ok, ok, Lance asked me to talk to you about your girl problems. Believe it or not, I'm popular with the ladies!\" Hunter was surprised to hear this. \"How do you know Lance?\" Hunter asked. \"We just got here today.\" At that moment, Troy flexed and tensed his muscles. Hunter's eyes and mouth widened as Troy's muscles grew, stretched, and thickened to Hunter's size. Troy stopped growing and said smiling, \"I'm a god too!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Hunter exclaimed. \"Lance knows other gods besides me?!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Lance and I met at a surfing contest a few years ago. We grew suspicious of each other after we tied for first place. Been buds ever since.\"<br>\r\n\"Seriously?!\"<br>\r\n\"Yep!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm going to have a long talk with him!\"<br>\r\n\"Don't go too hard on him. He means well.\"<br>\r\n\"I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter cooled down a little bit from the surprise and took a deep breath. Troy got up to stare into the ocean. \"Besides the surprise, think you can use my advice?\" Hunter nodded. \"Good. I gotta go. Listen, if you need me or just want to hang out, let me know.\" Troy then ran into the ocean with his surfboard and caught a wave he created. Hunter just watched as Troy surfed into the nothingness of water. Hunter had enough surprises for the day so he made his back to the room and crashed for the night. Before he went to sleep, Hunter planned to talk to Trixie in the morning, starting by doing something that will catch her attention. Before he could think what that something was, Hunter fell asleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He slowly sits up in bed, and that's when he feels something on his abs. It turned out to be Trixie's right hand. She was still sound asleep. You stared at her for a moment, but couldn't help but put on a warm smile at her as well. You slowly shift a large paw through Trixie's hair, when all of a sudden, the door of your guys' room slams wide open, scaring both of you wide awake. It turned out to be Lance. \"Hey you two! Let's get going! We're gonna go walkin' around the town!\" Both Hunter and Trixie stare smugly at Lance. \"... Eh...I'll, wait outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance closes the door shut as a pillow was thrown at the door. The pillow was thrown by Hunter. Hunter sighs, and says as he scratches the side of his head, \"Eh-heh... Sorry about my friend. He doesn't seem used to keeping quiet most of the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie began rubbing one of her eyes, \"No. It's okay. I'm actually glad he woke us up anyway. I'm not much of an earlybird myself.\" Trixie looks up at you so that you were staring at each other eye-to-eye. \"Hee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just smile back at Trixie as you both stare at each other for a moment. Lance suddenly knocks on your door, \"Hey! You guys comin' or not!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! We're getting up already!\", Hunter yells out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Hunter, Lance, and Trixie were out and about walking through an outlet mall. You three were just starting to walk on through while Lance had a smoothie to drink. Hunter remembers about what he told himself last night. At this point, he wasn't very sure about Trixie's interests. Other than muscles of course. \"What better place than an outlet mall, huh?\", Lance telepathically tells Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter glances at Lance, and then sighs in his head. \"You know, part of me kinda saw this coming.\", he tells Lance telepathically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, let's stop by here!\", Trixie calls out. Hunter looks at the place Trixie was pointing at. Maybe it's the place to find out more about her interests.</span></div></div>",

Hunter looked intrigued. \"You sure you want to come in here?\" asked Hunter. \"Why not?\" Trixie said. \"Everyone deserves nice clothes. No offense Hunter, but you could use some proper clothes! I like you in your tank tops but you need some more suitable.\" Hunter and Lance looked at each other, shrugging their shoulders in a \"what the heck\" kind of gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie didn't know what to get for Hunter due to his size. Clothing that fits and looks good can be hard to find for muscular people. Although Trixie loved Hunter's muscles, she wanted to see if she could find something that could cover them up or slightly define them. She grabbed a green polo shirt and Hunter placed it in front of his chest. Trixie thought a polo would be tricky. They were nice shirts but they would emphasize his arms a lot; she wanted him to look a little slimming. She wasn't sure what to do. Trixie dragged Hunter to a fitting room with a series of mirrors around to corner. She stood next to him thinking of what to do. Lance was looking at tank tops meanwhile but knew what was going on thanks to his powers. Lance contacted Hunter telepathically, \"So, she's a fashion expert at heart!\" Hunter responded, \"Yeah, I guess so. She had try on different shirts and pants to see if anything can slim my muscles. We found some pants but nothing for shirts.\" \"Here's your chance, dude! Talk to her!\" \"What should I say?\" \"Anything!\" \"But what?\" It was too late. Lance stopped talking and left Hunter alone with Trixie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie was still thinking while Hunter tried a lot of shirts. \"I just don't know!\" said Trixie. \"I just can't think of slimming clothing. Do you have any ideas?\" Hunter didn't know anything about fashion. He just put on what he thought was comfortable. He thought for a minute and just said, \"What if I wore a second shirt?\" Trixie looked at Hunter closely and widened her eyes and mouth. \"That's it!\" Trixie exclaimed. \"That's perfect! I know just what to do! You stay here while I get some things. You're a genius!\" Trixie ran off and Hunter felt proud of himself, even though he didn't mean to. This could be his chance to get close to Trixie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie came back with some singe colored shirts and plaid buttoned shirts. \"Try these.\" Trixie asked Hunter. After putting them on, Hunter showed himself to Trixie. She thought he looked amazing. She ran to get Lance. When she returned with him, Lance shared her enthusiasm. Hunter had a pair of jeans with a red long sleeved shirt and a blue and green plaid shirt over it. Hunter slightly flexed his arm as a sign of approval. \"I think I look awesome!\" said Hunter. \"Thanks, Trixie.\" Trixie couldn't hold it anymore. She ran up to Hunter and gave him a hug around his abs. \"I can't believe how good you look!\" she said to Hunter. \"Thanks for helping me!\" Hunter smiled and said, \"Thank you.\" Lance knew this was a special moment for them, so he didn't say anything to embarrassing the both of them. </span></div></div>",

I still just can't help it with the way you look.\" Trixie came to a stop, \"Huh? Ooh!\" Trixie ran off.

No one said you have to go inside.\" Hunter and Lance waited in front of the store for about ten minutes. At that time, they both turned their heads to see Trixie walking out of the store with a small bag. Hunter and Lance stood up, \"Hey Trixie. All done?\" Hunter began sniffing something in the air. \"Whoa. You sure smell nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like it?\", Trixie asked. \"I smelt this earlier and just <i>had</i> to try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter sniffs her one more time. \"Hm. Well, it sure makes you smell ravishing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie chuckles a bit, and says as she holds Hunter's hands, \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance was looking away. \"Cheesy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter turns his head to Lance, \"There something you'd like to share with us, Lance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance looks back Hunter, \"Huh? Oh no, no, I was looking at a poster at the food court. But seriously, can we go there? I really am hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright.\" Hunter looks at Trixie, \"That okay with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\", Trixie yells out. \"I can go for some food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you three headed for the food court, Hunter was starting to think to himself some more about Trixie's interests. She seems to be interested in fancy clothing and fancy smelling perfumes. He was also starting to feel, maybe his muscles weren't the biggest part of her interests after all. He thought about talking to her about it, but, then again the food court might not be the best place to do so. \"Hey, mind if I join you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you turn your heads to see who it came from. It was Troy!</span></div></div>",

Hunter didn't mind Troy. He seemed like a decent enough guy, despite his similarity with Lance. \"How about we get some food?\" said Hunter. Everyone nodded and went off to fine lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, Lance, Trixie, and Troy found a table while waiting for their food. Hunter, Lance, and Troy led most of the ongoing conversation while Trixie just sat there. Troy noticed her silence. \"I'm sorry,\" Troy said to Trixie. \"Here we are going on. Tell me Trixie, what do you do for a living?\" Trixie replied shyly, \"I work as an assistant  for a fashion designer.\" \"Really?\" said Hunter, finally understanding her interests. Trixie nodded. \"Yeah, I really enjoy the fashion world. I even have my ideas for a clothing line.\" Troy looked intrigued. \"Do you have a sketchbook?\" Trixie said yes and handed a spiral notebook to Troy. Troy opened the notebook with Lance and Hunter looked over each of his shoulders. Trixie's designs looked very interesting. Most of them were women's clothing with bright colors but there were a few clothing ideas for muscular guys. Obviously, Hunter was her inspiration. \"These look pretty good!\" said Hunter. \"I really like the colors you use.\" Trixie blushed. \"Thanks. I think our food is ready. I'll be right back.\" Trixie left the table leaving the guys with her notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Trixie was out of hearing, Troy huddled with Hunter and Lance. \"I have an idea.\" He told them. \"Let's get her clothing line set up! With our powers, we can make famous!\" Lance, as expected, was excited about the idea while Hunter was reluctant. \"I don't know, guys.\" said Hunter. \"Come on, Hunter!\" said Lance. \"You can only make it through the fashion world by knowing people and Trixie just so happens to know a few gods!\" Hunter made a point. Trixie couldn't achieve her dream unless she knew someone of high status. She was a nobody to fashion people. Hunter sighed. \"Okay, let's do this.\" Lance and Troy gave each other high fives for having a plan. Trixie came back with a tray of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie noticed the high five and a concealed smile on Lance's and Troy's face. \"What's up?\" asked Trixie. \"Well, Trixie,\" Troy began, \"I just so happen to know some designers in the area. I would really like to show your work to them if that's okay with you.\" Trixie simply lit up. \"Seriously?!\" Troy nodded. \"I'll let them know about you and see what they say.\" Trixie came around the table to give Troy a big hug. \"Thank you! Thank you so much! I can't believe this!\" The group enjoyed the rest of their lunch and Troy made his leave shortly after. Hunter, Trixie, and Lance said their goodbyes to Troy. Before Troy left, Hunter asked him with telekinesis, \"Do you really know fashion people?\" Troy gave a thought chuckle and said, \"Not yet.\" Hunter sighed and went back to Trixie and Lance.</span></div></div>",

Let's sit.\" Trixie pointed back at an empty park bench. They both then walked over to the bench and sat on it. Trixie then pulled out her sketchbook and began sketching. Hunter was starting to feel a little awkward since he hasn't actually said anything for time being. \"I can not believe my life so far!!\", Trixie suddenly yells out happily. I met the cutest and handsomest guy, got to travel with him to a sunny place like this, met two of his awesome friends, and my even get my own line of clothing sooner than I thought. It all seems to good to be true!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" Hunter smiled, but then it goes away once he looked away. He says in his head, \"Yeah. But it's really just us three guys who happen to be gods.\" Trixie puts her sketchbook down, and then she wraps her arms around Hunter's large right arm. \"!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie smiles warmly, \"But it's you I love most of all.\" Hunter's eyes widen out a bit. \"If it was for meeting you in the first place, none of this would be happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smiles back at Trixie. \"Heh. !\" He overheard Lance telling him, \"Do it already!

He took a deep breath, expanding and puffing his chest. \"Trixie, I'm really glad I got to meet you. I really do. I hope you feel the same way.\" Hunter paused, trying to collect his thoughts. \"I like being big and strong, but I think found something that I like more.\" Trixie looked confused. She tilted her head up to look at Hunter in the eyes. \"Hunter, what are you trying to say?\" Hunter took another breath, struggling to get those words out. He finally got the words to his mouth. \"I like you, Trixie. I, like, really do. You're nice, smart, passionate, and beautiful. You are much more than that and I want to see more of you.\" Trixie looked a little surprised but Hunter could what looked like a content smirk at the corner of her mouth. \"Well, what do you say?\" asked Hunter. Trixie stood up, got in front of Hunter, and kissed him on the mouth. \"I say, I like you too.\" Trixie said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter looked at Trixie with a smile of joy. He too got up and gave Trixie a hug that literally carried her off her feet. Trixie loved Hunter's hug because she was surrounded by comforting and protective muscles that belong to someone she could lean on. During the moment, Hunter and Trixie heard a repetitive clap in the background. They turned to see Lance clapping with plastic bags filling around his bumpy arms. \"It's about time!\" Lance exclaimed. \"I was just about to give up on you two!\" Trixie blushed and asked Lance, \"Was it that obvious?\" Lance nodded hard. Hunter put Trixie down and they gave one last smooch before resuming reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, Lance, and Trixie decided to head back to their hotel to relax. Trixie went to her room to take a nap, leaving Hunter and Lance on the couch. Lance slapped Hunter on his shoulder. \"You see?! That wasn't so hard!\" Hunter looked back at him. \"You kidding?\" replied Hunter. \"I was completely nervous!\" \"You were fine! Besides, you got a girlfriend out of it!\" Hunter smiled agreeing with Lance. \"By the way,\" continued Lance, \"Troy contacted me. Everything's set for Trixie, but he gave us, including him, a little something.\" \"What's that?\" \"He got us all to model Trixie's larger clothing designs!\" Hunter perked up. \"Say what?\" \"Yeah man! Come on! We'll be in posing in great clothes and great guns!\" Lance, at that moment, put his hands on the collar of his tank top and tore it in half to show off his 8-pack abs and pecs the size of bicycle wheels. Hunter shrugged and said \"I suppose, but was ripping your shirt really necessary?\" Lance made a jokingly made a face as if he was insulted. \"Dude, it's a crime to hide these!\" Lance flexed his chest and arms, growing them to mass proportions and pushing blood and adrenaline in his already showy veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, amused Lance's enthusiasm, asked, \"When do we start?\" \"Troy didn't say. He said he'll let us know when it's time. Until then, maybe you should do something with Trixie huh?\" Hunter blushed and wanted Lance to stop teasing him about Trixie, but Lance had a point. Maybe he should. Hunter put that idea at the corner of his mind until he knew what other plans might emerge.</span></div></div>",

Hunter seemed to be staring at the floor the entire.

Trixie came out in a red silky and sleek dress that shaped her body perfectly. Her hips were slender and chest well shaped. Trixie added a smile to her look. \"How do I look?\" she asked Hunter. Looking at her made Hunter relax more. He couldn't believe how beautiful Trixie looked. She was truly the perfect image of a goddess. \"You..you look amazing!\" said Hunter, \"like an angel!\" Trixie blushed at the compliment. \"So, shall we go?\" Hunter took her hand and made their way to the front door of the hotel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hunter and Trixie were walking down the stairs, Hunter used his powers to make a limo wait for the both of them at the front door. Trixie\u2019s jaw fell to see the fancy limo waiting for her and Hunter to come in. They both got in (the limo was big enough for Hunter to get in no problem). Trixie lost her breath in the luxury. The seats were leather and a cooler of drinks were between her and her hulking date. \u201cThis is amazing, Hunter!\u201d said Trixie. \u201cHow on earth did you afford it?\u201d Hunter shrugged a giant shoulder and said, \u201cI got my ways.\u201d Trixie was suspicious, but the luxury of the limo distracted her mind into their date. She and Hunter were having a great time talking on their way to the restaurant and arrived before they knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA white and finely dressed cat was waiting at the reservation desk as Trixie and Hunter got out of their ride. Hunter didn\u2019t made reservations beforehand, but with a flick of a finger, Hunter and Trixie were on the VIP list. \u201cWe have a reservation,\u201d said Hunter in a deep voice, trying to sound fancy. Trlxie giggled. The cat went through the list. \u201cAh, yes, here you are.\u201d Said the cat. \u201cCome this way.\u201d Hunter and Trixie were led upstairs to a double door. As it opened, the room had tables full of people that seemed important and eating fancy food that looked incredibly expensive (a lot more than they\u2019re worth). The VIP room bordered a glass-doored balcony that gave a remarkable view of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie and Hunter were placed at a table right next to the balcony. Hunter creaked his chair. He blushed as Trixie giggled. \u201cI guess I\u2019m a little too big.\u201d He told Trixie. Trixie grabbed his hand over the table. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d As they were eating, Trixie couldn\u2019t help but stare at Hunter\u2019s muscles. Although his muscles were covered in Hunter\u2019s suit, Trixie could still see their great definition and strength. Hunter began to relax as they were eating. He stopped jittering and muttered while he talked. Both of them were having a great time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, Hunter and Trixie made their way to the balcony to admire the scene and each other\u2019s company. Trixie hugged around Hunter\u2019s arm feeling the pulsing and rippling tendons against her. Hunter enjoyed having a sweet, small, and innocent girl beside him despite his intimidating appearance. \u201cThis night truly was amazing,\u201d said Trixie. Hunter nodded. \u201cIt really is.\u201d Hunter then scooped Trixie off her feet and set her next to his protective chest. Trixie giggled and was met with a romantic kiss. This was the best night they ever had.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After their passionate kiss, Hunter notices Trixie unbuttoning a button on the right wrist part of his suit. She was about to slide his sleeve up over his massive forearm, \"Uh, Trixie? What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie looks up at Hunter, \"!\", she then lowers her head back down a bit while blushing a little, \"Oh. Uh, sorry.\" She looks back up at Hunter, \"I guess I got a little carried away there.\" Hunter still kept staring at her. \"... It's just, whenever I'm with you and your fantastic body...I can't help but feel safe. Plus, feeling and caressing, let alone staring at your large forearm, it...it just feels nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter blinks his eyes, blushing a tiny bit as well. He was happy with what Trixie said about him. He seemed even more happy with the feeling of Trixie's fingers slowly running along the muscles around his forearm. Hunter starts to blush a bit more as he says, \"Actually, I meant what are you doing unbuttoning my sleeve, when you really should be unbuttoning my suit. At least then you'd be able to see more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie's eyes open a bit wider, her cheeks also turning redder. Hunter starts unbuttoning his suit. Once he was finished, he slipped his suit coat off and sets it on the railing of the balcony. Hunter now was in his white shirt coat that was underneath, which he starts unbuttoning next. Hunter starts unbuttoning his white shirt this time. \"You know...you, you really don't have to...\", Trixie adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter slips off this white shirt and tosses it on the railing over his black suit. \"Yeah. I <b>don't</b> have to...\", Now in a tank-top, Hunter walks up to Trixie, wrapping his strong arms around Trixie's sides, \"...but I just wanted to.\", Hunter says with a smile. Trixie stares smiling at Hunter. Hunter smiles back. She then rests her head against Hunter's chest. She could hear Hunter lightly purring right in front of her. Trixie couldn't help but do the same thing, brushing her right hand over Hunter's exposed left arm. Hunter in turn tightened up the muscles in his arm. Trixie's arm was shifting around Hunter's forearm for a bit, and then made its way upon Hunter's large bicep. Hunter than raises his left arm a bit to flex his bicep while Trixie's hand was still caressing it. Hunter blushes a little again, \"So, how does it feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie started to blush as well as she had a firm grasp on Hunter's towering arm and shoulder, \"Honestly...you're...you're built like a tank! A soft, firm tank. You're a real powerhouse, that's for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie starts feeling the puffy part of Hunter's chest with her left hand. Hunter then tenses his chest a bit as he lowered his arms against his sides. He even bounced his pecs a few times, making Trixie chuckle. \"Heh. Is there, a certain part that you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie fingered around Hunter's enormous chest a bit with her left hand while feeling his rock-hard 8-pack with her right. \"... It's...actually kind of hard to choose. I'll just say, that I like every part of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter suddenly tenses up all the muscles on his upper body even more than before. Trixie's eyes widened as she looked up at you. \"If you say so.\", Hunter said proudly. Hunter just kept on tensing and flexing his muscles, making every muscle and tendon in his body ripple and shred with great feeling. Hunter grasps Trixie's left hand with his left hand and places it over his right bicep. He flexes his bicep up and down a few times, making sure she got a great feel of what was underneath. \"Feels nice, doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter flexes his arm once more, flexing his muscles as hard as he could this time. He was even flexing all the muscles on his body in the process. Trixie could even feel a good vein pulsating from underneath his palm as Hunter held his flex. \"Oh my...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter relaxes his muscles a bit as he lets go of Trixie's hand. He takes a step back and then does a double bicep flex for her. \"Nothin' but solid steel.\", he says proudly once again. Hunter's tank-top seemed to be getting stretched to its limit. Hunter does one more pose, which was a downward double bicep pose. He flexes hard once more for her, when suddenly, 'RRRIIIP!' his shirt ends up ripping right off of his body. Hunter blushes again, \"Huh. I, actually kinda expected this. Didn't really think this tank-top was a match for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie suddenly walks up to Hunter. Hunter looked down at her as she was wrapping her arms around his large waist and rests her head on his chest. \"I didn't think so either. Still though, thanks for the wonderful show.\"</span></div></div>",

Hunter pawed through Trixie's hair and back; Trixie rubbed her hands up and down Hunter's back, feeling every muscle she could sense. They were lost in each other's emotions until the cat interrupted them. He told them that Hunter's shirtless appearance was distracting the other guests and had to leave. Hunter and Trixie were offended but quickly forgot about it because they were together. They returned to their limo heading for the hotel room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were driving, Hunter and Trixie began to come back to Earth. \"I can't believe that guy kicked us out,\" said Trixie, \"especially during a moment like that!\" \"Don't worry about it,\" responded Hunter flexing his chest. \"They were just jealous!\" They both giggled when the limo swerved suddenly. Trixie screamed. With no other thought, Hunter launched to Trixie, wrapping her in his protective arms until the limo came to a complete halt. \"You okay?\" asked Hunter. Trixie, still shocked, nodded. \"What in the world happened?\" He asked. Hunter got out of the car, Trixie right behind him. The limo's hood was smoking right in front of a dented road rail. They waded to the end of their ride to find the back right tire shredded. \"A flat?\" said Trixie. \"How did that happen?\" Hunter had no idea but he was freaking out on the inside. His date was going along perfectly until this happened. It just had to happen on a perfect night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do now?\" asked Trixie. \"Nobody else is on the road and if we wait traffic will back up because of this!\" Hunter smirked to himself. This night was just about to get even better. \"I got an idea,\" said Hunter. \"Stand back.\" Trixie did as she was told as Hunter squatted to the side of the car and placed his hands under it. Trixie knew what Hunter was trying to do. \"Hunter, I know you're strong and all but I don't think...\" The car began to squeak. Hunter's arms swelled and rippled more than ever before; it was as if his strength was trying to jump out of his fur. With all his strength (and a little bit of his powers), Hunter raised the limo over his head. Trixie was amazed! Her boyfriend could lift a limo as if it was a toy! Her emotions became a mix of pride and passion. Hunter charmed her even more by letting one hand go to flex a bicep. \"Where should I put this?\" Hunter asked Trixie with a smile. Trixie spotted and pointed to an opening in the rail leading to a pack of gravel. Hunter effortlessly carried the limo to the patch and let go with a loud thump. Hunter was circling his shoulders relieving the stress while Trixie wrapped herself in his abs. \"That was amazing!\" Hunter blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and Trixie turned to see a small and deserted beach just below the road. Trixie bent over to remove her shoes and tore off the end of her dress to give her more room to move her legs. Hunter looked at her puzzled. \"You wanna take a closer look at the beach?\" Without answering, Hunter also took off his shoes and ripped the legs of his pants, revealing well sculpted calves. They both ran down to the sand. Hunter chased Trixie playfully and scooped her up his arms. He twirled her around as he was laughing joyfully. His muscles may have been hard, but they were comforting to Trixie. Trixie then got on Hunter's back for a piggy-back ride and Hunter ran as fast as he could. The wind blew Trixie's fine hair to ruins but she didn't care. After a while, Hunter sat down with Trixie on his meaty chest. Trixie was soothed by Hunter's pounding heart, which was still pumping from the lifting and playing. \"That was amazing.\" Trixie said smoothly. \"You really know how to make fun dates!\" Hunter at this point was full of passion for Trixie. \"It was my pleasure.\" said Hunter. \"I just really wanted to make you happy.\" They then tilted their heads to each other and kissed as the waves of the ocean were crashing.</span></div></div>",

Trixie loved the feeling of Hunter's tight chest heaving up and down with each breath he took. She also rests her left hand on Hunter's right bicep, slowly shifting it up and down a bit. Hunter smirks a bit, pumping his bicep under her palm in return. All of a sudden, a fairly large wave washes up on shore, soaking up Hunter and Trixie both. Trixie sits up on Hunter's stomach to shake her hair dry while Hunter spits out some water from his mouth. Trixie gets up on her feet, \"Well, that kinda stunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter sits up, \"Heh. Probably shouldn't have lied so close to the water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice calls out, \"Hey! Hunter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and Trixie look behind them. The person who yelled out turned out to be Lance, who was waving an arm at them as he and Troy were walking their way. Trixie waves back to them, \"Oh! Hey Lance! Hey Troy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter gets up, \"He-hey you guys.

When all of a sudden, this guy stops me in my tracks to challenge me to a surf off. We surfed for hours, but he still can't get over the fact that I'm just better than him.\", Troy explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, aren't we the narcissistic one.\", Lance added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy points at himself, \"Trust me. I've surfed much longer than you ever have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance shifts a hand at Troy, \"Whatever. So hey, what have you two been up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was told you two were on a date. How romantic!\", Troy added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did! Hunter and I went to dinner, and the food was fantastic. After that, we just decided to stop by here.\", Trixie explained happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uh, what happened to your clothes?\", Lance asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie and Hunter look at each other eye-to-eye, realizing how much less clothed they were. Trixie starts to blush, \"Um... Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter blushes a bit too, scratching the back of his head as he glances away, \"Funny story...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, nevermind.\", Troy interrupted. \"Anyways, it's nice to see you two had fun.\" Troy does a bit of stretching. \"Well, I'm gonna turn in tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Same time tomorrow?\", Lance asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy starts walking away, \"Oh boy, here we go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Lance follows along, \"I'm just asking for a friendly competitive, weight-involving game tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy and Lance continue playfully fighting at each other as they were walking off. Hunter sighs. \"Man. It seems like those two are a handful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Hunter...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter turns his head towards Trixie, \"Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie walks up to him, holding his large right hand, \"... Thanks again for the wonderful night. Shall we, do it again sometime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter stares at Trixie, and then brightly smiles.

He got dressed in a tight red t-shirt and jeans and made his way to the living room. Hunter saw Trixie's bedroom door was closed; she must still be asleep after a long and pleasant night. Lance and Troy were sitting on the couch talking when Hunter walked in. \"Rise and shine, Romeo!\" said Lance. \"You looked like you were having a good time with Trixie last night!\" Hunter was a little annoyed that Lance and Troy interrupted them at the beach. \"Yeah, key words: were having.\" said Hunter. Troy shrugged the bitter comment. \"Come on, man. You should be thanking us! If it weren't for us, you would not have had Trixie on your chest at the beach to begin with!\" What did Troy mean by that? Anger started stirring in Hunter. \"Wait a sec,\" said Hunter, \"you mean you had something to do with our flat tire?\" Lance nodded and said, \"and the beach. We added that too!\" Hunter walked to the couch and stared them down. \"Are you guys nuts?! We could have gotten killed!\" \"Relax, bro!\" said Lance. \"It was just a flat tire. Besides, I'm sure you would have done something in case something went wrong.\" \"That's not the point!\" Hunter exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance got up and placed a hand on Hunter's shoulder. \"Ok, bro, we're sorry. Come on; let us make it up to you.\" \"How?\" Before Lance and Troy could answer, they and Hunter noticed their surroundings disappeared without warning. They found themselves in a plain and deserted white area. \u201cWhat did you guys do?\u201d \u201cWe didn\u2019t anything; I swear!\u201d exclaimed Lance. \u201cHe\u2019s right.\u201d Said a cloaked figure who appeared out of nowhere. He took off his hood and Hunter recognized him instantly: it was the tiger person who told Hunter he was a god in the first place. \u201cYou all have been summoned by the request of the tiger deities, Hunter\u2019s parents.\u201d Hunter\u2019s heart sunk to his back, making his spine shiver. \u201cWhat?\u201d replied Hunter. \u201cMy mom and dad want to us?\u201d The servant nodded. \u201cI will take you to them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white limbo area took the shape of a luxurious throne room. Walls and columns were encrusted with gold and fine jewels. Right in front of Hunter, Lance, and Troy were a male and female tiger dressed as royalty. \u201cMom?\u201d Hunter, still figuring out what\u2019s happening, \u201cDad?\u201d \u201cHello, Hunter.\u201d Said Hunter\u2019s mother. \u201cIt\u2019s very good to see you.\u201d \u201cYou certainly have grown.\u201d Said Hunter\u2019s dad. \u201cWith those muscles, you look like a god.\u201d Hunter blushed and was grabbed by the shoulder. \u201cI taught him everything he needed to know to stay in shape!\u201d exclaimed Lance. Hunter\u2019s parents didn\u2019t believe Lance, but they acknowledge his comment with a nod. \u201cSon, Lance, Troy,\u201d began Hunter\u2019s dad, \u201cWe need your help with something.\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d said Hunter, \u201cAnything.\u201d He literally meant anything. After seeing his parents for the very first time, Hunter was willing to do anything for them. He was so joyful to see a reflection of himself right in front of him. \u201cBefore we tell you, there is something you should know, Hunter.\u201d Said Hunter\u2019s mom. \u201cYou have a brother.\u201d Hunter felt like dropping to the floor but resisted. \u201cI-I have a brother?!\u201d Lance and Troy looked surprised by this fact. Hunter never mentioned a brother. \u201cYes.\u201d Said Hunter\u2019s dad. \u201cHe is your little brother. His name is Zack. He does not know he is a god. We would like the three of you to approach Zack, tell him of his heritage, and watch over him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter felt a ton of pressure falling on him every second. His parents want him and his friends to take care of a brother he never knew he had! How was he suppose to do that? Hunter asked, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you let your servant approach him like he did with me?\u201d Hunter\u2019s parents stared down to floor as if they were ashamed. His mother answered, \u201cZack is more \u2018troubled\u2019 than you are. Our servant approached you because we knew you could handle it. It may not be the same case for Zack.\u201d \u201cWe fear he may discover his powers too soon and abuses them.\u201d Said Hunter\u2019s dad. \u201cPlease, talking to someone similar to him may help him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was still absorbing it all. How was he suppose to take care of kid? He was always by himself until he became a god. Before he said anything, Troy interrupted, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it! We\u2019ll find him and lead him on the right path! You can count on us!\u201d Hunter\u2019s parents thanked Troy and looked at Hunter. \u201cWill you help us, son?\u201d asked his mom. \u201cYes.\u201d Hunter responded reluctantly. \u201cThank you.\u201d She said. \u201cYou\u2019re dismissed.\u201d Hunter, Lance, and Troy saw the throne room melt away with their room on Earth showing underneath. They were right back where they started. \u201cSo,\u201d began Lance, \u201cWhere is this long lost brother of yours?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Is that alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" Hunter thought about it for a moment, but this actually seems like a good thing. He, Lance, and Troy'll probably be gone for a while too. Hunter smiles at her, \"Yeah. That's alright. You have fun.\" Trixie smiles back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple minutes later, with the help of Herman and their powers, they found themselves walking along a pretty clean and sane neighborhood. The three were just walking by the gated community, watching kids run around and play on the streets, parents and their kids playing in a large pool area, and a park that was populated by kids and parents having fun and just lying around together. \"This place seems nice.\", Lance replies. \"Maybe I should get a place here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!!\", Hunter and Troy yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though, about what you said...\", Hunter added, \"...this place <i>is</i> nice. I'd find it hard to believe Zack would be a troubled guy coming from these surroundings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack, hasn't been having as good a life as your parents had hoped. Your parents felt meeting him and telling him about his powers will make his life, a little more manageable.\", Herman explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say we should get to know the kid first.\", Troy suggested. \"If he does sound, bad, I wouldn't want him abusing his powers once we tell him either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here.\", Herman says. The three turn their heads towards a two-story house that lay in front of them. \"He will be able to see me, but I'm not going to reveal myself to him, yet. You three go ahead and...how do you say...'break the ice'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and friends stare blankly at Herman again like before, \"Mm...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hunter, Lance, and Troy walked up to the doorway, Hunter standing at the front. Hunter goes ahead and rings the doorbell, then looks behind him to see Herman standing at a safe distance away from them. The three wait patiently for a moment, but no answer. Hunter rings the doorbell again, then waits patiently. Suddenly, Hunter turns back to Lance and Troy, \"Just promise you two won't change anything about him once we meet him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, he's a god. He just doesn't know it. You should know better than that.\", Lance replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eheh, Sorry. Force of habit.\", Hunter said, scratching the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, they all hear a lock click. They all turn around and await as the door opens slowly. As the door opens they each caught their first glimpse of the figure, that was Hunter's brother. Their eyes widen out a bit more as, the tall and slender figure leaning against the doorway with his arms crossed. He was wearing a red shirt coat with the sleeves ripped off, black jeans, and black sneakers. His built was muscular all over his tall body. People would find it hard to believe if HE were the younger brother and Hunter was his normal self. \"Can I, help you guys?\", he asks in a pretty aggravated tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter blinks his eyes, \"Uh! Hi. Um, are you Zack by any chance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack stares at Hunter when an eyebrow cocked, then says, \"Yeah. Who wants to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well, my name's Hunter, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack interrupts, \"Let me guess. You're another one of guys who are out to hunt for blood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter stares at black, \"...What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack sighs, then places a hand on his forehead, \"Sorry. It's, been a long life.\" Zack looks up. \"And who are those guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGesturing a hand at Lance and then at Troy, \"Oh uh, this is Lance. And this is Troy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack glares at the three, \"Hmph. So what? This is your crew? You all here to beat me up or somethin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? No!\", Hunter exclaims. \"I came here because, well, to tell you that you're my brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack stares blankly at Hunter. \"...... What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm, your brother.\" Hunter starts rubbing the back of his head, \"I actually found out about this recently myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...... Is this some kind of joke!?\", Zack questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're here thirty seconds and you suddenly tell me you're my brother? I find that hard to believe! I mean, how did you even find me?\", Zack questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter didn't really know how to reply to that. \"On the...internet?\" Lance, Troy, and even Herman facepalm themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riiight. Well, nice knowin' ya.\", Zack says as he was about to shut the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter quickly slams a hand against the door just before Zack shuts it. \"Look, I really am your brother okay? I'm pretty I have something on me that'll prove it to you.\" Hunter reaches into his back pocket and pulls out his wallet. He begins reaching into it to find something of use. That was until he pulled out a photo. \"!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter holds out the picture to Zack. \"!!\" It was a picture of Zack and Hunter, back when they were young kids. \"I...remember this moment... I mean, I remember it vaguely but, I can tell this is me and this is...you...\" Zack chin shrivels up just a bit, and then he gestures a hand at Hunter and his friends, \"Alright. You got me. Come on in.\"</span></div></div>",

It had a long and very comfortable couch fit for 5 people side by side, a glass coffee table in front of it, and a big flat screen tv on the wall. \"Whoa!\" exclaimed Lance, \"You must be living the dream here!\" Zack gave a little scoff from his mouth. \"Yeah, I guess.\" \"So,\" Hunter started, \"Where are your folks?\" \"I don't know.\" answered Zack. \"If I had to guess, probably in Hawaii.\" Troy perked his face to Zack. \"Seriously?! And they didn't take you?\" \"That's what they do.\" said Zack. \"They're always away at work. I haven't seen them for about five months now. They just leave me cash to live by and I call them when I need more.\" Zack's story saddened Hunter. Although Hunter had a rough step dad, his step dad at least acknowledged his existence. \"That's sounds pretty tough.\" said Hunter. \"Not really.\" said Zack. \"I got everything I need here. What else do I need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter then looked into Zack's mind with his powers. Hunter saw that Zack had a very lonely life. His parents were never around, even when he was a kid and he didn't have any friends. Zack didn't have anyone in his life. \"What about friends, family?\" Hunter brought up. Zack tried brushing it off by saying, \"Why would I need people? They never needed me.\" \"Everyone needs someone.\" Zack couldn't hold it in any longer. Tears leaked from his eyes. He always covered up his feelings with apathy. If nobody cared about him, why should he? Hunter got off the couch and wrapped his overly muscular arms around his tall baby brother. \"I'm so sorry.\" Hunter told him. \"I'm so sorry I wasn't there for you when you needed me. I'm here now. We all are.\" Lance and Troy followed Hunter to a group hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Zack calmed down a little bit, they all sat down and talked about each other's life. Hunter told Zack about his life with his step dad and how bad things were with him. Lance told  his life story about coming from a big family of seven in a small trailer park and Troy about living in a beach house with only his mom. They all were having a great time and Zack felt as if he was part of the group. \"So how did you guys find out about me?\" asked Zack. Then there was a pause. \"Umm, we had some help.\" said Hunter. Zack didn't understand; his new brother and friends were so open to him and now they were hiding something. \"What kind of help?\" pressured Zack. \"Come on, tell me.\" Hunter gave in. \"We came across our real mom and dad. They told us about you and wanted us to see you.\" \"It's true.\" Herman came into the room out of nowhere. Zack jumped. \"Who the heck are you?\" \"My name is Herman; I am a loyal servant of your mother and father, the tiger gods.\" \"What?\" \"Our parents are gods, Zack.\" said Hunter. \"You're a god with supernatural powers. Lance and Troy are gods too.\" Lance and Troy shook their heads agreeing the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was beginning to be annoyed with the group. \"Are you kidding me? You expect me to believe a ridiculous story like that?\" Hunter, Lance, Troy, and Herman understood they needed to convince him through their powers. Hunter spoke up. \"I'll show you.\" Hunter then took a pose and then tensed his muscles. Lance and Troy thought he was going to grow more muscular. Actually, Hunter's fur changed color from orange with black stripes to pale gold. His tail then followed the changing color and added a furry tip. Then hair grew from the sides Hunter's neck, turning into a mane. Zack, Lance, and Troy was surprised to see Hunter as a lion! Hunter himself was impressed because he never did a species change before. He then changed back into a tiger. \"You believe us now?\" Hunter asked Zack. Zack simply nodded in amazement. </span></div></div>",

Perhaps a snow leopard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I was thinking about something simple.\" Hunter points at something on the table, \"Like picking up that pencil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance and Troy stare down at it. Lance then responds, \"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack glances towards it, \"Um, okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was about to reach for it with his left hand, \"No no!\", Zack turns to Hunter. Hunter starts tapping his head with his finger, \"With your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack looks back at the pencil, and then imagines the pencil being picked up on it own. To his surprise, that's exactly what happens. \"!!\" He starts moving his head around, the pencil also followed sue. \"No way... This is unbelievable!\" Zack grabs the pencil, and then looks down at the table. With a simple thought, he manages to pick it up with ease only using his mind! \"Hah! This is incredible!\" Zack sets the table back down, and then stands up looking at his hands again, \"I can do anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerman places a hand on Zack's shoulder. Zack looks at Herman. \"Just remember Zack. With great power, comes great responsibility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack stares at Herman, and then nods his head. Lance whispers to Troy, \"Heh. Haven't heard that one before.\" Troy slaps Lance on the back of his head, \"Ow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack thinks to himself, remembering what Hunter did earlier. He wanted to try something like that. He turns to Herman, \"Mind if I tried something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerman holds a hand up, \"Hey, I said you shouldn't go maniacal with it. I didn't say you could live a secondary life.\" They stare at Herman for a moment, each with the same expression on their faces from earlier. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Zack throws his arms out, \"Here I go.\" Zack closes his eyes, and then the fur all over his body was starting to change. Zack's orange and black fur was starting to turn white on his chin, chest, and abdomen changed to white, and the rest of his fur started to turn red. His ears started to change and become more pointed like fox ears. His tail also became a little shorter in length but more puffy. Hunter and the others were now in view of Zack, the red and white-furred fox. Zack starts checking himself all over, \"Whoa... This is so awesome!\" Zack looks up at Hunter with a smile on his face. Hunter smiles back, and then Zack runs over to him to try to give him a hug. \"Eheh... You sure are big. Or, is that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It kinda is.\", Hunter replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack backs up from their hug, \"Hmm...in that case, let me try that again.\" Zack changes back to his tiger self. And then...</span></div></div>",

All of a sudden, Zack's muscles felt knotted and tense; he held his breath to see the muscle knots push against his fur. Every muscle from arm to leg was being fueled with power and rippling to massive proportions. When Zack stopped transforming, he met Hunter, Lance, and Troy at eye level. At first, he had to look up to see them. Zack then looked down to see his new body. His clothes were still intact but clearly defined his new improved pecs and 8-pack abs. Zack put his hand under his shirt to feel his chest; he loved the feeling of his chest thickening as he stroked upwards. Zack loved the new him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look awesome!\" yelled Lance. \"You almost look like you can take us!\" Zack looked at Lance skeptically. \"Almost?\" Zack focused his powers again. This time, his muscles grew more massively and powerful than before. The sensation that came with the growth was almost unbearable to Zack. He kept growing until his fur erupted out of his shirt and lower part of his pants, making them both tear. He also grew a few inches taller than the trio. Zack stopped growing and flexed his arms into beachballs down at Lance. \"I can take you guys easily!\" said Zack in a deeper voice. Hunter was happy that Zack was enjoying his powers. \"Let's see what you can do with those.\" said Hunter. Zack was way ahead of him. Zack already had the unnecessarily big couch in one giant paw over his head. \"I think I'm going to enjoy this!\" said Zack laying the couch with a loud thump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say guys,\" said Zack, \"I just came up with a great idea! I heard there's going to be a beach party tonight and it can't start without us giants being there!\" Troy loved the sound of Zack's idea. \"I'd say we go!\" Troy exclaimed. \"I'm pumped! Let's do it!\" said Lance. \"You up for it, Hunter?\" \"Absolutely,\" answered Hunter, \"but is it okay if I invite someone?\" Lance knew where Hunter was implying. \"I'm sure Trixie would love to go with you. She'll die if you don't.\" He teased. Hunter slapped him at the back of the head. \"Who's Trixie?\" asked Zack. \"Hunter's hot new girlfriend.\" said Troy. Zack knew he had to tease Hunter about it later because it was obvious Hunter was shy about his love life. Zack also began to think maybe he could find someone with his muscles. \"Come on, Hunter, bring Trixie!\" said Zack. \"I'd love to meet her!\" Hunter nodded. \"Okay, I'll ask her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\" said Zack. \"How about we pump ourselves up before we go?\" \"You have a gym in this place?\" asked Troy. Zack opened the nearest door to show the a giant room with shelves of dumbbells, weight benches, treadmills, and other exercise materials for a good workout. There was also a refreshment bar on the left of the room. \"There is now.\" said Zack implying he used his powers again.</span></div></div>",

Lance was out talking and flirting to some girls while making a few muscular poses, the girls chuckling and giggling in reaction. Troy also had a small group of people standing in front of him and his surfboard. The group was a mix of guys and gals as he chatted with them a bit about surfing techniques and a few other things. Upon chatting he takes notice of one of the girls in the group, who was a white-furred lemur in a pink two-piece. He gives a wink at her, and she took notice, blushing a bit in response. Hunter and Zack were sitting on their own out near the shore, chatting a bit as they got to know more about each other. Zack was also back to his normal self. \"So, you don't know very much about our parents?\", Zack asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately no.\", Hunter replies. \"That was actually the first time I ever got to meet them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack looks down, \"Mm...\" He then elbows Hunter against his massive shoulder, \"Hey, maybe we should stop by and visit them sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smiles back at Zack, \"Heh. Yeah. Maybe we should.\" Hunter takes notice of Zack's current form. \"You, sure you don't want to pump yourself up like before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack shrugs his shoulders, \"Eh. I'm more into agility than strength.\" Zack holds out his right arm, then uses his powers to expand all of the muscles in his arm to large proportions, flexing his enormous bicep in response. \"I do like the option though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Hunter!\", a female voice calls out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both turn their heads, Hunter responding back, \"Oh! Hey Trixie!\" Hunter and Zack stand up as Trixie walks up to them both wearing a red T-shirt that curved over her upper nicely, and blue short jean shorts, \"I'm so glad you're here. This is Zack. My, little brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie gasps. \"You're little brother? I had no idea you had a little brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Eheh... Neither did I.\", Hunter replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" Trixie looks at Zack, then back Hunter, then back at Zack. \"Oh my gosh! You two do look alike!\" Trixie runs up to Hunter to give him a hug, \"I'm so happy for you two!\" Trixie walks up to Zack. \"Hi. I'm Trixie. It's so nice to meet you Zack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack smiles warmly, \"Heh. It's nice meeting you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie smiles back. \"Oh! I gotta head to the changing room real quick. I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take your time.\", Hunter replies, waving back to her as she runs off. Zack watches as she runs off, but then the expression on his face slowly dwindles. Hunter turns to Zack, and then notices the expression on Zack's face. \"Zack? Is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack sighs. \"Must be nice to have been with someone who cares about you a lot.\"</span></div></div>",

He went back to the time when he was five years old andhis parents ran around the house working while he wanted them to play with him.  He also remembered when they first left him alone for a month at eight years old. A tear dripped from Zack's eyes. Hunter noticed it and gave Zack another hug. \"You do have someone who cares about you.\" Hunter told Zack. \"I care. I know we just met but your my brother and I care about you as much a brother can and should.\" Zack allowed every word to touch him. He grabbed his brother and buried his face into his chest to cry openly. Luckily nobody noticed them. Zack's heart was healing, but it was still sore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack settled down after a few minutes. Hunter broke up the hug. \"You okay?\" Hunter asked. Zack nodded. \"Yeah, I'm sorry.\" \"Don't be. If you need to let it out, do it.\" Zack nodded again. \"Oh, Hunter!\" Zack and Hunter turned to find Trixie in a red two piece bikini. It shaped her curves and body perfectly. Hunter was awestruck; he couldn't resist picking her up and kissing her. \"You look beautiful as always.\" Hunter told her. Trixie kissed him back. \"And you look strong as ever.\" she said. Hunter put Trixie down. \"Hey, Zack,\" said Trixie, \"I met a girl in the dressing rooms. She seems nice and I think you'll like her.\" Zack's spirits went up instantly. \"Really?!\" Zack asked. \"Yeah.\" answered Trixie. \"She'll be out in a minute.\" Hunter was really happy to hear that. \"Trixie, go on ahead to the party, I'll help Zack get ready to meet this lady.\" said Hunter. \"Okay, but don't go flirting with her!\" She teased and went off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and Zack shared a grin. \"See?\" said Hunter. \"Things are looking better already!\" \"Yeah,\" said Zack, \"I guess you're right!\" Hunter and Zack waited a little while for Zack's mystery girl until Hunter said, \"Do you want to pump up for her? I know you said you prefer to be agile but a lady always loves a big strong man!\" Zack chuckled. \"Maybe; I think I'll pump up just a little bit.\" With a thought, Zack strengthened his whole body at once. He wasn't massive like Hunter and his friends, but he wasn't lean and svelte either. Zack's muscles were cleanly sculpted and obviously powerful despite their smaller size. Zack looked like the ideal model. \"You look awesome!\" said Hunter. \"Thanks.\" Zack replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, there she was. A slender and beautiful lioness came out of the dressing rooms. Zack was struck by her. The moonlight reflected off her fur, making her look like a golden goddess. \"Wow.\" said Zack simply. Hunter pushed him slightly to her direction. \"Go get her, bro!\" Zack nervously made his way toward her. The lioness saw Zack and was charmed instantly. She loved Zack's well defined 6-pack abs, powerful arms, and reliable legs. He wasn't too big and wasn't too small. The lioness thought he was just right. \"Well, hello.\" said the lioness. \"You must be the guy that Trixie mentioned in the changing room.\" Still anxious, Zack said, \"Uh, yeah, th-that's me.\" \"Well,\" she said, \"She was wrong about one thing.\" Zack's heart dropped. Does she not like him? Why? He didn't want to be alone; he couldn't. \"What do you mean?\" Zack asked. The lioness placed her hand against Zack's cheek, making Zack blush. \"You're cuter than Trixie said you were.\" Zack felt relieved right then. \"Thanks. I'm Zack.\" \"Cristina.\" \"Would you like to hang out with me a bit?\" Zack asked Cristina. \"Sure.\" She responded. They both walked across the sand hugging each other's side. Cristina loved Zack's chest and rubbed it with her hand as they walked. \"They're going to love each other.\" said Hunter making his way to Trixie.  </span></div></div>",

He was walking along the sand with a gorgeous woman beside him who seemed to like him a lot. The old, lonely Zack was gone, gone forever. \"So, Zack,\" began Cristina, \"Are you some kind of model?\" Zack blushed a little bit. \"No, I just keep in shape any way I can,\" he said. \"Well, you just keep on doing what you're doing,\" Cristina said while rubbing Zack's chest. \"I would love to see bigger and stronger muscles from you.\" Zack was completely charmed by Cristina. Despite his first thoughts of keeping lean muscle to stay agile, he agreed to pump up more for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMusic began to play and everyone was getting together to dance. \"Come on,\" said Cristina, \"Let's dance!\" She grabbed Zack by the hand and dragged him towards the music. At first, Zack was nervous; he didn't know how to dance in front of a hot girl like Cristina. \"Come on, don't be shy! You don't have to be good.\" said Cristina. Zack and Cristina got into the crowd of party dancers. Cristina started to move wildly and randomly while Zack just moved a little not really trying. \"Put your hips into it!\" Cristina yelled to Zack and smacked his hip.  Zack jumped and danced a little more. As he danced, he began to appreciate the company of Cristina. Her smile and sense of adventure made Zack want to melt into the sand. He began to relax and dance loosely. \"That's it, Zack!\" said Cristina. \"You got it!\" Zack commented with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey danced what felt like hours. Zack and Cristina lied down on the sand cuddling each other. \"That was really fun.\" said Zack. \"Thanks.\"  Cristina blushed slightly. \"I should be thanking you!\" she said. \"I would never have had a good time like this without you! You just need to let loose!\" After relaxing a little bit in the sand, Zack thought it was time to break the ice. \"So, what do you do for a living?\" Zack asked. \"I'm a photographer!\" Cristina answered. She then had a thought; all those muscles on Zack would look good on paper. \"I brought my camera, want to have a posing session?\" Zack beamed with excitement. \"Yeah, sure!\" Cristina ran back to her car and grabbed her camera. While she was gone, Zack flex an arm in joy, seeing it swell with power and have veins running across it. Zack was so distracted, he didn't see Cristina taking a picture of him admiring his arm. \"That was really good!\" Cristina said. \"Show me more!\" Zack then did a double arm pose, thickened his chest, and rippled his legs. Cristina got every detail Zack was offering. As she was taking photos, Cristina began to feel affectionate towards Zack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCristina gave Zack a hug. \"You are amazing!\" she told him. \"Were they really that good?\" Zack asked. Cristina nodded. \"Just wait till I get them developed. You're going to love them!\" They sat down again and settled down. \"Zack,\" Cristina began, \"Tonight was great. I would love to see you around, if you want.\" Zack couldn't believe what he was hearing. Somebody wanted to be with him for once. \"I would love to.\" replied Zack. At that moment, they kissed passionately. Zack knew he was never going to be alone ever again.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zack was still pumped from having to meet his first girlfriend and spend time with her. It had been about an two hours since him and Cristina have spent time together, so maybe Hunter and the others were still around, he thought. Zack starts looking around for Hunter and friends, but he ended up walking through what seemed like a deserted part of the beach. It all seemed kinda off to him, but he just kept pacing on. After five minutes of walking and no spotting of life, Zack started feeling a little scared. His feelings of being alone seem to be coming back to haunt him again. \"... What's...going on...?\" His paces were starting to get faster and faster. It was as if he was running through an endless path that lead to nowhere, and Zack didn't know why. \"What's going on?!\", he screams to himself, \"Where am I even going?! Where is everyone?! Lance?! Troy?! Hunterrr!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he okay?\", asked a female arctic fox. It turns out Zack had been lying on his side on the sand, shaking an shivering. It was as if Zack was going through some sort of weird funk. Accompanying the fox was a male orange and white-furred fox, who the arctic fox places a hand on, \"Why don't you go check on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" The male fox crouches down on one knee, placing a hand on Zack's shoulder, \"Hey buddy, wake up. You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get away from me...\", Zack suddenly says in a deep and threatening tone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Hey, wake up.\", the orange fox calls out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack's eyes open wide, his eyes emitting a bright-red color in them. Zack got up on his knees. His left arm pumps right up as veins then slithered around it, and then he punches the male fox right out of the way. \"Jimmy!!!\", the white fox yelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, Lance, and Troy each overheard her scream at once, \"!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was lying on a beach towel on the shore next to Trixie. He immediately jumps up, \"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm... Hm?\" Trixie gets up a bit, \"Is, something the matter Hunter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no. Actually I just remembered something. I'll be right back, okay?\" Trixie nods her head, and then lies back down. Hunter then gets up and casually walks off to not attract too much attention from her. As soon as he was far enough, he immediately zips off and runs over to where the scream came from. As he was running, Herman suddenly flies down beside Hunter with his wings. \"Herman, what's going on!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Zack! It seems he's in a bad state.\", Herman replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember what your parents said about him being a little, troubled?\", Herman asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\", Hunter thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was soon joined by Lance and Troy, who were running alongside him. \"Hey, what's goin' on?\", Lance asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Zack. He's in trouble.\", Hunter replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure hope the kid is okay...\", Troy added.</span></div></div>",

His love and passion for Trixie overwhelmed Hunter's mind. He cared for her so much and would do anything to protect her. Hunter felt tightness around his abs as Trixie hugged him. \"Hunter,\" she said, \"I hope this doesn't sound too much, but, I love you.\" Hunter lifted her from his chest and kissed her. \"I love you too.\" It was official. If things were to go well for him and Trixie, Trixie needed to know all that there was to know about him. It was time to tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trixie,\" Hunter started, \"There's something I gotta to tell you.\" Trixie sat up to meet his eyes. \"What?\" she asked. Hunter took a deep breath. \"First, do you trust me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I do!\"<br>\r\n\"Do you promise to take me seriously and not laugh?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter paused for a few seconds and took another deep breath. \"I'm a god.\" he finally says. Trixie laughed and said, \"I know you are. With those muscles , you look like a..\" \"No.\" Hunter interrupted. \"I'm really a god. I'm a being with supernatural powers and I can literally do anything with a single thought.\" Trixie looked skeptical. \"Really?\" she said. Hunter knew exactly what to do to prove it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter got up to a random spot on the beach. He raised his right massive leg and stomped on the sand as hard as he could. A tiny earthquake followed and a mount of sand in the shape of a modeling Trixie emerged. Hunter then opened his hands towards the sand sculpture. Beams of flames shot out of his palms and began to burn the sand into glass. Finally, Hunter waved his arm towards to ocean. A ball of water came out of the waves and levitated directly over the heated glass. With another wave, Hunter made the water pour onto the sculpture. The natural beach breeze began to dry off the love monument Hunter proudly made for Trixie. When Hunter turned to Trixie, Trixie looked scared and had no idea as to what she saw. Hunter sighed. \"Trixie, I know this is a lot to take in. I'm sorry for keeping this from you. But I'm telling you now because I love you.\" Trixie remained silent. \"Well,\" Hunter continued, \"What do you say?\"</span></div></div>",

That certainly blew my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter still felt very skeptical about what Trixie said. \"...\" Hunter raises his arms and starts tapping his pointing fingers against each other in front of his chest and says while he glances away, \"Um, in a, good way? Or a bad way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, Trixie runs up to him to wrap her arms around Hunter's large abdomen and gave him a big hug. \"In a good way silly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was pretty surprised with her reaction. \"Huh? You...you mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie backs up a bit to look up at Hunter, \"Okay I'll admit. I still am a little shocked, but mostly surprised and amazed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...

I'm normally not this big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. So then, how do you normally look?\", Trixie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... !\" Hunter just remembered. He has no idea HOW he normally looks! He sped up time 20 years ahead, so this would actually be a good question for him as well. Hunter looked back down at Trixie. He felt worried at first, but looking at his love's calming expression seems to just be melting them away. Hunter grins at her, \"Well, I guess I'll just have to show you.\" Trixie smiles back at him, and then steps back a bit to watch. Hunter closes his eyes, and then gulps his throat once before he starts turning back to normal. \"Just hope I don't look too bad...\", he thinks to himself.</span></div></div>",

Hunter could hear Trixie gasping as he was transforming. When he finally opened his eyes, Hunter saw little muscle on his body. He flexed an arm but it barley moved. Hunter looked up to Trixie. \"Well,\" Hunter said, \"What do you think?\" Trixie kissed him on the cheek. \"I think you look so cute!\" she said. \"Not as cute when you're big but still very cute!\" Trixie hugged  Hunter as tightly as she could. She almost wrapped her arms around his chest but failed because he was still fairly big. \"You think so?\" Hunter asked her. \"I don't look as big and strong.\" Trixie then let go of him and looked at him the eyes. \"Hunter, I don't care if you're big or small. I love you, just the way you are.\" Hunter's love for Trixie then overwhelmingly grew. He never met someone who liked him for himself. It was always him and his father, who was mean to him at the time. Hunter shed a couple tears. Trixie saw his crying and asked, \"Are you okay?\" Hunter smiled at her. \"Yes.\" he answered. \"I am. Thank you. Thank you for being there for me.\" Trixie and Hunter kissed again with more passion than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and Trixie then ran into the ocean to play in the waves. They splashed each other and swam as fast as they could towards the horizon. Then Hunter came up with a fun idea. He swam close to Trixie and focused his powers on the water. The water began to push underneath them. It pushed them so hard Hunter and Trixie felt like they were going to jump out. The next thing they knew, they were floating on a pillar of water above the ocean. Trixie was scared at first but she relaxed after seeing the view of the beach and Hunter. She began to love her god-like boyfriend even more. Hunter impressed her more by picking her up and walking on the water towards the shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing!\" said Trixie when she and Hunter made it back to shore. Hunter just blushed. \"So I guess you're cool with all this?\" \"I more than cool! I love it!\" Trixie kissed Hunter again. \"Just out of curiosity,\" said Hunter, \"I know you said you like big or small but what would you prefer?\" \"BIG!\" said Trixie instantly. Hunter chuckled. \"You better stand back then.\" he told her. Hunter tensed his muscles and began to focus. The sense of heat and power flowed in his muscles and Hunter loved that feeling. Hunter could feel his skin and fur stretching as his muscle grew back. Trixie was mesmerized by Hunter's growing muscles. It was as if she was seeing power being poured on Hunter. In an instant, Hunter was the giant he and Trixie loved. Hunter flexed a bicep to Trixie. \"Better?\" he asked her. \"Much.\" Trixie replied.</span></div></div>",

You opened the door, but then Trixie suddenly leans her head in on his large forearm, \"Hm? Is something the matter Trixie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie yawns, and then says as she starts rubbing her eye, \"Oh no. I'm just a little tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter blinks his eyes, and then grins, \"Heh.\" Hunter leans in and picks Trixie up with ease so that she cradled on his massive arms. \"I'll carry you to bed.\" Trixie just smiled back at Hunter, and then gave him a hug to show her thanks. Upon entering inside, the room was quiet and almost completely dark. But it surely wasn't anything Hunter couldn't navigate through. Hunter navigates his way to their room, using his tail to open the door. He walks inside and lays Trixie on their bed, tucking her in afterwards. Hunter then lies down next to her, lying on their bed with his arms folded behind his head and one leg crossed on top of the other. He reminisces about the time they had together for a moment, but then suddenly he feels Trixie's hand lying on his hard and fluffy abs. Hunter looked down to see Trixie's hand on his abdomen, \"? Heh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter places a hand on top of Trixie's, and then flexing and tensing his abs in return. He then feels Trixie's hand shift up on to his powerful chest while his hand followed. Hunter then flexes and thickens his pecs a bit while Trixie's hand feels nearly every inch of them. Hunter overheard Trixie giggle a bit in return, which made him grin back at her. Hunter then moved Trixie's hand down his left shoulder and over his enormous left bicep. He slowly flex his 25-inch hill and let her feel his bicep ripple and raise through the whole thing. Hunter did this a few more times, then he realizes he was doing most of the moving of Trixie's hand. Hunter waited patiently for a moment to hear and/or get a response from Trixie, but that's when he realizes she had just fallen asleep. \"Heh.\" Hunter kisses Trixie on her forehead. \"Good night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter sets Trixie's hand down, and then stares back at the ceiling. He slowly shuts his eyes all the way, but then suddenly...'BANG!' \"Woohoo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's eyelids jolted back up. He then sits up on their bed and sighs. \"Well, sounds like Lance is finally back.\" Hunter turns to look at Trixie, who was still fast asleep. Hunter sighs once again. \"At least he didn't wake Trixie up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter gets up and out of bed. Out in the living room, Lance was out in his usual gym shorts and shoes proudly making random flexing poses with his sweaty body. \"Hah! That, felt, great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you're home.\" Lance looked over at Hunter, who was standing in the hallway with his arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunter! You're back!\", Lance yells out. \"Hey, care to join me for a quick flex off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not right now.\", Hunter replied. He then walks up to Lance, keeping his distance, \"Hey, remember what I said about yelling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance does a double-bicep flex while looking at Hunter, \"Oh. Sorry man. NGH! Guess I just got a little carried away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what have you been up to?\", Hunter asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance then watches as he raises his left arm to flex his bicep a few times, \"Just some training with Troy. You may not notice, but that guy's a REAL competitor. Oh! And I heard you told Trixie about you being a God.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This doesn't surprise me.\", Hunter replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I have to say is...</span></div></div>",

Did he tell her because he got carried away? He then thought back to their magical night. Love and trust replaced his worries. \"I don't think she will tell.\" Hunter told Lance. \"I trust her. I wouldn't have told her if I didn't. Besides, I can just use my powers to erase her memories.\" Lance relaxed a bit after hearing the memory erasing idea. \"That's true.\" \"If it makes you feel better, I didn't tell her about you and Troy,\" Hunter commented. \"Good. Let's keep it that way, for now,\" said Lance. \"One more thing.\" Hunter looked at his friend puzzled. \"Do I always look this good or is it just me?\" Lance asked jokingly. Hunter sighed. \"You and Troy look fine. I'm going to bed.\" Lance still flexed every muscle he could find in the mirror as Hunter entered his room to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Hunter found Lance and Troy talking on the couch. \"Hunter!\" exclaimed Lance. \"Come here, we got a plan!\" \"What is it?\" asked Hunter. Troy gave him the details. \"Get this: yesterday Lance and I work out at the gym and compete who's the strongest. We're having a good time until this jerk hyena shows up and calls us amateurs! AMATEURS! He called a couple of gods AMATEURS! We really wanted to teach this guy a lesson but we'd raise suspicion with our powers. We challenged him to a strength contest and we want you to help us!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter wasn't sure about this. He never used his powers like that before and didn't want to. \"I don't know guys,\" said Hunter. \"I don't want to hurt this guy, even if he is a jerk.\" \"Don't worry man,\" said Lance. \"We're just going to tease him, not grow 50 feet tall and squish him...even though we could.\" Hunter was still unconvinced. He knew he, Lance, and Troy could take him no problem, but Hunter just didn't know if he should. It would be interesting to see how he could use his powers. \"I still don't know.\" Hunter said. \"Can I get back to you on that?\" Lance slapped Hunter's back. \"Absolutely!\" he said. \"But make it fast. We're meeting him today.\" Troy got up towards the door and Lance followed him. \"We're heading to the gym to warm up.\" Troy told Hunter. \"Meet us there if you want to.\" Then they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter lied down on the couch debating whether to join his friends or not until Trixie came into the room. Hunter's mood lightened immediately. \"Hey, gorgeous.\" said Hunter. \"Morning, handsome.\" Trixie replied. \"Did the almighty god sleep well last night?\" Hunter chuckled. \"You know I did.\" He then flexed a bicep that made her cheeks glow. \"You have any plans for today?\" Hunter asked Trixie. \"Well, I was thinking about exploring the town more,\" she said. \"Would you like to come with me and show me what else you can do besides from last night?\" Trixie placed a smile on her face and her hand on Hunter's bumpy chest which made his cheeks glow. \"Umm..\" Hunter stuttered, \"I don't know. Lance and Troy invited me to do something with them but I'm not sure if I want to.\" Trixie kept her smile. \"Do what you want. You don't have to go with me if you don't want to. I know even a strong god like you needs some guy time. If you want to join me, great. If not, that's fine.

He was about to enter inside, until he noticed what looked like a disturbance through the window. Inside, Lance and Troy appeared to be getting yelled at by said hyena, who really got his attention. The guy was really buff! Actually, just a tad buffer than them both and you, \"Who is this guy?!\", you thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like Lance and Troy were keeping their cool, letting the guy mouth off to them both.

Ya made it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter slowly walks up to the three. \"Hey--\", the hyena turns his attention towards him, glaring at him with what felt like blazing eyes, \"--Uhhh...\", Hunter just sidesteps up beside Lance. \"So, this the guy?\", Hunter whispers to Lance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I think he heard you.\", Lance replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can hear you.\", the hyena added gruntingly. \"So, this the other amateur you guys mentioned as being part of your posse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amateur?\", Hunter said in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy shows his hand to Hunter, \"This is Hunter. Hunter, this is Rhet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhet says as he folds his large arms over his chiseled chest, \"Didn't really want to give him my name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he certainly would've learned it sooner or later.\", Troy replied with a modest tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what exactly are we gonna do?\", Hunter asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance raises his right arm to flex the hardened peak that was his bicep, \"We're gonna teach this guy some manners! That's what we're gonna do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that.\", Hunter replied, \"I meant what is it exactly we're going to be doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhet walks up to the different euipment and then points out,</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rhet started pumping the bar. His arms and chest thickened and relaxed between each rep. Hunter was impressed how big the hyena was. Rhet looked more like a god than actual gods. \"I have an idea!\" said Lance. \"This guy thinks he's all that with his muscles. I bet he'd think differently with them gone.\" \"What are you getting at?\" asked Hunter. Lance grinned. \"I say we take away his muscles and split his strength between us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's sounds cool!\" said Troy. \"I'm in!\" Hunter wasn't sure. He liked the idea of getting bigger but making someone smaller? Hunter didn't know if Rhet deserved that. \"I don't know, guys.\" said Hunter. \"Don't you think that's a little harsh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a way, I guess.\" said Lance. \"But Hunter, this guy's a JERK! And not just to me and Troy.\" \"What do you mean?\" asked Hunter. \"We read his mind.\" explained Troy. \"Rhet just got big because he wanted to push people around! He finds punching the blood out of people more fun than showing off his muscles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this in mind, Hunter thought more. Maybe it would be safer for everyone if Rhet did lose his muscles, if he was really that bad. And Trixie always loved seeing bigger muscles on Hunter. \"Okay, but let's not make a big deal out of this.\" Lance clapped his hands in joy. \"Alright! Let's do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhet was still at the bench doing his hundreth rep. Hunter, Lance, and Troy hid in a corner from the locker rooms. Lance began by thinking of a scrawnier Rhet. Hunter looked at Rhet very closely. He could see the hyena's muscles growing smaller! It wasn't much but he saw it! \"Oh, that feels good!\" said Lance as his chest began to fill his tank top till it looked like it couldn't hold him. His gray arms and legs looked more defined too! Hunter was amazed what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhet could feel getting tired. It was weird. This was usually an easy lift for him and he could do two hundred reps no problem. \"Must be more tired than usual.\" Rhet thought. \"I'll go to the locker room and get my protein shake. That always makes me feel better!\" Rhet did so. He put the weights down and trodded to the locker room. The godly trio followed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, Lance, and Troy hid behind the next row of lockers from Rhet. Luckily, the place was deserted. Troy was next. The dragon took off his shirt to be safe from the growth. He showed a ten pack with bowling ball pecs. Troy then did what Lance did before: imagined Rhet's strength away and claiming it his own. Rhet felt dizzy. \"Wh..What's going on with me?\" Rhet felt weaker and weaker while Troy felt stronger and stronger. Rhet noticed his gym clothes being loose. How's that possible? They were skin tight when he came in! Troy's muscles became more defined and gave Troy some height. His head peaked over a weakening hyena. Troy grinned and looked down at Lance and Hunter. \"This is awesome! Hunter, you're next. Finish it off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter did as he was encouraged. He took a deep breath while Rhet's muscles continued to shrink. Hunter felt warmth in his muscles and they pushed against his fur to grow. He too grew some height, a little more than Troy and swelled his already rippling body. His arms literally shredded in front of his eyes and looked like they could bend a car. His chest widened to a slight shirt tear between his pecs and his legs pumped to great power and speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to me?!\" Hunter turned his already peering head to see a scrawny hyeana. It was hard to believe that it was actually Rhet. To avoid suspicion, Hunter altered Rhet's memories so it appeared Rhet was always small. \"What am I doing here?\" asked Rhet to himself. In confusion, Rhet left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance and Troy were amazed by how they and Rhet looked. \"You know what you remind me of, Hunter?\" asked Lance. \"A god!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After their encounter with Rhet, they decided to show-off a bit in front of the mirror. It's not like they wouldn't mind doing this before, but seeing how big they had gotten after sapping the muscle from him, they might as well. Troy was the first up, flexing his arms down and against his chest. He then holds his hands behind his back and sticks his left leg out and stretches his thigh and calf muscles and doing a pose that showed his deltoids the most. Lance steps up in front of Troy, raising his arms up high to perform a high and wide double-bicep flex. His pecs stretched out impressively as well. Troy sticks his head out from behind Lance, \"Hey, do you mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, couldn't let you hog the mirror all to yourself.\", Lance said while turning around and raising his left arm up and sticking his right arm down, flexing his enormous back proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Even though this isn't a full-length mirror?\", Troy asks, standing in front of a mirro wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Hunter, he took a moment to look around his entire body to see and feel just how big he had gotten. He stuck his right arm down like Lance did, feeling around his shredded forearm and pumped bicep with his left hand. He then starts feeling his immense chest, which actually stuck out past his chin a bit. Just before Hunter continued, he had just received an idea into his head. \"Hey guys?\" Turns out the two had been fussing around, looking at Hunter in a weird pose. \"Uh... I guess I'm gonna go head back to the hotel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\", Troy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on man! You barely spent any time with us!\", Lance exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter grabs his gym bag, and then raises his left arm up to flex his grown bicep, \"Don't worry. I'll have more time for you guys later on.\", he said with a big grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance crosses his large arms, \"Alright. Return to your little girly friend.\", he pouted. Troy slaps Lance on the back of his head. \"Ow! I'm just say--\", Lance starts rubbing the back of his head, \"--Owww! That really hurt this time ya know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckles at them both, and then heads off and out of the gym. Back at the hotel, Trixie was sitting at the table while watching some daytime television. She also had a cup of strawberry yogurt set in front of her, taking a spoonful and eating it up. \"Mmm! I swear, this hotel should recieve 10 stars instead of 5!\" She suddenly hears a knock at the door, and the door swinging open. \"Oh! Hi Hun-...-ter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter sets his gym bag down on the floor. The first thing Trixie noticed was his size, which she started looking up Hunter's body just to see how much bigger he had gotten. In Trixie's eyes, Hunter was actually more pumped up in muscle than height. \"Hey, Trixie.\", Hunter says in a manly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...it's Trixie.\" She covers her mouth, \"Oh! I, thought you called me 'honey'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter walks up to Trixie, kneeling down on one thick leg so he was head-to-head with her. Speaking in a manly tone still, \"Oh? And what if I did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie turns away, blushing, \"I'd, I'd pop you on the cheek. Because I don't really like being called anything else than my first name.\" She overhears Hunter chuckle. \"So, what's with the sudden muscle growth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter holds his hands together in front of his abs, tensing his pecs enough so Trixie heard the shirt thread start to stretch, \"Just had to teach someone a lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie folds her arms in front of her chest, still blushing but trying to keep her composure, \"Really? You didn't beat him up or anything did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter brings his head in closer to Trixie's, wrapping his rippling arms around Trixie's well-toned back and giving her a lick on her snout, \"Come on. You know I'm not that kind of guy deep down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lick Hunter had given her actually made her body tremble a bit. She smiles at him, and then wraps her arms around Hunter's magnificent trap and neck muscles to give him a kiss, \"I know.\"</span></div></div>",

Hunter, Lance, and Troy make their way to full mirror in the locker room. Lance grinned with his new flexing muscles. The trio wasted no time admiring themselves. They thickened each improved muscle peaking them to perfection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance flexed his arms downward tensing his already defined arms while Troy thickened the muscles in his wings. Troy figured he could fly even faster now. Hunter noticed his pecs expanded past his chin slightly. He tensed his torso slightly and heard a slight tear in his shirt. As much as he would love to shred it, Hunter wanted to keep it on, for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is awesome!\" exclaimed Lance. \"I never felt so powerful!\" \"I know what you mean!\" said Troy. \"I bet I can crush bottles with my wings! What do you think Hunter?\" \"I'm still at a loss of words!\" answered Hunter. I feel awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" yelled Lance. \"We GOTTA do something with these guns!\" Hunter couldn't agree more. Then, he came up with an idea. \"I know just what to do!\" said Hunter. With a snap of his fingers, Hunter transported himself, Lance, and Troy to a rocky mountain terrain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy and Lance looked around the giant boulders and rocks around. Lance cracked his knuckles and neck. \"This'll do just fine.\" Lance waddled to the nearest boulder. He squatted, tensing his massive legs and back, and slid his fingers underneath it. Lance put little pushing pressure on the boulder and he threw it over his head instantly. Troy and Hunter clapped happily for Lance, especially when he flexed a bicep while holding the boulder with one hand. Lance dropped it with an earth quaking thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was so cool!\" said Lance. \"Your turn, Troy!\" Troy looked around. What would beat Lance's feat? Troy grinned. He walked over to the boulder Lance lifted. He then spread his wings and flew to the air. Hunter and Lance wasn't sure what Troy was doing until Troy floated over the boulder and began lifting it. Troy heaved the boulder up and threw it up in the air. As the boulder was coming down, Troy curled his fingers together and thickened the muscles in his arm and claw. Veins squirmed through trying to push power through Troy hard muscles. Troy swung his fist at the oncoming boulder and it shattered!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and Lance were very impressed. Troy landed leaving clawed feet indentations in stone. \"Not bad!\" said Hunter. \"That was amazing!\" Lance told Troy. \"I know, I know.\" commented Troy unmodestly. \"Your turn, Hunter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter walked up to the boulder not knowing what to do. What can top Troy's feat? He perked his ears with an idea. Hunter grabbed hold of the boulder and raised it above his head no problem.Then, he began to squeeze it. The boulder was hard but Hunter's muscles were harder. Pressure thickened Hunter's tendons and muscles strips in his arms. Hunter then heard a crack from the boulder. That encouraged him to push harder until the boulder scattered into large pieces. Lance and Troy clapped thinking Hunter was done. Hunter wasn't finished yet. He crushed every piece with flexes! Hunter place a piece of rock on his arm and crushed it with a simple bicep flex. Another placed between Hunter legs and crushed by their power. Lance and Troy cheered for joy! \"Now THAT was awesome!\" said Hunter flexing his chest ripping the shirt he wanted to keep.</span></div></div>",

It's not like that was the first time you've ever done that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that. I just caught me off guard.\", Hunter says while raising his arms inward towards his chest to flex them. \"So what should we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy puts a hand under his chin, \"Hmm... I got it!\" With a snap of his finger, the three of them appeared in a vast forest land populated by dozens of of of large and tall trees. \"Here we go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma-han! Lookit all the trees!\" Lance tenses up his right arm, \"I like where this is going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy takes a first crack at it, walking up to one of the many large trees. \"Alright. Rules are simple. See how we can take down these bad boys.\" Troy grabs a hold of the tree with both his massive arms. He grunts, tensing and flexing out the muscles that stuck out the most on his arms. With a little effort, Troy was already using enough strength to get the tree to shake. Troy then shows a little more teeth, flexing the shredded muscles on his chest and back. The tree was starting to get pulled off from its roots, as Troy then exerted even more strength muscle to start pulling it out. \"Hnnng...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and Lance stood back, Lance staring with arms crossed. See the amount of muscle being used in this feat was really an impressive sight for them. After another thrust of with his immense arms, he finally rips the tree out from it roots, holding up the ripped-out out tree for Lance and Hunter to see, who applauded in the background. Troy smiles back at the two, and then tosses the tree, which landed behind him. Troy then strikes a pose for the two, which was a simple but impressive double-bicep flex, \"Hah! Whatcha guys think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was great!\", Hunter commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was, pretty good.\", Lance added. \"But I think I can do better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah shut up and just do it already.\", Troy replies blantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\", Lance says walking up to another tree. He places his hands firmly on the tree, and then flexes his arms as he starting pusing against the tree. The immense power being exerted really grabbed Hunter and Troy's attention. Lance's forearms started to swell up, his biceps and triceps started pushing out even more, and his shoulders became broader. \"Come on...!\" Lance's chest and back were starting to become affected, as his pecs only pushed outward some more and his abs started to harden out underneath. His back and lats started to stretch out some, becoming more shriveled and rippled with strength. Lastly were his legs, his quads just crowded out firmly above while his diamondhead calves flexed out below. Lance grins in anticipation, \"Heh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy puts on a frowny face, \"Show-off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckles at Troy, \"Heh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of seconds, the tree starts to tear from its roots and fall forward towards the ground, \"TIMBER!!\", Lance cries out. The tree topples to the grassy field with a loud thud. Lance then turns around toward the two of them, wiping the sweat from his forehead. He looks up to Hunter, \"Alright Hunter. It's finally your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter tenses the muscles all over his body in anticipation, \"Alrighty!\" Hunter walks right up to another tree, pressing a hand against it to feel it's texture. \"This should do.\" All of a sudden, Hunter sits himself on the ground in front of the tree, Troy and Lance staring at him with confused looks on their faces. Hunter then raises his legs and plants his feet firmly onto the tree. \"Just gonna turn it up a notch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter wastes no time in getting himself ready for the tree. He immediately flexes his calves and thighs as he pushes hard against the tree. Hunter's continental legs started showing their stuff as his quads and hamstrings really started to take the tree down. His thighs were swelling out so much his shorts didn't seem to last much longer over them, stretching out to their limit as well. With one hard push, Hunter uses his chest and abs to aid him in this feat, flexing and hardening out said muscles with great definition it causes the tree to start ripping apart from its roots. Hunter's pal's eyes stared widely at his legs that really showed their stuff, until the tree was pushed out of its roots enough to fall to the ground. Hunter quickly leaps back up on his feet. \"TIMBER!!\" The tree falls to the ground, causing the forest around it to shake. Hunter turns to the two of them, \"How was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude...that was amazing!!\", Lance exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no question.\", Troy added. \"You really put a lot on those shorts of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter looks down, seeing that more of his immense thighs were exposed over his ripped shorts. Hunter blushes a bit, \"Eh heh...\"</span></div></div>",

With their powers and muscles, Hunter, Lance, and Troy made a pile of wood worthy for a cabin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe godly trio looked at the pile with pride. Lance interuppted the prideful silence. \"So, what do we do now?\" \"We built a cabin!\" Hunter exclaimed enthusiastically. \"But how?\" asked Lance. \"I don't know the first thing about building cabins.\" \"Me neither.\" commented Troy. Hunter chuckled and smiled. \"I guess we'll just do this the easy way!\" Hunter snapped his fingers that sparked a flash of light on the pile of wood. In an instant, a finely built cabin stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvenly cut out logs made perfectly even walls. There was even a second floor with windows! Lance sighed in relief. \"Oh, I love being a god!\" They all chuckled and went back to the feline.<br>\r\n\"Sir,\" said Hunter, \"We're done with your cabin.\" The feline turned with a skeptic face. \"Seriously?\" he asked them. \"I know you guys are big and strong and all but even...WHAT THE???\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feline was amazed with the beautiful cabin. He felt like he could live there forever. \"It's amazing!\" he implied. \"How the heck did you do it?\" \"With some luck and muscle!\" said Troy flexing his arm and wings, literally showing all the power he stored in his powerhouse body. \"Thank you so much!\" said the feline. \"How can I ever thank you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad! Is everything ok?\" They all turned to see a gorgeous yellow feline girl walking towards them. \"Hey honey!\" said the male feline. \"You won't believe it, these guys finished our cabin!\" The female feline looked at the cabin in amazement. It looked so luxurious and so did the guys who made it. \"Gentlemen,\" said the male feline, \"This is my daughter, Mary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance and Troy's hearts beated faster than ever before at the sight of Mary. She was so lean and sexy with her lumberjack outfit she wore to help her dad with the cabin.

Not knowing what else to do, the flexed their arms hoping to charm Mary. Mary laughed a little. \"No need to be shy.\" Mary said knowing what they were thinking. \"I like big guys!\" She then walk to the cabin to see the insides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance walked to Mary's father and said, \"If you want to owe us, you can start by giving us Mary's phone number!\"</span></div></div>",

No problem.\", Troy replies with a bright look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Lance, I'm available tomorrow if you are.\", Mary explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance winks at her while smiling, \"I'll see ya then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy whispers to Lance, \"Just, promise you'll be easy on her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance glares at Troy, and says in a low-grumbling voice and with his teeth clenched, \"What's that supposed ta mean!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary and her dad were already off to their old home, while Hunter stares at Lance and Troy, who appeared to be banging heads against each other. Literally... Hunter sighs, \"Oh boy.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next night, Lance walked proudly into a local carnival in town with Mary hugging his beefy arm. This was going to be a great night. Lance going to make sure of it. \"Thank you so much for taking to the carnival, Lance.\" said Mary hugging the tough rhino's arm tighter. \"No problem!\" replied Lance while tensing the bicep under Mary's twiggy arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary couldn't keep her eyes of Lance and his muscles. How could some like him be so nice and so big? She had to ask him. \"So, Lance, how strong are you?\" Before he answered he noticed the classic carnival strength game where you hit a button with a hammer and ring the bell. Lance grinned and said to Mary, \"I'll show you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked up to the stand and were greeted by a little crocodile running it. \"My,\" said the crocodile, \"You sure are a big one! You think you can ring the bell? Then pick up that hammer and slam it down as hard as you can!\" The hammer looked giant and heavy to lift for the average person. Lance was no ordinary person. He cracked his knuckles and stepped forward. Lance grabbed the hammer with one hand and heaved it over his shoulder. Mary and the worker were amazed by this feat. Nobody ever lifted the hammer over their head. The level of astonishment doubled as Lance slung the hammer down and rang the bell loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" said Mary. \"That was amazing!\" \"Indeed it was!\" said the crocodile. \"Very well done, sir! Now pick your prize on left side here!\" Lance turned to see a wide variety of prizes from squirt guns to giant stuffed animals. Lance picked out the giant panda. \"Here ya go!\" said Lance offering the panda to Mary. \"Oh, Lance, this is so sweet! Thank you!\" Mary then hugged around his bumpy chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the night went by, Lance and Mary had a great night of rides and games. They laughed until they approached what appeared to be a wrestling ring. Inside the ring was a HUGE bear. The bear's muscles made Lance's looked like pebbles in a stream. This wrestler did not look normal.The bear huffed and puffed while pounding his chest. He then flexed his arms and chest, making his whole body look like a mountain range. \"Is there anyone worthy of my time?\" said the bear. \"Is there anyone challenging?\" Lance had to take this opportunity. \"I'll fight you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear saw the big rhino peaking over the crowd surrounding the ring. \"You?\" said the bear. \"You look like you couldn't stand a minute in here!\" This guy was starting to annoy Lance. Lance started walking towards the ring until Mary grabbed his hand. \"Lance, you don't have to fight him.\" said Mary. \"I know.\" said Lance, \"But I can't let this guy think I'm a wimp.\" Mary understood what Lance needed to do. \"Just be careful.\" she said and released Lance hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance jumped into the ring and looked up to bear straight in the eye. \"I'll try not to send to the hospital.\" said the bear. \"Me neither.\" replied Lance. Both competitors walked to opposite corners of the ring to begin the match. The fight bell rung. Without hesitation, the bear ran to Lance and tried to body slam the rhino to the ground. When the bear jumped under Lance, there was no impact or screams of pain. He just felt what appeared to be hands holding him midair. The bear, Mary, and crowd cheered wildly for Lance, especially when Lance flexed a rippled bicep while holding the bear with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear had no idea what was happening. Nobody ever did this to him before. They couldn't. However, Lance did. Lance put both hands back on the massive bear above him and slammed him to the ground. The bear was unconscious instantly. Mary cheered for another amazing feat performed by the amazing rhino. Lance turned back to her in the ring and flexed his arms downward towards, signifying all that was for her.</span></div></div>",

I promised Troy I'll meet him tomorrow.\" Mary hugs her prize, \"Oh and, thanks for winning me the stuffed animal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\", Lance replies. \"Just try not to let the big dragon scare ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary chuckles. \"I'll try not to.\" Mary walks off home. Lance stares at her walking off for a short time, and then walks home the opposite direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-THE NEXT NIGHT-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy awaited for Mary on a park bench. He checked his watch for the time, but then hears footsteps coming his way. It was Mary. \"Mary!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Troy!\", Mary calls out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad ya made it.\" Mary grabs Troy's hands, \"Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where we going?\", Mary asks with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking we got out to get something to eat.\", Troy replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Where to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy raises up Mary's hands, \"My place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. You can cook?\", Mary asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. My place is just down the street.\" After walking and talking for a couple minutes, they both made it to Troy's place, which was a two-story home. And it wasn't one he thought up either. Troy walks right up to his door, unlocks it, and then opens it for Mary. \"Right this way. Sorry if the place is a tad messy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Mary took a moment to take a closer look at the place. It was actually mostly clean, and spacey. There was a couch, a flat-screen, a dining table, what you would normally expect in a middle-class home. Only with some pricey furniture. \"Wow... Your decor looks nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care to take a seat?\", Troy asks patting the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure. Thank you.\" Mary goes ahead and settles in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stay right there, while I get ready to cook dinner.\" Troy heads upstairs to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple minutes later, Mary waited patiently until Troy was heard coming downstairs. Mary turns her head towards Troy, and then her cheeks blush up a bit. \"Oh my...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy was wearing black shoes and black pants that would normally be worn by chefs, but nothing over the top. He was indeed shirtless, his scaley upperbody muscles practically glowing from the chandelier above. \"Oh. Yeah, I normally cook better without a shirt. I don't wanna end up getting sweat all over it while cooking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no.\", Mary says. \"It's quite alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy smiles back at her, and then holds out a hand to raise her up from her seat, which she does. Troy then walks her over to the dining table, so she'd get a good view of Troy while he was cooking. Troy walks into the kitchen and then grabs an apron that he wore around the front and tied it on his muscley back. \"I was thinking of cooking some fish and steak. That alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary wasn't completely able to not stare at Troy's outstanding muscles from around the apron, but then she shook her head, \"Mm! Yeah! That's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy stares at Mary, and then smiles. \"Heh. Don't worry. Feel free to enjoy the view while the man cooks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary blushes, and then chuckles.</span></div></div>",

She peeked into the kitchen to see a shirtless Troy flipping steak and fish. The heat was getting to him as sweat speckled his torso. Thanks to his scales, Troy's muscles seemed like they were sparkling. Mary's cheeks turned a deep red from the sight and heat in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy returned with two steaming plates in both hands. The food looked delicious to Mary. As she took a bite from her steak, her eyes beamed. \"This is really good!\" she said to him. \"Seriously, this is like the best steak I've ever tasted.\" Troy rubbed the back of his head blushing, shifting his bulging shoulder and arm muscles. \"Wow,\" said Troy, \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy and Mary had a great dinner. They talked about each other's lives (without Troy mentioning his being a god), music, movies, etc. Before they knew it, their plates were empty. \"Well,\" said Mary, \"What next?\" Troy smirked to himself. \"How about this?\" Troy raised his arms stretching and thickening them and his chest. The lighting in the room made his scaley flesh shine. Veins also pushed against Troy's scales, twitching to squeeze all Troy's power into them. Mary gasped at the sight. A strong dragon that cooks; what's better than that. For the final touch, Troy expanded his wings and swelled the muscles in them and his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...really amazing, Troy.\" said Mary. \"Glad you liked the show.\" replied Troy. Troy then came up with another idea that would win the feline's heart. \"Actually, I have another show for you.\" \"Really?\" said Mary excitedly. \"What is it?\" \"Meet me on the balcony upstairs and I'll show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy disappeared into the kitchen and Mary walked upstairs to the balcony. Mary loved the night outside as she waited for Troy. What was he planning? Troy came back still shirtless. \"So, what's your show?\" asked Mary. Without saying a word, Troy picked up Mary and cradled her in his bumpy chest. \"This!\" Troy squatted down and spread his wings. He leaped into the air but didn't come back down. Troy's spread out wings drifted him and Mary into the winds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary was scared at first. She was never a fan of hights. But being with Troy gave her some sense of security that she couldn't explain. Troy flew over downtown to enjoy the lights of the city below them. Mary was amazed by the sight. The whole district looked a giant Christmas tree and the people didn't realize. \"This is awesome!\" exclaimed Mary. Troy winked at her. \"Yeah, this city is beautiful but not as beautiful as you.\"</span></div></div>",

Not angrily or anything, just staring at each other. Hunter was also there, standing in between them both and so he would see who Mary chose. After a couple more minutes of waiting, Mary walked outside, her father standing behind her as she walks up to them both. Mary stares at the ground while Lance and Troy's eyes were locked right on her. \"......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mary, it's okay.\" Mary looks up at Lance. \"Don't worry about it too much. It's not like we'll stay mad at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Mary looks at Troy. \"We'll still be glad you at least spent some time with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary looks back down, \"Heh. Oh-okay.\" Mary takes a deep breath. \"Lance, I really like the time we had at the carnival. We had fun, and I'm still happy with the prize you got me so, thanks for that. And Troy, I really like the dinner you cooked for me and the time we spent, flying, together. So, after thinking about it for a long time...\", Lance, Troy, Hunter, and her father stare at her. And then she says, \"...I'm going to have to with Troy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was moment of silence. Lance's expression seems to have dipped, a lot. But he tried his best not to show it. Hunter and Troy stare at Lance, Mary did the same. \"What? Hey, it's fine with me.\" Lance starts scratching the side of his cheek, \"Just uh, what made you choose him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary walks up to Lance, holding his right hand, \"Lance, I really liked the time we spent at the carnival. Really, I did. It's just, with Troy, he seems to know how to take care of himself and others. Plus, Troy really respected me and, I kinda saw more of it in him.\" Lance's expression seemed pretty down still. Mary holds up Lance's hand. \"Look, you're an awesome and outsanding guy. I'm sure you'll find someone who's more, active, than steady. It's kinda how I've been since living in the forest.\" Mary then gives Lance a quick kiss on his cheek. \"I promise I'll hold on to the prize you got me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance still looked pretty down, but then his face brightens for her, \"Hey, I get it. Like I said, don't worry about it too much. I'm happy for you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance pulls Mary in for one more hug, before they let go. Mary walks over to Troy, who then walks her over to her house. Hunter and Lance stare as the two and Mary's father walk off. Hunter walks up beside Lance. \"Hey, you doin' okay bud?\" Hunter stared at Lance for a short time, but then saw what looked like a tear running down Lance's right cheek. Hunter sets a hand on Lance's shoulder to comfort him, \"Hey, you holding out okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"!\" Lance quickly rubs his eye. \"Y-yeah. Yeah! Heh. Aw well. Guess you can't win them all huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter stares at Lance with a worried look on his face, \"... Yeah...\" Lance was staring down at the ground again. Hunter then wraps his thick right arm around Lance's wide back to pull him in for a hug. \"It's alright man.\"</span></div></div>",

He even cried!\" Trixie became concerned as well. She always like Lance for being so enthusiastically optimistic. She couldn't imagine Lance without his smile. \"Romance is a very complicated thing, Hunter.\" said Trixie. \"And its ending is never easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what should I do?\" asked Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try giving him some space for now.

Choosing either me or him. I'm sorry for putting you in that position. Besides, if it were the other way around, I would feel the same way.\" Mary pecked Troy on the cheek. \"It's okay. I really liked you both and I was really interested in the both of you when I first met you two.

Lance looks up at Hunter and Troy after reading, \"Hey, you guys should join in too. Whatcha think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and Troy shrug their shoulders, Hunter being the first to say, \"Eh. Why not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Haven't been in one of those in a while.\", Troy added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance raises his right arm in a flexing pose, \"You guys care to train a bit with me while you're here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I was thinking we spend some time together. Out of the gym.\", Hunter suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance lowers his arm, \"Huh? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and Troy chuckle at each other, and then Troy walks up behind Lance and pushes him towards the entrance, \"Because, you've done nothing but arm curls in here all morning. You should get some fresh air.\" The three of them are now out of the gym, walking in one direction. Troy wraps an arm around Lance's wide back. \"Let's go to the mall. Maybe we can grab a bite to eat while we're there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...\", Lance replies uncertainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter comes around the other side to wrap an arm around Lance's back as well. \"Yeah. Maybe even go shopping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance sighs. \"You guys...\" After a few minutes of walking, they were finally there. The first thing they did was eat. Hunter was eating a slice of pepperoni pizza, Troy eating a salad, and Lance eating a corndog. They even chatted a lot about what they've been up to, trying their best not to bring Mary into the conversation. At least, maybe not yet. Just so it doesn't bring up any bad memories. After a couple minutes of chatting and eating, the three just lied back on their seats, letting the food settle. Lance lets out a loud belch, \"Excuse me. So what did you guys want to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could go clothes shoppin'.\", Hunter replied happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\", Lance replies loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! You can use some new duds. I mean, you've pretty much only been wearing shirts and shorts lately.\", Troy added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\", Lance exclaimed.</span></div></div>",

Lance dragged his feet into the entrance. \"Come on, man!\" said Troy. \"It's not going to be that bad. Who knows? You might find a look you like.\" \"I don't know.\" said Lance. \"I just pick clothes that fit me. I don't pay attention to how I look.\" \"But it's very important you do.\" said Hunter. \"Shopping for big clothes can be difficult but not impossible.\" Troy smiled at Hunter. \"Trixie told you that, didn't she?\" \"Shut up!\" said Hunter blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and Troy skimmed through while Lance was waiting to get out of there next to the dressing roomm. The trip distracted him from Mary but the rhino was going from sad to impatient. Hunter and Troy made a pile of clothes for Lance to try on. The pile composed of jeans, t-shirts, and everything else that might look good on Lance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't know about this, guys.\" said Lance. Troy picked out jeans and a shirt and pushed them to the rhino's chest. \"Just shut up and put them on.\" said Troy. Lance did as he was told and walked into the dressing rooms. A few minutes later, Lance walked out in jeans that clearly defined his legs and a shirt that was close to shredding against his massive chest. \"I'm thinking to small.\" said Hunter. \"You think?\" said Lance. Troy picked up a bigger pair of jeans and a red polo shirt. \"Try these.\" he told Lance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few minutes Lance walked out again. His jeans actually fitted him. They still defined his thighs a bit but not as if they were about to be torn. The red polo looked great on him. It actually made him look a little bigger and more intimidating. Troy smiled at Lance. \"I like this look. Totally you!\" \"I agree!\" said Hunter. \"What do you think, Lance?\" The rhino turned to the mirror. He slowly smiled at the new him. He especially liked the polo. It was definitely not worth shredding with his muscles. \"I like it.\" said Lance. \"I really do!\" \"See?\" said Hunter. \"All you needed was a new look for you and everyone to see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio left the store with bags at hand. \"Any more ideas?\" asked Lance to Hunter and Troy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\"</span></div></div>",

He glances around a few times, just watching people walk by, minding their own business, shopping, etc. Lance even took notice of what looked like a young couple holding hands: A male white-furred wolf, and a female red fox. He stared at them for a short time, which caused him to think of Mary, but not making him feel as bad as he used to, thankfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just turns his head back, and sighs. All of a sudden, someone walks out of the bookstore, her eyes stuck to a book she had just bought. Without noticing, she sits down right next to Lance, which nearly caught him by surprise. \"Uh...\" Lance stares at the tall and slender cougar for the time being as her eyes lay fixiated in that book of hers. It had actually been about five minutes since she sat there, Lance waiting patiently to respond the whole time. \"Um, hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, she actually took notice. \"Oh! Uh, I'm, I'm sorry. I didn't know anyone was sittin' there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance holds a hand up, \"No, it's alright. You seemed really interested in that book so I didn't want to bother you.\" Lance took a closer look at the book she was reading. \"So, you into novels?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes.\", she says bookmarking the page she was left on.

Lance didn't know much about books personally because he's been pumping his body than his mind. However, nothing that god powers can't fix. With a thought, Lance became knowledgable in books. He and the cougar then had a friendly conversation. Lance even made her laugh a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about this, Hunter,\" said Troy. \"What if Lance gets serious with this girl and it doesn't work out? I can't stand Lance being sad again.\" Hunter was worried about this too. It scared him to see such a happy guy like Lance to be so depressed. Then again, Lance looked happy with the cougar. \"Let's give him a moment.\" said Hunter. \"This might just be what Lance needs.\" Troy was skeptic but agreed with Hunter's advice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" said the cougar, \"What do you do for fun?\" Lance smiled and flexed his arms to her. \"I'm a bodybuilder! I lift heavy weights and meet nice girls like you for fun.\" The cougar giggled and blushed a little bit by Lance's words and muscles. She had a thing for big guys. \"I'm Lance, by the way.\" said Lance offering his meaty hand to the cougar. \"Alecia.\" responded the cougar shaking Lance's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlecia felt connected to Lance. She couldn't explain why but she grew to like the giant rhino. \"So,\" started Lance, \"You going anywhere?\" \"Well, it's silly.\" said Alecia. \"No, come on, tell me. I won't laugh.\" Alecia still felt shy but told him anyway. \"I was going to go into the new candle shop that just opened.\" she said. Lance raised his brow in interest. That was the first time a girl showed interest in candles. \"Would you like to come along?\" Alecia asked. Lance answered almost instantly. \"Yeah, sure. That sounds like fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance turned around to see Troy and Hunter looking at him and Alecia. He felt embarrassed now but he knew they cared about him when it came to girls. \"Say,\" said Lance, \"I'm with some friends. Would it be okay if they came with us?\"</span></div></div>",

They both watched as Lance has a good time with Alecia, taking a look at different scented candles, but mostly chatting with each other.

Maybe you don't know him enough.\", Troy replies. \"Lance would do anything for chicks.

Anything to help out his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance was surprised in the candle shop. It was full of aromas that smelled great and interesting at the same time. It was actually nice to smell something different from the stench of sweat. Alecia picked a candle to another to sniff while Lance was still taking it all in. \"Hey, Lance,\" said Alecia, \"What do you think of this one?\" She held a purple shaded candle up to his chest. \"It's called 'Lavender Mountains.'\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance still wasn't sure about candle shops. Who would name their candles 'Lavender Mountains?' Regardless, for Alecia, Lance bended over the candle and sniffed. Surprisingly, it wasn't that bad. It smelled very fresh and relaxing. Lance couldn't explain how or why though. Maybe there was more to candles than he first thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" said Lance, \"I didn't expect that.\" \"I know!\" said Alecia. \"Me neither! I think I'm going to get it.\" As they continued browsing, Lance and Alecia continued talking. \"This is a really interesting place,\" said Lance. \"It's kinda nice to be in a place that doesn't smell like sweat and feet.\" Alecia laughed. \"I think you need to get out of the gym more often.\" she said.<br>\r\n\"Maybe. But I don't really know what else to do besides working out.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll show you how to have a good time if you show me.\"<br>\r\n\"Deal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance and Alecia finally walked out of the candle shop. \"Thanks for going in with me, Lance,\" said Alecia. \"I had a really good time.\" \"Me too.\" said Lance. \"Alecia, would you, um, like, to get together again sometime?\" \"I would love to!\" Alecia gave Lance his number and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance walked back to Hunter and Troy. \"So, how did it go?\" asked Hunter. \"It was awesome!\" said Lance. \"I never thought I'd have fun in a candle shop with a girl like Alecia. She's really cool!\" \"Are you going to see her again?\" asked Troy. \"You bet!\" answered Lance. \"She gave me her number so we can hang out again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter took a deep breath. \"Lance, I'm great you met Alecia, I really am. I'm just a little worried you're getting carried away with her. I just don't want you to get crushed by her like Mary.\" Lance shrugged a shoulder. \"Yeah, I'm a little worried about that. But I can't let that stop me. I want what you and Troy have and Alecia could be the one for me. I can't just let her go after today.\" Hunter understood how Lance felt. If he was in his shoes with Trixie, Hunter would have done the same thing. \"Okay,\" said Hunter. \"Just be careful.\"</span></div></div>",

I completely forgot about that. I would've invited Alecia to that too. Ah it's alright. I'll just let her know tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithing a couple minutes, Hunter and friends made it back to the gym. They each headed to the locker room, putting their stuff away and dressing into their own pair of tank-tops and gym shorts. For the next hour, they basically spent it working out together. Pumping iron, flexing muscle, gaining mass, etc. One thing was off though the entire time. It didn't smell like sweat at all. Troy and Hunter sniffed out what smelt like...lavendar mountains. Taking a look at a nearby bench, one of the candles Alecia was looking at before was lit on top of it. Troy and Hunter also noticed Lance, minding his own business while working out right next to the candle, and the looked back at each other, chuckling in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for Hunter and Troy, it was nice to see Lance happy once again. Working his heart out, even being competitive with each them. At one point during their workout, Lance went ahead and checked himself out in front of the mirror wall. He started flexing various muscle groups on his body, seeing the progress he was making yet again. After showing off for a bit, he rips his tank top clean off, and then challenged the two of them to a flex off. Troy was more than happy to go up against him first, pulling his tank top right off and flexing along side his buff buddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter just worked out on his own, keeping watch over the two of them while they competed to see who's muscles were best. It always seemed like a tie though, but it was also great practice for the competition next week. Suddenly, Hunter's phone rings. He puts down a 500-pound barbell he was lifting to answer it. \"Hello? Oh, hey Trixie. Lance? Yeah, he's doing great. Much much better as a matter of fact. What? You did? Wow, I'd love to. Alright. I'll see ya there.\" Hunter hangs up, and then turns to the flexing two, \"Trixie got tickets for a show. I'm gonna take off and meet her there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy walks over to his gym bag and grabs a towel, wiping his face. \"Yeah, I think it's time I get going too. Oh and Lance, you take care, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance finally relaxes his muscles. \"Hey, I'll be alright. That's why I've got you guys to keep me sane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and Troy grin back at lance. \"Didn't like the candle, but it was nice working out with ya anyway.\", Troy added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, least it's better than sweat!\", Lance remarked.</span></div></div>",

He then made his way to the theatre Trixie told him to meet her. When he entered the lobby, Hunter found Trixie in a sexy red dress. \"Trixie,\" said Hunter trying to get her attention. \"Hunter!\" she replied. \"I'm so glad you could make it!\" \"And miss my girl?\" said Hunter. \"No way! You look great in that dress.\" \"Thanks. You too in that suit. Just try not to rip it.\" Hunter blushed and chuckled in embarrassment. \"Well, let's get seats before they're filled.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and Trixie entered a giant theatre. hundreds of seats spread across the floor and balconies on the walls. \"What seats would you like?\" asked Trixie. Hunter looked around trying to find the perfect spot for them. \"I know just the spot.\" said Hunter. With a snap of his fingers, Hunter and Trixie found themselves on the center balcony facing directly at the stage. \"I think you're VIP material.\" said Hunter flirtfully. Trixie was amazed by their seats and Hunter. Trixie kissed her tiger god. \"I'm so glad I'm dating a god.\" she said. Hunter chuckled. \"Well I'm glad I'm dating a goddess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and Trixie enjoyed the show in their seats. They spent the night holding hands and Trixie lying on Hunter's chest. Since they were in the VIP section, it was deserted. They had the whole balcony to themselves. \"This is really nice.\" whispered Trixie. \"I know.\" said Hunter. \"I really like the show there and here.\" \"Oh, Hunter, stop it!\" Trixie said jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple stretched out once the play reached intermission. \"That play is getting really interesting.\" said Trixie. \"I really like the idea of the main character turning into a different species.\" Hunter agreed. \"Yeah, that is interesting.\" \"Say, Hunter,\" began Trixie, \"I was just wondering, um, could you turn into another species? That is, if you wanted to?\" \"I think so.\" answered Hunter. \"But I never tried. You wanna see?\" Trixie nodded excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Trixie was a vixen, Hunter thought he would try turning himself into a fox. Hunter closed his eyes and pictured himself as a fox. Right before Trixie's eyes, Hunter's fur turned into a darker orange and his stripes disappeared. His tail became thicker and bushier while his muzzle grew longer. Hunter still kept his muscles when he finished changing. When he opened his eyes, Hunter saw Trixie with her mouth open. \"How do I look?\" asked Hunter. \"You look amazing!\" They hugged and Trixie loved the feel of Hunter fur softer than before while keeping the sturdiness of his muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring their moment, the lights of the theatre darkened. \"Looks like the show's about to start again.\" said Hunter. \"Let's enjoy the show!\"</span></div></div>",

Why wouldn't I be?\" Hunter wanted to show off a bit to her, but he felt he didn't want to keep her attention from the play. Even with her wrapping her arms around him, she still kept her eyes locked on to the play. Hunter didn't want to worry about it too much. The play wasn't gonna last that long anyway. But for the time being, he would go ahead and tense his muscles under his large suit. Not enough to rip it of course, but enough for her to take notice of it while still hugging you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the last part of the play, the main character, which was a dragon, reveals himself to his love as originally being a mule. But his love, still takes him for being who he was, and of course being truthful to her. The scene even makes Trixie tear up a little. Hunter watches his love crying a bit onto your suit. He was okay with it of course. \"You know, this scene seems familiar, doesn't it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie looks up into Hunter's eyes, a tear running down her cheek. Hunter uses his hand to wipe it away. \"It does...\", Trixie replies tearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter pulls his love in for a big fox hug. This moment was so sweet for the two of them. \"Thanks for taking me for who I am.\", Hunter added warmly, Trixie crying a bit more in his thick arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the two lovebirds were out and about walking from the play. Luckily no one notices Hunter coming in as a tiger from the beginning. Trixie was still tearing a bit from the show. \"That play was great. Thanks for coming along with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\", Hunter replies happily. \"It's only 5 o'clock. Wanna head home? Or would you like to head out someplace else? It's getting a little stuffy being in this suit anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie knew where this was going, blushing a bit at the thought of it. It would be nice to see how Hunter looks under there, as a fox.</span></div></div>",

Trixie gave a small yelp in fear but disappeared as they landed. The top of the theatre was pretty with the lights flashing inwards and out. Hunter posed and asked Trixie, \"You ready for another show?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter grabbed both sleeves and ripped them at the same time. He then flexed and shredded his thickened and tensed arms. Hunter's biceps looked bigger from his fur's thickness. He then ripped his shirt to show his bumpy bare chest. He joked with Trixie by making his pecs bounce. Hunter then ripped the bottoms of his pants revealing strong and firm legs. Trixie was amazed by Hunter's muscles. She thought Hunter looked better as a fox because his fur really made his muscles look bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's muscles got even bigger as he posed. He tensed his arms upwards and downwards, shredded his abs and pecs making them more define, and flexed his legs to make them look like tree trunks. Trixie truly thought Hunter looked more like a god as a fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" said Hunter. \"I think you look fabulous!\" answered Trixie excitedly. \"Seriously, you look great as a fox! I suggest you keep this look.\" Hunter wasn't sure about that. Stay as a fox? Become a fox god rather than a tiger god? \"I don't know about that.\" replied Hunter. \"Well, you think about it.\" said Trixie. \"Right now, let's head home. I'm ready for bed. Without hesitation, Hunter picked Trixie up again and leaped building to building home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finally made it back to the room. \"Thanks again for the date,\" said Trixie. \"Good night.\" She closed the door to her room. Hunter also thought it was time for bed. He got into his room and stripped to his boxers. He paused to see himself in the mirror. Hunter was still a fox. Should he stay as a fox? His thick fur really did make his muscles look bigger than as a tiger but Hunter felt like that would be like giving up a part of himself. Hunter was sure Trixie would understand if he stayed as a tiger. But what to do?</span></div></div>",

With a quick snap of his fingers, black stripes stretched his body, his muzzle grew smaller, and thick fur thinned. Hunter was back to his normal self. He was sure Trixie would understand. He then got into his boxers and headed straight for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Hunter found Trixie in the kitchen. Trixie noticed Hunter as a tiger again. \"I see you're back into your stripes!\" she said. \"That okay?\" asked Hunter. \"Of course!\" answered Trixie. \"It was great seeing you as a fox but I like you just the way you are!\" She gave Hunter a quick kiss on the muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunter!\" Lance stomped his way across the room to the godly tiger. \"Hey Lance!\" said Hunter. \"How was your date with Alecia?\" \"Dude, she loves the muscle rhino!\" exclaimed Lance. \"We had a great dinner at this very nice coffee house and I got to show off some guns at the gym afterwords! She is so awesome!\" Hunter was thrilled to hear such great news from Lance. \"Great! I'm so happy for you!\" \"I'm happy for me too!\" said Lance. \"Well, I think I'm going to pump some more iron. See you guys later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lance seems to be in a better mood.\" commented Trixie. \"Yep. I think Alecia's going to be good for him.\" said Hunter. \"Say, I just had an idea.\" said Trixie. \"Since you, Lance, and Troy have girlfriends, you want to try doing a triple date?\" \"A triple date?\" said Hunter. \"I suppose we could. Where would we go?\" Trixie thought about it for a few seconds. \"How about a picnic on the beach? There will plenty of space for us and plenty of space for you all to show off for us!\" Hunter chuckled at the idea of showing off with Lance and Troy for their girls. \"I think that does sound like fun.\" said Hunter. \"Let's do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter walked into the gym to tell Lance the beach picnic plan. Lance was working out with Troy and they were really focused on it. \"Hey guys,\" said Hunter getting their attention, \"I know what we're going to do later!\" \"What?\" asked Troy. \"How would you guys feel about a triple date on a beach?\" \"That sounds awesome!\" said Lance. \"You know I'm all about the beach!\" Troy nodded agreeing with his friend. \"Great!\" said Hunter. \"Trixie and I were thinking about having it this evening when the beach is less crowded. Is there anything you guys want to do until then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance and Troy thought for a minute.</span></div></div>",

They agreed upon the working out part, but weren't sure of Lance's interpretation of 'pumping up'. Hunter stood up straight and tensed his chest a bit, \"I, think we're good just the way we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\", Troy added. \"I wouldn't want to overwhelm Mary too much.\" Troy chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah you two are killjoys. But I'm okay with that.\" Lance picks up the previous dumbbell he was repping with. Troy was previously lifting a 500-pound barbell, which he continues lifting to himself. Lance looks over to Hunter, \"Hey, aren't you gonna join in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter waves a hand at them, \"Yeah, yeah.

Afterwards, the three were drenched in sweat. Troy wipes his head with a small towel. \"Alright. Let's all take a quick shower. Then I guess we'll all meet on the beach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance jumps up, giving his arms a hard-earned flex. \"Alright! An evening on the beach with us and our gals!

I've seen enough tv shows to know that these sort of things don't always end well.\" Trixie giggled. \"Don't worry. It'll be fine. This isn't a tv show, Hunter.\" \"You got a god for a boyfriend. I think we're not that far from one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys!\" Hunter and Trixie saw the rest of the group already at the picnic spot. Lance, Alecia, Troy, and Mary were sitting next to a fire while wearing their swim suits. Troy was sitting on a log with a guitar in his hands while Lance and Alecia were dancing to the music he was making. \"Hey, you all!\" replied Hunter. \"Troy, I didn't know you played the guitar!\" \"I did as of a few minutes ago.\" Troy answered telepathically. \"Oh, nevermind.\" said Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie was getting aquainted with Alecia and Mary. They all seemed to like each other fine. Maybe this won't be a disaster triple date.

This is what they get for having a meathead for a friend. But their giant rhino friend made an excellent point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, Lance, and Troy got up in a row getting ready for a muscle show. Hunter raised his arms upward while Lance downward. They both tensed and defined their biceps and triceps while Troy puffed up his already rippled chest. Alecia could see a giant grin on Lance's face to match his giant muscles. Lance went so far to impress by stretching out his legs and flexing them until veins popped out of them. Hunter curled his arm towards Trixie with a sexy smile and Troy tensed his wings to Mary. For the grand finale, the muscle trio flexed all the muscles in their bodies all at once. The girls were madly impressed by such an amazing feat that they clapped and cheered for their men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was great!\" said Alecia. \"You were great, Lance!\" Mary responded by smooching on Troy's cheek and Trixie jumped into Hunter's arms. \"Thanks, girls!\" said Lance. \"Hey guys, could I talk to you all for a sec?\" It was a bit random but Hunter and Troy agreed and followed Lance until the girls were out of sight. \"What's up?\" asked Troy. \"Getting nervous?\" \"No!\" said Lance. \"I'm doing great! I just had a thought.\" \"Hope it didn't hurt!\" said Hunter jokingly. Lance slapped him in the back of the head. \"It's serious!\" Lance insisted. \"Well, you how Trixie knows about Hunter being a god? Well, what if we told Alecia and Mary about us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and Troy were surprised to hear what Lance just said. \"I don't know, man.\" said Troy. \"What if they can't handle it? What if they freak out?\" \"We can always erase their memories so they won't know.\" said Lance. \"But if you want to have a serious relationship with Alecia, Lance, she's bound to know sooner or later.\" said Hunter. \"I didn't mean to start anything.\" replied Lance. \"It's just a thought. I feel like I can really trust Alecia and I know you guys feel the same way about Trixie and Mary. What do you guys think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" expressed Troy. \"Sounds pretty risky.

They wondered what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" asked Hunter. \"Oh nothing,\" said Trixie, \"Just playing a little game of truth or dare.\" Lance was thinking, \"Aren't they a little old to play that?\" until Troy elbowed him in the abs. \"You guys want to join us?\" asked Mary. \"Unless you guys want to do something more manly that is.\" \"No, not at all!\" said Lance. \"We'd love to join you!\" \"Are you serious, Lance?\" said Hunter telepathically. \"Truth or dare?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you told me I need to get to know Alecia more.

Top of her class, popular, everything a guy could ask for. \"Well,\" shrugged Hunter, \"There was this one other girl before I met Trixie.\" The crowd gasped in response. \"What was her name?\" asked Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tanya.

I love you very much, dear!\" said Hunter under the domestic pain. \"Please let go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie did so and everyone laughed at Hunter.

He can do whatever he puts his mind to!\" Hunter and Troy weren't worried about their friend but he better hurry up before the girls begin to seriously worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group then heard water crashing and a massive rhino emerging with two handfull of fish. Lance held them by the tails as he raised them up and yelled, \"Fish fry!\" Alecia and the girls clapped and cheered for Lance and his another amazing feat. The boys put the fish on sticks to let them cook by the fire. They all stopped their game to relax by the fire and see their fish crisp. They all sat by their according mates. Alecia wrapped herself around her rhino's chest feeling all the strength he could possibly hold. She pecked him on the cheek. \"Is there anything you can't do?\" Alecia asked Lance softly. \"Not yet.\" Lance answered. They then kissed passionately and didn't care everyone was watching them.</span></div></div>",

Troy then pulls out his guitar and starts singing and playing to everyone. Mary even joined Troy in a duet for one song.

The girls got together wondering what their boyfriends were planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" asked Hunter. \"You're going to think I'm crazy,\" said Troy.

Trixie, Mary, and Alecia laughed at this sight and Hunter responded with a look of great distain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is what you wanted us to see?\" asked Trixie.

He then spewed fire from his scaly lips directly at Hunter! The girls, Lance, and Hunter gasped in fear at the great flames. \"Are you crazy?!\" asked Trixie. \"You're going to barbaque my boyfriend!\" \"Don't worry, Trixie,\" said Lance. \"Troy knows what he's doing.\" After about a minute, Troy spat out his last drops of fire and Hunter went from a heap of sand to a block of glass! Troy melted the sand around Hunter to make glass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were amazed but Trixie was still horrified. \"You okay, Hunter?\" asked Troy. \"Yeah, I'm fine,\" Hunter answered. \"You wanted to show us putting my boyfriend in glass?\" said Trixie. Troy winked. \"Yep! Give them the grand finale, Hunter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter knew what to do next. He gritted his teeth and tried to move his frozen limbs in the glass. At first, there was nothing. Then Hunter heard faint glass cracking and it got louder for everyone to hear. The glass exploded as Hunter stretched out his arms and legs in a sexy pose. Everyone cheered for Hunter and Troy for the neat trick and Trixie apologized to Troy for doubting him. \"I gotta admit, Troy,\" said Hunter telepathically, \"This was a pretty cool trick!\" \"Yep!\" Troy responded. \"I know what the ladies love best!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie hugged Hunter around his huge waist. \"I'm so glad you're okay.\" she said.

Trixie clapped her hands in joy and excitemet. \"You might wanna stand back just to be on the safe side,\" he told her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike before when he turned into a fox, Hunter tensed his muscles and imagined himself turning into a dragon. All of a sudden, his fur melted onto his skin and hardened into scales. His orange color and stripes remained. His tail grew longer and thickened to the size of a tree trunk. His muzzle grew longer as well as the claws on his hands and feet. Then dubs emerged from his back and grew into giant wings with the span of seven feet! For the final touch, Hunter grew more teeth and sharpened them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie was amazed to see an orange striped dragon in front of her now. Hunter was impressed himself. His new scales defined his muscles better than ever before, even as a fox. He raised his arms high and flexed them. \"What do you think?\" Trixie was speechless; she could barely get a sentence out. She finally yelled out, \"You look amazing! Look at your scales! Your wings! Your muscles! I swear they're bigger than when you were a tiger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled at her compliments. \"If you think I look good, check this out!\" He raised his head to night sky and flew fire to the stars. Trixie couldn't contain her excitement at such a site. She hugged Hunter tight feeling his warm but cool scaly muscles on his chest. \"You are so amazing, Hunter,\" she said. \"I'm glad I met you!\" \"I'm glad I met you too,\" replied Hunter. \"How about we fly home?\" Trixie nodded yes excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter picked up Trixie to his pecs and Trixie wrapped her arms around his neck. \"Don't worry,\" said Hunter, \"I won't drop you!\" Hunter spread his wings and squatted his thunderous legs. In a single jump, Hunter and Trixie were in the air riding the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie felt startled from the leap and the sudden air rushing through her face. She held to her new dragon boyfriend tightly and felt safe under his strength. Trixie looked at Hunter's new face and he smiled at her with his new dragon teeth. She began to really love his new dragon form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Hunter landed with a thump on their room's balcony. Hunter put Trixie down and she was still mesmerized by him. \"You okay?\" Hunter asked. \"Yeah,\" answered Trixie, \"I'm just still blown away. You're really amazing, Hunter, especially as a dragon. Feel free to change into one whenever you like!\" Hunter chuckled shyly making his chest ripple. \"Well, I think I'll head off to bed,\" said Hunter. \"I'm really tired.\" Trixie gave a quick peck on the scaly cheek. \"In that case, good night, Hunter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter remained a dragon as he changed to his boxers ready for bed. He then looked at himself in his mirror. He really did look good as a dragon. Really really good. With his giant muscles and wings, Hunter felt like he could do anything.

Trixie then drops her hand to the floor to recooperate for a bit, and then turns around to hear her love breathing in and out beside her while lying on his side. Thinking Hunter was still fast asleep, she slowly reaches a hand to feel what turned out to be Hunter's strong and thick chest. \"Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon taking a closer look, and feel, Hunter's skin was still all hard and scaley from last night. Looks like Hunter decided not to change back after all. She didn't mind of course. She instead feels Hunter's monstrous pecs and hardened abs, wanting to a good feel of it all.

I just thought this was a nice look.\" Hunter holds his arms in front of his chest and tenses his thick arms, \"Much nicer than a tiger, or a fox.\" Hunter stopped to look at Trixie, and then lowers his head to scratch it. \"Uh, no offense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie stared at Hunter, and then chuckles again, throwing her arms around as much of Hunter's wide and dragon-like body as she could. \"Oh Hunter, you can never offend or make me mad.\" She then backs away from Hunter on the bed. \"Besides, I think you look, sexier, like this.\", she blushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter blushes a bit as well. He then turns around so he could set he feet on the floor. \"Hey, Trixie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Yeah Hunter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you can massage my back a bit? It's still a little sore from last night.\", Hunter asks spreading his back and wings as much as he could so Trixie could get a good look at Hunter's magnificent back muscles as they rippled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie grins. \"Heh. Sure.\" Trixie walks up to Hunter on her knees, and then works her hands around Hunter's back, feeling and massaging as much of Hunter's amazing muscles as she could. \"So, are you really sore? Are do you just want someone to give you a massage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, gods get tired too.\", you reply with a smirk. \"I guess I flew around a little too much last night. Plus, you would also get to feel more of this handsome hunk if you did, and here you are now.\" Hunter flexes his muscles a few times in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie giggles once again. \"And, how long are you expecting to be a dragon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a few seconds for Hunter to respond. \"Eh. Just a little while longer maybe. Definitely not long enough for the others to find out.

Let's get dressed and fly over there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie put on a red blouse and jeans and waited for Hunter.

Hunter placed Trixie down who was still stunned from their flight. \"So, what do you want to do?\" asked Hunter. \"It such a beautiful day,\" said Trixie. \"Let's just go for a walk.\" Hunter couldn't agree more. He offered his giant claw hand to Trixie and they began to walk around the green lush around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe happy couple walke for all to see. Other folks stared at Hunter and his muscular chest. They all wondered how someone could have large muscles like that. Trixie made girls jealous by hugging Hunter and rubbing his abs.

He decided to take advantage of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter found a thick branch of a nearby tree. \"Want to see something cool?\" he asked Trixie. \"You know I do!\" she answered. Hunter walked underneath the branch and jumped to grab hold of it. He then began doing pull ups on it. A group began to form around Trixie to see a monstrous dragon doing such a feat. They all could see Hunter's arm and chest muscles tensing and shredding between each rep. After about thirty reps, Hunter let go with a solid thump to the ground. The crowd cheered for Hunter and Trixie rushed to hug her man. \"You never cease to amaze me!\" said Trixie. Hunter didn't say anything. All he could do was blush.</span></div></div>",

In a matter of seconds, Hunter and Trixie were gone. As for the two lovebirds, they were soaring through the sky at a pretty fast speed. Trixie was curious to where Hunter was taking her. \"What was your idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter kept his attention towards the sky in front of them. Trixie waited patiently for an answer, but then felt as if she was ignored. \"Sorry. We're here now. Just look down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie looked down, and was amazed. Right below them was the ocean. She wasn't sure if it was the pacific ocean, the atlantic ocean, or any other ocean for that matter. It was just...the open waters. \"Uh...where are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter then comes to a sudden, but easy stop. What was right below them turned out to be an island. It wasn't big, but it was definitely big enough for two people to have an easy living. Alone. It was mainly populated by a sandy shore, a small, but livable forest, and strangly, a small dock. \"I just thought we could use some alone and relaxation time.\" Hunter lowers himself down for a smooth landing, and then sets Trixie down on her feet. \"What do ya think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie takes a moment to look around. \"Has, this place been populated before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably. If there's a dock here for whatever reason.\" Hunter walks along with her, skimming around the area to see only a few small beach and forest animals pass by. \"Do you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie takes a moment to look around some more, breathing in the fresh sea air. \"It's...just beautiful.\" She then turns around to face Hunter. \"Heh. So, did you feel we got too much attention back at the park?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shrugs his broad shoulders, \"Nah. Okay, maybe. I just thought we could use some more alone time in a place like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie tilts her head a bit, \"So...why here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter starts to blush. \"Well...'cause then I wouldn't be able to do this around you.\" To Trixie's surprise, Hunter pulls off the pair of jeans he was wearing, now wearing only his speeds and showing some impressive dragon thighs and calves. \"What do ya think?\", Hunter asks with a proud toothy grin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie blushes. \"Huh... Being a dragon sure has brought a lot of confidence in you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh heh.\" You still were blushing even more.</span></div></div>",

He loved it show much Hunter wanted to show Trixie. \"You know what my muscles look like,\" said Hunter to Trixie, \"But how do they feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter raised an arm to flex a bicep. Trixie was stunned to see such raw power and strength underneath his scales. She could also see veins stretching across providing Hunter's muscles their power. Trixie couldn't help but feel them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie reached out her hand across Hunter's bicep. His scales felt cool to the touch but Trixie could feel warmth deep under them. She couldn't really explain it but it felt as if there was something inside Hunter's arm waiting to come out. Whatever it was, it was sealed in thick and strong tendons and strands of dragon god muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie was amazed. His arm was the hardest thing she ever felt. She stroked her hand up his arm to his shoulder then his pecs. Trixie loved the sensation of muscle underneath her palms. As she had her hand on Hunter's pecs, Trixie could feel Hunter's heart beating hard. She could tell it was beating hard because it was healthy and bringing blood to his powerful muscles but it was also beating out of love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Trixie felt Hunter's abs, she wrapped him around her arms. \"I don't need to feel the rest of you,\" said Trixie, \"You are amazing! Simply amazing that I am so thankful that you're here with me.\" Hunter raised her head up to his. \"I'm glad you're here with me too,\" said Hunter. He then bent over and kissed the girl of his dreams. Trixie returned the favor by providing passion to their love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they knew it, Hunter and Trixie saw it was sunset. They lied down in the sand in each other's arms mesmerized by the orange sunlight. \"This was really nice, Hunter,\" said Trixie. \"It was,\" he replied. \"I had a great time!\"<br>\r\n\"Hunter, I've been thinking...\"<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, you're so wonderful as a dragon. Have you thought maybe you could stay this way for good?\"<br>\r\nHunter was surprised about Trixie's question. He could but did he want to? \"I don't know, Trixie,\" he said. \"What will the guys think?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, you said they're gods too, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n\"Then I'm sure they'll understand. You don't have to if you don't want to, Hunter. I was just curious if you thought about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, Hunter did think about it and still wasn't sure. I guess now's the time for him to make a decision. What will it be?</span></div></div>",

It was definitely a nice thought to be a dragon, but, he still felt he should stick to his true animal form. \"Nah, sorry Trixie. I'm just gonna stick around as a tiger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter sees a small frown on Trixie's face, but then it went back to a smile. \"Okay. It's no big deal really. If that's your choice, then that's your choice.\" Trixie stares at Hunter for a while, but didn't know what she was staring at him for. \"Aren't, you gonna turn back to your tiger self?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Hunter chuckles. \"I said I wanted to stay as a tiger, but I didn't say I was gonna turn back right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie blinks her eyes, \"Oh. Okay.\" Trixie grins, and then wraps her arms around Hunter's sides. \"So, what're we gonna do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna gather some firewood?\", Hunter asks. \"I'll go catch some fish and treat us to a nice dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie looks up at Hunter. \"We're gonna eat fish again? I didn't even get to eat breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Hunter looks away, \"Well... If you prefer something else...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie tries to give Hunter a hug again. It wasn't much, but Hunter still felt it. \"It's okay. Maybe we can combine it. But, I'd rather not get the stuff all myself. You help me with the wood, I'll help you with the fish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter stares at Trixie, but knew where she was going with this. Hunter would take any time and any moment to show Trixie his raw muscle power. \"Alright.\" Hunter stands up, Trixie standing up along with him. \"Let's go get that firewood.\" Hunter and Trixie take a stroll in the forest. It wasn't that big, and it wasn't that dark once they entered it either. Which is a good thing. Trixie spots a few twig and thin pieces of wood, but it wasn't really good enough to build a decent fire. As for Hunter, he was strolling along with her, looking up different trees. Suddenly, Hunter points outward, \"There!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie looked out to where Hunter pointed. It turned out to be a rather large oak tree. Trixie was rather surprised at Hunter's choice of lumber. \"Uh, we're just building a campfire. Not a chimney.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter walks off, \"Too late, I've already made my choice.\" Hunter walks up to the tree, rubbing his hands together. He then grips the tree with both palms, tensing his arm muscles right out as he started to pull onto the tree. \"Grrr!\" Trixie was enticed with the amount of dragon power Hunter was using just for a tree. Seeing Hunter's body ripple and shred, showing such definition she never thought anyone could obtain. In a matter of seconds, the tree was ripped right out of its roots, \"Raaaugh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie cheers, making a cheerleader-like pose, \"Woo-hoo! Go Hunter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie runs up to Hunter to give him another warm hug. It, lasted for a quite some time. \"Uh, Trixie, I'm still holding the tree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little longer.\"</span></div></div>",

Hunter gave her another toothy grin. \"Like this!\" He stretched out his hand and karate chopped the tree in half! Trixie gasped for air at this feat but Hunter wasn't done. He chopped the tree more and more until the wood pieces were firewood size. \"Wow!\" said Trixie, \"Just when I think I've seen all you can show me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and Trixie walked back to the beach. Hunter dumped the firewood into a pile and puffed up his chest. Trixie remembered Troy doing the same thing at the triple date. Hunter sprayed the wood with fire creating a pillar bright enough to see the ocean in the dark. Trixie wasn't sure to look at the fire or at her dragon boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm going to get the fish,\" said Hunter. \"Be right back!\" \"Just don't take as long as Lance did!\" Trixie yelled. Hunter chuckled and dove into the ocean waves. The water felt great to Hunter. It felt cool against his scales while feeling the warmth of his muscles. Each stroke Hunter did made him swim faster and faster against the ocean currents. He even swam with his wings open for even more speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fish swam quickly across the hulking dragon. Hunter didn't hesitate in catching them. With god-like reflexes, Hunter grabbed fish with his bare hands, tail, even teeth! Hunter figured he caught enough after grabbing a dozen fish. He turned around and swam back to shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie waited for her man by the fire. She got excited after seeing Hunter walking back to shore with water streaming down in muscles. \"Wow!\" exclaimed Trixie after seeing Hunter's catch, \"Don't you think you caught too much fish?\" Hunter rubbed the back of his neck. \"Yeah, I guess I got carried away a bit,\" he said. \"Don't worry, I'll finish what you don't eat.\"<br>\r\n\"You sure? That's a lot of fish.\"<br>\r\nHunter flexed his arms to her emphasizing the power she previously felt. \"Yeah, trust me, this body can take away a ton of food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and Trixie laid down cuddling each other while eating their fish on a stick. Trixie hugged Hunter tighter feeling his abs. \"This is really wonderful, Hunter,\" she said. \"You're wonderful!\" Hunter smiled down at her. \"Not as wonderful as you! Seriously, you've been very good to me and kept my secret of being a god. I really appreciate that, Trixie. I really do. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n\"Hunter, what's gotten into you?\"<br>\r\n\"Nothing. I just love you so much.\"<br>\r\n\"I love you too.\"<br>\r\nHunter and Trixie revealed the affections by kissing each other on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, their moment was interrupted as the sunlight dimmed. \"What's going on?\" said Hunter. He looked up to see the sun was being blocked by a dark cloud followed by a series of dark ominous clouds. \"I think it's going to rain,\" said Trixie. \"What do we do?\" Hunter thought about it and came up with a plan.</span></div></div>",

It seemed he was really disappointed by the sudden change in weather. \"Um... You could just change the weather, can't you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah...\", Hunter replies. \"But, that'd be kinda tough. What with the amount of energy it's gonna take and people not noticing. I just don't wanna take that chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie thinks to herself some more. \"Hmm...\" It was soon starting to sprinkle around them, \"Well then, maybe you can build a shelter. That shouldn't be too hard, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's smile suddenly returns. \"Hm. Now that, I CAN do.\" Hunter gets right up, quickly running into the forest. Trixie gets up, hearing chopping and ripping bark sounds come from the forest area. The wind was starting to pick up as well, but Hunter was already running back to her. He also brought along a couple large pieces of lumber. \"Just one sec.\" Trixie waits patiently, a lot of hammering and nailing being heard as she does. \"Done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\" Sitting in front of the fox was a small, but well-proportioned house. For just being made out of lumber, and a god's wits, it certainly looks sustainable. \"What were all those hammering and nailing sounds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My hands.\" Hunter looks at them, \"They feel really hard as a dragon.\" The wind was really starting to pick up now. \"Come on! This huddle should keep us safe.\" Trixie grabs Hunter's meaty palm, and then takes a seat along with him inside the hastly built shelter. Upon sitting inside, all they were surrounded with were the sounds of raindrops ramming the shelter like bullets, and wind gusts picking up at a high rate of speed. Hunter could feel Trixie starting to shake up beside him. He then wraps one of his lengthy wings around Trixie's body. \"Don't worry. If something does happen, I'll be here to protect ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie inches her body closer to Hunter's, wrapping her arms around Hunter's titanic body. \"Mm...

Trixie stood up from Hunter's reach. \"It stopped raining already?\" she said. \"Huh,\" said Hunter, \"That's weird.\" Hunter and Trixie walked out to see the rain did stop but the ominous clouds remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Hunter enjoyed Trixie's company on this mini vacation, he assumed the rain was a signal that the vacation was over. \"How about we head back home before it decides to rain again?\" said Hunter to Trixie. \"Yeah,\" Trixie answered, \"I don't like the look of this weather. But it was great while it lasted!\"<br>\r\n\"Glad you think so! Come on, let's go home.\"<br>\r\nHunter picked up his girl to his chest again and sailed to the skies once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie found herself at the familiar balcony Hunter whisked her off from. Hunter gently placed her down. \"That was really great, Hunter,\" said Trixie. \"You sure you don't want to stay as a dragon?\" Hunter remembered what he said earlier about being a tiger. Although he loved his tiger form, Hunter loved being a dragon too. \"I'm not sure anymore,\" said Hunter. \"I'll let you know later.\" Trixie hugged her dragon man and pecked him on the cheek. \"You don't have to stay a dragon if you don't want to,\" said Trixie. \"Whatever you decide, I'll still love you!\" Hunter blushed. \"Thanks, sweetie. That means a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie yawned. \"I think I'm going to take a nap. All of today's excitement has got me all sleepy.\" \"Okay,\" said Hunter, \"Sleep well!\" Trixie waved and walked back to her room. Hunter thumped his way to the couch and collapsed. His wing muscled ached from flying and his arms were tired from all trees he heaved. But it was all worth it to see Trixie smile. Hunter laid back on the couch daydreaming about Trixie and the smile that he loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the heck are you?!\" Hunter jumped off the couch to see Lance and Troy behind him. \"Get out of here before we make you!\" yelled Lance. \"Guys, wait!\" said Hunter. \"I't me! Hunter!\" Troy and Lance's eyes widened. \"Hunter?\" said Lance, \"What are you doing stealing Troy's look?\"<br>\r\n\"I didn't steal his look! Back at the triple date, Trixie was curious about what I would look like as a dragon so I became one for her. I spent the day with her like this.\"<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" expressed Troy, \"I gotta admit you do look good as a dragon.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, Trixie's been asking me to keep this dragon look. I told her I want to stay as a tiger but now I'm not so sure.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Hunter landed in front of the gym, he felt worried about the contest.  He may have been a God, but Troy was as well.  He did not know what kind of contest this would be, or what kind of tricks the other dragon would pull off.  Shrugging it off, Hunter entered the Iron Abs Gym.  He felt the name was fitting.  When he entered, he say Lance, Troy, Mary, Alecia and Trixie.  Everyone wanted to watch.  \"Hang on, I need to change.\"  Both Troy and Hunter said.  As they entered the locker room, Troy said, \"No using our powers until after the competition.  That way, this will be fair.\"  \"Okay Troy.  I have a question.  What are we doing in this competition?\"  Hunter inquired.  \"Strength and posing.  Nothing too difficult for an 8 time Mr. Furlympia.\"  It's been so long since that last competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 minutes later, both of the dragon Gods were in their Speedos.  \"Hello ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome to the Dragon-off.  Who will be the stronger and bigger dragon?  Me?  Or Hunter?  Let's find out.\"  Troy immediately walked over to the barbell, and loaded it with as much weight as he could fit.  25 tons.  These bars were meant for squats.  The curling bard only went up to 5 tons.  Not nearly enough to challenge two Gods.  Then, he curled it with ease.  \"Well Troy, if that's what you're starting with, I think I'll play your game.\"  Hunter loaded two barbells with 25 tons, and curled one in each hand.  \"Easy as pie.  Beat that Troy.\"  Hunter beamed.  \"Well, seeing how my hands cannot fit more than one barbell in it, I'll just do what you did.\"  Troy did.  \"You're right Hunter, this is easy.  Almost too easy.\"  He immediately flew to the pull up bar, and started to do vertical sit ups, still holding the two barbells.  Hunter followed suit.  \"Stop Troy.\"  Troy did.  \"Okay, from this point, the first to 1000 sit ups wins the strength portion.\"  \"Okay.  Lance, can you begin the countdown?\"  Troy asked.  \"Sure.  3, 2, 1, go!\"  The two muscular dragons started, and never stopped.  20 minutes later.  \"DONE!\"  Both dragons exclaimed simultaneously.  \"Okay, so the strength portion is a tie.  Let's see whose muscles are bigger.\"  The two flexed their behemoth muscles.  Then, Lance took out a tape measure.  \"Hunter's biceps are...  42 inches.  Troy's are...  42 inches.  You're biceps are the same size.\"  Lance said.  \"Okay, but how about our chests?\"  Troy asked.  \"Okay.  Hunter's chest is...  103 inches.  Troy.  You're chest is 103 as well.  It's another tie.\"  Lance worryingly said.  \"Well.  It seems we are equal.  I honestly do not mind.\"  Troy decided.  \"Actually, let's arm wrestle.  That would be fun.\"  \"Okay Troy, let's do this.\"  The two found a place to wrestle, clasped each other's hands, and began.  Their biceps exploded to their full 42\" and vascularity.  Their biceps looked like a road map of veins.  After 5 minutes, nothing happened, and the let go.  \"Wow, we really are equals.\"  \"Troy, that was fun.\"  \"Yeah.  It was.\"  The two muscle dragons left to go to the locker room to change back into their normal clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Troy!\"  Mary yelled.  \"One minute Mary.\"  Troy responded.  Soon, the two dragons were changed and reunited with the group.  \"How did you become so strong?\"  Mary asked.  \"Um, it's a long story.\"  Hunter knew that he was going to admit to his God status.  \"I have an idea.  One night, Trixie and I found a nice island.  Let's go there.\"  \"Great idea Hunter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two dragons flew themselves and their friends to the island.  \"Okay, there's something the guys need to tell you three.\"  Hunter said.  Trixie knew what was coming.  \"Each of us are omnipotent Gods.\"  \"Well.\"  Mary said.  \"That is awesome.  My boyfriend is a God.\"  \"Same!\"  Alecia exclaimed.  \"I told Trixie a while ago,\"  Hunter said.  \"Wait, if you three are Gods, prove it.\"  Mary suggested.  \"Okay.\"  Troy answered.  First, Troy changed the cabin Hunter built on his last visit into a large mansion.  Then, Hunter changed himself back into a tiger.  Finally, Lance changed into a dragon.  \"Is this proof enough?\"  Hunter asked, while changing himself back into a dragon.  \"Yes.  But, I have two requests.\"  Trixie interjected.  \"First, seeing how we have a beautiful mansion here, why don't we all live here together.  We're always together anyway.  Plus, furnishing, internet and electricity could be magically created with our boyfriend Gods.  Next, can you change me into a dragon too Hunter?\"  \"Okay.  I don't see why not.\"  With a snap of a finger, Trixie transformed into a red dragon, complete with wings, tail, and draconic features.  \"Now I can get here anytime.\"  \"How about we all become dragons?\"  Lance suggested.  \"OKAY!\"  The others yelled.  Soon, the island, now known as God's Island by the six, was inhabited by 6 dragons.  \"I can get used to this.\"  Lance, the now grey dragon, said.  He also changed himself to be as muscular as Troy and Hunter.  \"Wait.\"  Alecia said.  \"I know in mythology, Gods sometimes disguise themselves as mortals to check on Earth.  Do you have 'God Forms'?\"  \"Now yet, but we an make them.\"  Troy responded.  \"I think I know what they would be.\"  Trixie started.  \"I think that your God forms should be like, 10 feet tall, really muscular, and glowing a gold color.\"  \"That works for me.\"  Hunter said.  Soon, he changed into that.  He grew to 10 feet in height, doubled the size of his muscles, and changed his scales to a bright gold color.  \"Does this look God-ish?\"  He asked.  \"Yes.\"  Everyone said.  \"I wonder how strong this form is.\"  Troy broke in.  \"As strong as you want it to be.\"  Hunter responded, as he reverted back to his \"Mortal Form\".  \"I personally wonder how strong this form is.\"  \"Let's find out.\"  Lance suggested.  The six dragons entered the mansion, and walked to the designated gym room.  \"First, magical equipment.  This will let you set it to whatever weight you want.\"  With a snap of Troy's fingers, equipment appeared.  \"First, let's bench.\"  Troy walked over to the bench press, set the weight to 100 tons, and benched.  \"Okay, 100 tons is too easy.\"  Troy bragged.  \"I could probably curl this in one hand.\"  \"Hey Troy, the machine seems to have a percent mode.  That probably means a certain percentage of your max.\"  Lance said.  \"Set it to 100\"  Troy beamed.  Lance did, and Troy benched.  He could only do one rep before feeling like his arms would fall off.  \"Wow, that's a new feeling.  How much weight was that.\"  \"1000 tons.\"  \"Holy crap.  I just benched 1000 tons?  I'm stronger than I thought.\"  \"Anyway Troy, my turn.\"  Lance said.  \"Wait Lance, the three of us are equally strong.  So, we each should test an exercise.\"  Hunter suggested.  \"That makes sense.  Since Troy just went, I'll go with squat.\"  \"I'll do deadlift.\"  \"I'll wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three muscle dragons worked out as their girlfriends watched.  \"Okay.  We've compiled a list of all our results.\"  Hunter quipped.  \"Here it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 kt = 1000 tons.<br>\r\nBench:  1 kt<br>\r\nSquat:  1.5 kt<br>\r\nDeadlift:  1.75 kt<br>\r\nCurling:  400 tons per arm.  800 tons using both.<br>\r\nLats/Pull ups:  750 tons.<br>\r\nAbs machine:  50 kt<br>\r\nRunning/Flying speed:  Mach 3<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuscle Size Measurements:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiceps:  42\"<br>\r\nChest:  106\"<br>\r\nWaist:  45\"<br>\r\nThighs:  67\"<br>\r\nCalves:  47\"<br>\r\nForearms:  34\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.  You're abs seem really strong.\"  Alecia observed.  \"Yeah.  When growing our muscles, it seems our abs became unnaturally strong in comparison to the rest of them.\"  Troy added.  \"How much do you weigh.\"  Mary asked.  \"1 ton of pure muscle.\"  Hunter answered.  \"Our bodyfats are 0%.\"  \"I wish I was as strong as you Hunter.\"  Trixie said.  \"Maybe I can train you one day.\"  Hunter said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe six left the Gym, and walked around the rest of the mansion.  They chose their bedrooms, Trixie sleeping with Hunter, Alecia with Lance, and Mary with Troy.  \"This was a good day.\"  Hunter laughed.  \"Yes it was.  I love you Hunter.  You may be a God, but you're my God.\"  Trixie chuckled.  \"As a God, I can do whatever I want.  But I never know what to do.\"  \"Maybe tomorrow, we can walk around the island and explore.  Find a good place to make a pool.\"  \"That sounds fun Trixie.  Anyway, good night.\"  \"Good night Hunter.\"  Trixie fell asleep using Hunter's pecs as a pillow.  Despite their diamond hardness, they were comfortable.  The 7'7\" dragon stretched his body, yawned, and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Hunter woke up feeling different, but good.  He got up, and did his morning routine.  First was a quick flex in the mirror.  That's when he noticed why he felt different.  He looked bigger.  Hunter made a tape measure appear, and measured his height.  \"8 feet exactly.  When did I grow 5 inches?\"  Hunter wondered.  He then measured his bicep.  51\"  In fact, all of his muscles were 20% bigger.  Using his God mind, he calculated that he was two times stronger than yesterday, that he weighed 1.2 tons now, and that his bodyfat was negative somehow.  \"Trixie?  Do you notice anything different about me?\"  Hunter yelled for Trixie.  \"Yes, you seem bigger.  Also, liking the 12 pack.\"  Trixie responded.  \"Do you know why I'm bigger?\"  \"No.\"  \"Actually, Troy, Lance and I made a pact yesterday that if one of us grew, all of us would grow to the same size/strength.  Something tells me that someone grew.  Anyway, something else is weird.  Somehow, my bodyfat is negative.  I have a bodyfat percentage of -5%.  I think Troy would know why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Troy, why is my bodyfat -5%, and what does that mean?\"  Hunter asked Troy.  \"Well, Lance wanted to see what would happen.  Turns out that having negative bodyfat is amazing.  While you were asleep, we learned that having negative bodyfat made our bodies literally indestructable, somehow.  Take that knife, and try to stab me anywhere.\"  Hunter did as he was told.  He took the kitchen knife, and stabbed Troy in the abs, inbetween the the two columns of 6.  The knife bent and broke, leaving no mark on Troy's body.     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"That's not the only thing too.  Besides being pretty much indestructible, I felt no pain at all.  On top of that,it made our muscles look even more ripped.\"  Hunter noticed that Troy's abs looked much more vascular than yesterday.  In fact, his whole body was covered with veiny bumps.  \"Wow, this is nice.\"  Hunter added.  He made a gun appear out of nowhere, and show himself in the head.  (DON'T TRY AT HOME!!!!  If you do, it's not my fault.)  Sure enough, the bullet ricocheted off, despite having very little muscle where he shot.  \"Anyway, time for breakfast.  What to have.\"  Hunter s himself.  \"I think I want some eggs.\"  Hunter walked over to the refrigerator and took out a full carton of eggs.  He then cracked each one, and made a 12 egg omelet.  That n cholesterol at once would be horrible for any normal person.  But, Hunter was not normal.  His metabolism converted the whole meal into pure muscle.  \"I've always wondered where the muscle I get from eating goes.\"  Hunter said.  \"Abs.  That's why ours are so much stronger than our other muscles.\"  Troy explained.  \"Makes sense to me.\"  Hunter added.  \"Anyway, this dragon has a romantic walk with his girlfriend scheduled for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunter, is that what you're wearing for our walk?\"  Trixie commented.  \"What's wrong with it?\"  Hunter asked.  He thought he looked fine.  He was wearing a polo and cargo shorts.  \"Hunter, why would a muscular dragon need a shirt?\"  \"Fair point.\"  With a quick flex, the shirt was destroyed.  \"Better?\"  \"Much.  Let's go.\"  The two dragons left the house, and started to walk through the woods of the island.  \"Trixie, remember how you wanted a pool.  Well, I do too.\"  All of the sudden, about 50 feet from the house, the ground changed into a giant swimming pool, equipped with diving boards, and a swim up bar.  \"Hunter, you never cease to amaze me.\"  \"Thanks.\"  As the two continues their walk, they came across a river with a waterfall.  \"This is really pretty Hunter.  How did you know this was here?\"  \"I did a quick flyover of the island to find the perfect place to do this.\"  Hunter knelt down on one knee and pulled out a small box.  \"Trixie Samantha Winfield.  Will you marry me?\"  \"Hunter.  Could I say no?  Of course.\"  Hunter opened the box, and revealed a diamond ring with a large orange piece of garnet in the middle.  Trixie put it on, and immediately hugged her fianc\u00e9.  \"Hunter, you're the best.  How much was that ring?\"  \"I shouldn't say.  But if you want to know, it was $1,000,000.\"  Hunter answered.  \"You really did not need to spend that much on me.\"  \"But I wanted to.  Now, do you want to join me in the river?\"  \"Sure.\"  Hunter used his powers to set up chairs and towels, and to change their clothes into bathing suits.  \"Before we go in, I need to check something.\"  Trixie said.  He walked over to Hunter, and touched his abs.  \"What are you doing?\"  Hunter asked playfully.  \"Lay down please.\"  Hunter did as he was told.  \"I'm seeing how deep you're abs go.  I've always wanted to feel your abs.  Plus, I'm comparing your abs to the diamonds I have in my hand.\"  Trixie stuck her finger between the two columns of Hunter's abs, and observed how far it went in.  \"I can stick my whole finger into your abs?\"  Trixie gasped.  \"They are 4 inches deep.\"  Hunter commented.  \"How hard are they though?\"  \"Let's find out.\"  Trixie took the diamond ring, put it next to Hunter's abs.  Then, she compared their hardness.  \"I have concluded that your abs are harder than diamond.\"  \"Would you like to know how much harder?\"  Hunter asked condescendingly.  \"Of course.\"  \"Now, I promise that I am not exaggerating.  My abs are the hardest things in the universe, aside from Lance's and Troy's abs.  We're equal.\"  Hunter explained.  \"God that's hard.\"  \"You rang?\"  Hunter joked.  \"You said God, and I am a God.  Anyway, river time.\"  The two jumped into the river, the cool water feeling incredibly refreshing.  \"This is nice.  We need to remember this spot.\"  Trixie said.  \"Oh definitely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour playing and relaxing in the river, the two got out, and dried off.  \"That was really nice.  I'm glad you proposed to me.  I was waiting for it.\"  Trixie said.  \"How long?\"  \"Since you told me you were a God.\"  \"Oh.  Anyway, want to fly back to the house?\"  \"Sure.  Take it slow though.  This is my first time flying myself.\"  The draconic couple flapped their wings, and flew to the house.  \"This is easy!\"  Trixie laughed.  \"When transforming you, I made sure that flying would come naturally.  I've heard learning to fly is horrible.\"  \"Thank you Hunter.  You really are the best.\"  \"You're welcome Trixie.\"  The two stopped in midair to hug and kiss each other.  When they finished, Trixie asked, \"If we're not flapping, why are we still in the air?\"  \"Dragons can hover in place without flapping.\"  \"I really like being a dragon.\"  \"Wait, there's one other thing about being a dragon that you should know Trixie.\"  With that, Hunter breathed a huge column of fire into the air.  \"How did you do that?\"  \"Easy.  First, concentrate on breathing fire.  Then, let it rip.\"  Trixie inhaled as much air as she could, and blew fire right at Hunter.  \"Are you okay?\"  \"Perfectly fine.  Dragons are fireproof.\"  With that, Hunter blew fire at Trixie.  \"Hahaha.  That tickles!\"  \"Told you.\"  With that, the two dragons landed on the roof of the mansion.  \"I set up a landing spot on the roof.\"  Hunter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, Hunter proposed to me!\"  \"Congratulations!\"  Everyone said.  \"I was waiting for the perfect time to propose to my perfect fianc\u00e9.\"  \"When's the wedding?\"  Mary asked.  \"We're still finding a date.  My stepdad is very busy.\"  \"Well, congratulations Hunter.\"  Troy said.  \"I think I know what this calls for.\"  \"What?\"  Hunter asked.  \"A celebration workout!\"  \"Okay, I think the girls and I are going to go shopping.\"  Trixie added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  Since we made that pact, there's no point in competing.\"  Troy said.  \"What do you want to do for you're celebration workout?\"  \"How about taking a dip in the pool?\"  Hunter suggested.  \"What pool?\"  Lance asked.  \"The pool I made.\"  Hunter answered.  The three Gods walked into the backyard, and saw the massive pool Hunter made.  \"Hunter, this is amazing.\"  Troy approved.  \"I especially like the bar.\"  \"You order, and your drink appears in front of you.  No matter what it is.\"  Hunter explained.  \"I'll show you.\"  Hunter swam up to the bar.  \"I'll have a glass of orange juice.\"  All of the sudden, a large glass of OJ appeared in front of Hunter.  \"Personally, I like it.  And, if people who do not know about our God powers come, there will be a bartender in it.\"  \"Perfect.  However, I'm not in the mood for a swim.\"  Lance said.  \"How about a fly?\"  \"That sounds fun.  Where do you want to go?\"  \"Let's see.  Our little island is 5 miles outside of LA.  I've never been to Chicago before.\"  Hunter suggested.  \"Yeah.  Chicago sounds fun.\"  \"Plus, with these, we can get there in under an hour.\"  Troy beamed, while flexing his wings.  \"Let's change, and go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 minutes later.  \"Trixie, we're going to Chicago.  We'll be home tomorrow.\"  \"Hunter, isn't Chicago really far away?\"  \"2020 miles to be exact.  Remember, I can fly at Mach 5?  I can fly around the whole world in 8 hours, without tiring.\"  \"Okay.  See you tomorrow.\"  Beep.  Hunter put his phone away.  \"Okay, got your stuff packed?\"  Hunter laughed.  He didn't need to pack, he could just use his powers to get his stuff to Chicago.  \"Let's go!\"  The three dragons flapped their wings, and started flying to Chicago.  32 minutes later, the three landed.  \"What to do here?\"  Hunter asked.  He used his powers to find all of the sites to see in the city.  \"I know.\"  Troy interjected. \"Let's go to Navy Pier!\"  The three flew to Navy Pier.  Navy Pier had everything imaginable on it.  A ferris wheel, many restaurants, attractions, theaters, and more.  \"Troy.  Not to disapprove of your idea, but there's a lot to do here.\"  \"I'm hungry.\"  Hunter interrupted.  \"Let's get something to eat.\"  The three walked around until they saw a good seafood restaurant.  \"This place looks good.\"  Troy said.  The three entered the restaurant, got a table, and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their lunch, they continued touring the pier.  By dinnertime, they had covered most of the pier, when suddenly, they noticed something.  A sign reading \"Professional team bodybuilding.  Make a team and try to win!  Come to Fur's Auditorium for more information.\"  \"Team bodybuilding.  Even with our unfair edge, that sounds fun.\"  Hunter said.  \"Let's go.\"  The three made their way to the auditorium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, we're here to find out more information about the Team Bodybuilding.\"  Hunter spoke to the fur running the event.  He was a tall, built horse.  However, not nearly as tall or as muscular as the three.  \"Certainly.  Team Bodybuilding is where a team of up to 4 bodybuilders organize a performance showing off each person's muscles, posing proficiency, strength, and chemistry.  Would you like to sign up?\"  The organizer asked.  \"We can't, but I think that we've just found a new profession.  Thank you.\"  Troy explained.  \"No problem.  We have another competition in LA in 3 months.\"  The organizer said.  \"We live in LA.  That will be perfect.  We'll get back to you on that.\"  With that, the three dragons left, and checked into the best hotel in Chicago.  Money was not an issue for the Gods, because they're Gods.  They made it to their room, and immediately fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

We may have found something to do in three months.\"  Troy answered.  \"What?\"  Mary chimed in.  \"Team bodybuilding.  There's a competition in LA in 3 months.\"  \"Sounds right up you're alley.\"  Mary chuckled.  \"Anyway, Hunter, you and me have a wedding to plan.\"  \"Right.  See you later.\"  Hunter and Trixie went up to their room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, do you want a big wedding, or a smaller one?\"  Asked Trixie.  \"I'm thinking of inviting as many people as we need.  I don't really have much of a family, so it will be mostly yours.\"  \"Aw.  It's okay.  We don't need to have a big wedding.  Plus, no one in my family knows I'm a dragon now.  How would I explain that?\"  \"Good point.  Want it to just be the six of us?\"  \"That works for me.  We don't need anything too extravagant.\"  \"Just have a nice, low key wedding.\"  \"Let's do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne month later.  \"Hunter James Tusson, do you take Trixie Samantha Winfield to be your lovely wedded wife?\"  \"I do.\"  \"You may kiss the bride.\"  Hunter and Trixie shared a long kiss, as their friends applauded.  \"Let's eat!\"  Hunter yelled.  Trixie changed into a more suitable dress, and the six flew to Verde's, a nice French restaurant.  They decided that they would celebrate there.  \"Congrats lovebirds, or in this case, lovedragons.\"  Troy congratulated.  \"I like the name Trixie Tusson.  It works very well.\"  Alecia stated.  \"Hello, and welcome to Verde's.\"  The waiter interrupted.  \"I am Jacques, and I will be you're waited this evening.  What would you like to drink?\"  \"I think water for the whole table, and 2 bottles of champagne.\"  Hunter said.  \"Anything else?\"  \"No thank you.\"  Lance said.  \"Your drinks will arrive momentarily.\"  Jacques left.  \"Well, I'm glad that I'm married to my Hunter.\"  \"Maybe Lance will propose to me soon.\"  Alecia joked.  \"I've known you for one month!\"  \"I'm kidding.\"  The three chatted for the rest of the meal.  \"You're bill sir.\"  Jacques said, handing the bill to Hunter.  \"I'll take it.\"  Hunter said.  \"Our meal cost almost $1000.  But it was worth it.\"  Hunter put his card on the check and waited.  Soon, the six were out of the restaurant, and in the skies.  \"The next part of the celebration is a movie.\"  Trixie yelled.  \"What movie?\"  \"We'll find out.\"  They landed in front of the movie theater, and entered.  \"How about Fur's in Space?\"  Lance asked.  \"Didn't it get really good reviews?\"  \"Yes.  6 tickets for Furs in Space, please.\"  The deer handed them their tickets, and sent them on their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 hours later.  \"That was amazing.  Time for sleep.\"  Trixie said.  The six flew to their private island, and landed on the roof of the mansion.  \"Good night guys!\"  Hunter yelled.  \"Good night.\"  Then, the group split, each couple heading to their bedroom.  In the newlywed's bedroom...  \"Hunter, I love you.\"  \"I love you too Trixie.\"  Trixie hugged Hunter, barely getting her arms around Hunter's waist.  \"Goodnight.\"  \"Goodnight.\"  With that, Trixie put her head on Hunter's massive pecs, and fell asleep.  \"I still don't understand how she thinks my pecs are a good pillow.  They're hard as diamond.  Whatever.\"  And Hunter fell asleep a married man.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Good morning Hunter!\"  Trixie yelled.  \"Geez!  I was sleeping.  Why would you yell so loudly?\"  Hunter yawned.  \"Sorry, I'm just way too excited to Honeymoon.  Do you have any ideas?\"  Trixie asked.  \"In fact, I do.  Just, let me eat breakfast first.\"  Hunter left his bedroom, and walked to the kitchen.  For the first time, he walked into an empty room.  \"Where is everyone?\"  Hunter asked.  \"Still asleep.  It's 6 A.M.\"  Trixie responded.  \"Why would you wake me at 6?\"  Hunter grumbled.  \"Because, we should make sure our honeymoon lasts as long as possible.\"  \"Fine.\"  Hunter approached the fridge, and decided to have a sweeter breakfast.  He took out a large wedding cake, and ate the whole thing.  \"Hunter.  How many calories was that thing?\"  Trixie gasped.  \"I don't know.  Probably around 10,000.  Don't worry, remember my metabolism?  In fact, I feel it working right now.\"  Hunter responded as he felt his muscles harden slightly.  \"There, all of it was converted to muscle.  Anyway, ready for our honeymoon?  I have a real treat for you.\"  \"Ready!\"  \"Step outside, and get ready for the time of your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie and Hunter walked to the large backyard of the mansion.  \"Sit down Trixie.  You're God is about to get a whole lot Godlier, if that's a word.\"  Trixie sat down, and watched as her husband transformed into his \"God\" form.  Hunter grew two feet, evening out at 10 feet.  Then, all of his muscles exploded to new proportions.  His biceps grew from their original 51\" to a staggering 95\".  His chest grew until his pecs jut out two feet in front of his 14 pack abs.  His legs grew to become even stronger than before, which is quite impressive.  Finally, his wings grew until his wingspan was 20 feet.  Last, his orange scales switched to a bright golden color, and started to glow, energy emanating from his body.  \"Ready to travel the universe?\"  The God asked.  \"Yes.  Where are we going.\"  \"I think the better question is where aren't we going.  Hold my hand.\"  Trixie grabbed onto Hunter's hand, and a large bubble formed around the couple.  \"This is so that you will survive in the cosmos.  Anyway, Space Shuttle Hunter is ready to lift off.  3.  2.  1.  Go.\"  Hunter spoke as he started to flap his wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the couple was traveling at 50x the speed of light.  Then, 100x.  Soon, Hunter accelerated to infinite speed.  \"We have reached our first destination.\"  Hunter said as he stopped in front of a large galaxy.  \"Ready to see the power of a God?\"  \"Very.\"  Hunter raised his hand, and the galaxy disappeared.  All of the sudden, Hunter started to glow more.  \"Hunter?  What's happening?\"  \"I've taken the galaxy, and transferred some of the mass of it into my God form's muscle.  The rest was sent into another dimension.  Anyway, we have two options.  You can see what the galaxy has done to my body, or we can create something to fill in where that Galaxy used to be.\"  \"Why not both?\"  Trixie responded as she flew up to Hunter's arm.  Hunter knew exactly what to do.  He flexed the God bicep, for his wife to feel.  Trixie squeezed it as hard as she could, yet, she couldn't even dent one of his veins.  Hunter's muscles were currently the hardest things in the universe.  \"Hunter, let's make a new galaxy.\"  With that, Hunter waved his hand, and an entire galaxy appeared.  It glowed the same red hue as Trixie's scales.  \"Trixie, this is your galaxy.  Do you like it?\"  \"How far away is it from home?\"  \"50,000,000 Light years.  We're at the edge of the universe.\"  \"Wow.  How can I come back?\"  \"Just ask me.  Anyway, let's go to another universe.\"  Trixie grabbed Hunter's hand, as they disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, to a parallel universe!\"  \"What's different about this universe?\"  \"How about you find out.\"  With that, Hunter and Trixie traveled to Earth, where they noticed a scrawny looking teenage tiger.  \"This universe is one where I never became a God.\"  Trixie watched as other Hunter was beaten up in school, then abused by his cruel step-father.  \"Why would you show this to me on our honeymoon?\"  \"Because you are the only person I trust enough to show this to.  Plus, I want to make other me's life a bit better.  I want you to decide how.\"  \"Okay, I think he should have a loving set of parents.\"  With that, Hunter's old step-dad became a lovely set of parents, embracing Hunter, and tending to his bullying wounds.  The old, torn-up house became a lovely suburban home.  \"I think he also deserves a little meat on his bones.\"  \"Okay, will do.\"  With that, tiger Hunter's scrawny body was replaced with a toned, athletic build.  His muscles were big, but not huge.  He looked like a teenage natural body builder.  \"Nobody on this Earth will know of this Hunter's past life, and nobody will be mean to him ever again.  Anyway, are you happy?  You just improved the life of a sad child.\"  \"Thank you Hunter.  It felt amazing to do something for someone else.\"  \"Anyway, onward to destination number 3.\"  Trixie took Hunter's hand, as he teleported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, to our Earth, in 100 years.\"  \"Where are we?\"  \"At our mansion.  Do you see something strange?\"  \"Yes, I see all six of us, and we do not look a day older than today.\"  \"The boys decided that it's unfair to have 3 immortals when six of us deserve it.  So, we made you, Mary and Alecia immortal.  Also, we have not decided what powers to give you yet.  We want to give you powers, but it's tough to decide.  I just wanted your immortality to be a surprise.\"  \"Wow.  Hunter, I know I've said that you're the best, but I really mean it.\"  \"Thanks Trixie.  Anyway, we have one more stop.\"  \"We've traveled through our universe, went to another universe, and traveled through time.  How can you top that?\"  \"I think I know.  Hold on a minute.\"  With that, the couple disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and Trixie reemerged in a bright, cloudy area.  \"Is this heaven?\"  \"Yes.  I want you to meet my parents.\"  \"Oh my God!\"  \"Yes?\"  \"Haha, very funny.  Hunter, this is amazing.\"  \"Thank you.\"  With that, Hunter and Trixie flew into a large room, with a plethora of Gods.  There were dragons, leopards, rhinos, sharks, dogs, wolves, etc.  There two gods for every animal.  \"Here we are.  The way that the Gods work is that they have one child, which is the Demigod representing the species.  Anyway, here are my parents.\"  \"Are you Trixie Tusson?\"  The female tiger asked.  \"Yes.\"  \"Well, our son could not have picked a better wife.  You'll fit right in with the rest of the family.\"  \"Anyway, Mom, Dad, I hope you're not angry that I'm a dragon now.\"  \"Not at all Hunter.\"  The male tiger said.  \"Hunter, the dragon look fits you really well.  Anyway.\"  He turned to Trixie.  \"Trixie, you might not know it, but your parents are here too.\"  \"Why are they here?  Did they die?\"  \"No.\"  Hunter's mother assured.  \"They are over there.\"  She pointed down the hall to the two foxes.  \"Trixie, you're a Demigod too.\"  \"Then why do I not have powers like Hunter?\"  \"Why don't you ask them?\"  Trixie and Hunter flew over to the fox Gods.  \"Hi mom.  Hi dad.\"  Trixie said.  \"Trixie?\"  The male fox said.  \"Yes, it's me.  My new husband, Hunter, took me here to meet his parents.  He turned me into a dragon like him.  Anyway, I have a question.  If you are my parents, then why do I not have powers like Hunter?\"  \"Trixie, you do not have powers for a simple reason.\"  Her mother began.  \"It's because you have not developed them yet.\"  \"Hunter developed them when he was thirteen.  What's taking so long?\"  \"Well, the age you develop them is random.  Hunter was lucky.  Your friend Troy developed his when he turned 50.  He then used them to look and have the body of a 21 year old.  He still has it.  Anyway, we know when your divine revelation will happen.\"  \"When?\"  \"On your 35th birthday.\"  Her father said.  \"Don't worry, it's your biological age.  I'm aware that Hunter made you 21 indefinitely.  In 14 years, you will have the same powers as Hunter.\"  \"Hunter, can you speed that up?\"  \"That's the one power no God has.  Sorry Trixie.\"  The golden dragon responded.  \"Anyway, it was a pleasure seeing you Trixie.  Also, tell Mary and Alecia that it's no coincidence Troy and Lance chose them.  They're Gods in waiting too.\"  Her mother said.  \"Bye mom, bye dad.  When I have the power to, I will visit again.\"  With that, the two dragons flew out of the hall.  \"Ready to go home?\"  Hunter asked.  \"I guess so.\"  Trixie responded.  With that, Hunter and Trixie disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two dragons reappeared in the exact place they left from.  As Hunter was reverting back to his Mortal form, he felt different.  \"Trixie, do you notice anything different?\"  Hunter asked.  His face showed that he was actually confused.  \"Yes, I do.  Your bigger again.  Both in the muscle and height department.\"  \"I blame Lance.\"  Hunter walked into the kitchen, where he saw Troy and Lance eating lunch.  \"Hey Hunter, where have you been?\"  Troy asked.  \"Honeymooning.  I took Trixie to the edge of the universe, then to a parallel universe, then to us 100 years in the future, and finally, to heaven.  Fun fact, we were destined to develop relationships with Trixie, Mary and Alecia.  Soon, they will become Gods too.  When is a mystery.\"  Hunter responded.  \"Anyway, who became bigger?\"  \"I'll admit, I saw a ship off the coast of the island, and it was heading right for us.  I flew out and redirected it away.  However, it was too heavy to move with our past musculature, so I grew in private and pushed it.\"  Troy responded.  \"That's what we have our God forms for.\"  Hunter jeered.  \"I forgot.  Anyway, why are you complaining?\"  \"I don't know.  I feel like we're becoming so strong that it's not fun anymore.  I have not found something to put this strength to use for.\"  \"We'll find something.\"  Lance stated.  \"Anyway, I think we should test drive these new bodies.\"  \"Okay.\"  Hunter smiled as they walked towards their basement.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Okay, first, let's see what we can bench.\"  Troy said, as he wandered to the bench press.  He set the machine to 100%, and got under the bar.  Troy used all of his might to lift that bar, and was able to crank out the one expected rep.  Then, Troy used his powers to get rid of the muscle soreness.  \"How much did it say?\"  The gigantic blue dragon asked.  \"I'll tell you when it loads.\"  Lance responded.  \"Accoring to this, you just benched 100 kt.  Anyway, time for me to squat.\"  The former rhinoceros yelled.  He got under the bar, and did one hefty squat.  When he put the bar down, it looked like Lance's thighs were going to explode.  Just like Troy though, he used his powers to get rid of the soreness.  \"Lance, that squat net you a grand total of 150 kt.\"  Hunter said.  \"Now its my turn.\"  Hunter went over to the deadlift, and with perfect form, squatted with the weight.  \"Hunter, that was 175 kt.\"  \"Hmm.  Not bad.\"  \"Not bad?  I can't think of anything that heavy!\"  Troy gasped.  \"Airplane?\"  Lance inquired.  \"Nope, most can't take off with more than 500 tons.\"  Hunter responded.  \"That's the weight of a large aircraft carrier.\"  \"Okay, can we get back to lifting?\"  The trio took turns trying each exercise, and found their maxes for each one:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBench:  100 kt<br>\r\nSquat:  150 kt<br>\r\nDeadlift:  175 kt<br>\r\nCurling: 40 kt per arm. 80 kt using both.<br>\r\nLats/Pull ups: 75 kt<br>\r\nAbs machine: 5 Mt  (Megatons.  1,000,000 tons)<br>\r\nDurability:  If not immortal, would be able to survive any kind of blast (Including supernova from 1 meter away)<br>\r\nRunning/Flying speed: Mach 300<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we got 100x stronger since our last test?\"  Lance asked.  \"It seems so.\"  Troy responded.  \"Let's see how big we are now!\"  The three pumped dragons walked over to the measuring machine, because tape measures are too impractical now.  They got in, flexed every muscle they could, and came up with these measurements:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiceps: 72\"<br>\r\nChest: 160\"<br>\r\nWaist: 47\"<br>\r\nThighs: 100\"<br>\r\nCalves: 80\"<br>\r\nForearms: 50\"<br>\r\nHeight:  9'0\"<br>\r\nWeight:  3 tons<br>\r\nBodyfat:  -5%<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our biceps are bigger than most people are tall.  Is it just me, or is that awesome!\"  Troy yelled as he flexed a gargantuan bicep.  \"Troy, how heavy was that ship?\"  Hunter inquired.  \"100 kt.\"  Troy responded, using his God mind to tell.  \"Well, now this makes more sense.  I think this calls for a posing session with the girls.\"  Lance stated.  \"I think you're right Lance.\"  Troy and Hunter said simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies, say hello to your new and improved boyfriends/husband!\"  Troy yelled as the three showed off their 6' biceps.  \"Guys, don't you think this is a bit much?\"  Mary asked.  \"We understand that you're Gods, but you need to pretend that you're mortal to blend in.  \"Well, this can be between us.\"  Hunter laughed as he bounced his mega pecs.  \"But, I think Mary's right.  We should try to look more like mortals.\"  Lance muttered.  \"Fine.\"  Troy grumbled.  The three muscle dragons shrunk down to their 8' tall forms.  (Their measurements are in the chapter Dragon vs. Dragon)  \"We may have to look like mortals, but we don't have to be as weak as them, no offense.\"  Lance yelled.  \"We're going to keep our current strength levels.  Anyway, we have a show to prepare for.\"  With that, the three dragons flew off into the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three Gods landed in the deserted forest behind the house.  \"Okay.  We need a show showing off our muscularity, strength and chemistry in an interesting way.  Any ideas?\"  Lance asked.  \"How about acting out a story?\"  Troy responded.  \"Sounds fun, but none of us are actors.\"  Lance said.  \"Aren't you forgetting that we're Gods?  We can make ourselves amazing actors!\"  Hunter said while flexing all 12 of his abs.  \"I'm thinking a western.  One of us is the sheriff, one is a bank robber, and the other one is a local hero.\"  \"That sounds fun!  Anyway, we need three aspects.  First, posing.\"  \"We can have a pose off between the robber and the sheriff, to try and intimidate the others.  Then, when the hero arrives, he'll pose and show off his muscles.\"  Hunter said while bouncing his pecs.  \"Hunter, I'm guessing that you want to be the hero.\"  \"Sure.  I'm thinking Troy will be the sheriff, and Lance will be the robber.\"  \"Why am I the robber?\"  \"I feel like you'll be better at the role than Troy.  Anyway, not to be self-centered, but for this, the hero should have larger muscles than the others.  That way, it really shows his heroicness. (it's in the dictionary)\"  \"That makes sense.  But, what about our pact?\"  \"We can pause it for when we are on stage, then when it's over, I'll shrink down.\"  \"Perfect.  Now, let's get script writing.\"  \"Wait, how do we show off strength?\"  \"The sheriff and robber can try to hurl things at each other.  Boulders, buildings, cars, etc.  Then, when the hero comes in, the robber will use his gun, and try to shoot the hero.  The bullets will bounce off my body, and I'll save the day.\"  \"Perfect.  Now let's write the script.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany hours later.  \"Guys, dinner's ready.  I ordered pizza.\"  \"Coming.  We were writing.\"  The three Gods entered the kitchen, and saw a mountain of pizza boxes.  \"Well, this is a lot of pizza.\"  \"Well, we know how much food muscle monsters like you need.  We got you one of each variety of pizza.  It's 30 pies.  We're splitting our own.  Those 30 are for you.\"  \"How much did this cost?\"  \"Does it matter?  You're Gods.  If we need money, just add zeroes to our bank account.  It's not difficult for you.\"  \"Good point.  Let's dig in.\"  30 pies and 16000 calories (Per God) later, they were full.  \"That was good.  Now, back to our writing.\"  Lance said as the three dragons' muscles got noticeably larger.  \"Their metabolism sure does them justice.\"  \"Yeah.  But my pec pillow is starting to get too big.\"  \"Don't worry Trixie, you'll find another muscle to sleep on.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Name?\"  A kangaroo asked the 3 dragons.  \"The Good, the Bad, and the Strong.\"  Hunter responded.  \"Here's your number.\"  The kangaroo handed Hunter a tag that said 18.  \"When it is called, you go on stage, perform, and wait for your results.\"  \"Thank you.\"  Hunter walked towards Troy and Lance, saying, \"Okay, we're 18th.  Am I big enough to show a difference from a distance?\"  Hunter asked.  \"Yes.  Don't worry.\"  Lance said.  Lance and Troy were in their 8' form, whereas Hunter was 8'5.  Another key difference was that Hunter's muscles were 20% bigger than Troy's and Lance's.  Their biceps were 42\", whereas Hunter's were 51\".  \"Okay.  Let's do this.\"  The three sat in the waiting room.  There, they saw a whole assortment of furs.  There were lions, wolves, bears, zebras, elephants, and more.  Plus, all of them were very muscular.  Some were even bigger than the three dragons.  A fact that changed very quickly.  \"Guys, I know it sounds like cheating, but I saw a bull out there with 45\" guns.  I'd say that Troy and I should grow until we're the largest ones here, then wipe memories of our former sizes.  Deal?\"  Lance asked.  \"Sounds good to me.\"  Troy responded.  \"Okay.\"  Hunter said.  Immediately, Troy and Lance grew to 8'4\", with 46\" biceps.  \"Hunter, you're still noticeably bigger, don't worry.\"  Troy assured.  \"Number 18!\"  The voice on the loudspeaker said.  \"That's us.\"  Lance beamed.  \"Let's go.\"  Troy yelled.  The trio got set and the music started playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, Lance ran onto the stage, only wearing a train robbing bandanna, a cowboy hat, and his posing trunks, and carrying a bag with a dollar sign on it.  \"Hold it right there criminal!\"  Troy shouted from offstage.  He flew on, wearing a cowboy hat, a sheriff badge glued to it, and his trunks.  \"That money belongs to the town, not you.\"  \"What are you going to do about it sheriff?  Fight me.  Look at these!\"  Lance yelled as he put the money down to strike a double bicep pose.  Each vein on each muscle was clearly visible.  \"Think you can handle that?\"  \"Actually, I think I can.\"  Troy bounced his pecs as he copied Lance's pose.  However, he finished off with a tricep flex, showing off the horseshoe shaped muscles.  \"See this baby?\"  Troy asked as he pointed to his arm.  \"There's nothing you can do to scare me when I have this around.\"  \"Well, how about this!\"  Lance shouted as he took a car from offstage, and hurled it at Troy.  The audience gasped with fear, but Troy stopped it with one hand.  \"Is that the best you can do?\"  Troy laughed, as he took the car, broke it in half, and compacted the pieces of it into small cubes.  \"This was your big weapon?\"  \"No, it's all that i could find.  This town doesn't have much in it.\"  Lance said, as he reached for his bag.  \"However, I do have a trick up my sleeve.\"  Lance reached into the bag, and pulled a pistol out.  \"NOT SO FAST.\"  Hunter yelled.  His body silhouetted in the back.  \"I can't let you get away with this.\"  \"Well too bad.\"  Lance yelled.  He took the pistol, and fired straight at Hunter.  Surprisingly, to the audience, the bullet just plinked off his muscles.  \"You're going behind bars, strong enough to hold you.\"  \"Oh yeah?\"  Lance yelled as he took more shots at Hunter.  Again, the bullets plinked off.  \"I've caught you red-handed.  You're done for.\"  \"You've got me this time, but never again.  I'll be back.\"  Lance swore, as he was carried off stage by Hunter.  \"How can I ever repay you?\"  Troy asked.  \"You don't.  Beating criminals is all the reward I need.\"  Hunter said as he flexed a most magnificent body, and flew off stage.  The crowd went nuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hour later.  \"And the winner is....    The Good, The Bad, and The Strong!\"  Hunter, Lance and Troy flew back on stage to receive their prize.  One million dollars per participant.  \"Thank you.  I would like to thank my wife for being so supportive, and my parents, for supplying me with the genetics to have a body like this.\"  Hunter cried.  Troy and Lance also gave thank you's, but they were pretty much the same as Hunter's.  \"FLEX!  FLEX!  FLEX!\"  The audience chanted.  \"Well, if you insist.\"  The three dragons got into a position that showed off their biceps, triceps, abs, pecs and legs perfectly.  \"Thank you, and good night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater.  \"I'd say that went well.\"  Hunter laughed as he shrunk down to Troy and Lance's size.  \"Yeah.  Our powers certainly helped.\"  Troy laughed.  \"When don't they.\"  Lance cackled, as the three sat in the gym in the mansion.  \"I don't know about you guys, but I think I want a good run.\"  Troy said.  \"I haven't had one in a while.\"  \"Where?\"  \"I have an idea.\"  Troy said.  \"Follow me.\"  Troy walked outside into the night.  He took off, Hunter and Lance closely behind.  Within seconds, they were in space, and within one hour, were on the surface of the moon.  \"Why are we on the moon Troy?\"  Hunter inquired.  \"This is a pit stop.  I actually want to go to deep space, but I want to fly.  So, we need our God forms.  I just did not want to change into it at night, while people were awake and could see the glow.\"  \"Ah.  Okay.\"  With that, the three Gods transformed into their golden 10 foot God forms.  \"Now follow me.\"  Troy said.  Troy levitated up, and flew off at the speed of light.  Lance and Hunter followed suit.  Soon, they accelerated to 10000 light years per second.  After a minute, they were in intergalactic space.  \"Here we are.\"  \"What is here?\"  Hunter asked.  \"The location of the gravity gym.\"  Troy then created a light year long, wide and high cube.  \"Teleport into it.\"  Troy said.  The three teleported in.  \"Now, revert out of your God form, and say hello.\"  Troy turned on the lights, and a large gym filled with equipment and a running track emerged.  \"Now, the neat thing about this gym is that you can change the gravity in it.  Right now, it is set for 10000 times Earth's.  So, one pound in here, is 5 tons on Earth.  Now, let's run.\"  Troy set the gravity to normal, and the three dragons ran on the track.  It had scenery produced by God powers, so it felt like a real run.  \"I'd say, we run for 1,000,000 miles, then, we crank up the gravity.\"  Troy suggested.  \"Even with our speed, 1,000,000 miles would take a couple of hours.\"  \"True.  How about 500,000?\"  \"Much better.\"  The three dragons, running at mach 270, or 207,163  mph, felt very alive.  It's been a while since they just ran for the sake of running.  Plus, their 50\" calves needed something to do.  \"What's your heart-rate?\"  Hunter wondered.  \"30 BPM.\"  Lance answered.  \"That's pretty slow.\"  \"Well, this isn't exerting much energy.  That's the only slow thing about me.\"  \"True.\"  \"Ready for 500,000 miles with 50,000 times gravity?\"  Troy asked.  \"Let's do this.\"  Troy set the gravity to 50k, and they continued running.  However, their speed slowed from mach 270, to mach 3.  \"Okay.  Not 500,000.  5,000 miles.  Fair?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 hours in the gym later.  \"That was fun.\"  Troy said as he reset the gravity to normal Earth.  \"Yeah.  I like gravity training.\"  Hunter panted.  \"Wow, I've since I became a God, nothing has ever fatigued me, except for that.\"  \"Yeah, but our legs are super pumped.  I think I know what this calls for.  A God's arm wrestle.\"  The three smiled as they transformed into their God forms, replacing any fatigue with pure energy.  \"First, me and Hunter.\"  Lance said.  An arm wrestling station was added to the gym.  \"The battle of the Gods has begun!\"  Troy yelled as the two golden dragons arm wrestled.  Troy decided to be the announcer.  \"Hello, I'm Troy, and welcome to the holiest arm wrestle in history!  We have two Gods of pure strength duking it out.  You can see their pain.  Oh, and look at those biceps.  Am I seeing 95\" of solid muscle?  I am.  Wow, these two are evenly matched.  Neither of their arms have moved at all.  Plus, with their stamina, it doesn't seem like they will.  Let's change things up a little then.\"  With that, Troy upped the gravity from earth's to 1,000,000,000,000 times Earth's.  \"The gravity in here is enough to be a black hole.  Good thing nothing outside of this is effected by its interior gravity.  And look, no straining from either of our competitors.  However, I am seeing something extraordinary!\"  As soon as Troy said that, Hunter and Lance started glowing white.  \"I think we need more gravity.  Let's set it to infinite!\"  Troy set the gravity to the highest setting, the gravity caused by the mass of the universe being compressed into the size of a singularity.  The two Gods (and now Troy)  started glowing even brighter, white flames erupting from their skin due to the energy.  \"Look at this.  Guys, stop the fight, I need to examine you.\"  Hunter and Lance let go of each other.  \"Guys, I think with that arm wrestle, and my changing of gravity, we've transcended the realm of God.  We're too powerful to be called Gods now.  We are the rulers of the universe.\"  \"Stop messing with us Troy.\"  Hunter quipped.  \"No really, did you hear what I said?  The gravity in here is infinite!  And we're glowing white.  Look at me!\"  Hunter's mouth dropped as he looked at Troy.  He was glowing white, with while flames coming out of him.  \"Check our measurements.\"  Troy yelled as he set the gravity back to Earth's.  \"Okay.  Here they are.\"  Lance gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight:  25'<br>\r\nWeight:  1 kt.<br>\r\nBiceps: 300\"<br>\r\nChest:  800\"<br>\r\nWaist:  100\"<br>\r\nThighs:  500\"<br>\r\nCalves:  400\"<br>\r\nMuscle Density:  Black Hole<br>\r\nMuscle Strength:  Infinite<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, we did it.  We're pretty much super Gods now.\"  \"What does that mean?\"  \"Anything that we could not do before, we can do now.\"  \"Like what?\"  \"I have an idea.\"  Hunter, Lance and Troy teleported to an alternate dimension.  \"This is a different universe.  Correction.  This was a universe.\"  With that, Hunter did nothing.  However, the entire universe became a swirling vortex of matter, which compressed, and exploded in front of the Gods.  \"Well, you just destroyed an entire universe by staring at it.\"  \"Yes I did.  That's the extent of our power.\"</span></div></div>",

Mortal, which is our weakest, god, which is our golden one, and now this, which I'm calling Super God.\"  Lance answered.  \"I think I get it.\"  Hunter exclaimed.  \"Our mortal forms can alter the Earth, and individual things.  My God form was able to destroy and create galaxies.  I think this one can control entire universes!\"  \"I see.  That's how you destroyed this galaxy.\"  Troy confirmed, as he looked around at the literal nothingness.  \"Well, I think whatever our God form can't do, this can.\"  Lance said.  \"Like make other people Gods?\"  Hunter asked.  \"Let's try it out.  But first, I want to try something.\"  Lance waved his hand, and the galaxy that Hunter destroyed returned.  \"Let's play a game.\"  Just then, Lance compressed the universe into a ball the size of a beach ball.  \"Play ball!\" Lance threw the universe to Troy at speeds light would call fast.  \"How hard did you pitch that?\"  \"Probably around 100 light years per second.\"  \"Anyway, what are the rules of Universe ball?\"  Troy asked.  \"Well, we throw the ball at each other, and the first one not to catch it loses.\"  \"Seems simple enough.  Go long.\"  Troy took the universe, and threw it.  \"Hunter, you're next.\"  \"Troy, where did you throw it?\"  \"It's probably around 1,000,000 light years away by now.\"  \"Got it!\"  Lance yelled, as he returned to the others.  \"Hunter, time for you.\"  Lance took the ball, and threw it directly at Hunter's abs.  \"Lance, why?\"  Hunter asked after being hit.  \"I thought I would catch you off guard.\"  \"Whatever.  I think we need to go to Heaven to see what exactly happened.\"  \"Okay.\"  The three Gods reset the universe, and disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?  Dad?  I have a question.\"  Hunter proposed.  He was currently in his 10 foot golden God form.  \"What is it Hunter?\"  \"Troy, Lance and I were working out in these forms, trying to see what they could do.  Eventually, the three of us transformed into this.\"  With that, Hunter transformed into his white Super God form.  \"Do you have any ideas why?\"  \"No, but we need to speak to the other gods.  Now.\"  The two tigers got up from their thrones, and walked into the hall.  \"Troy?  Lance?  Where are you?\"  Hunter asked.  \"Right here.\"  The two other dragons flew over to Hunter.  \"My parents were stumped.  What about yours?\"  \"Yep.  Their meeting with the other Gods.\"  \"Speaking of which, their coming back.\"  \"Hunter, Troy, Lance.  We have something to tell you.\"  A golden human stated.  \"I am the lord of Heaven.  All of these Gods work for me.  A long time ago, I foresaw 3 young Gods transcending their Godliness, becoming, as you call them, Super Gods.  These Super Gods were supposed to have power beyond any other of the Gods, including myself.  If you truly are these Gods, then prove it to me.\"  \"Okay, follow us.\"  Hunter said.  Hunter, Lance and Troy disappeared.  The human God shortly after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been experimenting with our power in this universe.\"  \"First, we should show you our adopted forms.\"  Hunter transformed into his normal 8'5\" form.  \"This is what we normally use when walking around on Earth.\"  Then, he transformed into his golden form.  \"We created this form to look more Godly when using the full extent of our powers, at the time.\"  Finally, Hunter transformed into the new white form.  \"Finally, when the three of us were working out in our golden forms, we transformed into this form.  We have no idea why though.\"  \"What can you three do in this?\"  The human asked.  \"Well, we played a game we call universe ball.\"  \"We took this universe, shrunk it down to the size of a beach ball, and played catch.  Whoever dropped it first lost.  I made it!\"  Lance explained.  \"Yeah, but I won.\"  Troy interjected.  \"Can you show me?\"  The human asked.  \"Sure.\"  Hunter waved his hand, and the universe shrunk down to the size of a beach ball.  \"Can I try to hold it?\"  \"Well, it's still as heavy as the universe, so if you can.\"  Hunter took the ball, and handed it to the human.  He could see the human struggling to hold it.  Hunter immediately took it back, and held it on one hand.  \"Troy, go long!\"  Hunter threw it as hard as he could.  Troy then bolted off after it.  One minute later, Troy returned, holding the ball.  \"How far did you just travel?\"  The human wondered.  \"Well, if the universe still was a universe, then it traveled the distance of it's edge and back around 50 times.  Otherwise known as 2.5 trillion light years.  That's a new record for us.\"  \"I think the prophecy has finally come true.  You are the Super Gods of the prophecy.\"  \"What does that mean for us?\"  Lance asked.  \"Well, you three have powers that no other God has.  You can transform others into Gods, and control the multiverse.\"  \"We get that, but did that prophecy say anything about what we would do with that power?\"  Troy asked.  \"It did not.  People say that Gods have limitless power.  However, there are limits.  We cannot let others become Gods.  Your powers are the only that are truly limitless.  The only thing you can't do is lose you power, die, or get hurt.  Before you transcended, we could have taken away your powers if we saw you as unworthy.  Now, we have no power over you.  In fact, you have power over us.  You are Gods of the Gods.\"  The human explained.  \"Now, could you put this universe back?\"  \"Sure.\"  Lance said as he threw the ball.  This time, it exploded into stars, nebulae and galaxies.  \"Now, let's go back to heaven.\"  After that, the four Gods disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunter, Troy, Lance.  You three have an important choice.\"  The human said to the trio, still in their Super God forms.  \"You can either stay here in Heaven, and rule over the Gods and the multiverse, or you can go back to Earth, and live out the lives you had before.  \"Can we talk it over for a bit?\"  Troy asked.  \"I'm in no position to say no.\"  \"Fair point.\"  The three white dragons walked over.  \"I feel like I'd prefer to live on Earth.  There's so much to do.  That, and I think with our powers, we could be superheroes!\"  Lance said.  \"I agree with Lance.  We have our relationships and our legacies on Earth.\"  Troy agreed.  \"I agree too, but we should still do something with this power.  I think that we should rule from Earth.  Every once in a while, check up with Heaven.\"  Hunter suggested.  \"That can work.\"  Lance agreed.  The three dragons approached the plethora of Gods.  \"We're going to stay on Earth.  One day every month, we will check up here, and make sure everything is in order.\"  Hunter proposed.  \"Perfect.  See you three in one month.\"  With that, the three white dragons disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trixie, there's something I need to show you.\"  \"What is it Hunter?\"  \"Just come outside.\"  The 8'5\" dragon flew outside with his wife.  Immediately, he transformed into his golden God form.  \"Troy, Lance and I decided to test the limits of this.  We found something unexpected.\"  With that, Hunter turned white.  \"Hunter?  What's happening?\"  Trixie trembled.  As soon as she said that, his muscles exploded, tripling in size.  He also grew to 25' tall.  While light poured out of his body, leaving a white aura around him.  \"We've become Super Gods.  This is our strongest form.\"  With that, he laid down on the ground, his head resting on a tree.  \"Trixie, come here.\"  She immediately flew onto his abs, and stood up.  She couldn't see his head over the pecs.  Rather than fly onto the pecs, she just laid down on the 24 pack.  \"We have power over the multiverse.  Any power that I did not have before, I have now.  Because of that, you tenure as a mortal is over.  Now, I need you to fly with me.\"  She flew up into the sky, with Hunter following her.  After they reached one mile in height, they stopped.  \"Ready to become a goddess?\"  \"Yes.\"  Hunter turned towards Trixie, and blew a large column of white fire at her.  This fire burned hotter than the sun, but it did not affect Trixie at all.  After a minute, Hunter stopped.  Trixie emerged from the fire, and started to glow.  \"What should I do first?\"  \"Well, Lance, Troy and I all have God forms.  How about you make one for yourself.  Also, they are doing this to Mary and Alecia too.\"  \"Okay.\"  Hunter shrunk down to his normal God form, and helped Trixie.  Soon, she grew to 10 feet tall, gave herself an athletic build, and changed her scales to a similar golden color.  \"A god finally gets his Goddess.\"  The two kissed, and slowly descended from the clouds.  The two Gods came to greet the others.  \"Look at me!\"  Trixie yelled to the other four dragons.  \"Yeah, Troy turned me into a goddess just now.\"  \"Same with me.\"  Alecia added.  \"I think the six of us should all transform into our God forms, and hang out as Gods.\"  Hunter suggested.  \"Okay!\"  Soon, the room was populated by six 10 foot tall golden dragons.  \"What should we do now?\"  \"Well, it's our first time in this form, let's see what it can do!\"  Mary suggested.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I know the perfect place to train you three in the ways of Godliness.\"  Troy realized.  \"Follow me.\"  The six dragons walked out of thee mansion, and started to fly.  The girls were used to flying behind the Gods, because the Gods were so much faster than them.  This was the first time they were able to keep up.  After a minute of flying, they were passing Jupiter.  \"Okay, now let's pick up some speed.\"  Mary said telepathically.  The six accelerated to trillions of times the speed of light.  Soon, they were almost 100,000,000 light years away from Earth.  \"Here we are.\"  Troy said as he stopped.  The girls were confused.  \"There's nothing here.\"  Alecia questioned.  \"Yet.\"  Troy smirked.  He waved his hand, and a large structure appeared.  \"This is our private gym.  One that only the six of us can use.  However, the only draw is that you have to fly there.  That's how I was able to make sure it was incapable of being seen from Earth in all ways.  Anyway, let's go in.\"  The six disappeared, teleporting into the structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome!\"  Troy yelled.  \"This place is huge!\"  Trixie marvelled at the gym.  There were machines for every muscle group imaginable, a large track for running and flying, a swimming pool, and a strange looking wall monitor.  \"What's the monitor for?\"  \"It's to change how strong the gravity is in here.  We can make it stronger, and harder to lift things.\"  Troy explained.  \"At one point, Lance and I arm wrestled, to see how these forms matched against each other.  However, these forms have infinite strength.  So we set the gravity to that of if the mass of the universe was converted into the singularity of a black hole.  In essence, infinite gravity.  That caused us to transform into the Super Gods.\"  \"Well, the two infinities clashing probably caused that.\"  Mary suggested.  \"Makes sense to me.  Anyway, ready to learn what these powers are good for?\"  Lance asked.  \"Ready!\"  The three girls yelled simultaneously.  \"Okay, everyone pair up.\"  Hunter yelled.  \"Let's train Trixie.\"  \"I'm ready.\"  Trixie assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  First, change into your normal mortal form.  We'll be training that first.\"  \"Okay.\"  Hunter immediately shrunk down to a modest, in comparison to his 10 feet, 8'5\".  Trixie did the same, however, her height was closer to 6'.  \"First thing is first, try to grow to my height.\"  Trixie thought about Hunter's height, and she shot up to 8'5\".  'Perfect, now, change to whatever height you'd think is nice for you.\"  \"Okay.\"  Trixie shrunk down to around 7'3\".  \"Next is your build.  Your mortal form seems to have a slim build.  Try bulking up a bit to a more athletic looking one.\"  Trixie did just that, her muscles bulking slightly.  She looked strong, but not like a hulk.  That was Hunter's job.  \"Perfect.  You look fantastic.  Now, this is your new mortal form.  Whenever you are out in public, stay in this form.  If something comes up where you need to use your God form, make sure nobody sees you transform.  I would say stop time, but only the God form can control time.  In your mortal form, you can control people's emotions, feelings, strength, bodies, memories, etc.  You can also change objects into whatever you want.  The God form allows manipulation of space time.  It allows manipulation on a much larger scale, like me making your galaxy.  My Super God form is able to manipulate entire universes with a blink of an eye, but I do not believe you are able to achieve that.  We met with the head God of Heaven, and he said only 3 gods could become Super Gods, and prophecies are unchangeable.\"  \"It's okay.  Anyway, what's next?\"  \"Using your powers to change something other than yourself.  Try changing my height.\"  \"Okay.\"  Trixie concentrated on Hunter, trying to grow him.  Soon, Hunter grew to 9' tall, with all of his muscles growing in proportion.  \"I decided the muscles had to change too.\"  \"Okay.\"  Hunter responded as he shrunk back down to his normal 8'5\".  \"Now, time to test manipulation of objects.  Try to make anything appear out of thin air.\"  \"Okay.\"  All of the sudden, a bench press appeared.  \"I made this, I did not move it.\"  \"Why a bench?\"  \"We're in a gym, I thought it made sense.\"  \"I guess.\"  Hunter laughed.  \"Anyway, since we have a bench, now I'm going to become a fitness trainer.  God's mortal forms are much stronger than normal mortals.  It's time to see your physical potential.\"  Trixie layed down on the bench.  \"Okay, I'm setting the bench to your max.  All you need to do is pull off one rep.  Now, the number may be smaller than mine, but that's because I've been a God much longer than you.  You will strengthen over time.\"  \"Let's do this.\"  Trixie grabbed the bar, and benched the bar.  She struggled a bit, but that was expected.  It was set to her one rep max.  With a little boost from Hunter, she completed the rep.  \"That was hard.\"  \"I never said this would be easy.  For a person I've never seen work out, you have amazing form.\"  \"I've watched you work out.  A lot.\"  \"True.\"  The muscular dragon laughed.  \"Okay, the machine says that you benched about 50 tons.  To give you some perspective, I weigh close to 3 tons of muscle, and my biceps are 46\" big.  I can bench 200,000 tons.  However, this is your first time exercising as a God.  Mu first time, I could bench around that too, and I was much bigger.  I sense much potential in you.\"  Hunter smirked.  \"Thanks.  Anyway, my arms hurt.\"  Trixie complained.  \"Not anymore.  I've gotten rid of muscle soreness and fatigue for this workout.  That way, your maxes can be found as quickly as possible, and we can get to the more important parts of your training.\"  Hunter ranted.  \"Anyway, let's get this show on the road.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hour later.  \"Okay, you're a very strong Goddess.  You squatted 100 tons, deadlifted around 120 tons, curled 40 tons in each arm, and was able to perform a lovely pull up with 75 tons of extra weight.  Nice.  Anyway, unlike me, you have not had the chance to really develop your body.  Mine was developed through the frequent contests I would have with Lance and Troy, as well as the bodybuilding competitions.  You'll figure out a way.  Anyway, you weigh around 500 pounds, most of which is muscle.  But that aside, it's time for the next part of your training.  God mode.  Switch into your God form.\"  Hunter demonstrated by transforming into his.  The now 10' muscle beast looked as his wife transformed into her form.  With her eyes finally at eye level, Hunter said, \"Now that we're the same height, I now realized how beautiful your eyes are.\"  \"Thanks.\"  Trixie blinked her hazel eyes, while Hunter gazed with his sea blue ones.  \"Anyway, try to stop time for everything but you and me.\"  \"Okay.\"  Trixie concentrated, but it seemed like nothing happened.  \"Nothing happened.\"  Trixie muttered.  \"Are you sure.  Follow me.\"  Hunter started to fly.  trixie followed him to where Lance and Alecia were training.  Lance was frozen in place, trying to spot Alecia while she was doing her pull up.  \"Are you sure nothing happened?\"  Hunter laughed.  \"I just stopped time!\"  Trixie proclaimed.  \"Anyway, unfreeze it.\"  Trixie waved her hand, and Alecia finished her rep.  \"Where did you come from?\"  Lance yelled.  \"We were practicing time manipulation.  Trixie stopped time, but she wasn't sure that she was successful.  We came over here and saw you frozen.  She's learning fast.\"  Hunter explained.  \"Congrats!\"  The now smaller Lance roared.  \"Thank you.  How's Alecia doing?\"  \"Very well.  We just took a bit more time than we thought we would with the making things appear.  We got carried away a bit.\"  With that, Lance pointed at a large pile of random objects.  There were chairs, a t.v, a couple of water bottles, and even a 5 foot tall teddy bear.  \"Well, I'll leave you two doing what your doing.  We have more work to do.\"  Hunter and Trixie flew back to their spot.  \"Okay, your final task is different.  Time manipulation is the only new thing.  However, I have one last task for you.  Take me to your galaxy I made for you.\"  \"Okay.\"  Then, the couple disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair of spouses reappeared near a large red galaxy.  \"Here it is Hunter.\"  Trixie proclaimed telepathically and proudly.  \"Okay, now I need you to create a new galaxy next to it.  I think that's a good test.\"  \"With pleasure.\"  Trixie jokingly cracked her knuckles as she started to form a galaxy next to her's.  Then, she made it have a slight orange glow.  \"This is your galaxy Hunter.\"  \"Thank you.  Anyway, time for my work.\"  Hunter then made the two galaxies collide.  The orange and red mixed, and formed a swirl of the two colors.  \"Just like us, the galaxies are married.\"  \"Aw!\"  Trixie cooed as they had an intergalactic kiss.  Then, the two returned to the Gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did we miss anything?\"  Hunter asked Lance and Troy, both of whom were in their golden God forms.  \"Besides a double marriage proposal, both of which were answered with yes, no.\"  Troy joked.  \"You two are getting married.  About time.  I was feeling lonely being the only husband in the group.\"  Hunter laughed.  \"Yep.  Just like you, It's going to be low key.\"  Lance said.  \"We're joking.  We're having it in Heaven.\"  Troy corrected.  \"Well, that's certainly something.  Anyway, how did your training go?\"  \"Mary got the hand of omnipotence pretty quickly!\"  Troy said.  \"The only issue is that she refuses to stop creating flowers in the Gym.  At this rate, the gym will become a greenhouse!\"  \"How about Alecia.\"  \"Besides the aforementioned pile of random stuff, she was perfect!\"  \"I took Trixie into space and had her create a galaxy as a final test.  Did you guys have final tests?\"  \"I made Mary reverse the gravity so that we were walking on the ceiling.\"  \"I made Alecia travel to an alternate universe.\"  \"Those work.\"  \"Anyway, I'd say this was a success.  Let's go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Could you stop for a minute?\"  Trixie asked.  \"Sure, why?\"  \"I see this really pretty thing near us.\"  Hunter turned around, and noticed the Eagle Nebula.  (Look it up, it's really cool.)  \"That is pretty, almost as pretty as you Trixie.\"  \"Oh Hunter, come here!\"  The two hugged each other, as they explored the nebula.  They flew through the Pillars of Creation and the Spire.  \"Hunter, can I ask you something?\"  \"Sure.\"  The golden dragon answered.  \"I know it seems weird to be asking you this now, but I have not had a private posing session in a while.  I want to see you're muscles in action.\"  \"In which form?\"  \"This one.\"  \"Right now?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Okay, fly back a bit.\"  The golden dragon used his powers to give all of his muscles a big pump.  \"Ready?\"  \"Yes.\"  The first thing Hunter did was flexed his biceps.  They rose to a huge 95\" peak.  \"This bicep is almost 8 feet around.  Would you like to feel?\"  \"Is that even a question?\"  Trixie answered as she drifted towards the bicep.  She wrapped her arms around it, but nothing she did could even dent the arm.  \"Even with my infinite strength I cannot dent my bicep.\"  Hunter smirked.  \"Ready for the next one?\"  \"YES YES YES!\"  Hunter let go of his flex, and started to bounce his pecs.  Then, he flexed the chest.  \"This is what a 250' chest looks like.\"  Then, he flexed his 16 pack abs.  \"Only in God forms can abs exceed 12, like mine.\"  Then, he flexed his 150\" thighs.  \"These legs could kick a galaxy apart.  Finally, he flexed his 125\"calves.  \"These let me run across the whole universe in minutes.  Anyway, ready to go home?\"  \"Not quite.  There's one more thing.\"  Trixie and Hunter flew towards a star, many light years away from home and the nebula.  \"Can you use your physical strength to destroy a star?\"  \"We can find out.\"  The golden dragon dove into the star.  Hunter tried to swim through the plasma, getting all the way to the core.  He thought he would just punch the core, but it was made of plasma too, and punching plasma just doesn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 minutes later, the star exploded in a massive nova.  Hunter flew out of the explosion towards Trixie.  \"I figured it out.  Somehow, me breathing fire overheated the star to the point of collapsing.  Anyway, let's get home.\"  The lovebirds, or lovedragons, (I made that joke already, but I don't care!)  flew back to their island home, changed back to their mortal forms, and slept.  It may have been the first time in Earth's history that two Gods shared a bed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Blarg!\"  Hunter yelled as he stretched his massive arms.  \"Rise and shine my big God.\"  Trixie greeted.  Trixie always got up before Hunter.  She was in her gym gear, a sports bra and shorts.  It showed off her athletic physique very well.  \"I want to work out, but I need my trainer.\"  \"Trixie, I just woke up!\"  Hunter laughed.  \"Give me some time!\"  \"Okay.  I'll meet you in the gym.\"  Trixie ran off, presumably to warm up.  Hunter changed into his gym shorts, and met Trixie in the gym.  \"Look at who decided to show up!\"  Trixie teased.  \"Okay Trixie, what are you working out today?\"  \"I don't know.\"  Trixie answered.  \"Well, when working out, you devote a day to a specific area.  It's best for the muscles.  I'd know.\"  Hunter explained as he flexed a veiny 46\" bicep.  \"Speaking of biceps, how about arms?\"  Trixie suggested.  \"Perfect, we'll do upper body.  Have you warmed up?\"  Hunter asked.  \"Yes.  I looked up how.\"  \"Okay, I believe you.\"  Hunter checked using his powers just to make sure.  He knew the consequences of working out without the proper warm up.  \"Okay, the real question is why you are working out.  Do you want to be more toned, more muscular, or stronger?\"  Hunter asked.  \"Stronger.\"  Trixie replied.  \"Okay.\"  The pair walked over to the bench.  \"Now, getting stronger is not easy.\"  Hunter started.  \"Good thing we're Gods.  One thing I've learned as a God is that in our mortal forms, workouts are 1000 times more effective than normal mortals.  So in one workout, you will become 1000 times stronger than a mortal would if they used the same exact routine.  With that, the first exercise I want you to do is bench.  You will be doing 8 reps at the weight I set for you.  It may not be easy, but it will be effective.\"  Trixie laid down on the bench, and put her hands on the bar.  Hunter set the percent to 85%, and stood behind the bar, ready to spot.  \"Go.\"  Trixie picked up the bar, and benched it for eight reps.  By the eighth rep, Hunter could see her struggling.  He helped her with the bar, and set it bach into it's holders.  \"That was not easy.\"  Trixie panted.  \"It's not supposed to be.  Anyway, I'm guessing you want to know how much that was.\"  Trixie nodded.  \"It was 42 tons.\"  \"Wow.  Anyway, what's next?\"  \"Well, you have two more sets.\"  Hunter grinned.  \"Oh.\"  \"With each set, you add weight, and subtract reps.  This one, you need to do six, but I'm adding one ton.\"  Hunter did not lie.  After her six, he added two tons, making the weight an even 45 tons, and Trixie benched the 4 reps she needed.  \"Next are biceps, which we will take care of by curling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(BTW, writer's note.  Two chapters ago, I screwed up all her numbers.  Her maxes shoould actually be Squat:  75 tons, Dead: 80, Curl: 20 each arm, Lats:  35  I forgot how to math that night.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, here we are.\"  The two dragons arrived at their destination.  \"We're going to do the same 8-6-4 sets.  Get ready.\"  Trixie took the bar, and started to curl it.  \"How much was that set?\"  \"35 tons.\"  \"Wow.  I really like the sound of that.\"  \"Ready for set two.\"  Trixie did her other sets, eventually making it up to 37 tons, which is very close to her max.  \"Next are lats.\"  They made their way to the lat pull down machine.  \"Okay, same set rules here.\"  The couple continued this with pull ups, curl ups, shrugs, tricep extensions, and more.  After two and a half hours, Trixie threw in the towel.  \"I'm exhausted Hunter, but I feel great.\"  \"You went through every exercise I could think of for the upper body!'  Hunter quipped.  \"You're doing well.  You should see your results soon.  Anyway, I think you need some ice cream.\"  \"I agree.\"  Trixie panted.  \"Before we leave the gym Hunter, can you do something for me?\"  \"Sure.\"  \"Can you curl me your max.  However, could you make the bar look as heavy as it is?\"  \"Okay.\"  Hunter walked over to the barbel corner of the gym, and loaded it with as many 5 kt plates as he could fit.  \"Well, this is an issue.  The bar is not long enough.\"  He said as he held the 80 kt bar in his hand.  \"This is almost enough for one arm curls.\"  \"Hunter, just use your powers.\"  \"I usually try to refrain from using powers while working out, but I think this exception can be forgiven.\"  He lengthened the bar so he could fit the 180 kt he needed on the bar.  The bar was longer than Hunter was tall, seeing how it had 18 plates on each side.  \"One curl.\"  Hunter curled the bar, but it felt too easy.  He curled it again, and again, and again.  After 8 reps, he put the bar down.  He walked over to the measuring machine.  He still had the same exact measurements, including weight.  \"Usually when I get stronger, I increase in weight.  More muscle.  I think the muscle fibers themselves strengthened.\"  Sure enough, that is exactly what happened.  Hunter's strength increased 10 times.  The machine read him his new maxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBench: 2 Mt<br>\r\nSquat: 3 Mt<br>\r\nDeadlift: 3.5 Mt<br>\r\nCurling: 800 kt per arm. 1.6 Mt using both.<br>\r\nLats/Pull ups: 1.5 Mt<br>\r\nAbs machine: 200 Mt<br>\r\nDurability: Nothing can harm at all.<br>\r\nRunning/Flying speed: Mach 7.5 k (7500)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.  Millions of tons, that's new.\"  Hunter smiled.  He lengthened the bar until it was 100 feet long.  He then filled the whole thing with plates.  Finally, he made sure that the bar was strong enough not to break.  \"Okay, there are 320 5 kt plates on here.  That should be enough.\"  It was.  Although difficult, Hunter successfully curled the 1,600,000 ton (3,200,000,000 pound) bar.  Hunter used his powers to get rid of the ridiculous bar.  \"Okay, shower time.\"  The two decided that they did not want to shower though.  They took a romantic bath together instead.  Trixie loved to lay with Hunter and is muscles.  Might as well get clean doing it.  Hunter was not very fond of showers anyway.  Soap always got stuck in his abs because they're so deep.  (3 inches deep to be exact).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their romantic bath, the two got dressed.  They both wore a tank top and shorts.  They walked outside and took off.  On their way into town, they noticed a train heading for broken track.  \"Trixie, our ice cream may have to wait.\"  The two flew down to the train.  They calculated that it was moving 120 mph, and that if it didn't slow down in two miles, it would derail.  The two dragons flew in front of the train, and braced for impact.  Just like in a superhero movie, the train pushed them into the ground, slowing gradually.  By the time the train reached the missing track, it was stopped.  \"What was that about?\"  The conductor yelled from the engine room.  \"The rails are broken.  The train was about to derail.\"  Trixie yelled.  \"Well, thank you!\"  The conductor replied.  \"Who are you?\"  \"That's for us to know, and for you to figure out.\"  With that, the two dragons took off, soaring quickly into the skies.  \"Well, that was interesting\"  Hunter laughed.  \"Yeah.  Did you see me?  I helped.\"  Trixie pointed out.  \"You certainly did.  I think you deserve that ice cream even more.\"  The two had a midair hug, and continued their journey to the ice cream store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two landed in front of Frostie's Ice Cream Parlor.  \"Huh, Est. 1902.  It's been around a while.\"  Hunter remarked.  \"Yeah, but there's a reason.  It's the best around.\"  Trixie replied.  The two entered the parlor.  \"Welcome to Frostie's.  What would you like?\"  The penguin behind the counter asked  \"Could I have a strawberry and chocolate milkshake?\"  Hunter asked.  \"And could I have a medium cup of Rocky Road?\"  Trixie asked.  \"Okay.  Coming up.\" She replied.  \"This place has been here a while.\"  Trixie said.  \"It's been a family tradition to run the parlor.  I'm generation 4.\"  \"Interesting.  I can't wait to have my shake.\"  Hunter said.  \"It's my first time here.\"  \"Is it?\"  The penguin asked.  \"I think I'll add something special to your shake then.\"  Once the shake was done, the penguin took it to the topping area, where she put white chocolate syrup into the mixture.  \"Thank you!\"  Hunter yelled.  He was excited.  He loves white chocolate.  \"Here you go.  That will be $4.50.\"  The penguin said.  Hunter handed her a $5 bill.  \"Keep the change.\"  \"Thank you, and enjoy your ice cream.\"  The two sat down, and had their cream.  \"I see why this place has been around for 113 years.  This is amazing.\"  \"Thank you.\"  The penguin giggled.  \"Could I have a XL shake to go.  This time, with hazelnut and chocolate?\"  \"Sure.  We call that the Nutella Special.\"  \"Perfect.\"  The penguin made the shake, and gave it back to Hunter.  \"That will be $3.50.\"  Hunter handed her another 5.  \"Keep the change again.  This is too good.\"  The two left the parlor, milkshake in hand.  \"We'll have to remember this place.\"  The couple took off, heading back to the house.</span></div></div>",

Funny meeting you here!\"  Hunter yelled at the couple flying.  \"Hey, long time no see!\"  Troy laughed as he and Mary approached the other couple.  \"How's the wedding planning?\"  Trixie asked.  \"It's going very smoothly.  We're having our wedding on the same day as Lance.  Might as well make it easy.\"  Mary responded.  \"So, what brings you here?\"  \"We went out for ice cream.  Trixie wanted to work out, so we did.  Since she was very good, we got ice cream.\"  Hunter stated, showing the Milkshake.  \"What about you guys?\"  \"We went to a sports game.\"  Mary responded.  \"That sounds fun.

I'm not bigger or heavier.\"  Troy responded confused.  \"Well, the actual muscle fibers got stronger.  The weird thing is that our muscles were not this strong when we went to bed, and none of us used our powers to make this happen.  Any ideas?\"  Hunter rambled.  \"No.  How strong are we now?\"  Troy wondered.  \"I'll show you.  Follow me.\"  The two dragons flew off at speeds unimaginable by most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApprox. 32 minutes later:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, the only place I could show you this is in here.\"  Hunter explained as he entered the Gravity Gym.  \"I also came here because Lance is here for some reason.  Anyway, while Trixie was working out, she wanted to see me curl using a traditional barbell.  It took over 300 5 kt plates!\"  Hunter explained.  \"I calculated my maxes, and they were measured in megatons.  Which reminds me.  LANCE!?\"  \"YEAH!\"  he yelled.  \"GET OVER HERE!\"  \"OKAY!\"  Lance flew over, barbell in hand.  \"I can't seem to find a weight with enough resistance.\"  \"Well, that answers that question.  For some reason, our muscle fibers strengthened, but nobody used their powers to do that.  They just did that on their own.\"  \"Maybe it has to do with us transcending the realm of Gods.\"  Troy suggested.  \"Yeah, but we did that a while ago.\"  \"I know why.\"  A mysterious voice said.  All of the sudden, the human God appeared.  \"Your mortal forms strengthened because your muscles wanted to.  They've become capable of increasing their strength on their own, without your consent.\"  \"Well, that's annoying.  I like having limits to my strength, even if they are too large to matter.\"  Lance complained.  \"There, I've used my powers to get rid of that.  It would get annoying very quickly.\"  \"But did you truly get rid of it?\"  The human asked.  \"By the way you said that, no.  Hang on a minute.\"  After saying that, Hunter transformed into his Super God form.  Troy and Lance immediately followed suit.  \"Now I've removed it.\"  Lance smirked.  \"The only thing this form cannot do is let other Gods transcend into Super Gods.\"  Hunter explained.  \"In fact, I just realized something.  If we want, which we wouldn't, we could take away the powers of other Gods.\"  \"Just in case someone corrupts, we'll handle it.\"  Troy grinned as he reverted to his normal God form.  \"Okay, from now on, unless the true need arises, our mortal forms will not become physically stronger than they are currently.\"  Lance said.  \"Agreed.\"  Troy and Hunter said.  \"Anyway, isn't there something that's supposed to take place in one day?\"  Hunter grinned.  \"Oh, the weddings.  Let's get back to the house.\"  The three gods transformed into their Super Gods, and teleported to the house.  (Remember how I said the Gravity Gym cannot be teleported to.  I never said anything about from.  Take that Plot-holes!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne Day Later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeaven, a place of wonder.  Most wonder if it truly exists.  Spoiler alert, in this story, it does, as shown previously.  How else would Lance be marrying Alecia and Troy marrying Mary in Heaven right now.  Anyway, the six dragons were all in their God forms, because only angels, Gods, and those taken there by Gods can enter Heaven.  Hunter wouldn't be allowed in in his mortal form, even though he is technically one of the God of Gods.  Rules are rules.  Anyway, onto the story at hand.  The six golden dragons were all standing in front of a large marriage alter, waiting for the Human God to marry those getting married.  Hunter and Trixie were off to the side, sort of being Best Man and Maid of Honor respectively.  Once the human showed up, the ceremony began.  An angel was playing a lovely organ, and all of the Gods in heaven were watching.  Soon, Lance and Troy walked down the aisle, both in very fancy suits that somehow were not tearing under all that muscle.  Hey, God powers work on clothing too.  Soon, everyone was standing, watching as the two beautiful Goddesses walked down, both in flowing white dresses, matching the clouds they were walking on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome unspecified amount of time later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that took a while.\"  \"Yeah, it must be confusing marrying two couples at one time.\"  \"Yeah, but that doesn't matter.  Now, Troy is finally my husband.\"  \"Yeah, thank God.  Or in this case, thank us.\"  The six all laughed at that joke coming from Alecia.  They make Oh My God jokes all the time.  \"Anyway, let's celebrate.\"  The six left Heaven, and went to one of the fanciest restaurants in the world:  Masagawa Restaurant in Japan.  They were in the mood for sushi.  Plus, this one was perfect for their wedding celebration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe six arrived at the restaurant, and got a table.  To make a long story short, the appetites of three muscle giants can be large, and the girls were decently muscular too.  So when the bill totaling $4000 worth of Yen came to the table, those paying were not surprised.  (Or worried)  After that, the six returned home, ready to do the thing most couples do after getting married that I do not want to mention to keep this story line as age appropriate as possible.  However, the subject matter may make this difficult.  Either way, they did that.</span></div></div>",

Hunter flew down low and saw a little kid getting picked on by 2 thugs. they beat him up and took the little guys money. Hunter snarled and spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you guys pick on someone your own size?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthey looked around to see where it came from. \"or better yet, someone BIGGER!\" hunter crashed into the ground and towered over the thugs snarling. \"you think your so tough picking on innocent little kids?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hey, stay back, we don't want any trouble!\" they said nervously pulling out knives. Hunter scoffed. his scales were too tough for those. he grabbed them by their necks and clunked their heads together knocking them both out. then he set them down and walked over to the kid. It was a green wolf pup. he wore a hoodie and sweatpants, and was both amazed, and nervous at the sight of the dragon. \"you ok little guy?\" hunter said kneeling down, \"they didn't hurt you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N...no. thanks for saving me.\" he said sheepishly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"its ok. where's your mommy and daddy?\" hunter asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their dead.\" he sighed, \"I don't have a home.

I'm a god and I can make you the biggest wolf alive, but you gotta promise me something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"what?\" he asked eagerly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise you will keep it a secret, and not tell anyone that I'm a god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise!\" Joseph said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter checked, and saw he would keep his promise, so he smiled \"ok stand back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe took a deep breath expanding his chest and blew a green flame onto Joseph. it consumed him, but didn't hurt. the flame grew covering him from view. Once it cleared, there stood a humungous green wolf as big and as old as Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it!\" he said pulling hunter into a hug. hunter hugged him back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you can make all the money youll need by wrestling and advertising.\" hunter said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe remembered his competition, \"bye Joseph\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wait! can I join you?\" joseph asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhunter stopped, this kid would fit in with his life, and he seemed like a great guy, why not?</span></div></div>",

However, some stayed around to have their items signed and photos taken with Hunter and Lance. Hunter signed things that he never thought anyone would want signed. After the rabid fans finally dispersed, the two giants talked to the event organizer. The event had raised tens of thousands of dollars for charity and people were paying through the nose to get Hunter and Lance to show off their strength at other events. Hunter and Lance left happy and satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they got to Hunter's penthouse, Lance said good-bye and headed back to his own house, giving Hunter the rest of the day to himself. He lay on his over-sized bed, pondering what to do. He could work out in his private gym, or go shopping with his millions of dollars, though he might be mobbed out in public...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's thoughts were interrupted when he heard the familiar ring of the phone. He rolled over to the side of the bed and picked it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Hunter boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! How's my favorite wall breaker?\" a familiar voice responded. Hunter's stepdad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey dad, what's up?\" Hunter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got some exciting news, Hunter! Tina and I are getting married!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter had to search through his memories even faster than the last time to figure out who Tina was. Apparently, she was his stepdad's girlfriend of 3 years. She had a thing for muscle guys, so she was at one of Hunter's competitions when she and his dad met. She originally was attracted to him for his competitor-like muscles, but through dating she found him to be kind and loving too. Tina herself was also very kind and supportive, coming to all of Hunter's competitions and events and treating him as well as a real mother would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, all of this information was given to Hunter in a second so he could answer in a normal amount of time. \"That's great! Good for you two!\" Hunter responded, his happy energy quickly renewed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we're at the house right now, so why don't you drop by for a little?\" Hunter's dad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll be there soon. See ya!\" Hunter hung up the phone and got ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, Hunter was walking up to his dad's house. It was the same house he had lived in during the previous reality. Hunter had the money to buy his dad pretty much any house in the world, but his dad insisted that he enjoyed the comfort his current home gave him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter tapped lightly on the door (which still sounded like a hard knock) and soon his dad opened the door for them. They embraced in a hug that would shatter the spines of most people in the world and Hunter's dad let him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's dad led Hunter to the living room, where Tina was sitting on the couch waiting for them. Though Hunter had saw her briefly during the memory flash, being able to fully stare at her really made his jaw drop. Though she was in her mid 40s like his stepdad, she had the body of a teenager. She had luscious curves and breasts that strained against her shirt. Along with that, being the girlfriend of the father/trainer of the world's top bodybuilder had convinced her to start working out. She had a fit, toned body, complete with very visible six pack abs. She was drop dead gorgeous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three sat on the couch for hours, talking about everything from protein shakes to good TV shows. Tina had a smile on her face the entire time and was always supportive of the two men. Hunter and his dad regularly looked at each other, both knowing that they both had a good woman in their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually it got late, so Hunter politely excused himself and jogged home. Before he knew it, he was in his boxers lying down to sleep. Though he had thought it many times before, Hunter was extremely happy. He was the strongest man on earth, he was a millionaire, his dad was happy, he had a loving mother...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was so busy listing the good things in his life that he didn't even realize it when he slipped into a deep sleep...</span></div></div>",

He looked around the room once more and said, \"Who's there.\" After one more random turn, two giant tigers appeared out of no where. They looked majestic and beautiful with their unique garment made out of jewls and gold. Although it would seem that Hunter would not know these remarkable strangers, he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, Dad?\" Hunter asked. \"Yes, Hunter,\" Said the woman, \"It is us.\" His father the spoke, \"We are sorry that we could not be in your mortal life. We had business to attend to and it would have been very lonely for you with us.\"<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" Said Hunter.<br>\r\n\"Hunter,\" Said his mother, \"We saw how you used your powers and we are very proud that you are having a good life in the mortal world. You're almost as strong as your father!\" Hunter blushes a little bit but his mother continued talking. \"Although you have a good life Hunter, there is more to being a god than just the luxury.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was puzzled by this. \"What do you mean?\" He asked. His father answered, \"We mean that it is time for you to take on the responsibilities you were destined to complete. You having been using your powers for yourself but now it is time to use it for others.\" Hunter thought about this hardly. He loved his powers and the life that it gave him. Was he willing to sacrifice some of his selfish desires to help others?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thought mad his decision: \"If his powers gave him so much goodness towards him, imaging how others would be like if they were exposed to it.\" Hunter said to his parents, \"I understand and ready to take on my duties as a tiger god.\" His parents smiled proudly to him after he said that. \"Good to hear, my son.\" Said his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want me to do?\" Hunter asked. \"Your first task Hunter regards your friend Lance.\" Said his father. Hunter was a little worried by the sound of that.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? Is he all right?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, he is fine. But you will need to accomplish your task.\"<br>\r\n\"You must start by telling him of who you are.\" Said the mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was more confused than ever now. \"What do you mean tell him? What is my task?\" \"All will be clear once you tell him.\" <br>\r\n\"Wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Hunter could ask his parents anymore questions, he woke up to a cold sweat with the morning sun beaming through his bedroom window.</span></div></div>",

He wasn't sure whether that was a dream or not, but the fact that it was so vivid made him almost positive. But what should he do about it, especially when he didn't even know what to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis deep thought was interrupted by a knock on the door. Not bothering to put on anything over his boxers, Hunter got up and walked over to the door, opening it to see a smiling face. It was Lance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey bro, what's up?\" Lance greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's mind went back to the talk he had with his parents. The one thing they did tell him about his destiny was that it involved Lance. Though that did involve revealing his biggest secret...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance could obviously see that Hunter was in deep thought about something, and his voice became more serious. \"What's the matter?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter considered it for a second. Revealing that you're a god is obviously a big deal. But Lance was such a good friend, and had never broken Hunter's trust. Hunter decided to go for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter sat down on his bed. \"Look, I'm going to tell you something, but you have to swear to keep it a secret,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance nodded. \"Dude, you know I'd never tell your secret. What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter took a deep breath and, taking a leap of faith, said, \"I'm a god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long silence between the two friends. Hunter was waiting to see what Lance would say. Would he be afraid? Angry?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance finally broke the silence. \"You serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter nodded. \"You know how my stepdad raised me because my real parents died in a car crash?\" Hunter asked. \"Well, the truth is that they didn't die in a car crash at all. They were secretly gods who had a kid in the mortal world before leaving to resume their godly duties. I'm that kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another long silence. Lance stood up. \"Dude, you know I'd trust you with my life, but that's a pretty crazy story. How can you prove it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter stood up right next to him. \"Is there anything that you want, something big that you've never been able to have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance gained an even more serious expression before going into deep thought. \"Well... there is one thing I've never been able to do that I've always wanted. I think everyone has. But for me, I've always wanted to...\"</span></div></div>",

Lance broke his silence. \"This kinda sounds embarrassing but I always wanted to fly.\" As Lance said this, Hunter kinda understood that. Lance was a very heavy and muscular guy. He couldn't be graceful or flexible if his life depended on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds cool dude!\" Said Hunter, \"Do you mean fly like a bird?\"<br>\r\n\"I was thinking more of a dragon. They look so cool on both land and sky!\" Hunter completely understood what he was saying and was willing to make this wish come true. \"All right,\" Said Hunter, \"Consider it done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter directed his hands towards Lance while he was wondering what he was doing. Before he could figure it out, Lance started to feel strange. He felt warmness all over his body while the wish granting occurred one step at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, Lance grew to Hunter's size in height and muscle and witnessed as they erupted out of his clothing. He then saw his rough skin melt away in front of his own eyes revealing red scales beneath. Out of nowhere, a sharp pain appeared on his back. It got more and more intense by the second. The pain stopped as giant red wings popped out of his back. After what seemed forever for Lance, Hunter's gift was complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter lowered his hands. \"What do you think?\" He asked. Lance was still speechless. His breath was taken away as he saw his clawed hands and feet while remains of his clothes scattered the room. He ran to Hunter's bedroom to look at his full length mirror. As he looked, Lance was simply amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw himself as a gigantic red dragon that was big as Hunter with upper part of his pants still remaining. Lance spread out his new wings only find desired beauty within them. His grin got bigger and bigger as he made more and more poses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude!\" Lance said still speechless. \"You really were telling me the truth!\"<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Said Hunter, \"Would I ever lie to you?\"<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Lance said still not knowing what else to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter walked towards the window of the living room and opened it. \"Go on; the sky's been waiting for you!\" Lance was totally stoked at the thought of flying. Without giving it any thought at all, he raced across the room and jumped out the window. Hunter worried about at first but saw Lance rising up with his wings wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance soared around the hotel for about half hour. He loved the air pushing against him and his wings. It made feel so full of life as if he was truly breathing for the first time. He was so excited that he did tricks like loops and twisting in the air. Hunter loved the sight of Lance having such a good time flying in such grace. Maybe his parents were right after all. He was glad that he told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance finally came back to the window again still stoked. \"That was COMPLETELY AMAZING!!!!\" He yelled. \"How did I do all that? I wasn't even thinking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was all me.\" Said Hunter. \"I gave you the knowledge of flight along with increased mobility and flexibility. That's why you were able to do all those tricks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter saw tears coming from Lance's eyes. They were tears of happiness. \"Thank you!\" Said Lance give Hunter the same strong hug that he occasionally gives him.</span></div></div>",

He turned to his alarm clock to see it was three in the morning and the pounding of his door wouldn't stop. Groggy and grumpy, Hunter got out of his bed and made his way to the door not caring that his was still in his boxers. As Hunter opened the door, a dark and hulky figure of Lance stood in front of him. Lance had a grin on his face and tense muscles of excitement. Still tired, Hunter said, \"It's three in the morning, Lance. What do you want?\" Lance burst out a breath with words. \"I have the greatest idea ever!\" Lance yelled. Hunter, clutching his ears, said \"Can it wait till another several hours?\" \"Nope.\" Lance said. \"Trust me, it's the best idea since underwear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance let himself into Hunter's place and sat on the couch. Hunter followed him. \"What's your idea?\" Hunter said with a hint of annoyance. Lance grin was still there. \"You know that dock of abandoned warehouses near the beach?\" he asked. Hunter nodded. \"Well,\" Lance continued, \"I was thinking that we use that area to our advantage. Let's buy the place and turn it into a massive gym!\" Hunter's head perked up a bit and Lance was still running with anxiety. \"Let me get this straight,\" said Hunter. \"You want us to buy an entire dock to build a place where underwear was most likely invented?\" \"It was a handy invention.\" Lance joked. Hunter sighed as if he was further annoyed. Lance got serious. \"Listen bro,\" He said to Hunter. \"I got it all figured out. We'll reserve each warehouse for a different type of exercise; like one for weightlifting and one for sports! We can have trainers of every kind to help customers and I got some money to start with!\" \"And you want me to pitch in?\" Hunter guessed. \"Think about it, bro!\" said Lance grabbing Hunter's shoulder. \"Bro and bro working at an amazing gym together. Awesome! Besides, you have more money than me and I thought you could pile some with mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was finally starting to wake up. He was actually intrigued by Lance's idea. He was loaded from all his competitions. He wouldn't miss some thousands. Hunter was concerned about the finances and keeping the place open but he figured he could use his powers for that. Hunter couldn't see a severe disadvantage. He thought it could actually be fun. With a sigh, Hunter said, \"Ok, let's see where this takes us.\" Lance slapped Hunter hard on his back making Hunter completely awake. Lance jumped out of the couch. \"This is going to be so cool! Trust me, you won't regret this! It's going to be so awesome!\" Without a goodbye, Lance slammed the door and ran toward his own home. Hunter took another deep sigh wishing he had a more subtle friend. It was four in the morning now. Hunter didn't care how early or late it was, he went back to his room to sleep.</span></div></div>",

He could always train later or at least use his powers to train. \"How about we go to the beach?\" Said Hunter to his stepdad. \"That's a great idea!\" Said his stepdad. \"Let's show off those prize-winning guns!\" Hunter blushed a little bit and went to his room after his breakfast.Hunter came out with a large towel and bathing suit with legs. His suit outlined his legs perfectly, just the way he liked it. Hunter's stepdad waited for him near the front door of the house looking almost as sexy as Hunter. \"Let's go!\" Said Hunter excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and his stepdad arrived at a busy day at the beach. Hunter didn't care. He was distracted with the salty air, sound of crashing waves, and the warmth of the sun. He puffed out his chest to take it all in. \"Beautiful, isn't it?\" Hunter asked his stepdad. \"Yep,\" his stepdad responded, \"but not as beautiful as that.\" Hunter's stepdad then pointed at a group of hot girls in bikinis around his age. \"Hunter, you go and find some fun. I think I just found mine.\" Hunter chuckled and said \"Ok. Try not to hurt yourself.\" But Hunter's stepdad didn't hear him. He was already gone in pursuit of the ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter made his way across the sand. Heads were turning in his direction and he loved the attention. He took a deep breath out of satisfaction how his life was looking. He looked great and felt great and his stepdad actually liked him. Nothing could change how Hunter was feeling. However, the deep breath he took quickly disappeared by the sight in front of him. There was a group of incredibly sexy girl tigers in bikinis in his sight. They were probably in their late teens to early twenties; Hunter wasn't sure. Hunter wanted to come up to them and flirt but he was too young. Who ever heard of a 13-year-old hitting on older girls? He felt restrained but he wanted to hang out with them so bad. Hunter then came up with an idea.</span></div></div>",

He saw a public bathroom near the surfboard rental stand and went inside it. Hunter looked inside to see it was deserted. He went into one of the stalls and began to think about what he wanted to do. He thought 21 would be an appropriate age. Not only was it appropriate, he would also be able to do adult things. He then concentrated on being 21 and it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter felt a surge of power running through his body. His bones shifted to make him taller and his muscles were doubling in size. Hunter was too distracted concentrating on his transformation. He didn't notice until he was done. It felt like forever for him, but he finished transforming into a giant 21-year-old. He squeezed out of the stalls and looked at the mirror. He looked amazing! Hunter was now at a hight of 7\"5' and his muscles looked like someone shoved giant boulders into his body. He flexed a bicep and it swelled to a veiny beachball! He looked at his chest to see it was an 8-pack and his legs looked powerful. He also had some slight facial hair on his chin. Hunter grinned and said in a deep and strong voice, \"Look out ladies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter walked out of the bathroom and saw the girls where he saw them last. He confidently made his way toward them. \"Got room for one more?\" He asked them. The girls looked towards him and almost gasped for air. A giant and sexy tiger wanted to stay with them. How could they refuse? \"Sure,\" said one tiger shyly, \"make yourself at home.\" They all moved to make a spot for Hunter. Hunter sat between the group in a sexy pose and smile. \"What's your name?\" One girl asked. \"Hunter.\" He said simply.<br>\r\n\"What do you do for a living?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm a bodybuilder.\" <br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Hunter flexed a bicep. \"Anyone want to feel it?\" All the girls rushed to feel his iron-strong pipe of an arm. \"So strong.\" Said one girl mezmerised. \"Thanks.\" Said Hunter. He then got an idea. \"And that's just the beginning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up from his spot and started flexing and posing for the girls. The girls enjoyed seeing such raw power bulging from Hunter's body and Hunter enjoyed the attention. Hunter didn't feel tired of showing off and the girls didn't want to stop cheering. Hunter finished with one pose that made him shine behind the sunshine. The girls nearly dropped dead. \"I love this!\" Hunter thought to himself.</span></div></div>",

Hunter then looked at the ocean in front of him and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone want to go for a swim with me?\" Hunter asked the girls. The girls couldn't refuse an offer like that from him. They nodded quickly and walked toward the water. As one girl dipped her foot into the water, she jumped it out immediately. \"It's too cold!\" She said. Hunter looked to her. \"Really?\" He said. \"Yeah, it's freezing!\" \"Let me see.\" As Hunter was making his way to the water, he used his godly powers to make the water warmer. As his feet seeped into the ocean, Hunter found the water very comfortable. He turned to the girls. \"Feels great to me. Come on!\" The girls first thought he was crazy or really liked cold water. They didn't want to go in at first, but hanging out with a muscular guy like Hunter didn't occur very often with them so they trusted his word.

They just wanted to be with Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and the girls swam and splashed each other in the water. They, especially Hunter, were having a great time. The water was cooling Hunter down but his heart was still racing. He never thought of hanging out with hot girls before and he loved it! He tensed his muscles with excitement and laid on his back floating in the water. After a while, Hunter and the girls got out of the water. The girls admired seeing a wet Hunter coming out. They loved the sight of water running through his rippling body. He stretched out his back showing more muscular definition due to relaxing so soundly in the water.

As a final touch, Hunter saw to it that his body began to emit pheromones so powerful, that girls tigers would have worshiped as a god! Then Hunter did start time! Immediately girls tigers, muscular and colossal, pounced on Hunter with loving and fierce sensuality. Those girls began to worship Hunter, hugging him with all the strength I had, for the torso, neck, arms and legs! Other kissed him so spasmodically sensual where they could in every part of his body. Still others wanted to Hunter even offer their breasts because he could suck on them. All those girls groaned so lustful, worshiping with all their might the young demigod.

You think you can just take whatever you want?!\" Hunter calmly said \" I'm sorry about that. I was going to bring them back. You see...\"<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" said the dragon. \"Give us your winnings, or ELSE!\" The dragon then slammed his massive scaly fist against a random locker leaving an indentation in it.\"That's suppose to scare me?\" asked Hunter. He then reached out both of his hands toward their shirts and lifted the dragon and lion from the ground. They started to get scared. Especially with Hunter's eyes glowing white. \"You dare accuse a god of being a cheater and thief?!!\" He yelled to them. With all of his strength, Hunter slammed the two onto the ground with a quaking thump.<br>\r\nThe dragon and lion were terrified now. They had no idea who the guy was but they knew he wansn't normal but Hunter quickly reacted before they could find out. \"Since you think of me as a theif,\" said Hunter, \"I'll show you a theif!\" He put one hand on each of their chests and felt the craving warmth again.

He grinned as he watch his street clothes slowly rip to shreds as he was getting bigger. His biceps were becoming the size of beachballs and his legs more sturdier than steel! His chest grew from an 8-pack to a 12 pack and his height peaked to 7 foot 5.<br>\r\nAt long last, the growth was complete. Hunter grew into a massive brute that he thought no one was capable of becoming. He then saw unconscious an dragon and lion with twig-like arms and legs wearing clothes way too big for them.<br>\r\nHunter was please with his new muscles. He flexed a bicep and saw it swell bigger than it ever did before. Hunter then thought to himself, \"I am Hunter: the tiger god of strength!\" Before he left the locker room room, he used his powers to erase the dragon's and lion's memories and replaced them with memories of them always small. He then used them to change reality again to make people think he was always that big and made bigger street clothes to appear on his rippling back. Hunter left the locker room as if nothing ever happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hunter decided to take a look around his new room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were shelves completely filling one wall of the room with trophies. Looking at a few of the trophies, Hunter was amazed at his athletic versatility. Baseball, basketball, football, swimming, soccer, rugby, track... you name it, Hunter excelled in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were also newspapers cut out of the local newspapers and framed on the wall. They had headlines like \"WONDER TIGER LEADS BASEBALL TEAM\" and \"LOCAL HULK SETS NEW TRACK RECORD\". The articles themselves showed that Hunter was captain of every team he was on and was breaking records left and right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were also some opened letters sitting on Hunter's desk. Hunter picked some of them up and read them. It appeared that high schools and even colleges were practically begging Hunter to attend their schools, offering fully paid tuition and many other great benefits. And who could blame them? With Hunter's awesome skills, any team he was on was destined to be great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Hunter noticed a calendar sitting next to the letters. He looked at the current date and saw that he had practice in 15 minutes! Frantically, Hunter took off his current clothes and threw on his uniform before dashing out the door. Excited to see just how good he was, Hunter sprinted back to school to practice...</span></div></div>",

There, he saw his new teammates, some who were eager to play, and others who were a bit shy. Hunter was obviously the best player on the court, since he was a young teenage boy with his divine powers, but as he walked on to the hardcourt, he remembered his mission and new purpose in life as well. He was supposed to help ordinary mortals using his divine powers. Sure, he could make himself the champion in everything, but the most important thing for him, was to use his abilities to help others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Hunter and the other boys warmed up, taking turns shooting and dribbling while passing the ball back and forth, he spotted one boy who was standing closest to the wall. This boy was one of the shorter players, who was also a bit on the chubby side as well. The boy dropped a passed ball now and then, and his aim for passing the ball to other players wasn't very good, either. However, Hunter noted that the boy really wanted to be on the team no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the Coach signaled that it was time to play a small pickup game, the boy made a lot of mistakes. He felt terrible, and the Coach made him sit on the bench. When it was finally Hunter's turn to take a rest, he sat next to him as he drank from his water bottle. Then he turned to face the boy, in the hope to learn as much about him as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his divine powers, Hunter figured out that his name was Cody. Cody was 11 years old, and he was friendly to everyone. But, Cody was a bit clumsy and not very athletic. So, Hunter decided to help him out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were sitting on the bench, Hunter quietly wished for Cody's basketball skills to increase dramatically so that he could now play at the same level as all the other boys. Next, Hunter made Cody grow almost a foot taller, making him grow from 5 ft 6\" to 6 ft 6\" tall, without anybody noticing it! Next, Hunter made all of Cody's flab melt away, replacing it with solid muscle! Cody's stomach gained washboard abs, his pecs filled out and grew into large round spheres of muscle, and his biceps were like round soccer balls. Cody was now tall and muscular! Plus he had all the skills in order to play some mean basketball! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the Coach blew his whistle he asked for Cody and Hunter to get back on the floor. This time, Cody was awesome! He was passing, dribbling and he was making all his shots! he was even making his free throws! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter just smiled as he saw how Cody was playing, and he began to look around, feeling determined to help other kids using his powers. Who would he help next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Apparently lifting heavy weights wasn't the only thing he could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHung up along the wall were various posters of movies that Hunter had starred in. The first one was called \"Tiger Terminator\", which had him fighting off robots in a leather jacket. The next one, \"Tiger Gladiator\", had him in a Greek arena doing battle. Finally, the last poster was \"Tiger Wars\", a movie set in the future in another galaxy. All of the movie posters took advantage of his large muscles by having him fight villains and wear as little clothing as legally possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's attention was then brought to a trophy case, which had two golden trophies in it. Hunter got up closer to read the words on the trophies. The two trophies turned out to be Oscars which Hunter had won for Best Actor. \"Well, I must be a pretty good actor,\" Hunter thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter looked around his room a little more. He found some magazines that he was on the cover of, and of course some gym equipment to keep his muscles in great condition. Suddenly, the phone in his room rang, causing him to jump a little. Hunter went and picked up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Hunter, it's me, Harvey! How's my favorite little bodybuilder doing?\" Harvey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Hunter made it so that he knew who Harvey was. It turned out that Harvey was Hunter's agent, the person who dealt with his roles and who had discovered Hunter in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Harvey, what's up?\" Hunter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid, you're gonna love this!

Would it be real?

Oh, looky!\" Hunter grinned, as he spotted three anthro lion teen boys, wandering around the mall as they were looking over the large display window in front of the sporting goods store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne boy was tall and skinny, the second was short and skinny, and the third was short and fat. To Hunter, this was a golden opportunity to have some fun using his divine abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go and make those three a little more muscular!\" Alec said, as he pointed at the three guys who were standing next to each other, gawking at the exercise equipment that none of them could afford.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the chubby anthro lion's big belly melted away and his fat legs became thinner, Every ounce of fat disappeared from his body. He now looked like the other two guys. Next, all three of them started growing more muscular, all at once! Their arms bulged out, their legs thickened as their calves inflated, their quads grew thicker, and their pecs became big and round with amazing muscle. Their abs were defined with washboard buttons and their physiques now resembled those of lions who competed in the Olympics!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!

Mr Hollis is explaining how a lever works.  \"The seesaw is an example of a lever.  An adult and a small child can seesaw if the adult sits close to the middle and the child sits far away from the middle.  The child's less weight exerts more force because he is farther away from the center point.  When the seesaw is balanced, there is an equation.

He finally decided to head back to school, thinking that he could maybe get an idea there. Hunter went back in the direction he came from, back towards his school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter walked through the doors to his school and started looking around. The school was mostly empty, aside from some kids who were involved in after school activities. Hunter was looking for someone or something to change when he heard voices. Panicking, Hunter hid behind a wall, close enough so that he could hear what the people were saying. He peered around the wall to see who he was listening to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first person was Mary, a shy bookworm who didn't have many friends. She was a panther, short with nerdy glasses and messy blond hair. The second person was Derek, a lion. He was captain of the football team, not to mention a jerk who pushed everyone around because of his superior muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Derek...\" Mary said, her voice soft and quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Derek asked, the annoyance in his voice evident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you... possibly consider... going on a date with me?\" Mary asked, finally managing to get the words out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slight pause as Derek took in what Mary had said. Then he burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right! Like I'd ever go out with you!\" Derek laughed, not even acknowledging Mary as he walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter saw that tears were beginning to form in Mary's eyes as she sat down. Hunter wanted to go and knock Derek's lights out, but he heard Mary say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does no one like me? Why am I not beautiful?\" Mary asked herself between sobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter felt really bad for Mary and wanted to do something for her. \"This is what gods do, right? They help people,\" Hunter thought. Hunter decided to grant Mary's wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter focused on Mary's first change. She grew from 5' up to 6', her legs becoming slimmer. Her waist thinned out, giving her the hourglass figure that was envied by most women. Her breasts, formerly very small, ballooned out into C-cups that gave her a stunning look. Mary had been too busy crying to notice the changes before, but now she began to notice that something was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Hunter changed her face. Her lips became full and red, making her mouth one that any boy would want to kiss. Hunter took away her need for glasses, revealing her gorgeous green eyes. Speaking of her eyes, Hunter altered them slightly to make them look seductive and luring. Mary's hair came next, straightening itself out and lengthening down her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mary seriously began to wonder what was going on, Hunter changed her personality. Before, Mary was shy and not very outgoing. Hunter made it so that she was cheerful and outgoing, proud of her own looks but not vain or stuck up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Hunter changed reality so that Mary had always been this beautiful. Her tomboyish clothes morphed into a revealing tank top, short skirt, and high heels, all designer. She was no longer crying, instead checking out her makeup in the mirror. Hunter smiled, knowing that he was going to like changing things, but wondering what to do next...</span></div></div>",

Hunter was happy that he could help someone like Mary but he wanted to be with her also. After pondering for a solution, he Hunter came to one. He wanted to change reality so he could be with Mary and help others with his powers. Hunter concentrated on this wish. The more he did, the more sleepy he got. Eventually, Hunter collapsed on his desk before the school bell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunshine from a nearby window caught Hunter's eyes. He opened them to find himself in an unfamiliar area. Hunter was in a huge round bed and everything in the room from wooden furniture to the carpets was lined with precious metals and jewels. He stood up to have the floor squeek underneath him. He went to a full view mirror to find a muscle-bound titan in front of him! The mirror showed Hunter in his silk boxers outlining his gigantic thighs with 10-pack abs, bulging biceps, and some slight facial hair. Hunter flexed a bicep and it grew to the size of a beachball! He touched his bicep only to see it was as hard as diamonds! He felt power rushing all over his new body. He then noticed the new facial hair and height. Memories ran through Hunter's head and found out he was now 24 years old. Memories overwhelmed him when he reached the double doors in his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter noticed the double doors of his room and opened them wide. He found himself on a balcony revealing a whole new world! There were building all different shapes and sizes, remarkable green and natural parks, and people that appeared scrawnier than him. Hunter then realized what happened. He began to remember that he was now the king of utopian world and he was a great king to others. Hunter felt overwhelmed with this new reality. He had new responsibilities he was expected to meet. However, he was satisfied that he was now living in his fantasy world. \"Enjoying the view?\" Said a voice behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter looked back to see a finely dressed and 24-year-old Mary. She looked slightly muscular than when he transformed in the last reality but not enough to be considered a bodybuilder. \"Mary.\" Said Hunter. He then comes her in open and powerful arms. Mary accepts his offering and give each other a good morning kiss.</span></div></div>",

He decided to get out of the classroom as soon as the last period was over and to see what was going on near the athletic fields after all the classes were over. This was where all the student athletes were hanging out, and Hunter figures that this would be the perfect place to test his powers. He could help out the football players, the baseball players, or the soccer players, depending on who was having their practice sessions that afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small soccer team called the Phantoms were having their soccer practice at the soccer field at the back of the school at that point in time, and Hunter decided to go take a look. He wandered over to the bleachers and sat down, watching a big group of anthro dogs and wolves all dressed in black shorts, green socks and green jerseys with black cleats battle it out against the Wolverines, who were dressed in black shorts and cleats but in red jerseys and red socks instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the Phantoms were the home team, all the kids in the bleachers were cheering for their boys who were dressed in black shorts and in green jerseys and socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter sat down in the bleachers and he realized right away that a few of the boys were growing tired after spending over thirty minutes chasing after the soccer ball and trying to defend their goal from the relentless attacks that the Wolverines were dishing out. Three players, all of them were wolves, sat down, all sweaty and tired, as they drank some water and they began to talk about the game as Hunter overheard them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, these guys are tough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We gotta get through their defense!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need two more goals and we got this game in the bag!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter noted that the three boys were named Giovanni, Anthony and Tristan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three boys stood up and slowly walked back on the field as they waited for the referee to blow the whistle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can help out our guys before the seecond half starts!\" Hunter grinned. \"I want our guys to gain ten pounds of muscle each!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, each one of the boys on the Phantoms soccer team were suddenly overcome by a tingling sensation in their muscles. All six of them, who were now standing on the field, began to experience a slight episode of muscle growth: Tristan, Anthony, Giovanni, Nicholas, George, and Carlos. All six of them felt their calves bulge out a bit; their quads inflated a little, their abs became firmer, their biceps became harder, their pecs inflated and their biceps enlarged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni and Anthony quietly stared at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude.... Are you like... feeling... stronger?\" Giovanni whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix other players from the Wolverines got on the field when the ref blew the whistle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Phantoms attacked the goal right away and Giovanni scored a goal within a minute! Then, three minutes later, Anthony scored the next one! Finally, Tristan scored the third goal about ten minutes later! The home team ended up winning the game by four goals!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter only grinned as he saw the results of his powers and wondered where to go next...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
