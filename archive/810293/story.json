No, it's much better.  Watch this.\"  With that, Warren turned and pointed the science fiction looking gun, a long heavy looking machine which he held with both hands, at a chair across the room.  A ray of blue light surrounded the chair and it quickly shrink away to a tiny size.  Jonothan and Andrew ran to examine the chair and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's awesome!  Like \"Land of the Giants\" awesome.\"  Andrew said.  Jonothon stared at the chair, open mouthed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All in a days work in the life of a Q from both Bond and Star Trek.\"  Warren said, grinning and nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are we going to do with it?\"  Jonothan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same thing to try to do every day, Pinky.  Try and take over the world!\"  Warren said with an evil grin.<br>\r\n................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a relativly slow day and the Magic Box closed early.

Unfortunately, Willow lifted her foot, causing the teeny slayer to tumble uncontrollably towards the young witches' toes. Buffy slammed against the front of Willow's shoe and could feel the pressure of her toes against her body. \"Is this how it ends?\" She thought. \"I've saved the world multiple times, survived endless apocalypses, and already died twice, and now this? Squashed like a bug under my best friend's toes? What a humiliating way to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow undid her shoelace and started to remove her shoe. \"Are you sure that was a bug, Anya?

Just as she started to make out the shape of Willow's enormous face hovering above, \"Will, it's me! I--\" Suddenly, her miniature world was turned upside-down. She found herself rocketing back through the length of the shoe and falling through space, finally landing in what felt like a gym mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow and Anya stared in shock at the minute creature in Willow's hand. \"B-B-Buffy? Is that you? What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy quickly shouted the story of Warren and the shrink ray and her troubles since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry my toes almost squished you.\" said Willow, looking down at her tiny friend apologetically. \"Yes, and I'm sorry I called you icky and tried to step on you...several times.\" said Anya. \"To be fair, you are very tiny, though.\" Buffy glared at her.</span></div></div>",

Aside from being all shrunk and everything, I mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good as you can be at an inch tall, I guess,\" she replied. \"I'm just worried about the damage that Warren might be doing with that shrink ray. I don't think he's gonna stop with shrinking me. You guys have any ideas to get him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea!\" said Anya excitedly. \"Of course, it involves selling tickets to see Buffy fight fleas, so...\" Willow cut her off. \"Anya! This is serious! A big bad could strike at any time and right now we have a very little slayer who couldn't hurt a fly! Literally! Umm...sorry, Buff. I mean, you probably could take a fly. Maybe even a bee. Or a...grasshopper...I'm not helping, am I?\" She looked down at her tiny friend with a sheepish look on her face, afraid of humiliating her further.

The former vengeance demon didn't even notice. \"...now, a cricket on the other hand, I could see Buffy taking down...\" The slayer walked back to the center of the table and collaped in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow suddenly sprang up. \"Alright, we can't just wait around for Warren to come back and shrink the rest of us. Here's what we're gonna do. Anya, you go get Xander and Dawn and check out where the Trio were hiding out before. I know of a spell that could possible restore Buffy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you gave up magic. You were 'addicted', remember?\" said Anya, sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why, I'm calling Tara first. If I don't have to do it on my own, it won't corrupt me. Plus we can keep an eye out for Warren. Now get going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Alright!\" Anya leaned her huge face close to the teeny slayer. \"Buffy, could you do me an itty-bitty favor while I'm gone, and check to make sure all the mouse-holes in the basement are sealed? Thanks!\" She patted her on the head with her pinky, knocking Buffy on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anya, get out of here!\" yelled Willow. As Anya exited the shop, Willow scooped Buffy up in her hand and brought her close to her face. \"Sorry about that, Buffy. She was having a little too much fun with your...condition. Don't you worry, though. We'll have you back all great big again, soon. Well, as big as you get, anyway. You know,\" she said, with an odd look in her eye, \"I'm kind of excited about doing magic again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in Willow's palm at an inch tall, the look was unmistakable to Buffy.

What's happening?\" Buffy yelled up to the titanic redhead. \"I-I--\" Willow gasped, just before she passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy ran to the table's edge and peered down at her giant friend sprawled on the floor. \"Will! Willow!\" she yelled, with no response. She had to get down there somehow. Taking a deep breath, she leaped onto a nearby chair, the equivalent of jumping off the roof of a six-story building to the insect-sized slayer. Luckily the chair was padded; however, she still felt the shock through her body. She then took a running leap off the chair, landing in the middle of Willow's stomach. As she rolled with the force of the landing, she nearly fell into Willow's navel. The young witch still hadn't stirred. Buffy climbed onto Willow's sweater and made a mad dash towards her head. As she approached Willow's chin, Buffy noticed something. Willow looked smaller than she had a second ago. Was the spell working? With renewed determination, she latched onto a lock of her friend's hair, and used it to swing to her ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" she thought, \"I am getting bigger! I'm larger than Willow's ear now!\" She screamed into the witch's ear, \"Willow! Wake up! The spell's working! I'm---\" Suddenly, Buffy looked at her surroundings. The chair, the books, everything still seemed as gigantic as before. Only Willow looked smaller. But that meant--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will!\" she screamed even louder, as the formerly giant ear dwindled before her. \"Will, you've got to wake up! The spell backfired! I'm not growing, you're shrinking!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If only there was a way to contact the other scoobies, she thought, but the Magic Box phone was perched atop a counter that loomed overhead like a mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned, the miniscule blonde watched as the former giantess quickly shrank to 6 inches tall. 5 inches. 4...3...2...and finally stopping at approximately one inch tall, the same amazingly tiny stature as herself. Willow moaned softly. Buffy cradled Willow's head in her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh...what happened? What--Buffy, is that you?\" Willow blinked rapidly and focused her gaze on her friend. Suddenly, she shot up to a sitting position. \"Buffy, it worked! You're back to normal size!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you thought I needed Tara!

I've been shrunk for a couple of hours now and believe me, it's no fun. At least  there's no one around to accidentally step on us.

In reality, Willow had only thrown the sneaker about 18 inches away, but for the tiny slayer, the fall felt like a mile. When it landed, she spilled out onto the hard floor, dizzy and fortunately unnoticed by the two giants who would surely have crushed her underfoot if they had spotted her tiny form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy managed to weakly roll to the safety of a table leg as Willow's heel came within inches of squashing her, while kneeling to retrieve her shoe. \"Did you kill it?

Desperately, she planted both feet in the spider's midsection and using all her (diminished) slayer-strength, flipped it over her head and several inches across the floor.

Buffy had recently thrown her out of the Summers house for helping to corrupt Willow with magic, and Amy was looking for something to juice her powers back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy wondered what to do. She didn't think she could trust Amy enough to help her, but the longer she was stuck at bug-size, the more she hated it. What's more, she knew that Warren was still out there with that shrink ray! Should she try to get Amy's attention or--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Amy froze in her tracks. She sensed something. \"There's someone here. Someone...small.\" Before Buffy knew what was happening, Amy dropped to her knees and snatched the tiny slayer up in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well. Somebody finally cut the great Buffy down to size.\" She smirked. \"Nice work. Magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy squirmed in her fingers. \"If you must know, it was a shrink ray. Put me down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughed. \"Oh, I don't think so, squirt. You know, I didn't appreciate the way you treated me before, especially after you left me as a rat for three years. Maybe this is karma. I just might start a roach motel with you as the first tenant.\" She started to gather objects around the shop. \"I should be able to duplicate the shrinking effect with a spell.

Wish I'd thought to bring my purse. There wouldn't be a hamster cage around, would there? Or would that be too roomy?\" She chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy glared at her giant captor. \"When I get back to normal-size, I'm gonna kick your ass!\" Amy squeezed Buffy's ribs with her fingers, causing Buffy to cry out in pain. \"Uhnn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, Pee-wee! Aahh, here we go. Perfect!\" Amy picked up a funnel from a shelf behind the counter. She placed the miniscule Buffy underneath it. \"Now you just keep an eye out for ants and mosquitos, and I'll finish my work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy gripped the bottom of the funnel, and lifted with all her strength. It wouldn't budge. \"Great\" She thought. \"I used to be able to kick down steel doors and throw people across city blocks. Now I'm too weak to lift a plastic funnel. Being tiny sucks!\" Then she had an idea. She took a spare stake from her jacket and jammed one end under the funnel, then set another stake under the first to use as a lever. This gained her ample leverage to lift the funnel up high enough to squeeze under. She glanced around to make sure Amy hadn't spotted her. She hadn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy had just about completed assembling her spell. \"Soon Willow, you are going to be in the palm of my hand. I am going to rule this town!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren meanwhile, decided the safest thing to do was to find Buffy, tiny or not, before she could contact her friends.

Panicking, her loss of concentration causing her spell to fail, she turned to escape the giant Warren. Unfortunately, she had already shrunk below 6 inches and tripped over a pencil on the floor. When she looked up, all she could see was a giant hand reaching down towards her. She was only 1 inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come 'ere, you.\" said Warren, as he snatched her off the floor. \"You wouldn't of happened to have seen a blonde 'bout your height, goes by the name of Buffy, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what, big guy.

He placed her under the funnel, just as she had done to Buffy minutes earlier. \"I'll be back, babe.\" He began meticulously searching the area around the funnel for the miniature slayer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her escape from the funnel, Buffy had made the amazing leap (6 inches!) to the next table and was attempting to reach the closest phone.

While there was a certain satisfaction in seeing the scheming witch receive a taste of her own medicine, Warren was now free to focus completely on tracking down the micro-slayer. She pondered her next move. How to get word out to the other scoobies? There was a phone next to the cash register approximately 200 feet (her scale) from where she hid. \"Even if I can make it over there without Warren spotting me,\" she thought, \"am I strong enough at this size to move the receiver, or even push the buttons?\" Once again, she cursed her tiny stature. The once mighty slayer, now too small and weak to operate a telephone? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question appeared to be moot, as the relatively-gigantic Warren was inching closer and closer to discovering her hiding spot. \"Come out, come out, little Buffy!\" he taunted. \"You can't hide for long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy, meanwhile, was arranging the magical items she had grabbed prior to her shrinking. She began chanting, as a mist started to swirl about her inch-tall figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy felt Warren's huge shadow fall over her as he approached her sanctuary. If she ran for the phone, he'd surely spot her; then again, if she remained, as soon as he moved the pencil-holder, she would be revealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren started to reach for the pencil-holder when he heard a rattle behind him. Turning quickly, he saw the funnel under which he had placed the tiny Amy begin to shake violently as a strange mist escaped from the top. Suddenly the funnel exploded in a shower of light and smoke, revealing the normal-sized form of Amy. \"Yes! It worked!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren began to raise the shrink-ray, when Amy froze him in his tracks with a gesture. \"Hold it, Dr. Shrinker!

She heard thunderous laughter from above, and gazed up at the two giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, look how cute she is!\", smirked Amy, peering down at the tiny blonde. \"She thinks she can use that big ol' phone to call her friends to come save her from big ol' us!\" Thinking fast, Buffy attempted to use a short stack of post-it notes as a springboard to vault over Warren's hand, but he merely raised it up an inch, causing her to fall back to the counter. \"Uh uh uh, munchkin, you're not going anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mini slayer tried to regain her footing, but found her sides being pressed together by something metallic.

Xander asks, \"So, idiots, how do we make it so that ladybugs can't kick our asses?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Talk, you lot, or I'll drain you dry.\" adds Spike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"We, umm, never thought we would have to unshrink any thing, so the gun wasn't designed to do that. Plus, I believe that it has disintergrated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well, you idiot better think of something soon, or...\" Xander's comeback is interrupted by a loud noise in the distance. The door to the Magic Box opens, and in walks the incomprehensibly large figures of Buffy, Willow, and Dawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Xander,Spike,Warren,Andrew,and Jonathan all say the same thing, in unison.<br>\r\n  \"Oh, shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Let's climb that Buffy mountain!\" said Spike in a sarcastic tone. \"Well, you pansies commin'?\" With that, the five of them took off at a sprint towards Buffy's tennis Shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Xander ran right behind Spike, toward the mass of blue and white ahead of them: Buffy's shoe. Now nearly there, the shoe rose above all of them, by the best estimates 20 stories or more to the ankle, which is covered by the blue jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Stopping just in front of the side of the shoe, they looked up in awe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How are we supposed to climb up that?\" yelled Warren, obviously scared out of his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well,\" began Spike, \"You look to the left about 50 feet and look at the shoelace. You move over to said shoelace, grab onto the weave, and climb. We'll see where it takes us from there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sure enough, to the left was a gigantic shoelace. It's plastic tipped end is a good 30 feet long, and the lace itself is about that far across. At this size the weave of the lace is easy to climb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Now by the shoelace, the five grab on, beginning the climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Good thing Buffy never learned that all too important childhood lesson of tieing her shoes.\" says Xander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They are halfway up the lace, nearly to the top of the shoe, when the world suddenly moves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"AHHHHHHHHHH!\" they all scream (except for Spike, of course) as the shoelace begins to swing.

And eventually, they stopped screaming. Well, except for Andrew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If that bleeding pansy ever going to shut his hole?\" Spike asked Xander, who was holding tight to the fabric of the shoelace beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" No, I don't think so.\" replied Xander. \" How about we just let him get it all out now, so that maybe later, you know, he won't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Then, they stopped. Instead of constantly moving forward, the shoe they were on moved up and came to an abrupt stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"We must be in the car. She's probably headed home.

Let's get climbing!\" No one disagreed with Spike's statement, so they began their climb anew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eventually, they managed to reach the top of the shoe, and all of them layed down and rested on the tounge of the sneaker that lays between the laces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Now what, great leader?\" Andrew asked Spike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Since when was he appointed leader? I want a recount.\" drowled Xander. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"We keep climbing, I'd say.\" said Spike, who then gazed up, seeing only an immense wall that was Buffy's denim pantleg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Are you nuts? That's suicide. I am not climbing some bitch that I should be killing!!\" exclaimed Warren. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, now is not the time for this. We have to figure out a way to get out of this mess, all of us. We don't have time for petty grudges.\" said Xander, stepping between Warren and a murderous looking Spike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Speak for yourself.\" growled Spike, who was now in full vamp face. \"I think i'm gonna kill this stupid ponce.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey, hey! I didn't mean it, hold on! We're in this together, just like Xander said. You might need my help, to get full size again. It was my shrink ray that did this, right?\" Warren said, his fear apparent in his eyes. He did not know that Spike could not attack humans, and so now feared for his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Spike's face morphed back to normal. \"Maybe you're right, mate. Won't kill ya this time. But badmouth her again, and I will drain ya dry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Look,\" Xander began, \"I don't know how long this Car ride is, but I think we had better start climbing that tounge to her jeans, cause we have a long way to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With everyone agreed, they began to climb the hundred or so feet to the top of the sneaker tounge. Everyone was nearly to the top when the mountain on which they climbed moved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"THEY MUST BE HOME. HOLD ON TIGHT!\" yelled Xander. <br>\r\n-------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After the longer than usual trip home(traffic was horrible, which is strange, for a small town like sunnydale), they finally arrived home. Willow drove, with Buffy in the passenger seat and Dawn in back. All Buffy wanted to do was get inside and take a load off her feet. She had been busy all day, and wanted to rest a bit before she went out on patrol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I am totally ready to just veg out in front of the T.V for a couple of hours.\" Said Buffy as she climbed out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, it's been a long day. I'm still worried about Xander though.\" said Willow as they walked up to the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, i'm sure he's fine. He's probably tied up at work. You know our Xander, he works hard for the money.\" replied Buffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, you're probably right. I'ts just, you know, living on a hellmouth and everything, you never know what could have happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, just call his house to see if Anya has heard anything. He might have just lost track of time, you know,\" Buffy looked behind her a Dawn, who didn't seem to be paying attention, \"Washing Anya's windows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm not sure if we should hope for that or not.\" Willow said as she stepped inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n When they got inside, Dawn went straight to the kitchen, most likely to get something to eat. Buffy slipped out of her shoes and walked upstairs, to change into something a bit more comfortable. <br>\r\n----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The five held on at the top of the tounge as Buffy walked up to the door. When she stepped through the door and stopped, They moved quickly. They stood up, the wall of Denim ahead of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"We have to jump! Are we ready?\" Asked Xander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I didn't see myself doing this when I woke up this morning.\" said Jonathan, mostly to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Xander began to speak again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Okay, on three. ONE, TWO, THREE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n On three, all five jumped. But at that exact moment, Buffy decided to slip her socked feet out of her shoes. In midair, the Denim wall was rapidly replaced by a fuzzy white plain, that was moving quickly away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Everyone was thinking the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, this sucks.\"<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

The shoelaces' tip was a good thirty feet long, the lace itself about that wide. The loose lace streched up the side of the shoe, up up and up, into the distance. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Apparently Dawn never learned to tie her shoe, lucky for us.\" said Xander. \"Well, what are we waiting for?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that, the 5 grabbed onto the woven white material and begun to climb. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n Halfway up, Xander says in an exasperated breath, \"Well, at least we are fast climbers. Halfway up in only a couple minutes?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Must be a side effect of the shrinking. The pull of gravity must be less or something...\" Andrew never completed his thought. At that point, an immense shadow over came the group...<br>\r\n===================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After waiting a couple minutes while Buffy and Willow talked in the other room, Dawn began to fidget. She looked down and noticed that she had a shoelace untied. At that point Buffy and Willow were beginning to come into the room. Not wanting to waste time and just wanting to get home to eat, Dawn hastily bent over and grabbed the shoelace, sticking it down into the side of her shoe. She wore no socks, so it wasn't uncomfortable. Plus, she was going to be home in a few minutes, and she would change out of them then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, are we ready to go?\" asked a hopeful Dawn. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Yeah. It's weird of Xander not to show.

Alas, as soon as she got to the kitchen, she heard Buffy yell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn! What did I tell you about leaving your shoes in front of the door! Move them, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She was only upset because last time, she tripped over Dawn's discarded shoes. The thought brought a smile to Dawn's face. All those slayer reflexes and training, and she trips over a shoe. She also didn't want to hear Buffy yell again, so she went. Walking back toward the entrance, Dawn glares at Buffy, and says <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" You couldn't have waited a half an hour? Was this really that dire? You're right, this ranks up there with the Apocalypse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Buffy just rolls her eyes. \"Just put them in your room.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n With a grunt, Dawn bends down,grabbs the shoes, and clutching them to her chest, runs up the stairs.<br>\r\n          ==============================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The five hear Dawn come in and exchange words with Buffy. Then, they see a massive teenage hand descend upon them. The hand misses the shoelace, but grabs the shoe, and lifts it. Winds rushes by, and Xander feels ready to puke.<br>\r\nThen, they are all slammed into red fabric. Dawn's shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oooh, Downy fresh\" cracks Andrew.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"All right, this is our chance. This is our ride. We just need to jump over to the red and we will be a short climb away from freedom. Who's with me?\" After Xander said this, they began to argue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What if we fall off?\" asked Jonathan.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"You'd be doin' the world a favor.\" replied Spike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I think this is a bad idea.\" says Warren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Do you have any better ones? Cause i'm listening. Except, time is a little short.\" Asked Xander. The world swayed by as Dawn ran up the stairs. \"We have to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With a final nod, everyone agrees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Okay on one, two, three, JUMP!\" screams Xander, and they all throw themselves onto the red fabric. This is just in time, as Dawn opens her door and throws her shoes in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"All right, now, what next?\" asked Spike to no one in particular.<br>\r\n              ===========================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Dawn ran down the stairs toward the kitchen, unaware of the 4 men and a vampire holding onto the red shirt covering her left breast. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She could taste the cherrios now, all crunchy and purportedly healthy... Then she realized she was fantasizing about cereal, and thought that maybe she should consider getting a lunch at school more often. She walked into the kitchen, and was grabbing a bowl from the cupboard when she heard Buffy yelling, yet again.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Hey Dawn! Will you pour me a bowl of cherrios too?\" Buffy's voice reverberated from the basement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why don't you make it yourself?\" Dawn yelled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I am folding YOUR laundry, so I am busy. Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Fine, since I am your slave, no problem.\" Dawn was annoyed. Now it would take that much longer to sit down and eat. She grabs a second bowl out of the cupboard and, grabbing the cereal box, begins to fill both bowls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Meanwhile, Xander, Spike, Andrew, Jonathan, and Warren clung to Dawn's sweater for dear life. Dawn's movement down the stairs almost threw them off, and now her seemingly jerky movements were threatening to do it again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why doesn't she just sit down, of fall asleep?\"<br>\r\nasked Andrew, clinging fiercely to the red material. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't see that happening any time soon. It seems to me like she is having a snack.\" said Spike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her movement stops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Finally! Oh, thank God! Thank god...\" Jonathan muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Looks like we can begin that climb. And remember gentlemen, don't look down.\" After Xander said this, they all began an upward movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Dawn poured both bowls full of cherrios, then turned to the refrigerator and grabbed the milk. With a steady hand she poured both bowls. Then, she stopped, hovering over both bowls. Should she use sugar? No, one has to watch her figure, after all. She notices that some of the milk jugs persperation got onto her hands. Hearing Buffy walk up the stairs, Dawn quickly brushed her hands down the front of her sweater, and upon grabbing her bowl and spoon, began to walk quickly to the living room. She wanted to beat Buffy to the T.V. She always hogs it, but not this time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"We're doing pretty good. We'll make it to her neck in two, maybe three years!\" growled Warren angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, maybe you should have thought about that when you shrank us to be smaller than an ant. In the future, you know, just be aware.\" Xander snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Spike began, \" Well, you know, we're makin' pre'ey good time, if you two betty's would do more climbing and less complaining...\" He was cut off when the fabric quaked violently. Everyone looked up to see a wall of flesh 40 feet high racing toward them: the side of Dawn's hand. The five had no time to react before they were smashed by the flesh wall, and swatted off the fabric. They all fell together, seemingly falling forever. They all landed with a splash! in a white liquid: Milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n They all began to bob to the surface, sputtering and choking in the sea of milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What...the bloody...hell... Where are we?\" sputtered Spike, still spitting out milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n We seem to be in a bowl of cherrios, which doesn't bode well for us, I think.\" replied Xander. \"Lets all grab onto this\" with that, Xander swam over to a small island, with a grainy texture. It was twice as tall as any of them, but they could hold onto the grainy side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Once everyone joined them, Spike asked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"We heard Buffy was having a bowl, too. The question is, whose bowl are we in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

At the top of the stairs she watched Dawn whizz by, intent on grabbing the T.V. first. This didn't bother Buffy so much; At least Dawn would be quiet and leave her alone for a few minutes. She looked forward to enjoying her bowl of cereal in peace and quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Buffy walked into the kitchen, and walked over to her prepared bowl of cheerios. She has been busy all day, and hasn't had time to eat a thing. Next time, she thought, i'll  eat my  breakfast at the designated breakfast time. Pulling up a stool, she grabs a spoon and digs in for her first bite. <br>\r\n----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The five tiny men floated in the milk, clutching the side of the cheerio, preparing for the worst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey, maybe we shouldn't be holding onto this. As it is to be eaten and all, maybe not the best idea to be hanging onto it.\" Said Spike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How else do you think we're going to get out of this bowl?\" asked Xander. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, I was kinda not hoping on a spoon, to someone's mouth.\" Spike countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Look, it's simple. All we have to do is stick together and jump off this undoubtedly healthy grain cereal piece at the same time, thus eluding a munchy, crunchy death.\" Said Xander, a bit of fear entering his voice toward the end of his sentence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"We're going to die, arn't we?\" asked Jonathan, to no one in particular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wait! Does Buffy have a really smart dog? Cuz' in that movie, 'Honey I shrunk the Kids', the dog saved that kid who was going to be eaten. So maybe if she has a dog, you know...\" Said Andrew, trailing off when he noticed the withering stares everyone else was giving him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Is he wrong in the head?\" Asked Spike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No time for that, look!\" yelled Andrew. Everyone's gaze turned skyward, as the looming face of Buffy appeared, her blond hair flowing over her shoulders. Suddenly, a silver object appeared in the sky, it's size boggling their mind: a spoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"AHHHHHHHHH!\" screamed Jonathan and Andrew in unison, who immediately began to swim toward the edge of the bowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No, you idiot's! Stick together!\" yelled Xander, but to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't think they liked your plan.\" Said Spike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Screw this. You guys can get eaten by that bitch if you want, but not me. I'll show her...\" Said Warren, as he began to swim off toward Jonathan and Andrew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Xander was about to swim off toward them, to reason with them, but was stopped by Spike's hand on his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Their ain't nothing we can do for those stupid ponces now. If they want to get killed, well... I'm not going to shed any tears.\" Said Spike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's because your evil. And as much as I hate to say it, your right. There's nothing we can do.\" Said Xander, right before the spoon hit the hills of cheerios behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hold on!\" yelled Xander as the cheerio they were attached to was pushed to the side by the force. <br>\r\n-------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Buffy dipped her spoon in the cereal absentmindedly, her thoughts elseware. It worried her that neither Xander nor Spike showed up for the meeting, and Willow's worry added to her own. What if Willow was right, and Xander was in danger? Buffy found that she wasn't too worried about Spike's well being. After eating, she was going to talk to Willow and maybe even pay a visit to Xander's apartment. She had to make sure he was okay. Then, Buffy brought the first spoonfull of cheerios to her mouth, and took her first bite. After she chewed and swallowed, she realized how hungry she was, and quickly dug in for more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Somehow, this situation was Buffy's fault. She always foils his plans, always foils him! Why couldn't this just go to plan? Stealing Fort Knox would have been so...cool, especially with one less Slayer in the world. He knew one day he would end her, one day she would die screaming in fear, in pure terror, as he...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren's inopportune focus cost him much, as a metallic wall slid between him and the more focused and thus much faster two-thirds of the Trio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Crap!\" Warren said, as he made an attempt to double back. Unfortunately, the spoon was much, much faster than he could compete with. It slid under him, deep beneath the milk, accumulating sunken cheerios and acquiring some that floated on either side of the retreating Warren. All was still for a moment, and then the world around Warren seperated from milk sea and began to make its ascent skyward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                      ----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Buffy dipped another spoon into her cereal, and then her thoughts began to drift toward the inept thorns in her side, the Trio,or whatever dorky name they had given themselves. She wondered where they would turn up next...no matter, she would deal with it when it comes, like she did everything. She would see it through, she always did. She realized that she had been holding her spoon out and staring off into space, and relieved that no one had been around for that slightly comical sight, brought the spoon to her mouth, opened wide, and took another bite. She chewed lazily, then swallowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                         -----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren world stopped for a moment, and he was able to see the undefinable sight of a Mountain-sized slayer. With her blond hair cascading and those beautiful lips, Warren might have found her attractive if a. He didn't hate her and want to kill her and b. She wasn't about to eat him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUFFY! BUFFY DOWN HERE! BUUUFFFFFYY!!!\" He began to scream as he was brought to her lips, which opened to reveal giant rows of white teeth, a monstrous snake-god of a tongue, and a black abyss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO-\" His screams were cut off as he was deposited into the mouth of the slayer, who preceded to chew. The world was a hellish conglomeration of chewed cheerios, saliva deep enough to drown in, and the constant thrashing of the landscape of her tongue. He narrowly avoided a quick death of being crushed between her teeth as he began to slide back, half buried in chewed food, to the back of her throat. Then she swallowed, cheerios, Warren, and all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Willow was in the lead, and her Sneakered foot was bearing down on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Spike and Xander then also began to run to escape being crushed into the floor. The shadow of the enormous sneaker, easily the size of a small town, began to bear down on them. With a ground shaking crash, it lands just behind racing forms of Xander and Spike, the air displaced throwing them both into the air and concequently crashing to the ground. Then Willow's foot again took off into the air, landing far ahead of them, in front of the still running forms of the Trio. She seemed to be walking into the back room. As Xander and Spike began to pick themselves up off the the floor, another shadow overtook them.<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As Willow began to investigate the back room, and Buffy by the counter, Dawn walked over to her older sister. All she wanted to do was go home and grab something to eat, but when Buffy told her after school that there was going to be a Scooby meeting, she knew it would be a while. Sure, Dawn enjoyed going to the meetings, but her gnawing hunger plagued her and her curiosity fled. While walking over to Buffy to suggest just going home, Buffy turned to her, looked down, then back up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey Dawn, now I know I remember teaching you how to tie your shoes. Or is that just a hip new thing kids are doing today? 'Cause if so, i'm sure that will go the way of the rubber braclets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Dawn looked down to see that her right shoelace was untied. She knew that with her lack of grace,that was an accident waiting to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Fine, i'll tie it, but only if we can get going and get something to eat! I'm starved, and it's apparent that Spike and Xander found something more exciting to do then come to this meeting. Like, I don't know, sleeping?\" said Dawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Just tie it.\" was Buffy's comeback. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Dawn then bent down to tie her shoe, and as she moved to pick up her loose shoelace, movement next to it caught her eye. She then bent down to take a closer look...<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With coinciding crashes, two enormous sneakers slammed down on either side of Xander and Spike. There, they stopped moving. Figuring they were saved for the moment, the two men, still on the ground, got up quickly and dusted themselves off. Too their right, and enormous shoelace rested on the ground, apparently loose from the sneaker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Who is it?\" asked Xander. Whoever it was, their face was so far up that it could not be seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's the little bit. Or, the formally little and now bleedin' gigantic bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What do we do?\" asked Xander. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm thinking that we should reconsider the climbing plan.\" said Spike, as he pointed to the shoelace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey, you were the one against it in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh,well. Yet again i'm the bad guy. 'Magine that. Well, are you commin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sure, why not? I due to be...\" Xander's cynical comeback was cut short when the enormous form above them began to move, and not to walk. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"She's crouching, to tie her shoelace! This is our chance, mate! HEY! HEY BIT! DOWN HERE!\"<br>\r\nSpike began to yell. Xander, processing what was happening, soon began to join him, waving his arms and screaming at the top of his lungs. <br>\r\n\"DOWN HERE, DAWNIE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her mind boggling huge hand, one that could hold a stadium in it's palm, loomed over the the loose shoelace, then stopped. Her face took up the entire sky as it peered down on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"DOES SHE SEE US?\" Yelled Xander, still waving his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I THINK WE ARE ABOUT TO FIND OUT!\" answered Spike.   </span></div></div>",

They didn't move like normal bugs, that is scurry away on numerous legs. They seemed to be standing, on two legs no less, and jumping up and down. She couldn't make out their features, but one thing stood out. On of these \"bugs\" had bleach-blond hair. Her eyes widened as she peered closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey, Buffy?\" Dawn asked, eyes not straying from the two forms on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Buffy still standing at the counter and wondering why Dawn is staring at the floor, replied \"Yes, Dawn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How many bugs have bleach-blond hair?\" Dawn asked in a sort of strangled voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n If Buffy was expecting a question, that was not it. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And stand on two legs, and... wear black leather jackets?\" continued Dawn, more of a hush to her voice now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What the hell are you talking about?\" said buffy, walking over to wear Dawn kneeled on the floor. As Buffy approached, her sneakered feet stopped in front of the spot on the floor Dawn was gazing at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey! Watch wear you place your feet! Buffy!\" said Dawn, her arm lashing out, her hand grabbing Buffy's shin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What's going on?\" Buffy asked, now kneeling with Dawn. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Do you see those two, on the floor?\" Dawn asked, her voice a little panicked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Buffy leaned down, and saw what registered to her as two gnat-ish things on the ground in front of her. \"Oh, Dawn, those are just some...gross..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I...I think that's Spike, and Xander.\" Dawn said, looking into Buffy's eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wha...What?\" said Buffy as she leaned down, taking a closer look. Her slayer enhanced vision stared, and her eyes began to grow large.<br>\r\n \"Oh.\" Buffy now knew what Dawn said to be the truth. On the floor, smaller than ants, were her best friend, and well...Spike. \"OH, god!\" Buffy exclaimed, the breath escaping her mouth sending the two on the floor flying backwards what would be to them quite a few feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Buffy!\" Dawn hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Buffy quickly covered her mouth, realizing her mistake, and then bent down to whisper,\"Oh, god, i'm so sorry! Xander! Are you all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She could tell they were moving, but could not hear a thing. Slowly, her feet planted, Buffy stood up, and Dawn joined her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't think we can move, we might lose them. Hey, Willow!\" Buffy said, and Willow, who had been in the back room, came out with a puzzled look on her face.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Did you find anything? I couldn't find...\" Willow noticed the look on both Dawn and Buffy's face and stopped. \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Buffy looked at Willow and said, <br>\r\n \"Willow, something strange is going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Willow began to walk toward's Buffy. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Buffy held a hand up and said \"Stop. Don't move. I think I'll just have to show you. Dawn, stay still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Buffy then bent back down onto the floor, and saw that the two shrunken figures still stood their ground. \"Hey guys,\" Buffy began in a hushed but articulate and steady voice, \"I'm going to put my nail on the ground, and I want you to climb into it, so that we can get you off the floor. Okay?\" Buffy didn't expect an answer, but said it anyway. Lowering her hand palm up, she laid her index fingernail on the ground, tilting it so that the two could climb into the bottom of the nail. After the two had done so, she moved the hand very slowly off the floor, and bringing that nail to the cupped palm of her left hand, deposited the two in the palm.  Without taking her eyes of the two figures now laying in the palm of her hand, Buffy walked over to Willow and said, \"I think something shrunk Xander and Spike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Willow's eyes widened. \"What?\"</span></div></div>",

Across the street, Andrew, Warren, and Jonathan sat in their van and studied the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do?\" asked Jonathan, \"Shrink down to microscopic size and sneak into the vault?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to be microscopic?\" asked Warren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" frowned Jonathan like a shamed child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a much easier way,\" said Warren, rolling down the window and leveling the shrink ray at the bank, \"Let me just expand the shrinking field...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he pressed a few buttons and pulled the trigger. Once again, a blue light shot from the device, but this time enveloping the entire building. There was a crashing sound as parts tore from the foundation, but in an instant there was a miniature bank exactly where the original had stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio climbed from the van and ran over to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me get it into the van,\" shouted Warren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they had the entire bank, the size of a doll's house, in the back of their vehicle. They started the car and drove a few blocks down to get away from the scene of the crime before inspecting their prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren climbed into the back and sat down next to the bank. He pulled the roof off with his bare hand, revealing a vault filled with tiny slips of money. Putting a pile down on the ground, he pressed some more buttons and blasted it. There was a red blast that enveloped the pile, but it quickly faded and nothing seemed to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit,\" shouted Warren tossing the pile back into the van and the gun to Jonathan, \"I was afraid of this. The power's shot from shrinking something so big. I'm gonna have to recharge it back at the lair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe climbed out the back and took the driver's seat, but when he turned on the lights, he found someone standing directly in front of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Buffy, dressed for slaying in her black leather jacket and clutching a wooden stake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't want to know what you three are doing out in here in the middle of the night,\" she said, looking somewhat bored by their presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buffy,\" grinned Jonathan who was moving around to get in the side door, \"What a nice little surprise. And I do mean 'little'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren groaned and shouted, \"Get in the car, you idiot. It's out of power!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late. Jonathan pointed the gun at Buffy and pulled the trigger. A light hit her and rapidly faded away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy looked up, even more bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. That's a nice laser gun,\" she said, \"Don't you hate when people point those at the screen during movies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan shrieked and jumped into the van, which promptly sped off into the  night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idiots,\" said Buffy and, being a quiet night, headed home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the basement, the trio unloaded the tiny bank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Warren?\" asked Andrew as he opened the back of the van, \"You know that money you shot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" he responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's bigger,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren ran forward and saw that Andrew was telling the truth. The money had nearly doubled from it's tiny size and actually seemed to still, though very very slowly, be growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is fantastic,\" beamed Warren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That we don't need to recharge?\" said Andrew, \"We might as well. It's gonna take forever for it get to it's full size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" smiled Warren. \"The gun was still working. And you shot the slayer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment, but the same smile grew on Jonathan's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like that's one small problem out of the way,\" Warren grinned before the smile stopped, \"You did remember to turn the gun back to shrink, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It still didn't mean that she wanted to wake up, though and didn't even notice, her eyes barely open, that the world had changed overnight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling off the covers, Buffy blindly moved into a sitting position on the edge of the bed, stretched her arms out, and yawned. At that very moment, she realized that three things weren't right. Her feet, which usually touched the ground, were dangling in the air over the side of the bed. Her arms, fully outstretched, were still contained inside her yummy sushi pajamas. Her yawn, which she had intended to have some degree of force, was a higher-pitch that almost made her jump, thinking it was made by something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lept to her feet and her pajama pants slid down and bunched at her feet as her enormous pajama top took the role of concealing as far down as beneath her knees. Horrified, she ran to the bathroom and had to climb on a box to see herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was relieved to see that she was, indeed, still herself. She had been transformed before and didn't much care for it. She looked down and her body and then back into the mirror. By her estimate, she was now no more than four feet tall. What had happened?

It worked!\" you exclaim, and then your vision clears, and you see nothing but a wall.  \"Fred?  Where are you?  Oh, bloody hell, not another hell dimension....?\" You say, spinning around.  The wall you bumped into is like leather, and black.  You walk up to it and find it goes into a tip that stops at your head.  Above it is a flesh colored plane that extends up to...a white lab coat?  A dark skirt underneath?  You look up to see Fred's face, high above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're corporeal, all right.  Corporeal and bloody tiny.  How's that for irony?</span></div></div>",

Whether this created an alternate timeline didn't matter to them.

They didn't touch his visionary powers, though.

He needn't have bothered. He was only a trigger. The Powers Looking For Cheap Laughs had used all of their power to shrink him and send him back into time to get even more power. The power to grant Doyle three subconscious wishes. The Practical Joking Powers thought the saying \"Be careful what you wish for. You just might get it.\" was the funniest punchline in existence.<br>\r\nAs soon as Cordelia touched Angel, Doyle straightened up, feeling like a bolt of lightning had just shot through him. The Powers That Thought Fake Vomit Was One Of Humanity's Greatest Accomplishments determined his three wishes and started granting them:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Doyle occasionally wished Angel was out of the way so he would have a better shot at Cordelia (the Joking Powers granted this by shooting back shrunken future Angel to his own time. Whether this created an alternate timeline didn't matter to them. Present day full-sized Angel they didn't touch),<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Doyle wished that he were fully human so that he would have a better shot with Cordelia (the Joking Powers That Chortle purged his demon side, making Doyle fully human, and incidentally, erasing the memory of him from every demon he owed money to. They didn't touch his visionary powers, though. The Joking Powers never rocked the boat of their older 'sibling', the Powers That Be), and<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Doyle often wished he wasn't so short, at least in relation to Cordelia. The Joking Powers had real fun with this. As soon as Cordelia touched shrunken future Angel he vanished and she took his place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia found herself six inches tall looking out at the office from atop her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoyle turned around and Cordelia and he stared at each other in stunned silence.

This was harder than any leg scissors, and his ribs were already badly bruised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I decided I didn't want your pathetic little guts all over my sandals.  They're worth more than your insignifigant little life.\"  Steph said with a sneer.  \"Humiliated, Rocky?  Are you afraid of Big Steph yet?  Well, it's only going to get worse.  You're mine, now, People's Champ.  And you'll stay that way until I grow tired of you, and then we'll see how your guts look on my sandals after all.\"  The Rock looked up at her, suddenly very scared.  She smiled at the fear in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...let's see...first I'll break your body, then I'll break your heart, and then your spirit.  Eventually you'll forget everything but me, your goddess. I'm wrestling's dominant female, and I'm going to prove it to you, little Rocky.  So...let's continue your training, okay?\" She grasps Rock between her index finger and thumb and begin to squeeze.  This continues, her smile one of twisted evil, drunk with the absoloute power she held over another human being, until The Rock spit up blood onto her fingers. She laughed triumphantly as she fell limp onto her finger, coughing.  She opened her hand and let him lie on her hand, badly wounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it, it's okay, Goddess is here...\" she said softly, her breath cascading over him.  Her smirked again over his broken form. So...what's next?\"</span></div></div>",

Help it to be what it is.\" She reached out and again grasped the food with her slender fingers. It was still now, hardly moving at all. River licked her lips again as she anticipated the rush of sensations that eating always brought her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food struggled less this time. Perhaps it had finally accepted its role. Regardless, she didn't want to choke again so she'd make sure it went to her belly in smaller portions this time. She lifted the food up above her head and began to lower it into her mouth. Her teeth clamped down on the first part of food that dangled down to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the food begin to react as she started to pull it away from her clenched jaws. After some slight resistance, and some noise from the food, a rip signified that she'd been successful. She could already feel part of the food in her mouth. Casually, she began to chew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the sphincter of hell are you doing?!\" Mal screamed at River. He'd been knocked unconscious by the impact with the counter. Fortunately, he'd woken up before he'd been eaten by the crazy, little hou zi de pi gu who's fingers he even now dangled from. Unfortunately, he'd woken up too late to say the same about his favorite brown coat. He rarely wore it while aboard ship; but was glad he had in this instance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd been held upside down by his ankles and the tail of his coat had fallen up and past his head. He realized that, had it not been for the coat, it probably would have been his head that River had chosen to chomp!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud 'gulp' signaled the end of River's bite of Mal coat. Her tongue briefly appeared long enough to glide across her lips before disappearing back into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unique taste,\" she said, mostly to herself, \"mostly protein.\" Her eyes briefly locked onto his as she continued, \"Don't like the consistency. Too chewy.\" Her tone was very serious and for a brief but surreally ridiculous moment, Mal felt as if she were scolding him for being tough to chew!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can't claim to be to remorsefulsum about that darlin,\" he called to her, trying to cram as much calm authority into his tone as possible, \"How bout you go ahead and put me down now, dong le ma\"?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiver's response was, to Mal's surprise, a light giggle as if she'd been truly tickled by his suggestion. \"But I'm not done eating you.\" And again her face turned stern as she continued, \"You shouldn't waste food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not food!\" Mal yelled as he was hoisted but above her head for a second bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why am I eating you?\" she asked, her face showing brief concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't!\" Mal snapped back! Hadn't he already had one of these conversations with her?! If he ever got out of this he was going to have a long talk with her brother about keeping her in her room. As her mouth opened again and he began to lower towards it; the thought of spacing her completely suddenly didn't seem so bad either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike lightening, Mal was in motion, in an instant he'd shucked off the rest of his jacket and with a great heave, had chucked it into the back of River's mouth which closed automatically upon registering the new bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs loud, wet chewing sounds began to emanate from River's mouth, Mal blew out a breath in momentary relief. He was gonna have to come up with a daring plan and quick if he was going to esc--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGULP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widened in shock! She'd eaten that bite much faster than the first; and he was fresh out of coats to sacrifice to her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consistisancy is still unpleasant,\" River began again, \"but easily swallowed in smaller portions.\" Her eyes briefly played over him, sizing him up. \"Portion is small enough,\" she concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shi-wha? No no n--\" his protests were cut off as his head and chest easily passed her lips and landed on the back of her tongue. He'd be a son-of-a-bitch if he was gonna go down without a fight though! Mal began to struggle in River's mouth even as she released his ankles. His legs still dangled out past her lips so he tried to use that as purchase to gain some sort of advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiver, on the other hand, had other ideas. This food was just another puzzle to solve; even as she enjoyed the taste as it squirming on her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her mouth, Mal was growing increasingly panicked. It was like she was reading his mind. Everywhere he tried to turn, the tongue was there first. He tried to push off the teeth, the tongue batted his arm away. He tried to turn himself around and the tip of her tongue greeted his face and pushed him back towards her throat, which loomed larger and larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Mal went for his gun. He hadn't forgotten it; instead he'd kept it as a last resort. He didn't want to kill River, but he didn't want her to kill him either. With a practiced ease he yanked it from it's holster at his hip. As he swung it around in front of him, however, the tongue again intervened, batting the gun effortlessly from his grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn horror, Mal watched his service pistol skid over the back of River's tongue before it slid into the gaping abyss of River's throat which clamped shut as she swallowed her metallic treat. When the throat opened again, Mal realized he was next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe entered the dimmed kitchen, intending to continue right through towards her bunk. \"River,\" she nodded towards the young girl in greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiver, leaning against one of the counter tops, didn't reply. It took Zoe a moment longer, in the dimmed lighting, to realize that River had her mouth full of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe was about to continue on, but something stopped her. Years on the battlefield had taught her to trust her instincts and right now they were telling her that something was very wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking more carefully at River, the only thing she could describe as 'off', more-so than usual, were the two tips of something still sticking out past her lips. As Serenity's XO, Zoe was expected to know almost everything about Serenity; including what was stocked in the galley. The more she looked, the less she was able to place the item River was even now starting to push into her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"River,\" she said finally, \"what are you eating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiver's eyes wandered over to Zoe as if noticing her for the first time. To answer, she has to empty her mouth. She can spit it out or swallow it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiver, it seems, has decided to...</span></div></div>",

At this point it didn\u2019t matter if the girl had been eating the floor plating so long as Zoe could get some shut-eye. \u201cHow did it taste?\u201d Zoe called over her shoulder as she turned from River and walked toward her bunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her, River smiled brilliantly. \u201cYummy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreaming the entire way, a fleshy valve opened ahead of him and Mal dropped awkwardly into the hot, dark sack of River Tam\u2019s stomach. Immediately he was covered in whatever frothing juices was sitting in the bottom of the girl\u2019s stomach. He struggled back to his feet, spitting out whatever fluid had gotten into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTe me da,\u201d Mal seethed angrily as he bent down and began searching blindly for his gun. It seemed to have vanished however, because all he found in the darkness was more slimy, wrinkled flesh. \u201cRiver,\u201d he called up to the equally wrinkled ceiling, \u201cdamn it girl. Spit me out!\u201d Not exactly the type of sentence he could have foreseen needing to use, but the verse seemed to do that sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe listened, trying to detect anything beyond the near constant gurgling and thumping coming from River\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYummy,\u201d he heard his ingestor moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo no no no no. \u201cRiver,\u201d he called again as loudly as he could as she sloshed through the soupy mix at his feet. Finally he ran almost face first into her stomach wall and began beating his fists against the slimy surface. \u201cRiver, get your brother! Tell him\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2014what\u2019s happening,\u201d River mouthed soundlessly, unsure why that thought had occurred to her. The fluttering behind her belly button was beginning to make her feel strange. Strange, but not bad. She\u2019d felt that way a number of times, usually when her thoughts had gotten mixed up with Zoe and Wash\u2019s, or Inara\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a\u2026 a happy expectation. Like a rubber band was slowly tightening behind her navel that would feel sooo good when it finally released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed her delicate fingers against her stomach, and gasped slightly as the fluttering intensified against her fingertips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill food,\u201d she muttered to herself, \u201cbroken down like apple bits. But it knows it\u2019s food now and it panics.\u201d She stroked her tummy lovingly, \u201csshhhh, hush baby, mommy\u2019s here.\u201d She gasped again as the fluttering intensified still further, as if someone were gently tickling her insides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought immediately brought her up short: somebody toying with her insides. They were her insides and it wasn\u2019t right to meddle! Immediately flashes of cold medical rooms and strange cutting tools began to intrude on her pleasant feelings. Somewhere distantly she realized that this usually ended with her brother apologizing after she\u2019d destroyed something else but this time was different.  The tickling, pleasant and loving, served as a kind of lifeline keeping her from descending further. She focused letting the darkness pass by her. Finally, she opened her eyes and she was on the Serenity. The strange doctors and their horrible machines were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA radiant smile spread across her face. The sun had come again and it was because of her strange food. Her wonderful strange food. Soon it would become a part of her and the doctors would quit torturing her when she closed her eyes. Thrilled, she rushed off to tell her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimon,\u201d a familiar voice whispered urgently. A momentary pause followed by the same voice, \u201cSimon!\u201d  Groggily, Simon turned his head till his sister\u2019s smiling face swam into view.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cMhn\u2026River?\u201d he asked thickly, \u201cWha\u2026. What the matter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeel,\u201d River breathed excitedly as she grabbed one of his hands and pressed it against her bare stomach. \u201cWe\u2019re pregnant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha?!\u201d Immediately Simon was wide awake and stumbling as he tried to jump out of bed but ended up tangled in his sheets. \u201cWha? Who? I mean\u2026\u201d He was on the edge of panic but River had already broken into a fit of giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou believed her,\u201d River scolded happily as she rubbed her tummy happily, \u201cMade a face,\u201d she concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRiver,\u201d he began angrily. Being woken in the middle of the night for her goofy jokes was not exactly a behavior that he wanted to reinforce, but he couldn\u2019t maintain it as he watched River giggled happily. \u201cYou are such a brat,\u201d he concluded at last with a grin slowly growing on his own face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to climb back into bed, certain that he\u2019d never actually fall back to sleep after that scare but determined to try anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d River whined as she pulled his hand back to her exposed midriff. Suppressing a yawn, Simon again pressed his palm against his sister\u2019s soft skin. He wasn\u2019t sure what he was supposed to feel besides her stomach working away on a meal but he wasn\u2019t feeling it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand River,\u201d he said gently as he looked up into her eyes. \u201cWhat are you feeling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiver\u2019s smile drooped as she seemed to consider her question. \u201cIncreased hear rate. Increased blood flow to labia minora. Increa\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour horny?!\u201d Simon blurted, spitting out a sip of water he had been taking as River had spoken, \u201cI\u2026 I mean, you\u2019re\u2026 aroused?\u201d He dropped his voice as he said aroused on the off chance that somebody was just outside his thin sliding door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same radiant smile returned in an instant to River\u2019s face as she nodded. \u201cAffirmative,\u201d she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeeze! How could people like that have won the war?! Twice Mal had lost his footing when the stomach wall he had been punching had suddenly pressed in towards him, apparently because of Simon\u2019s hand. Twice Mal and jumped right back to his feet to hammer as hard as he could against that same hand. And now, what did this fancy doctor with all his schoolin decide after his obviously thorough examination?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat his crazy sister was horny!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d he hollered up at the dark ceiling to his flesh chamber, \u201ctell him I\u2019m trapped in here! Tell him to get me the ai-yah tyen-ah out of here!\u201d He could just make out the Doctor stuttering madly as he tried to deal with his apparently amorous sister who continued to giggle happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, River opened her mouth\u2026</span></div></div>",

If he wasn't a shoe insole, then why had he been under her feet? He had to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut River's mind was extremely powerful, and holding such a fervent belief in something was especially dangerous, because she had the power to alter things. So, by believing Malcom Reynolds was a talking insole, he actually literally became a talking shoe insole. Anyone who looked on him now would no longer see him as a human, but as something to be give comfort to feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiver was able to read minds and knew that no one on the ship worked harder or was in better need of a comfy insole than Kaylee, so she made her was undetected into Kaylee's engine room.

It felt good to get out of those stuffy boots once in awhile... But before long a strange noise coming from the engine broke her rest. \"Oh no!

Without knowing he was there, she soon stuffed her sock covered foot into the boot and pressed against him. Then she went to work on the engine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Mal was finding it hard to breath inside his dark musty prison. For the moment, Kaylee's foot smelled fresh and clean, but this was sure to change as the day went on and she began to sweat. But even now, Mal could feel her full weight pressing down on his entire body and squishing him as if he were made of foam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, Kaylee was as cheerful and optimistic as ever.

Lana is freaked about her temporary abilities from the Kryptonite explosion, and so, at her aunt's prompting, goes and visits a distant relative of her aunt's in Middletown.  The relatives are happy to see her, as they had made plans for a two week cruise but were going to have to cancel it because the babysitter they had hired for their 11 year old son backed out at the last minutes.  Lana's aunt assures the parents that Lana is a very responsible young woman, and Lana is more than happy to get away from Smallville for two weeks.  Unbeknownst to Lana, that kryptonite explosion had another temporary(?), if delayed side affect, that was about to make itself known}.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana sighed happily as she set her book down on the table and rocked herself back and forth in an antique rocking chair.  Her cousins, the Patchers, have a beautiful house on a street lined with majestic oaks in a quiet section of Middletown.  It wasn't as big as Metropolis, but it was still bigger than Smallville.  And it didn't have any of Smallville's...peculiarities.  She missed the people in Smallville.  Her mind, for some reason, especially kept coming back to Clark.  But it was only two weeks, and she needed the peace and quiet.<br>\r\nIt was just a little after ten at night, and she had just put her cousin's 11 year old dark eyed dark hairedson Kris to bed.  She could tell he had already developed a crush on her, and perhaps that made him a little easier to handle.  But he was still a very well behaved boy.  True, he did seem to come home with tons of scrapes from sliding down trees and sliding into second, but all in all just a polite little boy who had all a little boy's rambunctiousness.<br>\r\nAs Lana relaxed she felt dizzy and felt a green haze come over her vision, the same color green as the meteor rocks.  Please, not more visions, she prayed.  And then, woosh, everything changed.<br>\r\nShe found herself buried in a blue denim material.  Pushing through it, she finally broke through to daylight and gasped.<br>\r\nThe room had grown enormous.<br>\r\nThen she realized the room hadn't grown.  She had shrunk.  And shrunk right out of her clothes.  The blue denim cloth burying her was her blouse.<br>\r\nJust then she heard footsteps.  Instinctively she ducked back under the denim cloth.  Eleven year old Kris came wandering sleepily into the room.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She stopped and brought her hand to her head as she staggered a little. She dropped the yardstick and tried to steady herself.<br>\r\n\"No, it can't be happening again!\", she cried. But it was! Kris was rubbing his bottom and watching. Lana was getting smaller! Her clothes were getting baggy.  Lana was taller than he. Now she was at his same height and they were looking at each other eye to eye. But just for a second. He watched as she disappeared into her clothing!<br>\r\nKris' frown became a smile!  Lana had been wearing jeans and white blouse. Now they were crumpled on the floor. Kris watched as a small lump under her blouse began to move. He heard some muffled sounds as it moved.  Gently he reached and lifted the blouse to reveal a again tiny Lana!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Was it getting shorter?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Kennedy seemed to notice something strange was happening as well and tried to pull the skirt down, but to no avail. She stepped behind the front desk and continued to write on the board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a tearing sound and she spun around and looked down.

Don't read if you don't like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe concept of this one is a \"Characters on TV Shrink/Grow\" concept, based on shows with particularly gorgeous women(such as Buffy, Angel, Firefly, WWE Wrestling and several others, with many spots for you to add shows that interest you), so please do add.  I'm going to work reasonably hard to keep things going, but I'm lazy.  But do whatever you like, including men and children if that's what your trip is.  I'm a big advocate of doing what you like and staying out of other peoples way. Enjoy.</td>",
