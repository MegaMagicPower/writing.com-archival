He was one the third sub-level of this the cult compound, He remembered from the SAT images that there was at least 2 more sub-levels bellow him.       The hall was dark, there had been some sort of surge early that had blown most of the lights and the ones that still worked were either dim or flashing. The emergency lights didn't help, just bathed everything in a red glow. James saw that up ahead the hall turned to the left. He approached it, hugging the wall and peeked around the corner with just his eyes so no one would see him easily. There was no one. It had been a while since he heard anything, either and echo or from the radio. every time he turned of the radio all he got was static so he had it off so as not to give away his position. He ready himself and slowly stepped around the corner making a sweep to double check that is was clear. He saw a door a few meters down the hall and that the hall continued on for a few more meters after that to a junction.<br>\r\nHe decided he would.....</span></div></div>",

As he drew level with the door he nudged it with the barrel of his CAR but to no avail, the door was locked and it wasn't budging any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No matter\" James spoke taking comfort in the sound of his own voice \"I wasn't planning on going that way anyway\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he resumed his cautious pace down the hall he turned on his radio again only to be met with the screech of static. James winced as he shut the radio off only to realize that the hall had gone completely silent, just as he stood there gripped by a growing sense of icy dread a bloodcurdling scream shattered the silence. James glanced down at his radio half expecting it to be the cause of the disturbance , however the switch was still in the off position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James raised his CAR and started to scan the area he began to hear the thud of foot steps <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThud, thud, thud. Jame's mind began to race looking for possibilities <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThud, thud, thud. To his right he saw an alcove that he could hide in, while at the same time his mind registered that he could probably take whoever it was with his CAR 15.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scream was closer this time, a booming inhuman howl that made James want to jump out of his skin. As James looked closer at the T intersection he noticed that the lights on the left hand side began to flicker. </span></div></div>",

He knew that the CAR would cut through anything that he encountered, but his orders came back to him, echoing in his mind.  Minimum casualties if possible.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThud thud thud, the booming footsteps were growing louder now and the emergency lights in his corridor were beggining to grow dimmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThud thUD THUD!  Suddenly the footsteps stopped and he could hear a deep rhaspy breathing coming from the direction of the intersection.  He readied the CAR in front of him and stole a glance around the corner of the alcove, what he saw made his breath leave him in a sudden whoosh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at the end of the hall was a creature, no a beast.  It was maybe seven feet tall, and under the dim glow of the red lights he could see that it had its head raised to the ceiling, and it was sniffing.  The beast had a human form, but seemed to be grotesquely disfigured.  Its entire body was coated with some kind of ooze, and under the red light Jame's couldn't tell what color that ooze was, in his heart though he knew it was red.  Blood, the beast was covered in blood and from the bits of flesh hanging from the creature's teeth he doubted that the blood was its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe left hand of the beast dangled at its side, and Jame's could see that halfway up the forearm of the thing that the flesh there had been ripped all the way through, and that the bone had been shattered leaving it to hang by a small scrap of flesh.  As if the beast could hear his thoughts it reached down and grabbed its own wrist with its right hand and pulled it slowly away.  James could hear the flesh ripping, and choked back the urge to vomit as it fell away with a wet smacking sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast dropped its head and looked in Jame's direction and for the second time he fought back that vomiting urge, the creature had no eyes, just two empty black sockets.  It let out a guttaral growl in Jame's direction and chunked the hand down the corridor towards him, it hit the floor beside the little alcove with a sloppy smack and Jame's watched as the fingers writhed against the ground, seeming to reach for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJame's closed his eyes and slid back up the wall, he still had confidence in the CAR but it was lessened now.

He bent down and poked it with the barrel of the CAR, and the fingers immediantely curled into a fist, tightening its grip with so much force that the points of the fingers began to disappear slowly into the flesh of its palm.  He kicked it hard back down the corridor that he had just came from, enjoying the sickening thud as it struck the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck is going on here?\" Jame's thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached down and clicked his radio on, cursing loudly as the static screech rang out through the hall.  He thumbed it off angrily, and raised his CAR in the direction of the intersection.  He thought about flicking on the flashlight attachment on the end of the CAR, but then dismissed the idea.  The only thing that he had going for him was surprise now, and running through the corridors with a bright white light wasn't going to do him any good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJame's pressed himself against the wall and side stepped his way to the end of the corridor, he peered around the edge of the wall in the direction that the beast had disappeared and saw that the bloody trail disappeared around another sharp turn about fifty yards down the corridor.  Another thing that he noticed was that there were four finger grooves dug into the wall on the right hand side of the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus fuckin christ\" he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped the trail of blood and pressed himself against the wall with the grooves in it and made his way slowly down to the turn.  He readied the CAR and jumped out into the open, letting out the long breath that he had been holding.  Empty.  At the end of the hall was an elevator shaft, the doors were buckled in and he could see that the shaft was empty.  An electrical cable hung in the empty shaft, throwing sparks every few seconds as it struck the door.  On the left was another door, or what was left of a door.  The medal had been shredded and it hung by one hing at an awful crooked angle, the room beyond was as black as midnight.  Jame's slowly made his way down to the room and with expert fingers he reached up and clicked on the flashlight and then swung it into the room sweeping back and forth in fast strokes. Empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked across from the room and in another little alcove he saw the empty rectangle were a door used to be, and beyond that he could see stairs leading down into darkness.  The blood trail led this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No other choice bro\" he said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe crossed the space to the small door and swept his flashlight across the stairs and over the rail to the flights below, the blood trail ended on the second flight down leading through another door.  Jame's braced himself and slowly made his way down the steps, carefully avoiding the blood.  When he made it to the landing between floors below him, Jame's froze.  He could hear a wet smacking sound, like a boot falling in wet mud followed by a sickening dragging sound.  The sounds were coming from below him, something was coming up the steps, no dragging itself up the steps.  Jame's covered the end of his flashlight with his hand and then...</span></div></div>",

James desperate to see what it was quickly took off his wrist watch and gingerly eased it out into the corridor enough so he could see the reflection but close enough that the creature couldn't see his reflection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat James saw terrified him, the creature was: seven feet tall, it had the appearance of a three week old corpse that someone had dug up, had some sort of tentacles going down the left side of its body including its leg which was the cause of the splat sound, also it had a human body in it's tentacles, or at least what was a human body at one point as now it had tentacles going into and out of every orifice in its body and looked partially absorbed into the creature and the body's intestines were hanging out of its lower end as it's legs were ripped off, hence the dragging sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James continued to stare at the grisly monstrosity reflected back at him it all of a sudden bent over and began to wretch out green slime. As James looked closer he realized that he could see human organs in the slime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWait, human organs but where would it get them from?\u201d James mused, then it hit him \"That thing must be sucking them out of the body on its side!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames fought back a shudder of revulsion and the urge to throw up at the same time. As he continued to watch he noticed the AC units in the section begin to start up and after a few minutes he began to smell the stench but that wasn't the worst part. The AC must have trigger a tactile response as the human body began to twitch and a few seconds it began to scream, or at least try to as a big fat tentacle was blocking it's mouth. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could still hear the god awful thing wretching, and something grew inside of him, past the disgust and the horror that old familiar feeling slowly began to seep back into his veins.  Rage.  Rage was his friend, and rage is what he needed most right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames clicked the flashlight on and swung out into the hall, at the last second he froze, the body that was inside this hideous monster was Louis.  He and Louis had grown up together and it had been his idea to join ATHER, he hadn't seen Louis since they had gotten split up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus no\" James moaned as he began to drop the CAR.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature turned to James and it's gut began to pull in and out as it prepared to spit more of that fucking slime.  He met Louis's eyes, and knew that his friend was to far gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Lou\" James said quietly as he raised the CAR back to his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames fired the CAR, enjoying the eruption of noise in the small corridor as round after round pumped into the stomach of the creature.  Chunks of blood and gore began to splatter against the wall behind the thing and James closed his eyes until the clip ran out.  As the smoke began to clear James heard an awful sloppy thud, and the flashlight fell on the creature.  James had cut it in two.  With horror James began to back away, the fucking thing was still alive, but now both pieces were sliding towards him across the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames took another step back and slipped in the blood trail that the other creature had left, he hit the ground with a thud, the thing was almost on him.  He jumped to his feet but now he was blocked, the wall behind and the creature in front.  James spotted a CO2 fire extingusher hanging on the wall next to him....</span></div></div>",

James having already pieced together what was going to happen quickly scooped up his CAR and booked it around the nearest corner. Just in time for as soon as he slammed his back up agents the corner every tentacle exploded simultaneously showering green gore up and down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames peeked around the corner to observe his handiwork; all he saw was a steaming puddle of paste. James began to laugh as he came down from the adrenaline high of combat, after his laughing fit was over James once again shouldered his CAR and moved out down the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he rounded the next corner his radio suddenly burped static then resolved into a voice that James knew too well <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is PFC Felicha Mennen broadcasting on all frequencies calling any ATHER personnel\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames quickly plucked his radio off his belt and brought it up to his mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Sergeant James Anderson ATHER team ECHO commanding\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

All of the soldiers had retired home for the long weekend as James was doing now. His wife was away on a one year long sabbatical from her job as a biology teacher at the local high school so he once again had the whole house to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James got into the driver\u2019s seat of the car he sat in a slight defocus as he struggled to contain his mounting aloneness and despair, his wife having been gone for the better part of five months and there being no one else at the house that he could talk to. James started up the car and began to drive home his only plans being a bottle of beer and a lonely night of watching old reruns on TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce James got in the house having just parked the car in the garage and checked his empty answering machine he took off his shoes and wandered into the kitchen. As he rummaged around in the fridge he recalled how happy he had been when he and Helen had gotten married, and how he had been even happier when they spent three magical weeks in Italy together as their honeymoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames sighed as he stood up beer in hand and moved to his lay-Z-boy recliner and twisted the cap off, remembering all of the fights soon after the wedding: bills, payments, friends, but most of all children Helen would never stop about having children. Eventually it got to the point where he and Helen couldn\u2019t even share a bed together and he was out on the couch, as the tension mounted James turned to drinking to help and soon she was on his back about that as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the sabbatical came up Helen had jumped at the chance to get out of the house and away from him, her last words to him were at the airport when she turned to him at the gate and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pick me up here in a year\" and with that had turned and boarded the plane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first James had loved it: no more fights, no more arguing, no more children, no more shit! But soon the magic began to disappear as James realised that all he wanted to do was make up with Helen and have her back with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames caught up in the memories didn't realize that he had finished his beer, as he went to get another one from the fridge he realized that it was raining quite heavily out. When James sat back in his recliner again he just stared out the window watching the raindrops patter against the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was mesmerized by the show of water for some time until he saw a pair of car headlights stop in front of his house and he began to hear the crunch of footsteps. As he turned towards his door the doorbell rang and he rushed to get it tripping over his shoes in his haste. By the time he untangled himself from his shoes and got to the door the person had begun pounding on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a second\" James croaked as he staggered to the door and opened it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding outside soaking wet was a young woman in her mid twenties and there was something familiar about her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Lieutenant Anderson I didn't realize that this was your house\" the woman sputtered. \"I just came here because my car broke down and my phone fell in a puddle while I was trying to fix it\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to come in\" James questioned as he leaned against the door jamb looking up at the pouring rain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir, thank you sir\" the woman replied as she stumbled in to the house<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to have me at a disadvantage ma'am\" James replied in response to her 'sir' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry sir\" the woman replied looking slightly embarrassed \u201cI'm PFC Mennen\u201d     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait\" James replied \"Felicha right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That\u2019s right sir\" Felicha grinned \"the FNG of ECHO team\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames snorted with amusement FNG meant fucking new guy of in Felicha's case it meant fucking new girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mennen we are off duty drop the Sir\" James commanded as they walked up the stairs into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...James\" Felicha replied as she looked around the kitchen \"Uhh.. Where is your phone?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" James grunted <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To call the tow truck\" Felicha answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\" James replied \"It's hanging up on the other side of the wall\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" Felicha expressed as she made her way around the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames began to rummage around in the fridge as Felicha made her call. James grabbed what he was looking for, shut the door, and turned around <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felicha\" he called <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm\" she grunted as she leaned around the wall covering the receiver with one hand, James held the beer up. She mouthed yes as she leaned back around the corner and finished the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James sat back down in his recliner and began to drink his beer, Felicha passed his chair holding her hand out for the promised beer. Smiling he dropped the beer into her hand as she took up the couch opposite him and twisted her beer cap off as well taking a long drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" Felicha replied holding up her beer <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem\" James replied looking up at the rain pattering on the windows<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The towing company says they'll send up a rig first thing tomorrow, something about the roads being too muddy tonight\" Felicha said nervously \"So can I stay at your place tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" James replied \"You can use the guest bedroom\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok thanks\" Felicha responded with a smile, James just stared off into space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next twenty minutes James and Felicha talked on and off about a multitude of topics all related to ATHER. Finally James looked at the clock and saw that it was getting late, as he stood up to leave Felicha got up as well and walked up to him and kissed him square on the lips, James in sock for a moment just stared impassively at Felicha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Felicha began to stammer an apology but before she could say anything James kissed her back passionately. After that all James could remember was staggering towards the bedroom, laying in the bed that he hadn't lain in for so long and the patter of rain drops on the window as the night turned to day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames shook off the memory with a visible effort and began to descend the ladder that he knew would take him down to the drains, and Felicha.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wait it wasn't quite blob like, James did notice something on its sides, after close inspection he realized with a shock that they were human faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames backed behind the wall and pondered what to do, the only advantage he had was surprise as the creature had not heard his yells due to the fact that its screams were louder than his. However it was only a matter of time before the creature spotted him and ruined his element of surprise, as he turned back to look at the creature it screamed one of its powerful screams and James saw all of the human faces contort in agony. James wondered why the faces didn't scream but then it hit him, the creature used its victims vocal chords to mimic anyone's scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the creature screamed again James saw the metal hatch begin to buckle, James's mind raced <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That things screams are powerful enough to buckle metal\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis told James two things: one that he had to be careful in dealing with this thing, and two that he had to get the thing away from the hatch where he was sure Felicha was hiding. But first he should warn Felicha about what was happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felicha come in\" James whispered. As soon as he finished a scream came over the radio, the scream was so intense and so painful that James fell to the ground clutching his ears in agony and rolling around like a dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames could hear the beast coming up on him and he knew he had to move, so as painful as it was he removed his hands from his ears and feebly reached into one of his vest pockets for the set of heavy duty earplugs he carried and shoved them in his ears. The feeling of relief was immediate as was the ability to think clearly, James immediately scrambled to his feet picked up his radio by this time the beast was nearly upon him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As James ran down the drains the thing hot on his tail he was glad that he had put in his earplugs as the thing kept screaming away and even with the earplugs it hurt but at least it no longer paralyzed him. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nJames turned a corner not even sure of where he was going until he saw a small circle of light off in the distance and knew that the pipe lead to the outside world. James almost slipped while he was running due to the fact that there was actually a current leading out to the opening, James grinned as he realized that he could use this to his advantage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ran James searched desperately along the walls for the one thing that he needed to make this plan work and at the last second found it, a metal grab bar right at the lip of the tunnel. James ran for the bar at full tilt as the monster followed him, then at the last second James grabbed the bar and swung out onto a lip of concrete no bigger than his foot. As he looked down he discovered that he was at least a hundred feet off the water of the local lake that all of the cult's drain water flowed into. James had no more than a second to brace himself before the beast came sliding out at full speed with no way to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the beast fell it screamed which almost caused James to lose his grip, hanging on by sheer power of will. It seemed to take an eternity for the monster to hit the water but when it did James was rewarded by a huge splash. Just as he was about to swing back into the drain he noticed that instead of floating the creature was dissolving in the water. Dismissing it as just a weird anomaly he climbed back into the drain pipe and collapsed on the floor and just lay there breathing heavily for the next five minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was ready to go he stood up and began to slowly make his way back to where he had seen the hatch. As he walked he noticed that there was a stairway on his right that led back up in to the complex into an important looking room.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In hand signals he told Ramirez to lay down suppression fire on the beast with his SAW, then he told Walters to chuck grenades at the thing until it died or until he ran out of grenades, and lastly he told them to wait for his go order to attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he took out a block of his C4 and slid it into the center of the hall, just in case and if they didn't need it he could always slip out the arming pin and use it again later. Finally everything was ready, the trap was set. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanderson waited a second then gave the go signal. Instantly Ramirez rose to a crouch and began to fire his SAW in short controlled bursts, while Walters stood up behind him and began to throw grenades at the beast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast never had a chance, with any lighter of a weapon it would have shrugged it off but the sheer volume and power of the SAW's 5.56X45mm rounds tore through its body and ravaged it, then the first grenade landed and blew chunks of the thing sky high. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three battle weary troopers stepped out from behind their respective covers each of their reactions told a little bit about the man underneath: Sanderson mopped his forehead with his sleeve and smiled at the fact that the men were safe, Ramirez slung his SAW over his shoulder and smiled at the chunks of still steaming meat over the floor, and Walters fell against the nearest wall and slid down it. <br>\r\nSanderson turned to Ramirez and clasped his hand and shook it, and then together they moved to Walters each taking one of his hands and pulling him up<br>\r\n\u201cCome on soldier\u201d Sanderson growled \u201cWe\u2019re not out of this yet\u201d <br>\r\nAs they moved away from the battle zone Ramirez slapped a fresh magazine into his SAW and Walters slipped his remaining grenades back into his belt pouches. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just as Sanderson was about to turn off his radio when he heard a faint echo of a voice and it sounded female. Curious he flicked the selector knob on his radio until he could hear the voice clearly, as he got to the right channel the voice spoke again leaving no doubt in Sanderson's mind that not only was the voice female, but that she was in trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Private first class Felicha Mennen\" She whispered \"if anybody can hear this I need immediate assistance\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanderson started before she could speak again \"This is Lance corporal Todd Sanderson acting commander ATHER team DELTA code in Private\" Sanderson didn't know this PFC Mennen but that wasn't unusual as the individual teams usually kept to themselves but if she passed the code in then he could trust her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Echo, Mike, Foxtrot, 0287569\" Felicha replied breathlessly <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanderson paused for a second as he recalled the code in passwords that he had been made to memorize for the mission, her's checked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK Mennen I'm listening, what is it you need\" Sanderson stated <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I need is help Corporal, I was trapped in a room but I blasted my way out of it and now I'm on the run because something is chasing me, I'm holed up now but it\u2019s only a matter of time before whatever\u2019s out there catches up to me\" Felicha hissed at him  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Ok, ok just calm down\" Sanderson soothed \"just hang in there long enough for us to get to the surveillance room and then we'll come get you\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, thank you I'll try to hang in as long as I possibly can\" Felicha replied getting some of her wind back in the process<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good we'll be there in a bit\" Sanderson replied \"Oh and one more thing\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Felicha answered <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn on your locator beacon\" Sanderson ordered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done\" Felicha replied then the channel went dead<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ramirez?\" Sanderson questioned as he looked over his shoulder <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got her\" Ramirez replied <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK good let\u2019s keep moving on\" Sanderson ordered \"the surveillance room should be just up ahead\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait\" Walters interjected \"why aren\u2019t we going to rescue her first?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok kid first off: don't question orders, second I don't know what movie you think is but we are going to need up to the minute intelligence, and third having someone in the surveillance room will be very useful to us anyway.\" Sanderson replied with quiet resolution in his voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So wait, who stays in the surveillance room then?\" Walters questioned <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\" Sanderson and Ramirez replied in unison, Sanderson with steel in his voice and Ramirez with amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me!\" Walters complained <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you have the least combat experience so you'll just slow us down, you'll be monitoring the cameras to give us up to date information, and you\u2019re starting to annoy me so I'd like to spend some time away from you\" Sanderson bit out \"Happy now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalters took the hint and shut up, just when they were a few feet from the surveillance room an overhead pipe came loose from its mountings and struck Ramirez square across the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst part wasn't the pipe striking it was the little spiders from hell that came pouring out from it, Walters was in the fray instantly: pushing, punching, and shooting the spiders away from Ramirez\u2019s prone form. Sanderson rushed up to Walters <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get him inside the room I'll hold these fuckers off!\" Sanderson shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWordlessly Walters slung his SPAS and began to drag Ramirez across the floor to the open door, Sanderson fired and fired, pouring mag after mag into the little bastards but more  just kept coming. Finally after what seemed like an eternity Walters hollered  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanderson fired one last burst, then turned sprinted for the door and dived in at the last second having Walters slam it and lock it behind him. Both men sat panting and gasping for breath for a long while. Once they felt physically up to it they dragged Ramirez\u2019s unconscious form into the room, which Sanderson found out served as a backup command room and shelter for the compound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving wrapped Ramirez up in blankets and given him a bit of food and water from the emergency supplies Sanderson moved to leave the room to get Felicha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me\" Walters called \"am I coming with you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanderson thought about it: on the one hand it would be nice to have backup, but on the other he did need someone to watch over Ramirez, feed him info, and wait for Sergeant Anderson in case he did show up.     <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was then that James realized that he was being dragged along by two other men. He tried to stagger to his feet but was rewarded for his trouble with a rifle butt to his midsection, he wheezed in pain as the wind was knocked out of him and the guards resumed dragging him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the unlikely trio rounded the bend James noticed a large blast door similar to others he had seen about the compound except that it was more ornately decorated and guarded by a pair of guards who snapped to attention as the trio approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prisoner to see the Colonel\" The guard who had drove the butt of his rifle into James's midsection stated in a stiff voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard on the right side of the door nodded and moved to slide a key card into a card reader while the guard on the left continued to stand at attention. The right side guard finished sliding the card through and resumed his stance as the massive door began to split apart and slide back into the walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames and as he called his two guards in his head Mutt and Jeff moved through the now expansive opening and into a bright well light room. James grunted in pain as his eyes had become accustomed to nothing more than dim emergency lighting, the glare was blinding so he shut his eyes with a watery wince. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff who had just about burst his insides apart with the butt of his rifle laughed at his discomfort. Mutt who had not uttered a word for the duration of the trip continued to say nothing and simply stared ahead at what James's adjusted eyes could now make out as a military checkpoint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff looked up and hastily snapped to attention and saluted at someone outside of James's view. The way Jeff saluted with his hand touching his forehead kicked up a red flag in James's mind, only Americans saluted that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this crucial bit of information fresh in his mind he looked upon the checkpoint with a fresh set of eyes: the guard's weapons were M4's and M16's the type of guns used by American forces, the camouflage was ACU the type used by American forces, and while there was no unit patches or rank badges he could still see the Velcro patches of where they used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this added up to one thing in James's mind he was being detained by American soldiers, his own side!    <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sitting opposite of him were: Lieutenant Richards head of the army contingent that had been called up and Director Ed Tillmen of the CDC who had been ordered personally by the present to make sure that the site remained quarantined.

On the ground Alpha fanned out into a loose five man semicircle behind Bravo while Bravo formed into a five man point with the plasma cannon on point, once Bravo got close enough to the creature the two men on the inside began to fire their Beowulf fifty cals at the thing, they took large chunks out of the thing but it still kept coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it came closer still the men on the outside began to chuck frag grenades at it, they exploded showering the freak with shrapnel but still came closer, finally when it was almost in tentacle range the plasma cannon opened up with a single shot but that single shot was more than enough as it punched into the things body and exploded showering the troops with blood and gore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squad leader shouldered his Beowulf and put his hand to the side of his helmet, Higgins earpiece beeped, he was completely silent for five minutes then he nodded and replied \"Acknowledged\" He then turned to Harkin \"Sir Bravo lead reports hostile neutralization and successful field test of the plasma cannon sir\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, send him my compliments, maybe now we can finally land\" Harkin replied in a sardonic voice<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The soldiers were about to hit a T-intersection, the third before their first objective when they began to hear a bizarre sound almost like ripping. At this the commandos settled into optimum firing positions and waited to see what came around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman in her early twenties staggered around the corner, lab coat grimy and tattered, her eyes dead and lifeless, but yet not a single scratch on her body as she continued to grope her way towards the power armoured titans. Then all at once ten Beowulfs opened up on her and the man who had appeared behind her, both were cut down without mercy. As the soldiers continued to hold their aim at the inert facedown forms one of the Privates went over to them to perform a death check, as he nudged the woman with his boot her spine suddenly burst through the skin of her back, wrapped around the unfortunate soldier and began to squeeze as hard as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor Alpha trooper never stood a chance; even his power armour which was supposed to keep out any kind of weapons fire simply crumpled at the waist and in effect turned him into a human hour glass. By this point all of the soldiers emptied their magazines into the spine literally sawing it in half, their comrade was spurting up so much blood that his time was measured in seconds rather then minutes, being his duty as team sergeant Silis crouched beside the dying man and asked if there was anything he wanted to say to his family the soldier responded with \"Tell my daughter I love her\" before slumping over and dying. Silis crouched motionless over the equally motionless corpse for what seemed like an eternity before leaning forward, grabbing his dog tags, and then standing back up. He nodded to Vadock and simply said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let\u2019s do this\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVadock nodded in kind and together the two teams along with their CDC specialists fought and sprinted until they made it to the failsafe room. As soon as the last hostile was purged from the room the two CDC specs went immediately to their work, in the meantime Alpha and Bravo were both listening to their mikes when suddenly an emergency signal came over the COM<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is army unit two Charlie we can't hold the lift be advised we can't... ahh, ahh get the fuck away-!\" and the com shattered into static. Both of the sergeants exchanged a look of worry but at the same time knew that the mission had to come first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked over to the specs one of them called out \"Sergeant Silis we are ready to innate detonation sequence, how much time do you want on the clock?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a half hour\" Silis replied <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir a half hour\" the spec spoke up as he entered the sequence, once he was finished the red emergency lights began to flash and a large klaxon announced <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Warning thirty minutes to detonation, thirty minutes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work you two\" Silis complimented as he turned to meet Vadock's eye <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes good work indeed\" Vadock concurred \"but now it's our time to get to work\" Vadock spoke as he fed a fresh clip of ammunition into his rifle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck with the Book\" Silis called out as he readied his team for battle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and I wish for you to have good luck in dealing with base security\" Vadock returned in kind   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe it was because they were lead by the captain and his L.T.?

Walters had only been with ATHER for a few weeks and this was his first combat assignment but he found that a bit odd, or maybe it wasn't? he didn't know, he had never seen ALPHA before, he mostly just stayed with the DELTAs as everyone else did with their respective squads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalters looked back the way they came to make sure they weren't being followed by anything, all he saw were PFC.

James rushed out just in time to see Jeff take a .50 cal slug in the chest as the black armoured monstrosity that shot him moved through the wreckage of the front blast door, James let the commando have it with a full burst from his CAR but the titan simply shrugged it off and returned fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames hit the floor as .50 cal slugs boomed over his head and took huge chunks out of the back wall. James staggered to his feet and ran back to the hall while gunfire raged all around him, once he got to cover he ran to Colonel Baird's office while the base security held off the approaching soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames all but collapsed once he made it into the Colonel's office, the only thing that stopped him was the Colonel grabbing him by the arm and moving him to the far side of the office<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ok son?\" Baird asked as he aimed his sidearm at the door<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am for now sir but soon we will all be dead so it doesn't matter\" James replied despondently <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not all of us will die\" Baird encouraged <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" James asked with suspicion <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaird opened what James thought was just another section of wall that led into an escape tunnel \"You can escape\" Baird said quietly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you sir?\" James asked even though he already knew the answer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone needs to stay behind to seal the hatch and hold them off Sergeant\" Baird spoke indicating himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hadn\u2019t thought of that sir\" James as he stared at the ground, suddenly he came to attention and snapped off a crisp salute \"It was an honour to serve under you sir\" he spoke, his voice tight as he moved to the hatch, he was in the tunnel when he heard Baird\u2019s voice <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and James\" Baird spoke using James's first name \"it was my honour to serve with you\" once he finished he shut and locked the hatch. James shut his eyes and sighed as he knew he would not see Baird alive again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames crawled to the end of the tunnel where there was a ladder that took him to the lower levels; as he mounted the ladder and stared at the hatch he heard a single gunshot, James shook his head and started down the ladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James came to the last fifty or so rungs from the ground he decided to slide down; as he built up speed he began to hear noises down below, unable to stop James\u2019s boots slammed into the ground as he spun bringing up his sidearm in his right hand and his light in his left, only to be met with a similar harsh light as his own. Just as James was about to order the unknown to lower their light a surprised gasp uttered from the other side of the light and it immediately snapped off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James is that really you?\" An all too familiar voice whispered <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure is, Felicha\" James confirmed as he snapped off his own light<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore James knew it Felicha ran up to him, buried her head in his chest, and began to sob. Her sobs were so gut wrenching that James found himself thinking back to the last time he had heard her sob like that, it had been years ago during the worst day of his life and the lowest point of his military career.<br>\r\n\u201cLieutenant Anderson you have been charged with: one count of inappropriate fraternization, two counts of dereliction of duty, one count of insubordination, and a count of assaulting a fellow serviceman\u201d Captain Salen addressed, \u201cIs that correct?\u201d Salen asked as he was met with silence <br>\r\n\u201cYes Sir!\u201d Anderson replied stiff and formal<br>\r\n\u201cDo you wish to protest any of these charges?\u201d Salen asked<br>\r\nAnderson hung his head in shame and mumbled out \u201cNo sir\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cVery well then, it is my decision that Lieutenant Anderson will suffer a reduction in rank from lieutenant to sergeant, will spend five days in the stockade and will be hereby ordered to stay at least 100 meters away from Private first class Felicha Mennen at all times\u201d Anderson continued to hang his head in shame while Salen addressed Felicha \u201cMennen you are hereby ordered to stay at least 100 meters away from Sergeant Anderson at all times, that is all\u201d Salen concluded as he snapped his portfolio shut and motioned for the Military Police. <br>\r\nTwo of them stepped forward to escort Anderson to the stockade, as they gripped his arms he shrugged them off and moved to the door on his own effort, at the same time an MP was escorting Mennen to a side door Mennen\u2019s eyes looked up just in time to meet Anderson\u2019s pain wracked eyes. That was all it took for Mennen to break down into sobs, seconds later the door shut and mercifully cut off her sobs. <br>\r\nAs James stood in the hallway of that god forsaken compound and comforted Felicha he made to wonderful discoveries; the first was that he had found his love again, and the second was that he rediscovered his certainty and self confidence, and with those he could survive anything including the horrors of hell itself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Acting fast James drew his knife and cut through the restraints and stood up, a wave of pain shot up his right leg but James suppressed the pain and moved towards Felicha, as he moved he noticed that some of the displays on the console were sparking causing James to work even faster as he did not want to be anywhere near the explosion that would be generated by a tank of Jet fuel and sparks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fast as he could James slashed Felicha\u2019s restraints and carefully lifted up the damaged console long enough for him to roll her out from underneath it, once she was laid out on the floor James stowed his knife and picked her up in a fireman\u2019s carry. Just as James started to haul ass out of there he heard the shouts of searchers responding to the crash scene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving no time to argue with what James was sure was a squad of soldiers he simply exited the chopper on the opposite side of the shouts and made his way down the steep hill that was just in front of the tree that the chopper had crashed into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce James made it to the bottom of the hill he did not stop, instead he kept moving trying to get as far away from the coming explosion, just as James heard a shout of surprise from the top of the hill a massive explosion ripped through the air as the helicopter exploded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames took one look back at the flaming wreckage before moving o, not wanting to get caught by the approaching authorities or a forest fire, although James was pretty sure that a forest fire would not erupt seeing as how the sirens were so close they were deafening, James turned his head back to the woods and within five minutes had disappeared into the forest.             <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

James familiar with the basic laws of convection began to snicker as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Felicha asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you see\u201d Sam answered, James being indisposed \u201cwhen you put electricity and water together the water convects the electricity, now imagine all the salts and what not and-\u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI get it now\u201d Felicha cut him off not wanting to hear more, \u201creal mature guys\u201d she chastised <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs immature as I may be my point still stands,\u201d Sam reminded her \u201cwhich brings us back to square one, how do we get in?\u201d Sam asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Sam finished his sentence James looked up as a realization dawned on him \u201cHey guys, why hasn\u2019t the self destruct in the compound gone off yet?\u201d he asked, both Felicha and Sam looked at James like he was nuts <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would that be a good thing James?\u201d Felicha demanded <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it would be one hell of a distraction for one thing\u201d James responded \u201cand for another the resulting electromagnetic pulse would be a welcome advantage\u201d he finished. What James did not know was at that very moment the survivors of the USOWB Bravo team were desperately trying to hold off the demons and rearm the self destruct in the compound, right as he finished his sentence they succeeded and five seconds after he said advantage the compound exploded.              <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Suddenly something smashed against the door hard enough to give the metal a groan and to throw James away for a few feet.  Visibly shaken he climbed to his feet, staring at the darkened sillouette of the door.  The lights in the room were dimmer than those that had been outside, but James saw a small window towards the top of the door.  He flicked on his flashlight attachment at the end of the CAR and searched around the space, looking for something to stand on.  He spotted a small wooden crate in one corner and grabbed it.  He tested the box with partial weight first, making sure that the would wouldn't just splinter and send him crashing to the floor, it held.  James pulled himself up slowly and peered through into the corridor, it was eerily quiet out there and that made James uneasy.  He squinted through the haze of red light and saw nothing, just empty corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the fuck did that thing get off to?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames took a deep breath, he climbed down shakily off the crate.

The room was small, and more importantly the room was empty except for the crate and a lonely crowbar leaning in the corner.

James mind began to swirl as he remembered the front gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------<b r></b>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on soldier shift it!\" Sergeant Anderson hissed as he watched the last of his ten operative team settle into position, he brought his wrist mounted PDA up to face and pressed the back light button. As the display shone a grainy green Anderson concentrated on the last few dots settling into position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on INDIA move it up double time\" the Sergeant whispered into the boom mike attached to his radio \"FOXTROT get your asses in gear\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the acknowledgments came flooding in Anderson resumed his focus on the compound's front gate, As overall ATHER field commander Sergeant Anderson had  a hand in formulating the battle plan that they were setting up for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plan called for team FOXTROT to take out the watchtower guards from long range as half of their operatives were snipers, once FOXTROT had taken out the tower guards teams INDIA and ECHO would blow open the gate with preplaced charges storm the two security posts on the top as well as the admin and elevator to the lower levels. Once stage one was complete then the remaining teams behind them would use the elevator to get into the main complex while the teams above ground would provide comm. updates, vital supplies, extra manpower, and a secure base of operations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a risky plan but hopefully the attack would be so fast and decisive that the defenders would never know what hit them. Finally the status reports of the fourteen teams under his command started to flow in<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Team ALPHA reporting in Sir\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Team GAMMA reporting in Sir\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Team SIERRA reporting in Sir\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a couple of minutes for the reports to finish up so Sergeant Anderson mused about the mission, the fact that the Cultist's compound was so big, underground and defended like a military base greatly disturbed Anderson. The other thing that disturbed him was the fact that Command had given him one hundred and forty operatives at his disposal, never before in his ten years of working with ATHER had he ever seen such a massive deployment of troops and equipment. Not that that mattered the Sergeant thought as he resolutely pushed the thoughts from his mind, he was a soldier his job was to carry out orders not to question them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last of the acknowledgments came through he turned to Louis <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Team ECHO reporting in sir\" Louis spoke with a tight wolfish smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then\" he muttered as he switched over to general frequency \"All teams mission countdown: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------<b r></b>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Five, four, three, two, one\" James thought to himself as he tensed then climbed down the now open manhole, crowbar in hand. As he reached the last few rungs on the ladder he simply let go, fell the last few feet and absorbed the shock of the impact with his knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stood he tried his GPS but all he got was a NO SIGNAL message<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there's a surprise\" James muttered bitterly as he tried to get a fix on his position via dead reckoning. After a while James decided that it had to be to the right of the ladder, James had turned to leave and had gotten a few feet when he heard a deafening screech behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames whipped around already bringing his CAR 15 up at what he assumed was a threat, when he did get turned around all he could see was darkness. James was about to dismiss it as nothing when he saw to pinpricks of light in the tunnel, then four, then six, then eight, and before he knew it there were dozens of pinpricks in the tunnel with James. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was still puzzling over what to make of the lights when one of them disappeared and the reappeared, that\u2019s when James realized with horror that they were not lights but eyes!    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While this was happening FOXTROT'S snipers were shredding the tower guards with their .50 caliber sniper rifles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmidst the chaos Anderson made rapid fire hand signals to SIERRA'S team Sergeant, Duburt was his name.

As he came to a T intersection he noticed a complete lack of noise <i>\"The calm before the storm\" </i> James thought grimly to himself as he raised his CAR, seconds later the creatures attacked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked vaugely human however their eyesockets were empty black pits their eyes having been burned out by the extreme red light that seemed to emanate from within them, their guts were split open as well revealing intestines that through some sort of dark transformation had now become barbed whiplike tentacles almost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first it wasn't so bad they would round a corner and the CAR would take their head clean off, but soon they were flooding around both corners at the same time, James fell back knowing that he could not hold his position. Just as James was about to make a fighting retreat his bolt clacked open, James checked his vest and swore in frustration seeing that he had no more magazines, James ditched his rifle and started to make a mad dash out of there with those things hot on his heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames zigged and zagged he turned left and right but nothing he did could shake those things, finally as he rounded the bend he saw his salvation a vent that was built into the wall but right on the floor.

Just as he was about to start his mad crawl towards freedom he came up short as he felt a hand lock onto his ankle with an iron grip, not having time to argue he once again pulled out his trusty .45 and emptied the other half of his mag into the creature. Not having time to admire his handiwork and caring only about the fact that the grip on his ankle disappeared he turned back around and began to madly crawl down the vent, however after about two minutes of crawling James hit a section of vent that was weaker and collapsed under his weight. As James hit the floor he lost consciousness and was engulfed in darkness. </span></div></div>",

When the brightness returned to normal he found himself sitting alone onthe cold floor with his gun laying nearby. He wiped the sweat from his brow and left the room wondering why the monster child had left. \"It had me at its mercy... and let me go... no, it willingly retreated for some reason, but why...?\" He began moving further down the hallway and soon came to a heavily damaged set of stairs. They looked rickety and ill-attached, but there was no way he would risk his neck on the elevator. Sure enough, on his third step the thing began trembling and he was forced to run the rest of the way down, jumping onto the floor just as the stairway collapsed into a pile of metal. James picked himself up and looked at the tangled mess. \"Looks like I'm not getting back up anytime soon, guess its a good thing I'm headed further down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames looked down the hallway ahead of him to get a good view of his surrounds before moving on. There was a faint siren sounding off in the distance along with what sounded like footsteps.

Further up ahead to the left was another hallway that probably led to an elevator or possibly a restroom. In any case, it was far too small to be very long or lead anywhere important. \"Shit, it looks even worse down here then the last level... I'd better get moving...\" With new resolve James began confidently moving down the hallway, only to stop when he heard someone scream.

Colin clutched him, terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 figures emerged in the bright light of the doorway. They were clearly human, but that was about the only reassuring attribute about them. They were all clad in black leather; all looked unfriendly and intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond, bearded giant in front was the most fearsome. He had a disforming scar running the length of the left side of his face. An eyepatch shielded the left eye. Most notable about the gargantuan man, was that his entire right lower-arm had been converted into a compact 3-barreled minigun; the ammunition belt that fed it, snaked across his right shoulder and appeared to emerge from the  metallic backpack the large man wore. He looked the absolute wrong bloke to screw with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 2 individuals flanking his sides, didn't appear any less menacing. A woman stood on the giant's right. Her short black hair in a spiky buzz-cut; she had gruesome tattoo's of bats, dragons and scorpions covering her open arms and shoulders. She carried a katana in one hand and a sub-machine gun in the other.<br>\r\nThe last man, standing on the blond giant's left, was perhaps the most frightening. He was an albino. He was clad completely, from neck down to his toes and fingers, in dark leather. He looked as if he wore the uniform of a colonel spray-painted black. An ink-black cap was pulled low over his red-pink eyes. His snow white hair and translucent skin was accented by the rest of his body being covered in such dark attire, making his face appear similar to that of a ghost. He held his arms crossed behind his back, like a bored officer inspecting his troops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn evil grin spread across the blond giant's face as he saw James and Cory: \"Oh look! More undead targets.\"<br>\r\nHe raised his minigun right arm, his left going to the firing lever attached to its upper side...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Lenggries.\" said the woman. \"The man is still human! Don't kill him!\"<br>\r\n\"The thing he's holding sure isn't, Petrova.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you people?!\" asked James, finding his voice at this trio of weirdo's. He presumed them mercenaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir!\" said the woman named Pretrova urgently at James. \"Let go of that child, NOW! It's undead, It'll kill you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColin looked at James pleadingly with his sunken eyes: \"You promised you wouldn't leave me!!!\"<br>\r\n\"I won't.\" James unholstered his .45 colt and aimed it at the giant named Lenggries. \"Why don't you put away the gun, friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it pal, if you don't put away that little peashooter of yours, I'll shred you in half with led!\" warned Lenggries darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do the same once you lower YOUR firearm, friend.\" said James menacingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not while that scrap of wormfood in your hands remains in one piece, I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not letting go of this kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You either let go of the freak or I gun you both down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames turned to his side, shielding the zombie todler with his body, from the minigun's line of fire.<br>\r\n\"You just try and I'll slug your remaining eye.\" said the outraged James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please sir.\" begged the woman, desperate to avoid a bloodbath. \"That child is no longer human. You have to let it go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over my dead body.\" Colin looked up gratefully at James, who held him close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your wish.\" said the giant callously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames sweated profusely. A bloody shootout seemed inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the albino. His sharp voice cut through the air like a knife through a cake. His voice held such a commanding tone, that none dared disobey him. \"You will all stand down! Lower your weapons this instant!\"<br>\r\nBoth James and Lenggries complied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe albino looked at the blond giant with disdain: \"Lenggries, have you succumbed to the level of depravity of the hellspawn? You would kill your fellow man so easily?\"<br>\r\nThe giant spat back: \"I was only bluffing! I just wanted that retard to let go of the undead. Our mission was supposed to ensure that no demon or infected was to escape to the surface, no matter the cost. Wasn't it? To exterminate all the hellspawn down here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You.\" the albino indicated to James. \"Please identify yourself.\" The way he said it, made it clear it wasn't a request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Sergeant James Anderson, leader of Echo team. I am part of ATHER, a counter-terrorist unit. I was sent here to stop a cultist terrorist group from-\"<br>\r\n\"Well your a bit late on that one.\" said the albino.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"The cultists are all dead, least from what I could tell from the screams...and so is just about everything...humanoid...down here. Still, its refreshing to at least meet another survivor from ATHER in this literal hellhole. One that isn't undead, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're ATHER personal?\" asked the surprised James.<br>\r\n\"Indeed. We are Omega team...or rather its remainder. I'm Leutenant Blank. The charming fellow over there with the personality disorder is Corporal Lenggries-\"<br>\r\n\"Up yours.\" said the giant blond, flipping them off.<br>\r\n\"-and the Lady is Corporal Petrova.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetrova anxiously nodded her head in James's direction, as if to indicate something deathly important.<br>\r\n\"Ah, Sergeant. Pardon for my rudeness, but...I strongly, STRONGLY advise you letting go of that child immediately. It is undead.\"<br>\r\n\"I already told you, I am not letting go of the kid.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know what...personal attachments you have with him...\" said the albino.<br>\r\n\"IT! It's a bloody rotting corpse!\" shouted Lenngries from the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe albino ignored him, and continued to talk persuasively to James. \"But he's no longer alive. He has no emotion, no recollection. Very soon he will turn feral and most likely attack you. You will probably be bitten, and infected. And then we will be forced to kill you. For no infection may reach the surface. He is no longer human. Let him go now so we can mercy kill him, and let him rest in peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames looked down at the pitiful mass of the child he he held in his arm. Colin stared back, petrified. Blank's words sounded convincing. Colin certainly didn't appear to be alive. He stank of decaying meat. His skin looked grey and green in some places. His face was stretched tightly across his bony skull. James could even feel the wet mucus running down his side from the kid. Worst of all he felt cold and clammy. Just like a corpse. No heat emanated from Colin's tiny body. It was evident he was dead, if not undead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet...Colin seemed genuinely scared. Tears ran down his face at the prospect of being given up by James. He looked very lifelike; not like a wild beast at all. No. James would never abandon a child in need, even at the risk of his own life. Even if that child was supposedly undead. And he had promised to keep Colin safe, hadn't he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only they kept coming. \"Damn it!\" angry, he screamed. \"You have to rip them completely apart to kill these fucking things!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Their heads!\" frantic, Cory yelled. \"Hit their heads!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLenggries grunted and moved his aim at the zombies heads then grinned darkly as they fell like flies. \"Die, bastards!\" after loading another chain of ammunition, he yelled. \"Back to hell with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all was quiet again, Petrova ran back and pushed the door closed before sealing it. \"If the kid had not, err, felt them coming, we would not have had a chance.\" glancing at Cory, she said. \"Thanks, kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small grin formed onto Cory's burned face. \"I'm not dead yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon looking at Cory again, James saw that he was not decaying but burned, as he had said. Only his unnatural cold body made him worry. <i>\"He's not dead yet.\"</i> he thought. <i>\"Let's hope it stays that way.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are welcome to join our team, the kid too.\" serious, Blank said. \"Just bear in mind.

The mission at hand: the closing of the Hell-Gate.\" Blank said this as if he was done discussing a particularly boring subject and had more pressing concerns on his table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we....met -\" he indicated with his head to James and the lithe form of Cory clinging to his side. \"-  Me and the rest of Omega-team were heading out to the Security-Console in room 34B. It houses the Camera room.\" Blank pointed to the flickering lights above them. \"If would appear there is still electricity in this facility, which means the computers and mechanized equipment may still be functioning down here. If we can find the central Security-Consoles, we may be able to view the video feed from the cameras all over this facility and get a clear idea of what just the hell happened. And that wasn't an intended pun.\" he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames smiled at the joke: \"Do you know where this Camera-room is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" he dug a tiny device from his back-pocket and held it out to James. It looked nothing more than a wide-screen cellphone. \"A PDA. Please keep this in your possession at all times. It functions as a walky-talky, a tracking device and holds a GPS along with the schematics and blueprints of this facility. Please use this to not get lost or to finish this mission if the rest of us all die.\" What a ray of sunshine you are Blank, thought James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I'm not grateful.\" said James taking the PDA. \"But you're rather quick to trust me.\"<br>\r\n\"You are the first humanoid.....being besides myself and the survivors of Omega-team whom hasn't tried to taste my face in 4 hours. <br>\r\nThat makes you a very trustworthy person. That and I'm obviously short of personnel. I rather need some...human allies at this moment.\" he indicated the 2 figures of Lenngries and Petrova whom were standing besides him silently and respectfully. James knew that each ATHER team consisted of 15 members, which meant they had taken some extremely heavy losses to have been reduced to just 3 people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlank nodded his head to James's side, his red-pink eyes hovering over Cory from beneath his black cap.<br>\r\n\"I only ask that you keep ensuring that...the child remains...trustworthy as well.\" Blank seemed to have this thing for pausing before a word as if to overstate its intended euphemism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before James could answer, Blank interrupted and continued as if he had expected an angry retort.<br>\r\n\"So. The plan of action is rather basic. We get our over to the Security-Console and camera room. There we will probably find recordings of the events that have taken place since the breech. Best never to go into deep action without being prepared. And even if we don't find any tapes, we may find live camera feed about this facility and be able to determine where precisely the Gate is. Also there is a microphone located there in which we might be able to communicate to any other remaining survivors. And even if we don't find any of the above-\" Blank looked at his own personal PDA attached to his belt. \"The Camera-room is North-North-East from here; we'll only be getting closer to the gate which is directly North from where we are currently standing. We'll figure out the rest as get there, assuming we don't all perish.<br>\r\nIf you have any objections or any better ideas, please voice them Sergeant.\"<br>\r\nThe way Blank said it, made it clear James should rather keep his mouth shut as he couldn't possibly think of anything more clever than mentioned by the albino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None. That sounds fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Now that were all good comrades-\" in ironic contrast to this, Lenggries just scowled at both Cory and James, making it brutally obvious that he neither liked nor trusted them. Petrova at least seemed to have admiration for them both. <br>\r\n\" -lets get moving. Petrova?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, there's a back door here. I say it best to avoid the main hall.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course. Please open it, Petrova.\" Petrova used her sharp slender katana as a crowbar and undid the locking mechanism of the wooden door with a single well-placed twist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Splendid.\" said the albino. \"Let's not dawdle. We're already behind schedule. The less we remain idle, the less we attract.....undesirables.\" Yep, Blank had a thing for Euphemisms, thought James. \"Lenggries, please take point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiss my ass! I'm not walking anywhere where I can't see the lump of wormfood right in front of me.\" said the blond, bearded cyclops gruffly, pointing to Cory. <br>\r\n\"Stop calling me names!\" retorted Cory. James suspected Lenggries was never an easy man to work with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh the delights of working with the immature.\" said Blank shaking his head in his black-gloved fingers. \"Fine then. You take the rear-guard. Petrova will take the front-guard. I will cover our 9, James our 3. And Lenngries...don't let any undead kiss your ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" But Lenngries complied, smiling crookedly. Blank was the only commander he had ever respected; he had a smart mouth on him at the very least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get going. Let us show these hell-spawn that ATHER is not to be fucked with.\" James was surprised at hearing the neutral albino swear for the first time.<br>\r\nAnd so the party stepped through the wooden door and into the enveloping shadows and dangers that lay beyond...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were patiently waiting for their next meal to fall within their grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are they?\" stunned, James asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20091228113816/half-life/en/images/3/39/Barnacle_Ep2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More hell-spawn.\" aiming her sidearm, Petrova said. \"Only why are those brainless zombies weary of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer answer case as we all heard what sounded like a raspy laugh and turned to see one zombie had come from a door and was caught by one of the creatures. The poor creature struggled, almost as if it were still human while other tongues lashed out and grabbed onto the pray. To our horror, the zombie was torn asunder with its putrid blood being spilled all over the walls and floor before the tongues came down, liking the blood clean with ravenous vigor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disgusting vermin!\" spatting, Lenngries yelled. he raised his mini gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" quietly, Cory warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo late, the loud noise caused all the tongues to reach down before a creature, inside the first to lower to the ground.

Once we were all through, James pushed the door closed and sealed it tight as the creatures hissed and shrieked in anger on the other side. \"Too close!\" breathing heavily, he said. \"What were those things!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are called 'gate keepers'.\" lighting a cigarette, Blank said. \"From what I understand from the briefing, they protect the gate from being reached.\" pausing, he added, \"Apparently this cult got past them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or they 'set up shop' after the gates were open.\" mussing, James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possible, we will have to keep our eyes open for them.\" nodding, Blank said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...

Low moaning, growling,  weezing and sounds of air escaping through damaged larynxes came from the shadows.<br>\r\nLike amphibians emerging from dark-murky water, 2 dozen zombies emerged from the darkness.<br>\r\nTheir pale-green rotting skin shone like sweat in the fluorescent light and maggots fell from their eye-sockets to be trampled by the hulking undead into squishy pulps...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were none of those giant-tongue creatures hanging from the ceiling in this room and the walking-corpses seemed to have no trouble or fear concerned with these humans.<br>\r\nSuddenly in contrast to their previous clumsy, slow shuffling walk, this group of zombies broke into a sprint and charged with surprising and inhuman speed and agility at the helpless from of Blank, whom had entered this room first and stood isolated far from the rest of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweating, James fumbled to get his CAR 15 unslung from his hips; he was stunned to see Petrova and Lenggries do nothing! They just stood contentedly, their weapons not even raised to save their commander from being overrun and mauled! James wanted to shout at them: what the hell was wrong with them, but their was no time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCory was sitting on James's back, having hitched a piggy-back ride and this prevented James from having being able to undo the CAR-15 from it sling; his hand went to his Colt .45, but it was too late: the undead swarm was upon Blank!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlank stepped forward and raised his right arm: a handgun seemingly had magically appeared in his hand; so fast and swift had he drawn it. It was a Glock 182 heavy-slug semi-automatic pistol. The glock series of handguns were notorious for having a deadly armor-piercing round and a rapid rate of fire, but they were mostly unpopular for their being extremely heavy as a sidearm. It was generally discouraged for weaker troops to wield them as they required both arms and a lot of stamina to even just hold them straight and stable for aiming. The fact that Blank held the Glock 182, stable, unwaivering and firm in just one arm clearly showed he had a great deal more strength than he let show in his skinny black-leather clad frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first zombie came within range and tried to make a grab for Blank; it earned him a hole in the forehead which sent it reeling backwards. And before the stunned eyes of James, Blank proceeded to dispatch the remaining undead with cold, murderous and unequaled efficiency. Not a single zombie came even close to laying a hand on him with their weathered bony fingers as Blank slugged them all one-by-one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike an elegant fencing champion, Blank stood firm, held one hand on his left hip and used only his right for killing; cigaretet still lodged in lips at an angle. He was so brutally efficient, that he never wasted or missed a single shot. In fact: not more that a single round was fired per zombie. Each fell in turn as a bullet from Blank's Glock pierced their necks precisely, as if by auto-guided fire. Blank displayed some supernatural marksmanship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs 18 corpses that would now remain corpses forever lay at Blank's feet, James now understood why Petrova and Lenggries had not intervened. They had been so confident at their commander's skill and competence, they hadn't even bothered to aid him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the following silence of gunfire, James noticed that the 'gate-keepers' had stopped laying siege to the metallic door the party had come in from, as there were no scratching or squealing from beyond anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was impressive, Luitenant. I thought you were done-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up and remain quiet, Sergeant!\" Blank seemed on edge as he alternatedly pointed his sidearm to the roof, the floor and the walls in the visible part of this room. James was surprised to see Blank looking afraid, as even with the hell-spawn zombie swarm that had nearly overwelmed him, he had kept an icy cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Child. Cory. You could sense all those undead and hell-spawn earlier. Can you sense something else in this room?\" asked Blank.<br>\r\n\"No-no sir. You killed all of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlank had a twisted-cynical smile on his face, but he looked deathly pale, if that was even possible on his translucent white skin.<br>\r\n\"Below us.\" he said, tensely. Petrova, Lenggries and James( now with his .45 Colt in hand) aimed their respective guns at the ground, but there was nothing but solid marble.<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Sir?\" asked Petrova like a concerned sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer answer came in the form of a rumbling below and a high-pitched howling like an eagle being skinned alive. The sound of pipes on metal and flapping wings hitting obstruction followed from below.<br>\r\n\"Quick.\" said Blank urgently. \"Find any ventilators or air-ducts and cover them!!!\" All complied, searching for any openings to the room, but there was none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rumbling an racket continued then stopped without warning. The silence once again hung like thick smog in the air. James could hear the blood pumping through both his ears as well as Petrova's standing a meter away from him. Cory's dead heart remained unmoving.<br>\r\n\"What is it?!\" he hissed at Blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLenggries spat against a warning poster that stated spitting was prohibited in this room: \"Well that was fucking anticlimactically undramatic-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girder in the corner on the floor of the room they had missed, shot into the ceiling with brick-breaking force followed by a hideous howling monstrosity. It had putrid yellow scaled skin and was humanoid in structure. But a pair of giant bat wings stretched from his back. Its hands and feet were webbed claws and its face was a gaping teethed maw with pitch-black orbs for eyes attached. It flapped in place menacingly.<br>\r\n\"SHCYFER AARON BLANK! YOU WILL NOT LIVE TO SEE THE LIGHT OF DAWN!\" It screamed in a scratchy ugly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gabzagul. Been a long time. How many times have I killed you already? 6?\" James was appalled by Blank's callous demeanor as he himself stared at this beast in petrified horror; Cory trembled on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU LAUGH AT YOUR OWN DEATH MORTAL! EVEN IF YOU REACH THE GATE, YOU WILL NOT EXIT IT!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm still not impressed. You're starting to run out of original threats old friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I WILL FEED ON YOUR HEARTS!!!\" the creature raged, filling the roam with fear.<br>\r\n\"Then come get them!\" cat-called Blank. \"We're not handing them over in platters!\"<br>\r\nThe creature seemed to need no invitation as it half-charged/half-glided across the room in a frenzy as fast as it's legs and wings could carry it in a bee-line to Blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeggries's concentrated barrage strafed its wake, but he stopped as he saw James and Petrova would be in his line of fire; the same scenario for them to Lenggries. That left Blank to fend for himself once more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike an agile matador avoiding a charging bull, Blank dodged the flying-beast in the last split-second by side-stepping and crouching. The creature turned, only to find the Glock 182 pointed into its open maw.<br>\r\n\"That makes number 7.\" said Blank to the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike with the swarm of zombies earlier, Blank made no attempt to fire his weapon efficiently. Like a street-ganster he passionately emptied his magazine into the face of the roaring demon, who clutched its facial wounds from which vile black blood squirted like sprinkler flows. The demon collapsed and Blank stood over it, still firing his side-arm even after it stopped twitching.<br>\r\nHe breathed heavily and sat down tiredly on the cold floor.<br>\r\nHis comrades rushed to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that thing?\" James asked breathlessly to Blank who shook his sweating head and stood back up.<br>\r\n\"Familliars. Not as deadly as Pit-lords. Still makes a mess to kill.\" he said this as if he was apologizing to his visiting guests for his pet having dirtied the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cigarette.\" said Petrova simply. Blank took out his and saw that a tiny speck of the Falliar's black blood had found its way on the burning tip.<br>\r\nBlank sighed and threw the cigarette stump into the widening pool of blood that was oozing from the dead Famillar demon.<br>\r\n\"Seems my private doctor is preventing my smoking from beyond the grave. Let that be a lesson for you Sergeant James. It's the corrupted blood of the hell-spawn which caused people contaminated with it to turn undead. Touching it won't matter, but don't let the black-blood touch YOUR blood. Don't swallow or breath it either. Of course I doubt you'd go around being stupid enough to taste the stuff...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I asked you a question: what was that thing?\" said James.<br>\r\n\"I thought I answered: It's a Familliar. A high-level winged imp.\" replied Blank<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First: I'm a bit new to the terminology and classification of hell-spawn. Second: that's not what I meant. That thing...that familliar knew your name and you its.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in order, my dear sergeant. First: you don't need to remember what they are called. Only that they are demons and therefore need to die. Second: that specific creature-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shaait! Hell's bells!!\" jubelated Lenggries after Petrova had turned on the remaining lights of the room from a switch-board on the opposite side. It appeared to be a highly secure storage room, but just no any kind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey commander, the God-of-War must be smiling on us today; guess where we currently are standing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An arsenal.\" said James.<br>\r\n\"Not just any arsenal, comrade...\" corrected Lenggries and laughed deeply and gruffly.</span></div></div>",

We just hit the motherload vain of guns!

The claw had 3 fingers, 2-hand fingers and an opposable thumb; not unlike a miniature forklift attached to the ball-bearing on the end of the iron cylinder that was now his lower arm instead of the minigun.<br>\r\nWith it, he lifted a magazine clip which also had orange warning tape wrapped around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-16 rounds! Wanno know what's special about them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They resemble your backside?\" queried Petrova.<br>\r\n\"Hike off! No, they're illegal. They are as against the Geneva-Convention as it gets! Anyone wants to tell me why?\"<br>\r\n\"They look just like any standard rounds to me, corporal.\" said James.<br>\r\n\"I'm not your corporal, pretty boy!\" said Lenggries while scratching the inside of his mutilated empty left eye-socket, the eye-patch moved on his forehead like a bandanna and the wounded scarred socket exposed, much to James's involuntary disgust. Cory looked away. \"Oh am I scaring you my little wormfood-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are the munitions-expert, corporal.\" interjected Blank diplomatically. \"Why don't you share with us your esteemed knowledge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLenggries gave another one of his crooked smiles; James suspected the disfigurement of the scar running down the left of his face, prevented the giant from smiling normally: \"Air-pocket bursting inverted shells. You know that panzerphausts in the second-world-war could penetrate the tough exteriors of American tanks easily, right? It was because some brilliant german scientist had the idea of deliberately leaving part of the rocket nose empty in the middle. So when the rocket nose tip hits the side of the armor, the force behind it caused it to make the nose invert inwards under itself from the pressure and literally create a rocket blast in from of it whenever it hits something. So basically, the panzerphaust was a spit-second mega-sized blow-torch at point blank range when it hits the armor of our Shermans; like a hot knife carving through butter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLenggries threw the M-16 clip from his mechanical claw and caught it with his good hand: \"These rounds are sorta similar. They burst the air when the make contact with their target; like making a miniature explosion. Normal 16 rounds are solid, they just go through meat. Not these little fine fuckers. They literally rip apart flesh from bone and make people into bursting meatball balloons. It's not pretty. Normal M-16 rounds wound people, these air-burst shells will make your lungs explode by just zooming past you as the atmosphere is literally sucked from your mouth and returned instantly with force in the displacement of the air-burst.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So just what the hell is that supposed to mean?\" asked Petrova impatiently; scratching her short-cut black hair. James noticed, now that he stood so close to her, that she had several piercings including a nose-ring and lip-ring. Along with the dragon and scorpion tattoos that covered her exposed shoulders and arms, it made her look exceedingly mean. Definitely the opposite of the type of woman you would aim to pick up at a bar. James suspected she would look relatively beautiful if she hadn't gone to such extreme lengths to modify her body and wear attire with the intent of projecting malevolence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Means you don't need to aim for vitals anymore.\" continued Lenggries, his fowl-language momentarily forgotten as he was obviously in his element: \"A graze from one of these little basterds on someone's toe will tear his head off. This means, Pertrova, that we won't need to aim at undead heads to kill them. They will rip off all of a zombie's limbs in one go. Their bursting action will rip anything apart as long as we can lay our sights on them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Useful.\" was Blank's only comment. James grinned; Blank had proven earlier he certainly didn't need the air-burst rounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Shcyfer Aaron Blank??\" jeered James. \"Sounds lovely.\"<br>\r\n\"You will refraim from using my maiden names, Sergeant. You may refer to me as Luitenant, commander or even Blank if you so prefer. And for those of you idiots who prefer a less syllable intensive workout, Sir will do. Right Lenggries?\"<br>\r\n\"Eff off.\" shot the blond man from the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll call you Blank, sir, if you tell me how that demon knew your name.\"<br>\r\n\"I was about to tell you before, no need pull leverage on me, sergeant.\"<br>\r\n\"And what did that familliar mean, by saying 'you will not exit the Gate', sounds like you intended to go through it, not close it.\" said James with hard eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlank smiled: \"How serious. You think I'm up to some secret agenda?\"<br>\r\n\"I'd simply like to know what it meant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlank looked at James intensely with his red-pink eyes, he wasn't smiling: \"Your first question: you will recall the familliar was Gabzagul. IT...has been a thorn in my side for a long time; ever since I've joined ATHER. I suspect we will run into him once more, before the night is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames looked confused, and pointed to the fresh corpse of the familliar. \"But...you killed it...didn't you?\"<br>\r\n\"One does not actually kill demons, one simply sends them back to wherever the hell they were spawned from. Again no pun intended. Gabzagul will regenerate another body for its corrupted soul and re-enter our plane of existence through the Hell-Gate. Hence the cardinal importance of closing the Gate in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why would you need enter the Gate? Don't try to tell me that demon spoke gibberish, I saw in your eyes its words disturbed you.\" said James with weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlank smirked, but there was no ill intent behind it, only bemusement: \"My eyes? Sergeant, you remember Petrova saying that this was a one-way-trip?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n\"She was being literal about it. Regardless of the outcome of tonight, there will be one less member of this squad going back to the surface.\"<br>\r\nHis words hung in the air like poison.<br>\r\nJames opened his mouth: \"Wha-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlank raised his gloved hand to indicate he wasn't done: \"The Hell-Gate is less of a gate and more of a portal. A door between 2 dimensions. It's key lies in its realm of origin, i.e. in hell itself. To close the Gate you must stand in the realm of origin to deactivate and the destroy the key.\" He breathed. \"One man must cross into hell and destroy the keystone there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence was electric; James looked at Petrova and Lenggries, he could see both knew this already.<br>\r\n\"But....how does that man come back.\"<br>\r\n\"He doesn't.\" answered Blank simply, brutally. \"Oh don't worry sergeant. As the senior officer here, I will be the one to destroy the keystone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames swallowed, not out of nervousness but out of the gloominess of this topic: \"Why didn't you say that when we met.\"<br>\r\n\"You never asked. Now!\" Blank changed the subject. \"Now that the first leg of excitement is over, let's get moving!\" James shook his head; again with the euphemisms. \"I want that to be in that camera-room half an hour ago. Load up on whatever ammunition or weapons you deem necessary, and do so quickly gentlemen an lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell is wrong with this guy? thought James. Just a moment ago he was talking about his inevitable doom and now...now he's  giving orders like nothing's off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLenggries was already loading up on strips of MG rounds into his metal-backpack and hung a whole score of grenades on his belt and chest slings. He was carrying two M-16's, one in either hand (well one in hand and other in claw). His gargantuan size made them look like mere pistols in his massive fingers: \"Saving on the minigun for later.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetrova wedged her one-third katana into the floor to clear her hand. James's eyebrows raised; the floor was solid concrete, that must be one fantastically sharp sword. She discarded her SMG for a PPKT machine-gun pistol and took the grenade-launcher slung across her back. Done, she retracted her katana from the cold floor; very much like Excaliber from the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames kept his usual default armament, and only freshened up on ammo and some pineapples. He gave Cory a 9mm pistol: \"Keep this on you.\"<br>\r\n\"R-right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlank took nothing, not even spare clips. James grimaced; true he had shown in his skill he didn't need any more firearms, but this was like a grim preparation for the albino's death.<br>\r\n\"Now then. To the security-console. Let's go stir up some trouble...\"</span></div></div>",

'him', isn't it?\" giving Lenggries a scorned look, Petrova asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLenggries nodded. \"It's him.\" he confirmed. \"The hell spawned bastard born ass fucking ball breaking jack ass who took my eye and my arm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second date?\" daring to make a joke, Cory asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLenggries gave the boy a crooked smile. \"You could say that.\" darkly amused, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have no time for any grudge match.\" sternly, Blank said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nor do we have time to avoid who or whatever is trying to find our big friend.\" pointed out James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLenggries walked to the door and grabbed the handle. \"We have to go this way to get to the security rooms anyway.\" gruffly, he said. \"If we don't meet him, fine.\" he then smiled again. \"If we do, so much the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he opened the door to reveal a towering humanoid form. It was covered from head to toe in a strange type of armor with a helmet that hid his entire head from view. As the group gazed upon the creature, they all noticed the same thing, the creature had a human eye in a small, fluid filled container, hanging from a chain around its neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img502.imageshack.us/img502/6652/customs014.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img502.imageshack.us/img502/6652/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me back my eye, you bloody bastard!\" charging the creature, Lenggries screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature let out an unnatural roar, causing Cory to shiver in fright. James held the boy tight to himself as he reached for his heavy gun, a S&amp;W X-frame Model 500. It was the most powerful handgun in the world, or so he believed. He was about to level it onto the creature when Blank gently pushed his hand down. \"This is a grudge match.\" sternly but softly, he said. \"That creature annihilated his entire family but fled when faced against Lenggries wrath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'd be pissed if anyone got in his way.\" touching James' shoulder, Cory said. \"I know I would.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The 2 M-16's were duel-wielded like pistols in his massive pawlike hand and bionic claw; Lenggries scraped them by the nozzles on the cement floor, like a gladiator scraping his swords in the sand of the colosseum to indicate his clear hostility to his opposition; a malevolent vengeful leer crossing his face in the form of his usual crooked grim grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't just leave him on his own!\" cried James in disgust at Blank's suggestion. James truly disliked the big blond man, but Lenggries was ATHER-personnel and therefore a comrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure we can!\" said Petrova callously, already making way to the entrance of the sliding-door. \"I don't want to be near a mile-radius of those barbarians when they spar. Lenggries is a big boy. He can take care of himself.\"<br>\r\n\"What??\" said James in disbelief.<br>\r\n\"Yeah! What?! He's your friend.\" accused Cory, surprising all by coming to the defense of his tormentor. \"You're just too scared to help him against that monster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlank chuckled darkly: \"Again you both misunderstand. We're not afraid of the hellspawn, Sergeant. We're afraid of Lenggries. He's a berserker. When deeply angered, as he is...obviously now, he gains tremendous strength, but loses his capacity to distinguish between friend and foe. If we dare to intervene in his fight, while he's in this blood-crazed state, he'll just tear us apart like a mad-dog in a frenzy taking bites at all around him. We will only do greater harm than good, mostly to ourselves, if we try to help the reckless idiot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to prove Blank, Lenggries pulled up the two M-16's; sprinted straight to the Beast (which stood on a towered collection of wooden crates) and opened fire; almost quite literally as the flames leaked from the barrels of the M-16's, setting the wooden boxes alight next to the Beast with the specialized atmospheric air-burst ammunition. Showing unnatural agility for its bulking armoured elephantine frame, the creature jumped with the grace of a flee, and out of Lenggries' fire onto a nearby ledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Beast pulled back his arms; pumped out his chest after bashing it, and imperiously let loose a second blood-curling roar which would have made maned-lions bolt with their tales between their legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery much unfazed, Lenggries re-aligned the creature back into his sights and unleashed his own version of a war-cry. Or rather a string of verbal abuse and continuous colourful cursing; the likes of which being most unbefitting for a soldier of ATHER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come down here, you motherfucking cowardly crap!! Your not worth the rat-shit that maggots refuse to eat! In fact: your lower than shark shit shade at the bottom of the sea abyss!\" James listened to Lenggries' tirade in bemusement and admiration. The man may be out of his mind, but he certainly showed boundless bravery to talk so indifferently to a demon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second blazing barrage of fiery bullets from Lenggries proved equally as ineffective as the first, as the creature simply jumped behind a stack of barrels. Lenngries ran sideways to get a clear line-of-sight from the obscuring barrels, only to see an oil drum hurling through the air to meet his face.<br>\r\nThinking on his feet (again literally), Lenggries leap-rolled out of the way; the oil-drum smashed into concrete floor with a bone-jarring impact, only a few feet from where Lenngries would have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up up at the metallic balcony, Lenngries saw the creature bowling several drums, as if they were mere paperweight tennis balls, right at him! In a gruelingly deadly live version of a dodge-ball game of bone-braking proportions , Lenggries tried to avoid and evade the quarter-ton drums smashing like meteorites next to him, each braking and bursting nearer than the last. But his luck ran out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very last drum had spilled several squirts of oil on the floor, on which Lenggries tripped, and was sent sprawling...<br>\r\nFalling face-first into mother-earth made Lenngries lose grip of the M-16's. Not even hesitating for an instant he rolled sideways. This saved his life as an explosion of a million-billion woody splinters occupied the same space as he had only a split-second ago, courtesy of a huge crate which the beast had thrown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the party till this point had silently watched the show-off from the edge of the room and out of the way, completely absorbed by the duel of these 2 giants. Because of their attention being captivated by their struggling comrade, they failed to notice 2 figures slithering downwards from the dark lamp-less ceiling, behind their backs.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack into the fight, Lenggries shot up from where he lay in a prone position on the ground, and turning, he hurled a 2-second pre-capped pineapple grenade at the beast. Since the mammoth creature had been in the midst of picking up another massive crate, he could not  jump out of the way beneath the weight as previously in time, and suffered the full ballooning blast of the detonation. Flames and smoked swallowed the balcony, sending the packed crates up there earthwards in scorched, burning fragments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLenggries, knowing full well the creature not to be defeated so easily, quickly scoured the floor for his M-16 assault rifles that had been sent flying from his hands. Dejectedly, he found them crushed to pieces beneath the last thrown wooden crate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now familiar fierce roaring of the beast alerted Lenggries to its re-appearance; this time of the opposite site of the enclosed room on yet another pile pf crates. It stood, mostly unharmed, its armour merely blackened by the smoke-blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLenggries pointed at it with his bionic claw: \"I'm not done with you yet, you sonofabitch!!! I'll tear you a new one so bad, that after I'm through with ya, they'll have to scrape yer face of the floor just to find what's left of ya!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I PROMISE YOU SUFFERING, MORTAL!\" croaked the gargantuan demon in raspy deep grinding voice: \"AFTER I COLLECT THE REST OF YOU...\" it said, dangling the fluid-container with the eye mockingly in front of Lenggries. \"I'LL SHOW YOU FEAR, PAIN AND MISERY FOR THE REST OF ETERNITY-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver simple-mindedly  deviant to any source not letting him have his way, Lenggries impatiently interrupted: \"And I'll show you how it feels to have a led brick up yer arse!!\"<br>\r\nWith that Lenggries raised his bionic-cyborg arm, and with a pneumatic whoose, shot the claw-hand-segment like the war-head of a harpoon-gun; a rubbery-chain-rope trailing its flight. The razor forklift-like claw latched on the momentarily astonished Beast's chest, securing itself as the anchor of the inbuilt grappling-hook of Lenggries' mechanized arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning evilly, Lenggries pulled down hard...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same both Blank and Cory spun around, having sensed the 2 entities which had crept up on the rest of the party and cried in semi-unison: \"Behind us.....!\"<br>\r\nGuns ready, Petrova and James turned...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Petrova had, unlike James or Blank, kept her personal weapons unsheathed and at arms length(and in fact in her hands) the entire time. She had held her katana-wielding hand directly beneath and supporting the hand aiming her PPKT machine-gun pistol; much the same way as police officers whom entered dark areas stabilized the underside of their sidearms on top of their flashlights, only Petrova instead of a torch had held her katana horizontally under her PPKT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of this, she was well prepared for the demonic creature that had made a grab for her; in a flash of finesse and swift steel, she severed the claws clutching for her neck, and leaped backwards to gasp in horror at the unsightly sight of exactly what the FUCK had almost touched her-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two...things, that had slivered from the ceiling were so hideously ugly and misfigured, that they would have caused miscarriages at the mere sight of them. They looked constructed and sown together from the body parts of several separate human corpses, and very crudely done so. The stitches holding together the pieces of flayed skin came loose like the worn seems of ripped plushies, exposing the rotten flesh held within. Disgustingly putrid black puss dripped from these primitive works of surgery and the gleaming whiteness of exposed bones shone from where the crudely connected limbs were poorly attached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two creatures looked as if some demented Frankenstein-wannabee surgeon had tried to create giant spiders out of the remains of a crematorium. The torso of each was devoid of legs and instead had 8 or more disfigured arms attached (some with their hands amputated; the amputations being just below the joint, so that the sawn wrists scratched on the floors like broken antelope hooves), at random intervals along the ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd from the back of the sternum of each of these freakish monsters, a giant thick scorpion-like tail rose and flailed around; this 'tail' seemed the destination of the missing legs as they consisted of 2 pairs patched together from foot to hip joint, as if a sadistic child had torn of the legs of a couple of his action figures and had stuck them together with prestick glue, end-on-end. <br>\r\nAnd at the very end of each \"tail\": the amputated hands were worked into opossable crablike clamps; the fingers interlocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was their heads that would haunt dreams and scar the minds of children. They had no faces. No eyes or ears or noses or hair; only sickly bleached bald domes hanging from their necks. How they saw and navigated and moved without the aid of sight or senses was beyond speculation. <br>\r\nThey did have mouths though. But not human mouths, holy shit no! Tendrils similar to those of sea-anemones hanged from where the lips would have been; grey-purple gutlike tongues wormed around as if they were tentacles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nightmarish sight for sore eyes(for causing them, not curing them!); for they induced cringed shuddering to whomever gazed upon them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spread out! Flank them!\" Blank bellowed orders, his skillfully drawn Glock once again appearing in his hand with such magical speed that frontier cowboy-gunmen would have been put to shame. 3 quick consecutive shots rang out from his sidearm, aim perfectly placed on the egglike head of the second monstrosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the creature seemed not to share the same weakness of zombies, for despite having its greymatter displaced, it proceeded to advanced undeterred. Momentarily caught of guard at the creatures invulnerability, Blank was given little time to evade the 3 arms that swung and smashed him out of the way as if he were a mere cardboard cutout, sending him sliding on the concrete floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch out, Sergeant!\" warned Blank to James, still firing( and impeccably aimed) at vital points on the creature, all the while he slid to a standstill. But heart-wounds similarly had no effect in slowing down the monster, which now made a bee-line for James and Cory, showing supernatural spiderlike speed for its disfigured limbs; sometimes crawling, sliding, slithering or scraping eratically across the floor..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames, having seen the relentlessness of the creature, discarded Cory roughly to the side away from him, like a rebellious teenager throwing his school backpack aside the moment he got home. But this was a selfless action to rid Cory from harm, who grunted as he fell. CAR15 firing from one hand and Colt .45 blazing from the other, James filled the beast with holes, while walking slowly backwards to maintain a distance and range from it for as long as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBullets seemed not as futile as before, as the monster swayed and shuddered beneath the barrage James's constant and competent haelstorm of led. 2 of its arms actually fell of as James shot through the already detached stitches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetrova meanwhile had been re-living Hercules' legendary struggle with the Hydra. She had fended off and parried and cut away the persistent grabbings that the arms of the first spider-like monster made at her. She cleaved, cut and carved off every grotesque hand, finger and arm in turn, but the monster had chased her into a corner, where she struggled desperately to keep it at bay with her katana. Her razor-edged short-sword flashed like greased lightning through the dimly lit underground lightning, shredding the monster apart, piece by ever larger body part piece, as if she were hewing a hedge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet still it refused to slow down, seemingly immune to pain or damage. Not even piercing its brain or heart would bring it to its...knees...or whatever it had!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature then suddenly bit at her, but she blocked its terrible mouth with her PPKT and while it stood there, stupidly chewing at the metallic nozzle of her firearm, she arced her finger and pulled the trigger. Being even closer than point-blank range ensured that the force of her machine-gun pistol's rapid fire erupted the back of the monster's eggshell head into a gory bursting massive zip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the 1st time since its ambush, the creature-construct relented on its aggressive assualt as a result of its obliterated head. Seizing this chance by its by the he-... never mind you get the idea, she just ceased the ****ing chance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiftly unslinging the grenade-launcher she had skied from the armory arsenal from her bare tattoo'd shoulders, Petrova trusted it up close and personal into the pulverized neck-piece of the monster and pulled the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back to hell with you, you scrap!!\" Not as original a come-back as the fowl-mouthed Lenggries, but who could blame her after a life and death struggle?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe powerful punch of the launched grenade being ejected into the monster, sent it reeling backwards into the wall as if pounded by a pinball spring, where it smashed, momentarily stunned. It gave of one threatening screeching sound before the delayed grenade embedded into it exploded, turning it into a butchery's waste. Pitch-black bile, guts and gore rained down on Petrova, where she could but stand stiff with her arms to her sides and accept the revolting rain washing her over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames on his end was being strangled by the scorpion \"tail\" of the second creature; its hands-clamp-claw-thing holding him by the throat into the air. Gasping and chocking, James tried to pry off onto the clasping fingers against his collar, while unleashing the remainder of his CAR15's clip into the creature's spine. The creature groaned from inside its stomach, but continued its strangling, unfazed by the bullets raking its back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have to do everything myself?!\" asked Blank standing back up from the floor, seeming more irritated at James' failure to dispose of this 'minor' obstacle rather than being petrified or concerned for the life of his endangered colleague. Staying true to his masterful marksmanship, Blank proceeded to break apart 5 of the spider-creature's arms, by shooting through it joints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlank swore under his breath as his magazine ran empty before he could finish destroying all of the monster's limbs, but he had done enough. Distracted at the loss of its extremities, the creature released a bit of its grip on James's squashed lung-pipe, giving him the breather to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames popped a pineapple from his belt and in an act sheer badassedness shoved his entire fist and forearm through the creature's gaping maw that had been chomping at his feet, before releasing the grenade and pulling his hand out before the monster could eat it off. In the same motion his other arm came up, clutching a serrated KA-BAR trench knife which cleaved through the clamp-fingers still embracing his neck, like a hot poker through butter, releasing James to fall back to earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoots meeting cement-floor, James jump-rolled out off the way just as the freakish-creature imploded into the splattering smithereens of down-pouring bile, black-blood and body parts. Intestines and unknown ruined organs covered the floor. Following suit after Petrova, James was also drenched by this less than appetizing rainfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegrouping, the party assembled. Cory smilingly pointed at James and Petrova, both now soaking in the gory liquid remains of the stitched creatures: \"You need a bath. You stink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" concurred Blank with a poker face, pulling his leather gloves which had gone loose in all the excitement, back tight into place, the rest of his attire of course being spotless: \"ATHER personnel should ensure their uniforms remain presentable at all times. I'm deeply disappointed. How unsoldierly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe received dark looks. But the group was alerted by a the inhuman screaming of Lenggries back in the storage room they had just left....</span></div></div>",

The creature threw a crate at the advancing boy but, like the creature, he easily dodged it and kept advancing until he was right on top of the beast. Cory grabbed the chain of the eyeball on the necklace and ran off, breaking the clasp as he took the necklace with him. \"You fight like a monkey, ugly!\" running with his prize, Cory taunted. \"Let's see how you do in a fair fight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You insect!\" furious, the creature roared. \"That's my prize!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature began to fire a barrage of laser blasts at Cory only, having escaped the gates of hell, dodging light beams was a 'cake walk' to him. Upon reaching Lenggries, he handed him the necklace. \"Maybe you'll aim better with two eyes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLenggries grabbed the necklace before taking out the eye; it was mechanical! He moved the eye patch aside and popped in the eyeball, reactivating his sight. \"Thanks... maggot!\" sneering, he said. \"Now out of the way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I went from worm food to maggot.\" reaching James, Cory said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA very slight smile formed onto Blank's face. \"You earned a few points, kid.\" nodding, he said. \"Just don't expect much, Lenggries doesn't let anyone too close for a reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCory nodded then turned back to the battle inside the room as Lenggries mechanical eye shot forth a laser sight, targeting the creature as he gave his famous crooked grin. \"My turn!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mechanical whirring, clicking and clanking was emitted by Lenggries' cyborg arm as it transformed once more and reverted back into its original minigun-state. Crooked smile and foul-swearing (the likes of which would have put salted sailors to blushing) ever present, Lenggries started towards the Demon Beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Party Time, mother-fucker! Let's paint the walls! I like red....or whatever the FUCK the colour of your blood is, freakshow!\"<br>\r\nWith his newly gained depth perception, Lenggries' aim was substancially improved and the phosphorous tracers of his suppressed minigun fire found its mark on the Demon Beast in very short order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna make you my gun's bitch, you fuck-off!\" Lenggries screamed half-crazed as the Beast jumped time again and again out of his line of fire. Unfortunately whilst Lenggries kept the Beast on its toes, he simply couldn't get a round on its agile grasshopper-like jumping form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly on his feet, James popped his last pineapple grenade and flung it with all the might in his arms.....to precisely where the Demon Beast ended up in one of its flea jumps. Smoke and shrapnel followed the detonation as the Beast was sent floor-wards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, before it could stand up, its colossal frame was raked by minigun fire so violently that a shadow of its putrid black blood formed against the wall standing directly behind it. Its body turned to resemble a cheese grater, the beast collapsed with a finishing finality. But Lenggries walked over to the beast and kicked it for good measure and even loosened several dozen rounds for safety's sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dead.\" he yelled callously as if declaring the fate of the newest road kill. Following that he pulled out his mechanical cyborg eye and licked it clean - quite grotesquely so - before popping it back into his skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that's utterly disgusting, right?\" asked Petrova with her nose pulled up.<br>\r\n\"What, like taking a dip in demon blood?\" retorted Lenggries, pointing to her soaked form.<br>\r\n\"Don't anyone ever mention this day to me...\" she said, shuddering as if during autumn chills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are showers next to the following hall.\" Cory said helpfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blank....\" she said, begging. To which he just sighed:\"That counts as dawdling, but...very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey kid....\" said Lenggries; his face contorted as if he was trying to get something heavy off of his chest, but at last he managed: \"Thanks....but if you dare tell anyone I said so, I'll pull off your head and shit down your neck, you got me wormfood?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCory just smiled brightly, completely unintimidated by Lenggries this time as he knew this to be his ...unique way of being sincere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With that...little bit of excitement out of the way, may we all please proceed to the Camera-Room now?\" asked Blank, with his usual dose of euphemisms. The party concurred and Cory jumped back onto James' back - this time James followed Petrova's example and carried his armaments in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames said: \"Let's first go to...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"WHAT?!\" raged Lenggries. \"A shower?! Now? Of all times? Of all places?! Insert random generic sexist joke about women right here, baby!!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, shut up, you pig!\" retorted Petrova. \"You try getting bathed in guts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...Lenggries. I think it advisable that James and Petrova both wash away the black blood that covers them ASAP. We are few enough as is. I can't afford to lose any more troops to the undead.\" Way to go, Blank, James thought. No sentiment lost there about us dying or anything. \"We need to get them to showers the kid was talking about. I don't know whether the contamination can spread through dermatological contact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Through what contact?\" asked Lenggries, chewing his lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blood. On. Skin.\" the albino said: \"I don't know what'll happen if they merely touch the blood. Best we not try and and find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just get a move on, then!\" hissed Petrova impatiently; her nervous voice betraying her stress at the talks of her likelyhood of turning into a zombie: \"I'll take point! Come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone argued or lingered, and the squad moved at a brisk pace through the storeroom in which Leggries had slain his arch foe and into the shadows beyond. Cory played the part of navigator from James' back; indicating the road to the facility's bathroom showers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their haste, the party kept their eyes peeled, ears open and 6th senses to the max, to ensure they wouldn't be caught off guard and suffer a second ambush. The penetrating silence amplified the irritating electrical fluctuations of the flickering lamp-lights; making the party jittery and nervous. Twice Petrova fired at her own shadow; Lenggries shot a mirror reflecting his ugly scowl; Blank <br>\r\naccidentally killed a rat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is getting ridiculous!\" muttered James to no one in particular. Only the shadows to answer him.<br>\r\n\"Agreed. Let's get to the console station directly after you and Petrova had a good dunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the group met no resistance. Not even any stray zombies, demons or monsters. Only empty room after concrete room, corridor after blood spattered corridor. The lack of action was more unnerving than the presence of a physical visible threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long, overdue last: the Bathroom Showers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's quiet! Too damned quiet. Lets make some noise!\" said Lenggries out loud, much to the unraveling nuisance of his comrades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are SUCH and asshole.\" said Petrova with barely concealed contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" whined Lenggries. \"It got bloody boring after the 3rd empty room! I have my eye back, people! I feel like a million bucks! What am I supposed to do with this energy? Let's shoot shit up, already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't some video-game, comrade! The preservation of earth itself is at stake!\" reprimanded Blank; rubbing his temple with index finger and thumb out of frustration: \"Go be a headache elsewhere: go be lookout, guard the main hall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLenggries belched, spat and farted (all in that order) to show how little he regarded opinions of him and turned tails marching and humming a tune: \"Nobody loves me. Everybody hates me. I'm gonna eat some worms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames just shook his head in wonderment: \"Just who is that guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lenggries?\" the albino answered, relighting a cigarette he had dug out from somewhere in his ink-black leather garb: \"Lengries is Lenggries. Rude, crude, disobedient, brutal, hard, psychotic. Any other positive traits I've missed, Petrova?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a reckless barbarian.\" replied Petrova; but this time with softness in her voice; as if she really did care after the oaf after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes of course.: no sense of self preservation. Lenggries in a nutshell.\" said Blank smirking, inhaling smoke: \"But I'm being unfair; especially behind a man's back. That doesn't do him justice. Lenggries is steadfast and honest, once you get to know the basterd. He may be a rough man, but he's loyal to the bitter end to his comrades.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you gents will excuse me, this girl will be getting some private time.\" said Petrova before disappearing into the unisex bathroom to rid herself of the black bile which still clung to her and her uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where was I?\" Blank asked James.<br>\r\n\"Lenggries being loyal, despite being an ass.\"<br>\r\n\"Ah. You see James, I'd rather have one of Lenggries at my side than 20 of you...no, no, don't interrupt...you proved your worth tenfold today...I mean trust in experience. I'd be willing to brave hell with only a bucket of water had I Lenggries to back me up. Something which might actually happen tonight, come to think of it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" said James.<br>\r\n\"So he's a good guy after all.\" asked Cory, ever the child.<br>\r\nBlank chuckled, cynical eyebrow raised to its default position: \"We'll he's certainly not a paragon...a saint if that's what your asking...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bone, marrow and everything in between chilling soprano scream sent the party all from conversation to combat mode in an instant. Petrova! They dashed to her!</span></div></div>",
